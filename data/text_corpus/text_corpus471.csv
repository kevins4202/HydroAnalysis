2355,this paper considers the imbalanced binary classification problem by focusing on the application of the short term rainfall forecasting in arid and semi arid regions specifically we present a novel boosting type method by utilizing the generalized extreme value gev distribution as the link function and applying a gradient tree boosting algorithm to capture complex interactions among covariates the proposed method has several appealing advantages such as it can identify rare rainfall events as well as quantifying the uncertainties it is data driven that without any assumption on the relationship between the covariates and the rainfall event the fitted model is highly interpretable making it a useful tool for studying the rainfall mechanisms in arid and semi arid regions experiments on two real world datasets show that our approach outperforms its competing methods keywords boosting methods extreme value distribution rainfall prediction rare events 1 introduction accurate and timely prediction of short term rainfall plays a crucial role in many diverse fields of hydrology and meteorology such as the early warning of the flood or heavy rainfall agricultural irrigation planning water resources estimation among others in the past several decades many approaches including both data driven and physically based models have been proposed to address this problem with various types of data e g radar observations satellite derived data and numerical weather prediction nwp data for example toth et al 2000 investigated the accuracy of several time series analysis based techniques for the short term rainfall forecasts sokol 2006 proposed to use a multiple linear regression model incorporating with a correction method for nowcasting of 1 hour 1 h rainfalls zahraei et al 2012 introduced a pixel based approach for short term precipitation forecasting by using radar data wu and lin 2017 proposed a method based on ensemble forecasts of nwp models to improve the predictive performance on short term precipitation as for machine learning based approaches chang et al 2013 applied a network based fuzzy inference system to multi step ahead rainfall forecasting based on the assimilated data obtained by merging three precipitation sources gauges radars and satellites yu et al 2017 employed the random forests and support vector machine for 1 h ahead rainfall prediction in three reservoir catchments located in taiwan moon et al 2018 recently designed an early warning system for heavy rainfall by using various machine learning techniques to name a few notice that although there have many studies on the precipitation forecasting in the literature to the best of our knowledge the problem of short term rainfall prediction in arid and semi arid regions as well as its related mechanism has not been fully studied the major difficulty lies in the latter problem involves the lack of precipitation in these areas which results in a low percentage of the rainfall events in related observations in this paper we focus on the problem of predicting whether or not it will rain in the near future in arid and semi arid regions by marking the rainfall events which are rare with the positive label we address this problem as a binary class probability estimation task with highly imbalanced data imbalanced classification for short see lópez et al 2013 this task is challenging since some widely used approaches such as the logistic regression can easily underestimate of the probability of the minority class i e the raining case and be biased towards the majority class king and zeng 2002 the bias is particularly obvious when the data is extremely imbalanced with limited sample size to overcome this difficulty many solutions have been proposed which can be roughly divided into two groups the first group aims to balance the data before developing models by utilizing diverse re sampling methods among them widely used over sampling techniques like adasyn he et al 2008 and smote chawla et al 2002 try to generate fake samples of the minority class studies have shown that such a balancing strategy can help to improve the performance of the model batista et al 2004 estabrooks et al 2004 however from our numerical experiments we also find that it may bring the risk of raising false positive alarms another popular re sampling strategy is under sampling which uses only a subset of the majority class liu et al 2008 this approach is efficient but in a highly imbalanced setting dropping too many majority class samples may significantly reduce model performance the second group focuses on the model itself and tries to enhance the learning of the minority class by designing the so called cost sensitive algorithms for example one approach is assigning different weights to the positive loss i e loss on minority class samples and the negative loss i e loss on majority class samples although it is simple and effective this method requires to determine weights in the loss it is also well known that the ensemble based algorithms like adaboost can significantly reduce the model bias and are easy to be implemented sun et al 2007 however these models mainly focus on the classification performance and pay less attention to the problem of accurately estimating the probability of minority class wallace and dahabreh 2012 which is an important problem as we address in this paper in view of the fact that the bias of the logistic regression model on imbalanced data can be attributed to its symmetric link function which imposes the same penalty on different misclassification types thus the asymmetric link functions were introduced to address the misclassification loss of the minority class in the literature for example wang and dey 2011 showed that the gev distribution function is an appropriate choice subsequently several algorithms based on the gev distributions were proposed by using a probabilistic model together with the maximum likelihood method calabrese et al 2011 calabrese and osmetti 2013 by noting that the loss functions adopted in those algorithms are non convex ones agarwal et al 2014b later introduced a convex loss function named as the gev canonical loss and zhang et al 2016 developed a more efficient gev regression model by using a calibrated loss most recently yin et al 2020 also proposed a skewed link regression model to characterizing the high skewness of the insurance data then adopted the bayesian approach to estimate the parameters noting that their proposal lies in the framework of the generalized linear models incorporating with the proposed skewed link functions and the linear relationship between covariates and the transformed response might be rigid in some practical situations this paper aims to develop an improved gev regression model for highly imbalanced classification our contribution is two fold first inspired by yang et al 2018 we relax the linear assumption used in the aforementioned gev type models by employing the gradient tree boosting algorithm thus we obtain a more flexible and powerful approach for estimating the probability of a rare rainfall event we illustrate its prediction accuracy via numerical experiments on two meteorological datasets second we further explain our fitted model under the shap analysis framework proposed by lundberg et al 2018 in summary the method that is proposed in this paper shows how the covariates relevant to rainfalls are automatically identified in the model fitting procedure and how the complex interaction effects among covariates are precisely captured with this we provide a valuable tool for studying the mechanism of rainfall in arid and semi arid regions the rest of the paper is organized as follows we formulate our method in section 2 sections 3 and 4 provide two case studies results analysis as well as a further discussion the paper is concluded with a summary in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 generalized linear model consider the learning task on the dataset d x i y i i 1 n where x i x r p is the p dimensional vector of covariates y i y r is the response variable x and y are the sample spaces respectively so the goal is to learn a model η ˆ that could accurately estimate the function η x y when building η ˆ one can first train a real valued scoring model f x v where v r then a monotone differentiable function s v y as an inverse link function can be used to map the score f x i to η ˆ x i that is η ˆ x i s f x i assume that the distribution of y is a member of the exponential family and f x i x i t β the generalized linear model glm can be written as 1 e y x i s x i β where β β 1 β 2 β p t is a p 1 vector of regression coefficients we refer to dobson and barnett 2018 for more details on the generalized linear models for the binary classification problem the response space y 0 1 and η x p y 1 x then the well known logistic regression model can be derived from model 1 by applying the following symmetric logit function s 1 η ˆ log η ˆ 1 η ˆ here the symmetry means that the response curve for η ˆ has a symmetric appearance about the point η ˆ 0 5 that is s 1 η ˆ s 1 1 η ˆ in another word η ˆ has the same rate for approaching 0 and approaching 1 which makes the logistic model more suitable for balanced datasets 2 2 gev distribution extreme value theory evt mainly focuses on the tail behavior of distributions it has a wide application in the fields of hydrology feng et al 2007 climatology jenkinson 1955 and also the insurance industry embrechts et al 2013 in extreme value theory it is well known that under some regularity conditions the distribution of the extremes asymptotically approaches to three different families of distributions which are the gumbel fréchet and weibull families respectively notice that these three families can be combined into a single one with the cumulative distribution function cdf defined as g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where σ 0 and 1 ξ x μ σ 0 μ σ and ξ are location scale and shape parameters respectively the fréchet and weibull families correspond respectively to the cases ξ 0 and ξ 0 and when ξ 0 it leads to the gumbel distribution this unified form of expression is well known as the gev distribution which simplifies the statistical implementation in hydrology the gev distribution is often used to describe extreme events such as annual maximum 1 day rainfalls and river discharges in our problem we take advantage of its asymmetric form when ξ 0 to construct inverse link functions to illustrate its flexibility we depict the gev distributions for ξ 0 5 0 and 0 5 in fig 1 we can see that the shape parameter ξ purely controls the tail behavior of the gev distribution compared with the gumbel distribution ξ 0 the cdf curve approaches to 0 slowly but 1 more sharply for ξ 0 vice versa when ξ 0 2 3 gradient boosting algorithm the gradient boosting algorithm friedman 2001 is a flexible and powerful machine learning method which is commonly used to optimize different kinds of loss functions specifically consider the following optimization problem 2 f x arg min f f e y x ψ y f x where f is a function defined on class f that maps x to y and ψ y f x is a pre specified differentiable loss function the basic idea of the gradient boosting algorithm lies in that it adaptively combines the outputs of many relatively simple models called base learners to get a better approximation of f more precisely assume that the candidate function f can be written in an ensemble form as f x f 0 m 1 m w m h x θ m where f 0 is a constant h x θ m is the m th base learner typically a decision tree with parameter θ m and w m is the corresponding coefficient commonly components w m h x θ m m 1 m are sequentially added through a forward stagewise algorithm by pointing each h x θ m in the negative gradient direction of the related loss function that is at the m th iteration the function h x θ m is first fitted by a chosen criterion e g least squares θ m arg min θ i 1 n y i m h x i θ m 2 with y i m ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x then given this h x θ m the coefficient w m is optimized by w m arg min w i 1 n ψ y i f m 1 x i w h x i θ m note that in the whole iteration procedure the new base leaner is added without adjusting the parameters of those components which have already been fitted 2 4 our proposal gevboost model we now describe how to estimate the probability of the short term rare rainfall event through a nonparametric approach called gevboost method which combines the gev distribution with a gradient boosting algorithm in particular following the notations in section 2 1 we express our binary classification problem as e y x p y 1 x s x β and assume that p y 1 0 5 to emphasize the imbalanced data or rare event note that by imposing constraints on the inverse link function s agarwal et al 2014a introduced the so called calibrated loss that is if the function s satisfies l lipschitz condition then there exists a primitive function s r r such that s s thus the calibrated loss function is defined as 3 l f x s f x y f x where f x x t β it can be seen that s should be monotonic increasing to guarantee the existence of s and the convexity of l in our problem we propose to use the gev distribution function as a link function in model 3 i e 4 s f x exp 1 ξ f x 1 ξ with x 1 ξ f x 0 where the shape parameter ξ can help to characterize different degrees of the rarity in real life datasets given that the mechanism of the short term rainfall is so complicated instead of making the strict assumption that f x x t β we tend to fit f in a data driven manner to be more specific we aim to solve the following minimization problem or equivalently in the lagrangian form 5 min f i 1 n s f x i y i f x i i 1 ξ f x i where i u 0 u 0 u 0 we further replace i u with i u 1 t log u in problem 5 to make the objective function differentiable where the parameter t 0 boyd and vandenberghe 2004 therefore instead of the minimization problem 5 we tend to solve the following approximated model 6 min f i 1 n s f x i y i f x i 1 t log 1 ξ f x i it should be pointed out that we do not require the explicit expression of the function s and only utilize its derivative form s to tackle problem 6 as will be described below 2 4 1 estimating f via gradient boosting here we introduce our procedure to solve problem 6 by using the gradient boosting method first suppose that the value of ξ is given define f x arg min f f i 1 n ψ y i f x i ξ where 7 ψ y i f x i ξ s f x i y i f x i 1 t log 1 ξ f x i we begin by choosing a constant as the initial estimate of f x that is 8 f 0 arg min γ i 1 n ψ y i γ ξ noticing that for sufficiently large t the third term 1 t log 1 ξ f x i on the right hand side of eq 7 could be ignorable this together with eq 8 leads to f 0 log n log i 1 n y i ξ 1 ξ next given the current estimate f ˆ m 1 m 1 m the next base learner h x θ m can be fitted via obtaining θ m as follows θ m arg min θ m i 1 n u i m h x i θ m 2 where u m u 1 m u n m t with each component defined as u i m ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x exp 1 ξ f m 1 x i 1 ξ y i ξ t 1 ξ f m 1 x i after iterating the above boosting procedure m times we have f m as the final estimate for the completeness we describe the details of fitting h x θ m as follows generally speaking to choose a base learner we need to take into account its computational complexity interpretability and robustness in the literature the decision tree is a well known learning method which has many advantages such as relative fast easily implemented naturally incorporating with both numeric and categorical covariates and robust to missing data and outliers so in our algorithm we express the m th base learner through an l terminal node decision tree h x θ m l 1 l γ l m i x r l m with the parameter θ m r l m γ l m l 1 l where r l m denotes the l th node of the tree and γ l m is its coefficient usually a greedy algorithm with the least squares splitting criterion is adopted to determine the regions r l m l 1 l and γ l m is estimated by the mean of u i m in the region r l m γ l m mean i x i r l m u i m as suggested by friedman 2001 we continue to find a constant η l m to improve the current estimate in each region r l m based on the following criterion 9 η l m arg min η l x i r l m ψ y i f m 1 x i η l in other words once the r l m l 1 l is fitted instead of using γ l directly we estimate the optimal terminal node value by solving 9 after that f m is updated in each region r l m as follows f m f m 1 v η l m i x r l m l 1 2 l here v 0 1 is a shrinkage factor used to control the update rate and reduce the overfitting 2 4 2 estimating ξ note that although it is possible to jointly estimate the function f and the tail parameter ξ by minimizing 7 the related procedure could be too complicated this motivates us to utilize a cross validation type method to estimate ξ to be specific we first fit many gevboost models by using a set of pre chosen values of ξ then the one with the best predictive performance could be selected in the procedure we estimate ξ by minimizing the brier score see section 2 6 with respect to k equally spaced candidate values of ξ i e ξ 1 ξ k it also has been observed that ξ 0 5 0 5 can provide diverse skewness that ensures the high flexibility of the gev link function see e g wang and dey 2011 hence in our case studies we choose ξ 1 1 ξ k 1 and k 20 our experiments further show that this is an effective way to estimate the parameter ξ while achieving the required accuracy and using a wider range of ξ value does not help us to gain additional improvement we summarize the main procedure of our method in the algorithm 1 remark 1 it is worth mentioning that zhang et al 2016 used a similar technique called the gev regression in tackling the imbalanced binary classification problem however our approach is different from theirs in that we do not impose any parametric restriction on f which is especially important in the hydrological or meteorological science e g the short term rainfall forecasting with complex interactions among covariates remark 2 in practical applications we can further improve the algorithm 1 by applying the newton boosting method furthermore by defining a custom objective function our method can be also adapted to the widely used parallel gradient boosting frameworks like xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 and lightgbm ke et al 2017 these frameworks are designed to be highly efficient and flexible and can scale to billions of examples in distributed settings 2 5 tools for analyzing gevboost models as pointed out by lipton 2016 practical models should be interpretable besides their good performance to address this issue we hope the fitted model can help to identify the most relevant factors that affects the precipitation in arid and semi arid regions as well as how these factors interact with each other we highlight that benefiting from inside tree structures our gevboost model can deliver interpretable results in addition to its impressive predicting powers especially classical tools designed for tree based ensemble methods e g random forests and boosting trees like the variable importance vi and dependence plot breiman 2001 can be directly utilized to provide a comprehensive summary of how the fitted model relying on these covariates recently an improved covariate attribution framework named shap shapley additive explanation was proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 with this unique consistent method they further suggest using the shap dependence plot to describe interaction effects in a tree ensemble model which plots each sample point down by taking the value of a chosen covariate for the x axis and related shap value for the y axis lundberg et al 2018 in this way it can provide more detailed information by visualizing the individualized covariate attribution other than just summaries moreover by drawing points of different samples from dataset the trend of the covariate s attributed importance can be illustrated as its value varies in section 4 we will analyze our gevboost model in such a framework to draw some useful conclusions 2 6 performance criteria to measure the performance of diverse approaches both the probability estimation accuracy and classification accuracy criteria are used in this paper accordingly since we do not know true class probabilities we assess the probability estimation accuracy by the brier score brier 1950 bs 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 where y i is the observed class label of the i th sample and y ˆ i is the predicted class probability meanwhile we also evaluate classifiers by the recall rate rr f1 score and especially the matthews correlation coefficient mcc on imbalanced datasets the latter has been demonstrated to be a more reliable metric for evaluating binary classifications chicco and jurman 2020 in our experiments we further plot the roc and precision recall pr curves davis and goadrich 2006 to compare different models visually 3 case studies in this section we investigate the prediction performance of gevboost method as compared to the logistic regression lr random forest rf adaboost artificial neural network ann and gev regression gr models we also consider combining lr rf and ann models with smote adasyn and random under sampling rs techniques a cost sensitive cs loss based on class wise re weighting scheme for lr and rf is also a option the first case considers an australian weather dataset while the second one investigates the 1 h rainfall forecasting for selected cities in gansu province where the highly imbalanced precipitation data make the problem quite challenging 3 1 the weatheraus dataset here we try different models on a public dataset named weatheraus 1 1 https rattle togaware com weatheraus csv the source dataset is copyright by the australian commonwealth bureau of meteorology and is used with permission this dataset contains processed daily weather observations from 49 stations around australia it has several covariates corresponding to the binary response variable which indicates the weather status i e raining or not on the following day since the proportion of raining days is less than 20 we encounter an imbalanced binary classification problem here in experiments we ignore the covariate location for an overall study of the weather status in australia meanwhile the covariate risk mm is excluded from the predictive model as it may leak the future rainfall information and four other covariates sunshine evaporation cloud3pm and cloud9am with too many missing values over 60 are also dropped then we randomly divide the data into two sets 70 of which as the training set 30 of which as a testing set and all models are fitted to the training set note that when building a gevboost model 30 of the training data is used as a validation set for selecting the value of parameter ξ for other models that require tuning hyperparameters we take the same procedure for ensemble models like adaboost rf and gevboost we use an equal number of base estimators which is 200 here as for ann model we utilize a four layers neural network with 30 units in each hidden layer set learning rate equals to 0 01 and adopt the adam optimizer more complex net structures do not result in much better model performance in our experiments we repeat the above data splitting and model fitting procedure 10 times and report the averaged test results in table 1 best scores are marked in bold it is easy to see that the classifiers combined with adasyn smote and random under sampling techniques get higher recall rates this result is foreseeable because these re sample methods will increase the proportion of minority class and make rainfall events to be easier detected however we find re sample based models have much lower classification precisions than the other approaches the possible reason is that some synthetic samples are generated into the majority class region i e the over generalization problem which makes the fitted classifiers prone to false alarms in rainfall forecasting so we can observe that they do not perform well under the auc and mcc criteria and also get larger brier scores our gevboost model on the other hand does not need to resample the training set or create synthetic samples from the minority class performs quite well in terms of both classification accuracy and probability estimation accuracy 3 2 hourly precipitation data in gansu province 3 2 1 study area in northwest china gansu province lies between the tibet and the loess plateaus affected by dry climatic conditions most areas in gansu province are located in arid and semi arid regions with few precipitation for example in the western part of gansu province annual precipitation ranges from 50 mm in dunhuang city to 75 mm in jiuquan city fig 2 presents the annual precipitation map of gansu in 2017 and exact locations of 14 national monitoring stations to be studied these stations are irregularly located in space spreading over a certain region that spans 32 95 n 41 8 n and 94 68 e 108 39 e 3 2 2 data description the original rainfall data are obtained on an hourly basis for some consecutive years starting from january 1 2013 for some stations available records starting from the year 2015 to december 31 2017 due to the season winds most of the rainfall in gansu is concentrated in the june to september so we select observations in this period of each year table 2 summarizes some properties of the rainfall data in each station with the rarity rate p defined as the proportion of 1 h rainfall events the meteorological covariates associated with precipitation in northwest china e g high temperature and low wind speed have been studied by shi et al 2007 in our experiments based on the observed data we select several covariates which help to differentiate the meteorological conditions that may produce the rainfall for example we consider air temperature ground temperature 10 min averaged wind speed 10 min averaged wind direction dew point relative humidity vapor pressure and the precipitation in the last hour in the single station model we also accept altitude longitude and latitude as covariates in the overall model which takes all the 14 stations into consideration table 3 shows some descriptive statistics of these covariates on the entire dataset 3 2 3 model performance first we fit the aforementioned models separately to 14 stations as shown in tables 4 7 the gevboost model has the smallest brier score as well as the highest f1 score and mcc in almost all stations then we merge samples from each station to have geographical covariates i e longitude latitude and altitude be concerned in this setting the data from the year 2013 2015 for some stations to 2016 are used as a training set and those of the year 2017 as a testing set we plot the roc curve and the pr curve to demonstrate the test performance of each method as illustrated in fig 3 from the figure it can be observed that both the area under the roc curve and the pr curve for the gevboost model are the largest among these methods which implies that this model has a higher recall rate and also a higher precision these observations also demonstrate that our approach can be more appropriate for predicting short term rainfall in arid and semi arid regions 4 discussion here we show how the fitted gevboost model provides interpretable results by utilizing the dataset described in section 3 2 2 to compare the factors that affect short term rainfalls in different climate regions we first apply the gevboost algorithm to two selected areas respectively one is the northwestern gansu often referred to as the hexi corridor which is dry and has a temperate desert climate the other one is the eastern gansu which is relatively humid with a continental monsoon climate fig 4 illustrates their significant differences in the precipitation amount and rarity rate of rainfall events we can see that from june to september the rainfall appears more abundant in eastern gansu than hexi corridor also the proportion of 1 h rainfall events is about 8 1 in eastern gansu while 3 7 in hexi corridor to start with we would like to identify the significant explanatory covariates that are related to short term rainfall events as in lundberg et al 2018 we plot a bar chart in fig 5 to show the impact of each covariate in terms of the mean absolute shap value where 10 covariates with the largest mean absolute shap value in each region are reported it is observed that in both regions relative humidity precipitation in the last hour and ground temperature all play a pivotal role in forecasting 1 h rainfall but the rainfall status in the previous hour has a greater impact on the eastern gansu moreover the effects of wind direction wind speed and time i e the covariate hour cannot be ignored either next we use the shap dependence plot to study the effects of covariates on short term rainfall events and the 6 most important covariates are shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 a and b illustrate that the larger amount of precipitation in the past hour the bigger probability of rainfall in the next hour which is in line with our intuition fig 6 c f show that high relative humidity as well as high wind speed make a positive contribution to rainfalls and the non monotonic relationships between the ground temperature and rainfall events can be seen in fig 7 a and b briefly speaking in hexi corridor the ground temperature between 10 c and 20 c plays a positive role however the higher or lower value outside this range plays a negative role in eastern gansu the temperature range associated with rainfall events is about 15 c to 25 c for categorical covariates i e hour and wind direction similar conclusions can be drawn from fig 7 c f for example we can observe that rainfall events are more likely to occur between 2 and 14 o clock and wind directions from 247 5 to 360 degree e g westerly and northwesterly winds represent a higher probability of rainfall in both regions in eastern gansu the influence of northerly wind on rainfall events is also significant this result is consistent with the conclusion given by liu et al 2019 who showed that the westerly wind is the main body of the water vapor transportation in northwest china and has a significant effect on the precipitation a shap interaction effect plot can visualize the effect of an interacting covariate by coloring each data point with its value lundberg et al 2018 with this useful tool we can study the interaction effect of different covariates on short term rainfall for instance fig 8 a and b show that most rainfall events tend to occur between 2 and 12 o clock and low temperature in this period has a positive contribution while high temperature has a negative one note that here color from blue to red represents the covariate value varying from small to large similarly fig 8 c d confirm the important role that the fast wind i e speed 2 m s plays in forecasting rainfall as it is associated with water vapor transmission but only when the relative humidity reaches over 50 also fig 8 e and f show the contrasting effect that the wind direction exposed at different times for example in the hexi corridor the westerly and northwesterly wind play a positive role during the day while a negative role at night on the other hand we draw the opposite conclusion in the eastern gansu and also find that northerly and northeasterly wind may indicate rainfalls in the morning 5 conclusion in this paper we present an effective model to accurately estimate the probability of the rare event and apply it to forecast short term rainfalls in arid and semi arid regions case studies demonstrate its improved probability estimation performance as well as classification accuracy moreover the fitted model can automatically identify significant meteorological covariates that drive the rainfalls and provide a series of tools to help researchers better understand related mechanisms the application of our method can go beyond the rainfall forecasting and be easily extended to the study of other hydroclimatic

2355,this paper considers the imbalanced binary classification problem by focusing on the application of the short term rainfall forecasting in arid and semi arid regions specifically we present a novel boosting type method by utilizing the generalized extreme value gev distribution as the link function and applying a gradient tree boosting algorithm to capture complex interactions among covariates the proposed method has several appealing advantages such as it can identify rare rainfall events as well as quantifying the uncertainties it is data driven that without any assumption on the relationship between the covariates and the rainfall event the fitted model is highly interpretable making it a useful tool for studying the rainfall mechanisms in arid and semi arid regions experiments on two real world datasets show that our approach outperforms its competing methods keywords boosting methods extreme value distribution rainfall prediction rare events 1 introduction accurate and timely prediction of short term rainfall plays a crucial role in many diverse fields of hydrology and meteorology such as the early warning of the flood or heavy rainfall agricultural irrigation planning water resources estimation among others in the past several decades many approaches including both data driven and physically based models have been proposed to address this problem with various types of data e g radar observations satellite derived data and numerical weather prediction nwp data for example toth et al 2000 investigated the accuracy of several time series analysis based techniques for the short term rainfall forecasts sokol 2006 proposed to use a multiple linear regression model incorporating with a correction method for nowcasting of 1 hour 1 h rainfalls zahraei et al 2012 introduced a pixel based approach for short term precipitation forecasting by using radar data wu and lin 2017 proposed a method based on ensemble forecasts of nwp models to improve the predictive performance on short term precipitation as for machine learning based approaches chang et al 2013 applied a network based fuzzy inference system to multi step ahead rainfall forecasting based on the assimilated data obtained by merging three precipitation sources gauges radars and satellites yu et al 2017 employed the random forests and support vector machine for 1 h ahead rainfall prediction in three reservoir catchments located in taiwan moon et al 2018 recently designed an early warning system for heavy rainfall by using various machine learning techniques to name a few notice that although there have many studies on the precipitation forecasting in the literature to the best of our knowledge the problem of short term rainfall prediction in arid and semi arid regions as well as its related mechanism has not been fully studied the major difficulty lies in the latter problem involves the lack of precipitation in these areas which results in a low percentage of the rainfall events in related observations in this paper we focus on the problem of predicting whether or not it will rain in the near future in arid and semi arid regions by marking the rainfall events which are rare with the positive label we address this problem as a binary class probability estimation task with highly imbalanced data imbalanced classification for short see lópez et al 2013 this task is challenging since some widely used approaches such as the logistic regression can easily underestimate of the probability of the minority class i e the raining case and be biased towards the majority class king and zeng 2002 the bias is particularly obvious when the data is extremely imbalanced with limited sample size to overcome this difficulty many solutions have been proposed which can be roughly divided into two groups the first group aims to balance the data before developing models by utilizing diverse re sampling methods among them widely used over sampling techniques like adasyn he et al 2008 and smote chawla et al 2002 try to generate fake samples of the minority class studies have shown that such a balancing strategy can help to improve the performance of the model batista et al 2004 estabrooks et al 2004 however from our numerical experiments we also find that it may bring the risk of raising false positive alarms another popular re sampling strategy is under sampling which uses only a subset of the majority class liu et al 2008 this approach is efficient but in a highly imbalanced setting dropping too many majority class samples may significantly reduce model performance the second group focuses on the model itself and tries to enhance the learning of the minority class by designing the so called cost sensitive algorithms for example one approach is assigning different weights to the positive loss i e loss on minority class samples and the negative loss i e loss on majority class samples although it is simple and effective this method requires to determine weights in the loss it is also well known that the ensemble based algorithms like adaboost can significantly reduce the model bias and are easy to be implemented sun et al 2007 however these models mainly focus on the classification performance and pay less attention to the problem of accurately estimating the probability of minority class wallace and dahabreh 2012 which is an important problem as we address in this paper in view of the fact that the bias of the logistic regression model on imbalanced data can be attributed to its symmetric link function which imposes the same penalty on different misclassification types thus the asymmetric link functions were introduced to address the misclassification loss of the minority class in the literature for example wang and dey 2011 showed that the gev distribution function is an appropriate choice subsequently several algorithms based on the gev distributions were proposed by using a probabilistic model together with the maximum likelihood method calabrese et al 2011 calabrese and osmetti 2013 by noting that the loss functions adopted in those algorithms are non convex ones agarwal et al 2014b later introduced a convex loss function named as the gev canonical loss and zhang et al 2016 developed a more efficient gev regression model by using a calibrated loss most recently yin et al 2020 also proposed a skewed link regression model to characterizing the high skewness of the insurance data then adopted the bayesian approach to estimate the parameters noting that their proposal lies in the framework of the generalized linear models incorporating with the proposed skewed link functions and the linear relationship between covariates and the transformed response might be rigid in some practical situations this paper aims to develop an improved gev regression model for highly imbalanced classification our contribution is two fold first inspired by yang et al 2018 we relax the linear assumption used in the aforementioned gev type models by employing the gradient tree boosting algorithm thus we obtain a more flexible and powerful approach for estimating the probability of a rare rainfall event we illustrate its prediction accuracy via numerical experiments on two meteorological datasets second we further explain our fitted model under the shap analysis framework proposed by lundberg et al 2018 in summary the method that is proposed in this paper shows how the covariates relevant to rainfalls are automatically identified in the model fitting procedure and how the complex interaction effects among covariates are precisely captured with this we provide a valuable tool for studying the mechanism of rainfall in arid and semi arid regions the rest of the paper is organized as follows we formulate our method in section 2 sections 3 and 4 provide two case studies results analysis as well as a further discussion the paper is concluded with a summary in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 generalized linear model consider the learning task on the dataset d x i y i i 1 n where x i x r p is the p dimensional vector of covariates y i y r is the response variable x and y are the sample spaces respectively so the goal is to learn a model η ˆ that could accurately estimate the function η x y when building η ˆ one can first train a real valued scoring model f x v where v r then a monotone differentiable function s v y as an inverse link function can be used to map the score f x i to η ˆ x i that is η ˆ x i s f x i assume that the distribution of y is a member of the exponential family and f x i x i t β the generalized linear model glm can be written as 1 e y x i s x i β where β β 1 β 2 β p t is a p 1 vector of regression coefficients we refer to dobson and barnett 2018 for more details on the generalized linear models for the binary classification problem the response space y 0 1 and η x p y 1 x then the well known logistic regression model can be derived from model 1 by applying the following symmetric logit function s 1 η ˆ log η ˆ 1 η ˆ here the symmetry means that the response curve for η ˆ has a symmetric appearance about the point η ˆ 0 5 that is s 1 η ˆ s 1 1 η ˆ in another word η ˆ has the same rate for approaching 0 and approaching 1 which makes the logistic model more suitable for balanced datasets 2 2 gev distribution extreme value theory evt mainly focuses on the tail behavior of distributions it has a wide application in the fields of hydrology feng et al 2007 climatology jenkinson 1955 and also the insurance industry embrechts et al 2013 in extreme value theory it is well known that under some regularity conditions the distribution of the extremes asymptotically approaches to three different families of distributions which are the gumbel fréchet and weibull families respectively notice that these three families can be combined into a single one with the cumulative distribution function cdf defined as g x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where σ 0 and 1 ξ x μ σ 0 μ σ and ξ are location scale and shape parameters respectively the fréchet and weibull families correspond respectively to the cases ξ 0 and ξ 0 and when ξ 0 it leads to the gumbel distribution this unified form of expression is well known as the gev distribution which simplifies the statistical implementation in hydrology the gev distribution is often used to describe extreme events such as annual maximum 1 day rainfalls and river discharges in our problem we take advantage of its asymmetric form when ξ 0 to construct inverse link functions to illustrate its flexibility we depict the gev distributions for ξ 0 5 0 and 0 5 in fig 1 we can see that the shape parameter ξ purely controls the tail behavior of the gev distribution compared with the gumbel distribution ξ 0 the cdf curve approaches to 0 slowly but 1 more sharply for ξ 0 vice versa when ξ 0 2 3 gradient boosting algorithm the gradient boosting algorithm friedman 2001 is a flexible and powerful machine learning method which is commonly used to optimize different kinds of loss functions specifically consider the following optimization problem 2 f x arg min f f e y x ψ y f x where f is a function defined on class f that maps x to y and ψ y f x is a pre specified differentiable loss function the basic idea of the gradient boosting algorithm lies in that it adaptively combines the outputs of many relatively simple models called base learners to get a better approximation of f more precisely assume that the candidate function f can be written in an ensemble form as f x f 0 m 1 m w m h x θ m where f 0 is a constant h x θ m is the m th base learner typically a decision tree with parameter θ m and w m is the corresponding coefficient commonly components w m h x θ m m 1 m are sequentially added through a forward stagewise algorithm by pointing each h x θ m in the negative gradient direction of the related loss function that is at the m th iteration the function h x θ m is first fitted by a chosen criterion e g least squares θ m arg min θ i 1 n y i m h x i θ m 2 with y i m ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x then given this h x θ m the coefficient w m is optimized by w m arg min w i 1 n ψ y i f m 1 x i w h x i θ m note that in the whole iteration procedure the new base leaner is added without adjusting the parameters of those components which have already been fitted 2 4 our proposal gevboost model we now describe how to estimate the probability of the short term rare rainfall event through a nonparametric approach called gevboost method which combines the gev distribution with a gradient boosting algorithm in particular following the notations in section 2 1 we express our binary classification problem as e y x p y 1 x s x β and assume that p y 1 0 5 to emphasize the imbalanced data or rare event note that by imposing constraints on the inverse link function s agarwal et al 2014a introduced the so called calibrated loss that is if the function s satisfies l lipschitz condition then there exists a primitive function s r r such that s s thus the calibrated loss function is defined as 3 l f x s f x y f x where f x x t β it can be seen that s should be monotonic increasing to guarantee the existence of s and the convexity of l in our problem we propose to use the gev distribution function as a link function in model 3 i e 4 s f x exp 1 ξ f x 1 ξ with x 1 ξ f x 0 where the shape parameter ξ can help to characterize different degrees of the rarity in real life datasets given that the mechanism of the short term rainfall is so complicated instead of making the strict assumption that f x x t β we tend to fit f in a data driven manner to be more specific we aim to solve the following minimization problem or equivalently in the lagrangian form 5 min f i 1 n s f x i y i f x i i 1 ξ f x i where i u 0 u 0 u 0 we further replace i u with i u 1 t log u in problem 5 to make the objective function differentiable where the parameter t 0 boyd and vandenberghe 2004 therefore instead of the minimization problem 5 we tend to solve the following approximated model 6 min f i 1 n s f x i y i f x i 1 t log 1 ξ f x i it should be pointed out that we do not require the explicit expression of the function s and only utilize its derivative form s to tackle problem 6 as will be described below 2 4 1 estimating f via gradient boosting here we introduce our procedure to solve problem 6 by using the gradient boosting method first suppose that the value of ξ is given define f x arg min f f i 1 n ψ y i f x i ξ where 7 ψ y i f x i ξ s f x i y i f x i 1 t log 1 ξ f x i we begin by choosing a constant as the initial estimate of f x that is 8 f 0 arg min γ i 1 n ψ y i γ ξ noticing that for sufficiently large t the third term 1 t log 1 ξ f x i on the right hand side of eq 7 could be ignorable this together with eq 8 leads to f 0 log n log i 1 n y i ξ 1 ξ next given the current estimate f ˆ m 1 m 1 m the next base learner h x θ m can be fitted via obtaining θ m as follows θ m arg min θ m i 1 n u i m h x i θ m 2 where u m u 1 m u n m t with each component defined as u i m ψ y i f x i f x i f x f m 1 x exp 1 ξ f m 1 x i 1 ξ y i ξ t 1 ξ f m 1 x i after iterating the above boosting procedure m times we have f m as the final estimate for the completeness we describe the details of fitting h x θ m as follows generally speaking to choose a base learner we need to take into account its computational complexity interpretability and robustness in the literature the decision tree is a well known learning method which has many advantages such as relative fast easily implemented naturally incorporating with both numeric and categorical covariates and robust to missing data and outliers so in our algorithm we express the m th base learner through an l terminal node decision tree h x θ m l 1 l γ l m i x r l m with the parameter θ m r l m γ l m l 1 l where r l m denotes the l th node of the tree and γ l m is its coefficient usually a greedy algorithm with the least squares splitting criterion is adopted to determine the regions r l m l 1 l and γ l m is estimated by the mean of u i m in the region r l m γ l m mean i x i r l m u i m as suggested by friedman 2001 we continue to find a constant η l m to improve the current estimate in each region r l m based on the following criterion 9 η l m arg min η l x i r l m ψ y i f m 1 x i η l in other words once the r l m l 1 l is fitted instead of using γ l directly we estimate the optimal terminal node value by solving 9 after that f m is updated in each region r l m as follows f m f m 1 v η l m i x r l m l 1 2 l here v 0 1 is a shrinkage factor used to control the update rate and reduce the overfitting 2 4 2 estimating ξ note that although it is possible to jointly estimate the function f and the tail parameter ξ by minimizing 7 the related procedure could be too complicated this motivates us to utilize a cross validation type method to estimate ξ to be specific we first fit many gevboost models by using a set of pre chosen values of ξ then the one with the best predictive performance could be selected in the procedure we estimate ξ by minimizing the brier score see section 2 6 with respect to k equally spaced candidate values of ξ i e ξ 1 ξ k it also has been observed that ξ 0 5 0 5 can provide diverse skewness that ensures the high flexibility of the gev link function see e g wang and dey 2011 hence in our case studies we choose ξ 1 1 ξ k 1 and k 20 our experiments further show that this is an effective way to estimate the parameter ξ while achieving the required accuracy and using a wider range of ξ value does not help us to gain additional improvement we summarize the main procedure of our method in the algorithm 1 remark 1 it is worth mentioning that zhang et al 2016 used a similar technique called the gev regression in tackling the imbalanced binary classification problem however our approach is different from theirs in that we do not impose any parametric restriction on f which is especially important in the hydrological or meteorological science e g the short term rainfall forecasting with complex interactions among covariates remark 2 in practical applications we can further improve the algorithm 1 by applying the newton boosting method furthermore by defining a custom objective function our method can be also adapted to the widely used parallel gradient boosting frameworks like xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 and lightgbm ke et al 2017 these frameworks are designed to be highly efficient and flexible and can scale to billions of examples in distributed settings 2 5 tools for analyzing gevboost models as pointed out by lipton 2016 practical models should be interpretable besides their good performance to address this issue we hope the fitted model can help to identify the most relevant factors that affects the precipitation in arid and semi arid regions as well as how these factors interact with each other we highlight that benefiting from inside tree structures our gevboost model can deliver interpretable results in addition to its impressive predicting powers especially classical tools designed for tree based ensemble methods e g random forests and boosting trees like the variable importance vi and dependence plot breiman 2001 can be directly utilized to provide a comprehensive summary of how the fitted model relying on these covariates recently an improved covariate attribution framework named shap shapley additive explanation was proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 with this unique consistent method they further suggest using the shap dependence plot to describe interaction effects in a tree ensemble model which plots each sample point down by taking the value of a chosen covariate for the x axis and related shap value for the y axis lundberg et al 2018 in this way it can provide more detailed information by visualizing the individualized covariate attribution other than just summaries moreover by drawing points of different samples from dataset the trend of the covariate s attributed importance can be illustrated as its value varies in section 4 we will analyze our gevboost model in such a framework to draw some useful conclusions 2 6 performance criteria to measure the performance of diverse approaches both the probability estimation accuracy and classification accuracy criteria are used in this paper accordingly since we do not know true class probabilities we assess the probability estimation accuracy by the brier score brier 1950 bs 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 where y i is the observed class label of the i th sample and y ˆ i is the predicted class probability meanwhile we also evaluate classifiers by the recall rate rr f1 score and especially the matthews correlation coefficient mcc on imbalanced datasets the latter has been demonstrated to be a more reliable metric for evaluating binary classifications chicco and jurman 2020 in our experiments we further plot the roc and precision recall pr curves davis and goadrich 2006 to compare different models visually 3 case studies in this section we investigate the prediction performance of gevboost method as compared to the logistic regression lr random forest rf adaboost artificial neural network ann and gev regression gr models we also consider combining lr rf and ann models with smote adasyn and random under sampling rs techniques a cost sensitive cs loss based on class wise re weighting scheme for lr and rf is also a option the first case considers an australian weather dataset while the second one investigates the 1 h rainfall forecasting for selected cities in gansu province where the highly imbalanced precipitation data make the problem quite challenging 3 1 the weatheraus dataset here we try different models on a public dataset named weatheraus 1 1 https rattle togaware com weatheraus csv the source dataset is copyright by the australian commonwealth bureau of meteorology and is used with permission this dataset contains processed daily weather observations from 49 stations around australia it has several covariates corresponding to the binary response variable which indicates the weather status i e raining or not on the following day since the proportion of raining days is less than 20 we encounter an imbalanced binary classification problem here in experiments we ignore the covariate location for an overall study of the weather status in australia meanwhile the covariate risk mm is excluded from the predictive model as it may leak the future rainfall information and four other covariates sunshine evaporation cloud3pm and cloud9am with too many missing values over 60 are also dropped then we randomly divide the data into two sets 70 of which as the training set 30 of which as a testing set and all models are fitted to the training set note that when building a gevboost model 30 of the training data is used as a validation set for selecting the value of parameter ξ for other models that require tuning hyperparameters we take the same procedure for ensemble models like adaboost rf and gevboost we use an equal number of base estimators which is 200 here as for ann model we utilize a four layers neural network with 30 units in each hidden layer set learning rate equals to 0 01 and adopt the adam optimizer more complex net structures do not result in much better model performance in our experiments we repeat the above data splitting and model fitting procedure 10 times and report the averaged test results in table 1 best scores are marked in bold it is easy to see that the classifiers combined with adasyn smote and random under sampling techniques get higher recall rates this result is foreseeable because these re sample methods will increase the proportion of minority class and make rainfall events to be easier detected however we find re sample based models have much lower classification precisions than the other approaches the possible reason is that some synthetic samples are generated into the majority class region i e the over generalization problem which makes the fitted classifiers prone to false alarms in rainfall forecasting so we can observe that they do not perform well under the auc and mcc criteria and also get larger brier scores our gevboost model on the other hand does not need to resample the training set or create synthetic samples from the minority class performs quite well in terms of both classification accuracy and probability estimation accuracy 3 2 hourly precipitation data in gansu province 3 2 1 study area in northwest china gansu province lies between the tibet and the loess plateaus affected by dry climatic conditions most areas in gansu province are located in arid and semi arid regions with few precipitation for example in the western part of gansu province annual precipitation ranges from 50 mm in dunhuang city to 75 mm in jiuquan city fig 2 presents the annual precipitation map of gansu in 2017 and exact locations of 14 national monitoring stations to be studied these stations are irregularly located in space spreading over a certain region that spans 32 95 n 41 8 n and 94 68 e 108 39 e 3 2 2 data description the original rainfall data are obtained on an hourly basis for some consecutive years starting from january 1 2013 for some stations available records starting from the year 2015 to december 31 2017 due to the season winds most of the rainfall in gansu is concentrated in the june to september so we select observations in this period of each year table 2 summarizes some properties of the rainfall data in each station with the rarity rate p defined as the proportion of 1 h rainfall events the meteorological covariates associated with precipitation in northwest china e g high temperature and low wind speed have been studied by shi et al 2007 in our experiments based on the observed data we select several covariates which help to differentiate the meteorological conditions that may produce the rainfall for example we consider air temperature ground temperature 10 min averaged wind speed 10 min averaged wind direction dew point relative humidity vapor pressure and the precipitation in the last hour in the single station model we also accept altitude longitude and latitude as covariates in the overall model which takes all the 14 stations into consideration table 3 shows some descriptive statistics of these covariates on the entire dataset 3 2 3 model performance first we fit the aforementioned models separately to 14 stations as shown in tables 4 7 the gevboost model has the smallest brier score as well as the highest f1 score and mcc in almost all stations then we merge samples from each station to have geographical covariates i e longitude latitude and altitude be concerned in this setting the data from the year 2013 2015 for some stations to 2016 are used as a training set and those of the year 2017 as a testing set we plot the roc curve and the pr curve to demonstrate the test performance of each method as illustrated in fig 3 from the figure it can be observed that both the area under the roc curve and the pr curve for the gevboost model are the largest among these methods which implies that this model has a higher recall rate and also a higher precision these observations also demonstrate that our approach can be more appropriate for predicting short term rainfall in arid and semi arid regions 4 discussion here we show how the fitted gevboost model provides interpretable results by utilizing the dataset described in section 3 2 2 to compare the factors that affect short term rainfalls in different climate regions we first apply the gevboost algorithm to two selected areas respectively one is the northwestern gansu often referred to as the hexi corridor which is dry and has a temperate desert climate the other one is the eastern gansu which is relatively humid with a continental monsoon climate fig 4 illustrates their significant differences in the precipitation amount and rarity rate of rainfall events we can see that from june to september the rainfall appears more abundant in eastern gansu than hexi corridor also the proportion of 1 h rainfall events is about 8 1 in eastern gansu while 3 7 in hexi corridor to start with we would like to identify the significant explanatory covariates that are related to short term rainfall events as in lundberg et al 2018 we plot a bar chart in fig 5 to show the impact of each covariate in terms of the mean absolute shap value where 10 covariates with the largest mean absolute shap value in each region are reported it is observed that in both regions relative humidity precipitation in the last hour and ground temperature all play a pivotal role in forecasting 1 h rainfall but the rainfall status in the previous hour has a greater impact on the eastern gansu moreover the effects of wind direction wind speed and time i e the covariate hour cannot be ignored either next we use the shap dependence plot to study the effects of covariates on short term rainfall events and the 6 most important covariates are shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 a and b illustrate that the larger amount of precipitation in the past hour the bigger probability of rainfall in the next hour which is in line with our intuition fig 6 c f show that high relative humidity as well as high wind speed make a positive contribution to rainfalls and the non monotonic relationships between the ground temperature and rainfall events can be seen in fig 7 a and b briefly speaking in hexi corridor the ground temperature between 10 c and 20 c plays a positive role however the higher or lower value outside this range plays a negative role in eastern gansu the temperature range associated with rainfall events is about 15 c to 25 c for categorical covariates i e hour and wind direction similar conclusions can be drawn from fig 7 c f for example we can observe that rainfall events are more likely to occur between 2 and 14 o clock and wind directions from 247 5 to 360 degree e g westerly and northwesterly winds represent a higher probability of rainfall in both regions in eastern gansu the influence of northerly wind on rainfall events is also significant this result is consistent with the conclusion given by liu et al 2019 who showed that the westerly wind is the main body of the water vapor transportation in northwest china and has a significant effect on the precipitation a shap interaction effect plot can visualize the effect of an interacting covariate by coloring each data point with its value lundberg et al 2018 with this useful tool we can study the interaction effect of different covariates on short term rainfall for instance fig 8 a and b show that most rainfall events tend to occur between 2 and 12 o clock and low temperature in this period has a positive contribution while high temperature has a negative one note that here color from blue to red represents the covariate value varying from small to large similarly fig 8 c d confirm the important role that the fast wind i e speed 2 m s plays in forecasting rainfall as it is associated with water vapor transmission but only when the relative humidity reaches over 50 also fig 8 e and f show the contrasting effect that the wind direction exposed at different times for example in the hexi corridor the westerly and northwesterly wind play a positive role during the day while a negative role at night on the other hand we draw the opposite conclusion in the eastern gansu and also find that northerly and northeasterly wind may indicate rainfalls in the morning 5 conclusion in this paper we present an effective model to accurately estimate the probability of the rare event and apply it to forecast short term rainfalls in arid and semi arid regions case studies demonstrate its improved probability estimation performance as well as classification accuracy moreover the fitted model can automatically identify significant meteorological covariates that drive the rainfalls and provide a series of tools to help researchers better understand related mechanisms the application of our method can go beyond the rainfall forecasting and be easily extended to the study of other hydroclimatic

2356,with a warming climate extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently in future which can lead to sediment and freshwater pulses to coastal waters that quickly affect water quality understanding how coastal systems respond to and recover from such acute events is becoming more and more important particularly true in semi enclosed bays with weak water exchange and purification capacities such as jiaozhou bay jzb based on the three cruises performed on 17 july 5 and 22 august 2012 a coupled physical biological model was used to examine ecosystem responses in jzb to typhoon damrey an extreme precipitation event in order to study the mechanism behind rainfall induced changes three groups of sensitivity experiments were set to furtherly analyze the contributions of rivers and atmospheric deposition respectively the results showed that typhoon induced rainfall provided high concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip to phytoplankton which caused a remarkable chlorophyll a increase subsequently during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from river runoff were 1 80 and 2 14 times than that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the productivity than that supported by atmospheric deposition rainfall induced nutrient input will lead to blooms in coastal areas especially in semi enclosed bays since increased rainfall would trigger higher river discharge rivers became the main carriers of nutrients atmospheric deposition provided a low level supply and it was limited for alleviating phosphorus limitation in semi enclosed bays enhancing ecological monitoring of rivers and atmospheric deposition is urgent and essential to predict the response of ecosystems to extreme rainfall events keywords heavy rainfall physical biological modeling nutrition dynamics phytoplankton dynamics river runoff atmospheric deposition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme precipitation events are expected to occur more frequently under the ongoing global warming donat et al 2016 knight and davis 2009 min et al 2011 pfahl et al 2017 which is potentially a large driver of change in the ocean dramatically changing the hydrological conditions and pose increasing threats to ecosystems knapp et al 2008 especially in coastal areas cardoso et al 2008 weyhenmeyer et al 2004 it can cause excess freshwater input from rivers and transport large quantities of sediment to the nearshore area decreasing salinity of coastal water xia et al 2007 du et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and reducing water transparency over weeks zhang et al 2013 river discharge can cause significant heterogeneity in nutrients distribution at both the spatial and temporal scales xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 xia and jiang 2015 and the nutrients concentrations will increase with the increased river discharge michalak et al 2013 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 xia and jiang 2015 nitrogen and phosphorus are the main requirements for phytoplankton which are critical to convert terrestrial inorganic nutrients into organic forms xia and jiang 2016 jiang and xia 2017 jiang and xia 2018 al diana et al 2020 azmi et al 2020 extreme precipitation has been identified as an important factor driving nitrogen and phosphorus loading previously ballard et al 2019 gentry et al 2007 nausch et al 2017 sinha and michalak 2016 the changes in nutrient concentration e g nitrogen phosphorus silicon and nutrient ratios play a significant role in controlling phytoplankton species diversity justić et al 1995a justić et al 1995b high nutrient inputs can lead to short and long term variations in productivity paerl et al 2006 2001 wetz and paerl 2008 phytoplankton is an important biological evaluation indicator of water quality tas et al 2009 especially in coastal areas where the ecosystems are critical to economic cultural and ecologic health barbier et al 2011 moberg and folke 1999 white et al 2000 chlorophyll a concentration in the aquatic ecosystem can be used as one of the phytoplankton abundance indicators which is highly useful in assessing interactive effects of nutrient loading on phytoplankton production franklin et al 2020 paerl et al 2007 therefore it is critical to understand how precipitation influences nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations in coastal regions responses of the ocean to heavy rainfall events have attracted increasing attention worldwide e g chambers et al 2007 de carlo et al 2007 xia and jiang 2015 du et al 2017 some studies have found that heavy rainfall events increased surface nutrient concentrations michalak et al 2013 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 which caused subsequent phytoplankton blooms and high chlorophyll a concentration burkholder et al 2004 paerl et al 2006 2001 peierls et al 2003 wetz and paerl 2008 zhao et al 2009 high nutrient discharge is driven by enhanced river runoff and atmospheric deposition induced by rainfall acker 2005 guan et al 2007 however previous studies were mostly based on field observation which is not enough for the comprehensive investigation on the spatial temporal variation of nutrient phytoplankton dynamics chai et al 2009 because the systems are heterogeneous at relatively small spatial scales and it is difficult to interpolate and extrapolate limited in situ observations bocaniov and scavia 2018 and satellite based methods have not yet been developed for routinely measuring phytoplankton dynamics in shallow coastal and estuarine waters where the ocean color is confounded by suspended sediments dissolved organic matters and interference from land moreno madriñán and fischer 2013 cloern et al 2014 models are robust tools to solve this problem a coastal physical biological model was used to simulated the distribution of nutrients salinity and temperature and investigate the effects of river discharge and atmospheric winds on the spatial and temporal distributions in cape fear river and in perdido bay xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 given the ecological significance modeling assessment of biogeochemical processes and their driving mechanisms are highly necessary xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 xia and jiang 2015 however there have been few studies about response of ecosystem to extreme precipitation events by numerical simulation to the author s knowledge there is only one relevant numerical study found yet mahlil et al 2020 built a depth averaged two dimensional ecological model in atsumi bay and found that high river discharges during rainfall altered nutrient concentrations throughout the bay and phytoplankton uptake of nutrients was highly correlated with phytoplankton growth although the model is applied to evaluate nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton growth in estuarine waterbodies it focused on the effect of large river inputs during rain events some questions such as the interactions of physical biological and chemical processes and the complex effects of these processes on biogenic elements phytoplankton growth and primary productivity still need to be addressed the relative effects of riverine and atmospheric input associated extreme precipitation events on the ecosystem are also unclear meanwhile the three dimensional physical biogeochemical model could better resolve the biophysical interactions nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics during extreme precipitations semi enclosed bays are vulnerable to extreme precipitation events due to constant eutrophication and weak water exchange xu et al 2010 jiaozhou bay jzb is a typical semi enclosed bay surrounded by the downtown of qingdao jiaozhou and huangdao district on three sides it is adjacent to the industrial and agricultural zones qdmbs 2017 heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities sun and sun 2015 with the increasing use of fossil fuels and agricultural fertilizers pollutants including sulfur nitrogen and heavy metals ultimately reach the marine environment via precipitation doney et al 2007 galloway 2005 galloway et al 2008 rodhe et al 2002 heavy rainfall events may increase the risk of eutrophication in jzb xing et al 2017a elevated rainfall and followed nutrient rich runoff contribute to the eutrophication potential of waters paerl et al 1999 and seem to coincide with blooms phlips et al 2004 therefore it is presumably an ideal region to study the variation of nutrient and chlorophyll a concentration in response to extreme precipitation events thus in this paper a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high resolution based on the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom was developed to obtain a detailed understanding of biological response to a heavy rainfall event in a typical semi enclosed bay the major objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the biological response to the extreme precipitation event in the semi enclosed bay 2 to quantify the contributions of river input and atmospheric deposition to nutrients supply and chlorophyll concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1

wastes into jzb liang et al 2015 the largest is the dagu river with an annual average runoff of 6 61 108 m3 ma et al 2021 the bay mouth is only about 2 5 km wide connecting to the south yellow sea ke et al 2020 owing to the restriction of the narrow bay mouth to water exchange sun and sun 2015 the average water residence time in jzb is up to 52 days liu et al 2004 2 2 data typhoon damrey landed in shandong on 2 august 2012 bringing heavy rain and strong wind to the cities along the route fig 1 a jzb was hit by heavy rain from 2 to 3 august with an average precipitation of more than 69 9 mm the observation data is collected by ocean university of china in the summer on 17 july 15 days before the rainfall 5 and 22 august zhang et al 2016 including 22 stations fig 1b the main inorganic nitrogen concentration no3 n no2 n nh3 n and po4 p temperature salinity and chlorophyll a were monitored according to the chinese national specification for marine monitoring part 4 seawater analysis gb 17378 4 2007 the river hydrological stations located at the estuary of haibo river licun river loushan river moshui river dagu river yang river and lianwan river wet deposition samples were collected at the top of mountain baguan no 5 yushan road qingdao more details about the observation data and determined methods can be found in zhang et al 2016 2 3 numerical model setup a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high spatial and temporal resolution was developed based on the fvcom version 3 22 which has been used to study the tidal dynamics and suspended sediment dynamics in jzb in our previous studies gao et al 2014 gao et al 2018a gao et al 2018b meanwhile a nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model was added considering the main ecological elements the unstructured triangular grids consist 3691 nodes and 6922 elements the average spatial resolution is approximately 500 m the water column is vertically divided into six layers using a sigma coordinate we introduce the basic structure of the biogeochemical model here and for more details please refer to li et al 2015 they have developed a 3d water quality model the estuarine coastal and ocean modeling system with sediments to determine the environmental capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus in jzb the coupling process in the model was similar with some previous studies such as xia and jiang 2016 seven state variables were considered in the model dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorus dop phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus diatoms were the dominant species of phytoplankton as known by the historical data and the bioassay in this study and copepod were the dominant zooplankton the basic structure of the set of model control equations can be briefly summarized by the following equation 1 c i t p h y s i c s c i b i o l o g y c i c h e m i s t r y c i c i represents the concentration of each ecological variable this equation indicates that the local variation of ecological variables is controlled by a combination of the relevant physical and biochemical process terms physical processes include processes such as advection diffusion and the riverine and atmospheric input the advection and diffusion of each ecological variable is synchronized with the temperature and salt fields and takes the same form the physical process term is expressed specifically as 2 physics c i v c i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k v c i z s i v c i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k v c i z and s i are the advection turbulent diffusion and source sink terms respectively k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients respectively in this model we used the smagorinsky eddy parameterization method smagorinsky 1963 to calculate the horizontal diffusion coefficient and the mellor and yamada 1982 2 5 level turbulent closure model for the vertical eddy viscosity and the thermal diffusion coefficient details of the equations and parameters of the physical biogeochemical model can be found in the appendix the hydrodynamics model was forced by tidal elevations the harmonic constants were derived from the tpxo global model of ocean tides at the open boundary and wind field data were from the observations provided by weather stations in jzb the flux of rivers was provided by qingdao water conservancy bureau and the terrigenous discharge fluxes were provided by qingdao municipal bureau of ecology and environment the input of nutrient concentration was obtained by the cruise observation and soil water tool assessment the heat flux was collected from the reanalysis data provided by national centers for environmental prediction the initial field was provided by field observations before the rainfall event 2 4 sensitivity experiments to better understand the complex mechanism behind ecosystem response to extreme precipitation events a set of sensitivity experiments se 1 was conducted to investigate the role of rainfall induced river runoff and atmospheric deposition in in nutrients cycling and chlorophyll a dynamics the nutrient concentrations in the various sensitivity experiments allow us to quantify imported fluxes and understand the processes involved river inputs caused by the heavy rainfall were excluded in se 1 1 and atmospheric deposition was excluded in se 1 2 both river inputs and atmospheric deposition were excluded in se 1 3 table 1 se 2 was conducted to investigate how increased river flow affects water exchange thus different nutrients flux inputs by rivers were set in se 2 1 se 2 2 se 2 3 and se 2 4 table 1 respectively the river fluxes remained constant but the nutrient concentration carried by river was changed taking the reference experiment re as the standard the nutrients flux of se 2 1 was 0 times than that of the re similarly the nutrients flux input by river of se 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 was 0 5 2 and 5 times than that of the re respectively 3 results 3 1 model verification the hydrodynamic environment in jzb is dominated by the tides physical models were used previously to study the effects of land reclamation on tidal dynamics in jzb the hydrodynamics sediment model was used previously to study the effects of land reclamation on tidal dynamics in jzb gao et al 2014 and on suspended sediment dynamics when waves were negligible gao et al 2018a it was also used to study the effect of each wave current interaction mechanism gao et al 2018b the model was thoroughly calibrated and applied in these studies the model tidal ellipse harmonic parameters for the dominant m2 tide had been compared with the field observations gao et al 2014 the mean errors of the m2 tide semi major axis semi minor axis inclination and phase averaged over the six different stations and the surface middle and bottom layers were 3 0 cm s 1 1 2 cm s 1 5 6 and 6 6 respectively the results of skill scores ss and correlation coefficients cc for field data showed that the model can used with good confidence for example the ss and cc are 0 94 0 96 0 86 0 89 and 0 71 0 78 for water elevations eastward velocities and northward velocities respectively gao et al 2017 it then gave us confidence for simulate the advection and diffusion processes of nutrients and chlorophyll a reasonably the numerical modeling experiments successfully captured the heavy rainfall event and reproduced the regional din dip chlorophyll a salinity and temperature with the root mean square error of 13 61 μmol l 0 57 μmol l 3 00 μg l 1 06 psu and 1 18 c respectively table 2 the discrepancies between model results and observations may arise from the timing mismatch between the daily averaged model data and instantaneous observation data it also can be seen from fig 2 and fig 3 that the modeled and measured values of din dip chlorophyll a salinity and temperature in jzb are fairly similar therefore it indicates that the physical biological model well captures the response of nutrients and chlorophyll a to the extreme precipitation event it enhances the confidence to investigate underlying mechanisms the blank areas near the northwestern part of the jzb coast is the tidal flat it is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide which was also blanked in previous studies gao et al 2014 gao et al 2018a gao et al 2018b qu et al 2020 li et al 2020 3 1 1 distribution of major nutrients and chlorophyll a before the heavy rainfall the din in jzb fluctuated in the range of 7 93 46 47 μmol l with an average of 23 00 μmol l and the dip ranged from 0 31 to 1 96 μmol l with an average of 0 69 μmol l high values of din and dip were observed in the northeast of jzb fig 2 the northeastern region is adjacent to downtown qingdao and three large wastewater treatment plants are located in the estuaries along the eastern coast in addition the capacity of water exchange in the east is weaker than that in the west shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 which is conducive to the retention of nutrients chlorophyll a varied from 1 04 to 6 38 μg l mean 3 32 μg l before the event and gradually decreased from the bay bottom to the mouth the salinity and temperature were in the range of 28 66 30 86 psu and 22 63 25 07 c respectively fig 3 one day after the rainfall precipitation resulted in higher concentrations of din and dip and a more significant increase was in dip concentration the mean concentration of din increased by 37 5 from 10 06 to 120 72 μmol l and the mean concentration of dip increased by 81 1 from 0 45 to 4 89 μmol l the heavy rainfall event led to a significant increase in surface runoff and terrestrial input resulting in significant increases in din and dip fluxes into jzb indicating that the rainfall process was generally accompanied by an increase in nutrient concentrations in a short period chlorophyll a ranged from 0 11 0 87 μg l with an average value of 0 44 μg l and concentration in surface water was considerably low in the whole jzb fig 2 the mean value of salinity dropped 0 41 psu but the mean value of temperature rose almost 2 55 c 18 days after the rainfall event din and dip decreased compared to the concentrations 1 day after the rainfall with the average value of 23 94 μmol l range 11 16 61 49 μmol l and 0 98 μmol l range 0 49 2 94 μmol l respectively fig 2 while chlorophyll a gradually increased from 0 31 to 8 23 μg l mean 2 58 μg l which is closely associated with abundant nutrients the rainfall induced high nutrient concentration enhanced phytoplankton growth triggered an increase of chlorophyll a and then consumed in the progress of phytoplankton growth the average salinity showed little change but the mean value of temperature dropped 1 85 c fig 3 3 1 2 temporal variation of major nutrients and chlorophyll a furthermore in order to analyze the effect of the heavy rainfall event on the variation of biogenic elements model simulated time series of din dip and chlorophyll a concentrations were plotted fig 4 din increased by an order of magnitude within 24 h after the rainfall and reached a maximum before it declined indicating that heavy rain is a crucial contributor to the increased fluxes of nitrogen the variation of dip had the same trend as the variation in din the peak value of dip appeared when rainfall emerged with the peak flow and almost at the same time with the peak of the din concentration chlorophyll a declined continuously before the heavy rainfall with the concentration dropped from an initial level of 3 3 μg l to the level around 0 8 μg l the decline was related to a rainfall event occurred in the upper reaches of rivers before 17 july fig 1 and resulted in higher chlorophyll a concentrations than normal concentrations after this rainfall event nutrient levels are insufficient to maintain the high concentration thus the chlorophyll a concentration gradually decreased and dropped to a low level before typhoon damrey previous study also found that the average of chlorophyll a in the study area were not very high in 2012 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 which supported our simulation after the extreme rainfall event associated with typhoon damery chlorophyll a increased slightly and slowly and a rapid increase was observed 7 10 days after the heavy rainfall the effect of the heavy rainfall event on chlorophyll a may be delayed probably due to the time needed for phytoplankton growth the post rainfall period was divided into four periods according to the growth rate of chlorophyll a fig 4 termed period i nutrient accumulation ii rapid chlorophyll a increase iii high chlorophyll and low nutrient and iv poor nutrition during the period i rainfall induced runoff inputs and atmospheric deposition significantly increased concentrations of nutrients with a slight increase of chlorophyll a during period ii high nutrient concentration stimulated phytoplankton growth leading to a rapid increase in chlorophyll a during period iii phytoplankton consumed nutrients and lea to a low level of nutrients but a high level of chlorophyll a when chlorophyll a concentration was steady during period iv phytoplankton was in a nutrient poor environment with a decrease in chlorophyll a concentration 3 2 experiments on source identifications the average din of the experiment without river runoff decreased by 45 3 mean 17 30 μmol l max 26 39 μmol l min 9 78 μmol l compared to the re mean 31 62 μmol l max 120 72 μmol l min 10 06 μmol l on 5 august followed by 22 august mean 10 71 μmol l max 14 50 μmol l min 8 86 μmol l when the average din decreased by 55 3 fig 5 the exclusion of runoff resulted in significantly reduced din concentration the concentration of din was close to zero on 22 august obviously different from the re however there was no obvious difference in din between the experiment without atmospheric deposition and the reference experiment the average din concentration only decreased by 6 2 mean 29 65 μmol l max 119 08 μmol l min 9 38 μmol l on 5 august and decreased by 8 0 mean 22 02 μmol l max 62 68 μmol l min 10 03 μmol l on 22 august the spatial distribution also showed an insignificant difference yet it was noteworthy that there was a difference on 22 august between the sensitivity experiment and reference experiment the contour line of din in the central area shifted northward slightly and the concentration decreased slightly suggesting that atmospheric deposition may enhance din concentration in the central region of jzb when runoff and atmospheric deposition were all not included the average din decreased by 44 1 on 5 august mean 17 67 μmol l max 27 21 μmol l min 9 68 μmol l and decreased by 54 7 on 22 august mean 10 85 μmol l max 13 77 μmol l min 8 90 μmol l compared with the re in general the result of exp 1 3 without river runoff and atmospheric deposition was highly similar to the result of exp 1 1 only without river runoff suggesting that rainfall induced river runoff was undoubtedly the dominant source of din in jzb although atmospheric deposition was also recognized as a nutrients source to ecosystems it was not a substantial source of din relative to river discharge fueled by precipitation it also could be found that river input was the predominant source of dip fig 6 and chlorophyll a fig 7 this pattern of higher concentrations when flow was highest was common in estuaries where dip was transported in river from its terrestrial source and rainfall took an increase of surface runoff similarly when the input of atmosphere deposition was not considered a slight decline of dip concentration could be observed in the central region the higher dip tongue that extended seaward disappeared indicating that atmosphere deposition maybe an important source of dip in the offshore area the time series of the mean din dip and chlorophyll a of the re and se also suggested that the high concentrations of main biological elements were related to the pulse input caused by the heavy rainfall fig 8 when rainfall induced river input was excluded the heavy rainfall had a limited impact on the ecosystem in jzb and nutrients and chlorophyll a showed little response to it 3 3 experiments on the variation of nutrients fluxes through river the sensitivity experiments showed that the rivers were the main carriers of nutrients during the heavy rainfall event whereas atmospheric deposition played only a supplementary role thus the second set of analyses was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to different nutrient fluxes of surface runoff an increase in concentration was observed in the riverine influenced area of the estuary and the contour line expanded toward the mouth gradually with the gradual increases in terrigenous nutrients input figs 9 11 when the nutrients flux input by rivers were 0 and 50 of the nutrient flux of the re the average din concentration on 5 august decreased by 41 5 and 20 8 mean 18 49 μmol l 25 06 μmol l respectively and on 22 august decreased by 48 4 and 24 4 mean 12 36 μmol l 18 10 μmol l respectively when the nutrients flux of river discharge was 2 and 5 times the average din concentration on 5 august increased by 40 2 and 160 8 mean 44 33 μmol l 82 47 μmol l respectively and on 22 august increased by 50 and 204 4 35 91 μmol l 72 87 μmol l respectively similarly an increase in dip and chlorophyll a concentration also could be observed with the increase of river nutrients fluxes tables s7 and s8 a series of experiments with varying surface flux demonstrated that the concentration of din and dip increased corresponding to the enhanced nutrient fluxes of river input although the nutrients remained a tendency of decreasing from the inshore to offshore when the nutrients fluxes of river input were increased a strong spatial gradient could be observed compared with the re the enhanced terrestrial input contributed to a higher concentration of nutrients with the spatial gradient increased because the variation of chlorophyll a was strongly correlated with nutrient concentrations fulton et al 2015 the increase in nutrient fluxes would be of significant importance to chlorophyll a and would lead to a more uneven distribution when higher intensity rainfall events appeared with global warming and then induced an increase of nutrients input by rivers the din dip and chlorophyll a concentrations will greatly be boosted and so will the spatial gradient 4 discussion 4 1 impact of heavy rain on din and dip influenced by the extreme precipitation event din and dip rose sharply and immediately after the rainfall event and then decreased in the following days fig 2 the significant increases were probably due to the high intensity and long duration of the heavy rainfall brought by typhoon damrey which led to a significant increase in land load of nutrients as well as intensified deposition of nutrients from the atmosphere specifically strong scouring and disturbance of the flood waters aggravated the loss of nitrogen especially phosphorus from the sediments in the ditches and rivers leading to an increase in runoff and nutrient levels the decrease of nutrients following the heavy rainfall was possibly due to biological uptake and water exchange between jzb and the yellow sea although nutrient levels inside jzb may be influenced to some extent by the exchange with the yellow sea the water exchange capacity was limited because of the quite narrow mouth only 7 of the total amount of water in jzb is exchanged per tidal cycle liu et al 2004 and the flushing time for the water in jzb at high tide is 28 days and at low tide is 43 days liu et al 2012 the average residence time is about 52 days liu et al 2004 which is longer than the rainy duration 2 days in this study and is over 37 simulated days after the rainfall event thus water exchange played a relatively minor role in nutrients decrease furthermore the limited exchange capacity indicated the weakness of capability to transport nutrients from the inside to outside of jzb precipitation induced especially sudden heavy rainfall short term and large amounts of nutrients input will bring jzb to the risk of eutrophication the heavy rainfall event changed the distribution pattern of nutrients in jzb before the rainfall higher din and dip concentration was in the northeast where the water exchange capacity was weak shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 therefore hydrodynamic conditions were conducive to the accumulation of nutrients and phytoplankton growth phytoplankton also obtained lots of organic pollutants in long term and the coastal rivers flowed through human intensive areas with urbanization the eastern coastal estuaries had become conduits of wastewater carrying 75 of the city sewage into jzb gao et al 2008 sewage direct input and intense respiration led to the northeast acting as a strong source of nutrients in contrast the impact of urbanization in the west was weaker and the natural ecosystem was healthier yuan et al 2016 thus the highest din and dip values were in the northeast after the rainfall the difference between the northeast and northwest was not significant because the heavy rainfall event promoted river input in the western and eastern portions of jzb simultaneously before the rainfall event being consistent with observation the mean n p ratios were mostly above 25 and it is above the redfield value 16 1 suggesting a comparative n abundance and p limitation status the high n p ratio was found in the area near tuan dao wastewater treatment plants and dagu river basin the heavy rainfall event did not instantly alter n p which increased significantly after 20 days compared with the temporal variation of din dip and chlorophyll a illustrated in fig 12 the increase of n p lagged behind the changes in chlorophyll a which indicated that the consumption of nutrients by high phytoplankton mass may trigger an increase of n p and ultimately caused phosphorus limitation in surface water during period iii the growth rate of chlorophyll a decreased in response to enhanced phosphorus limitation the spatial distribution of n p also changed with the high ratio appearing in nearshore areas fig 12e which was similar to fig 2r it indicated that the heavy rainfall event inducing nutrients input had no discernible effect on n p but high nutrients aggregated phytoplankton growth which enhanced phosphorus limitation in jzb especially in nearshore areas rainfall indirectly changed the nutrient structure and may ultimately affect the biological community composition 4 2 impact of heavy rain on phytoplankton growth before the rainfall event chlorophyll a decreased suggesting nutrient availability was not sufficient to sustain phytoplankton growth rates precipitation enhanced river input causing a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus substances to be released into the water meanwhile n p ratio was about 25 close to the redfield values which provided suitable conditions for phytoplankton growth thus the heavy rainfall event brought another explosive phytoplankton growth and ultimately led to an increase in chlorophyll a concentration and significantly exceeded pre rainfall levels a phytoplankton bloom exceeding 10 μg l was generated in the nearshore area fig 13 it can be concluded that the heavy rainfall and induced runoff from the land delivered large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus into the water which was likely to induce a bloom in a semi enclosed bay the occurrence of bloom showed regional differences and the more serious bloom located in the northeast where nutrient concentration was also higher the peak value of chlorophyll a was higher in the northeast and the time required to reach its peak was longer the longer term was probably because the nutrient level in the northeast was much higher the higher nutrient concentration the longer phytoplankton growing period naturally resulting in a higher peak moreover the weaker water exchange capacity in the region shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 induced phytoplankton gathering which resulted in a longer period of phytoplankton growth li et al 2017 found strong primary production in the west however a lower level of nutrients could be found in the northeast compared to those in the northeast fig 2 the strong primary production and lower nutrient concentration may lead to a significant reduction of time to the peak value in the northwest 4 3 contributions of increased river runoff and atmospheric deposition induced by heavy rainfall the se 2 indicated that the majority of increased nutrient concentrations were attributed to inputs from rainfall induced river runoff accounting for a higher percentage of the total external inputs of nutrients in jzb during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus input from river runoff were 1 80 and 2 14 times that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the increase of chlorophyll a concentration than that supported by atmospheric deposition that was partially due to many rivers in the study area and rainfall induced relatively high runoff although rainfall induced atmospheric deposition represented a low level of fertilization effect in the whole bay it played a role in nutrients supplement and caused a wide range effect on the area relatively far from the shore such as the central bay where the effects of river input weakened significantly as the distance increases after the rainfall event the nutrients emissions into jzb were dominated by rainfall induced river runoff indicating the major source of nutrients in jzb was terrigenous discharge and more attention should be paid to the environmental assessment and management nutrient loadings by river runoff and atmosphere deposition produce a lag increase in the n p ratio of bay waters fig 14 when the river input was excluded the n p ratio had been declining significantly whereas the n p ratio was almost the same when the atmosphere deposition was excluded it indicated that rainfall induced river runoff was the main factor causing the variation of the n p ratio because rainfall induced river runoff was the predominant source of nutrients as we noted above in the environments without nutrients input from atmospheric deposition phytoplankton growth seemed to cause more severely p limited conditions and the n p ratio finally reached a higher peak it suggested that the n p ratio of atmospheric deposition has a limited but important impact in the long term for alleviating phosphorus limitation in jzb the alleviating contribution tended to be larger one month after the heavy rainfall event the line representing the n p ratio of re the green line was always between the blue line experiment with no atmosphere deposition and the orange line experiment with no river runoff suggesting that the effects of river runoff and atmosphere deposition on the n p ration were opposite because of their different composition of nutrients 5 conclusions extreme precipitation events are rare but likely to occur more frequently under the warming climate this study took the extreme precipitation event during typhoon damrey as an example to examine how the short term heavy rain affected the ecosystem in a semi enclosed bay region based on the bay scale observation of three voyages from july to august 2012 the concentration of important biogenic elements and chlorophyll a were obtained before and after the rainfall event we have successfully simulated the nutrients dynamics and chlorophyll a dynamics during the heavy rainfall event using a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high resolution configured for jzb the model can also be used for biogeochemical simulations during future extreme weather events ecological responses were well reproduced by the coupled physical biological model nutrients din and dip and chlorophyll a exhibited remarkable changes in response to the heavy rainfall event one day after the rainfall event the precipitation enhanced riverine input and atmospheric deposition caused an increase in din and dip after 7 10 days chlorophyll a concentration rose in response to high nutrient concentration which also caused a decrease of nutrients as it rises rainfall induced nutrient input will lead to blooms in semi enclosed bays especially in nearshore area where the water residence time is long temporal variation of the nutrient stoichiometric ratios induced by the heavy rainfall event was investigated after 20 days the n p ratio increased significantly behind the variation of chlorophyll a the heavy rainfall event did not alter n p directly but it induced a large amount of nutrients input which aggregated phytoplankton growth and enhanced phosphorus limitation in jzb indirectly the difference in nutrient composition resulted in that the effect of river runoff and atmosphere deposition to the n p ratio in jzb was opposite during the extreme precipitation event the contributions of river runoff and atmosphere deposition were quantified the majority of increased nutrients were attributed to the rainfall induced river runoff din dip and chlorophyll a all increased following the increase of riverine nutrients flux during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus input from rivers were 1 80 and 2 14 times that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the productivity than that supported by atmospheric deposition our findings extended past research and pointed that the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events likely caused an increase in the occurrence of blooms especially in the semi enclosed bay which were easily impacted by anthropogenic activities the impacts of future extreme precipitation events may be even more devastating to estuarine water quality than anticipated as more human derived pollutants will be discharged to coastal waters especially in areas with development and increasing populations wiegner et al 2013 reducing the discharge of human produced sewage and effective coastal management may be the critical factors in avoiding eutrophication in addition enhancing

2356,with a warming climate extreme precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently in future which can lead to sediment and freshwater pulses to coastal waters that quickly affect water quality understanding how coastal systems respond to and recover from such acute events is becoming more and more important particularly true in semi enclosed bays with weak water exchange and purification capacities such as jiaozhou bay jzb based on the three cruises performed on 17 july 5 and 22 august 2012 a coupled physical biological model was used to examine ecosystem responses in jzb to typhoon damrey an extreme precipitation event in order to study the mechanism behind rainfall induced changes three groups of sensitivity experiments were set to furtherly analyze the contributions of rivers and atmospheric deposition respectively the results showed that typhoon induced rainfall provided high concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip to phytoplankton which caused a remarkable chlorophyll a increase subsequently during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus inputs from river runoff were 1 80 and 2 14 times than that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the productivity than that supported by atmospheric deposition rainfall induced nutrient input will lead to blooms in coastal areas especially in semi enclosed bays since increased rainfall would trigger higher river discharge rivers became the main carriers of nutrients atmospheric deposition provided a low level supply and it was limited for alleviating phosphorus limitation in semi enclosed bays enhancing ecological monitoring of rivers and atmospheric deposition is urgent and essential to predict the response of ecosystems to extreme rainfall events keywords heavy rainfall physical biological modeling nutrition dynamics phytoplankton dynamics river runoff atmospheric deposition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme precipitation events are expected to occur more frequently under the ongoing global warming donat et al 2016 knight and davis 2009 min et al 2011 pfahl et al 2017 which is potentially a large driver of change in the ocean dramatically changing the hydrological conditions and pose increasing threats to ecosystems knapp et al 2008 especially in coastal areas cardoso et al 2008 weyhenmeyer et al 2004 it can cause excess freshwater input from rivers and transport large quantities of sediment to the nearshore area decreasing salinity of coastal water xia et al 2007 du et al 2019 liu et al 2020 and reducing water transparency over weeks zhang et al 2013 river discharge can cause significant heterogeneity in nutrients distribution at both the spatial and temporal scales xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 xia and jiang 2015 and the nutrients concentrations will increase with the increased river discharge michalak et al

significant role in controlling phytoplankton species diversity justić et al 1995a justić et al 1995b high nutrient inputs can lead to short and long term variations in productivity paerl et al 2006

cultural and ecologic health barbier et al 2011 moberg and folke 1999 white et al 2000 chlorophyll a concentration in the aquatic ecosystem can be used as one of the phytoplankton abundance indicators which is highly useful in assessing interactive effects of nutrient loading on phytoplankton production franklin et al 2020 paerl et al 2007 therefore it is critical to understand how precipitation influences nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations in coastal regions responses of the ocean to heavy rainfall events have attracted increasing attention worldwide e g chambers et al 2007 de carlo et al 2007 xia and jiang 2015 du et al 2017 some studies have found that heavy rainfall events increased surface nutrient concentrations michalak et al 2013 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 which caused subsequent phytoplankton blooms and high chlorophyll a concentration burkholder et al 2004 paerl et al 2006 2001 peierls et al 2003 wetz and paerl 2008 zhao et al 2009 high nutrient discharge is driven by enhanced river runoff and atmospheric deposition induced by rainfall acker 2005 guan et al 2007 however previous studies were mostly based on field observation which is not enough for the comprehensive investigation on the spatial temporal variation of nutrient phytoplankton dynamics chai et al 2009 because the systems are heterogeneous at relatively small spatial scales and it is difficult to interpolate and extrapolate limited in situ observations bocaniov and scavia 2018 and satellite based methods have not yet been developed for routinely measuring phytoplankton dynamics in shallow coastal and estuarine waters where the ocean color is confounded by suspended sediments dissolved organic matters and interference from land moreno madriñán and fischer 2013 cloern et al 2014 models are robust tools to solve this problem a coastal physical biological model was used to simulated the distribution of nutrients salinity and temperature and investigate the effects of river discharge and atmospheric winds on the spatial and temporal distributions in cape fear river and in perdido bay xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 given the ecological significance modeling assessment of biogeochemical processes and their driving mechanisms are highly necessary xia et al 2010 xia et al 2011 xia and jiang 2015 however there have been few studies about response of ecosystem to extreme precipitation events by numerical simulation to the author s knowledge there is only one relevant numerical study found yet mahlil et al 2020 built a depth averaged two dimensional ecological model in atsumi bay and found that high river discharges during rainfall altered nutrient concentrations throughout the bay and phytoplankton uptake of nutrients was highly correlated with phytoplankton growth although the model is applied to evaluate nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton growth in estuarine waterbodies it focused on the effect of large river inputs during rain events some questions such as the interactions of physical biological and chemical processes and the complex effects of these processes on biogenic elements phytoplankton growth and primary productivity still need to be addressed the relative effects of riverine and atmospheric input associated extreme precipitation events on the ecosystem are also unclear meanwhile the three dimensional physical biogeochemical model could better resolve the biophysical interactions nutrients and phytoplankton dynamics during extreme precipitations semi enclosed bays are vulnerable to extreme precipitation events due to constant eutrophication and weak water exchange xu et al 2010 jiaozhou bay jzb is a typical semi enclosed bay surrounded by the downtown of qingdao jiaozhou and huangdao district on three sides it is adjacent to the industrial and agricultural zones qdmbs 2017 heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities sun and sun 2015 with the increasing use of fossil fuels and agricultural fertilizers pollutants including sulfur nitrogen and heavy metals ultimately reach the marine environment via precipitation doney et al 2007 galloway 2005 galloway et al 2008 rodhe et al 2002 heavy rainfall events may increase the risk of eutrophication in jzb xing et al 2017a elevated rainfall and followed nutrient rich runoff contribute to the eutrophication potential of waters paerl et al 1999 and seem to coincide with blooms phlips et al 2004 therefore it is presumably an ideal region to study the variation of nutrient and chlorophyll a concentration in response to extreme precipitation events thus in this paper a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high resolution based on the unstructured grid finite volume community ocean model fvcom was developed to obtain a detailed understanding of biological response to a heavy rainfall event in a typical semi enclosed bay the major objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the biological response to the extreme precipitation event in the semi enclosed bay 2 to quantify the contributions of river input and atmospheric deposition to nutrients supply and chlorophyll concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1

rivers terminate around the coast dai et al 2006 these rivers have become discharge trenches for industrial and living wastes from qingdao city ren et al 2007 and carry large amounts of sediments and wastes into jzb liang et al 2015 the largest is the dagu river with an annual average runoff of 6 61 108 m3 ma et al 2021 the bay mouth is only about 2 5 km wide connecting to the south yellow sea ke

shandong on 2 august 2012 bringing heavy rain and strong wind to the cities along the route fig 1 a jzb was hit by heavy rain from 2 to 3 august with an average precipitation of more than 69 9 mm the observation data is collected by ocean university of china in the summer on 17 july 15 days before the rainfall 5 and 22 august zhang et al 2016 including 22 stations fig 1b the main inorganic nitrogen concentration no3 n no2 n nh3 n and po4 p temperature salinity and chlorophyll a were monitored according to the chinese national specification for marine monitoring part 4 seawater analysis gb 17378 4 2007 the river hydrological stations located at the estuary of haibo river licun river loushan river moshui river dagu river yang river and lianwan river wet deposition samples were collected at the top of mountain baguan no 5 yushan road qingdao more details about the observation data and determined methods can be found in zhang et al 2016 2 3 numerical model setup a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high spatial and temporal resolution was developed based on the fvcom version 3 22 which has been used to study the tidal dynamics and suspended sediment dynamics in jzb in our previous studies gao et al 2014 gao et al 2018a gao et al 2018b meanwhile a nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model was added considering the main ecological elements the unstructured triangular grids consist 3691 nodes and 6922 elements the average spatial resolution is approximately 500 m the water column is vertically divided into six layers using a sigma coordinate we introduce the basic structure of the biogeochemical model here and for more details please refer to li et al 2015 they have developed a 3d water quality model the estuarine coastal and ocean modeling system with sediments to determine the environmental capacity of nitrogen and phosphorus in jzb the coupling process in the model was similar with some previous studies such as xia and jiang 2016 seven state variables were considered in the model dissolved inorganic nitrogen din dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorus dop phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus diatoms were the dominant species of phytoplankton as known by the historical data and the bioassay in this study and copepod were the dominant zooplankton the basic structure of the set of model control equations can be briefly summarized by the following equation 1 c i t p h y s i c s c i b i o l o g y c i c h e m i s t r y c i c i represents the concentration of each ecological variable this equation indicates that the local variation of ecological variables is controlled by a combination of the relevant physical and biochemical process terms physical processes include processes such as advection diffusion and the riverine and atmospheric input the advection and diffusion of each ecological variable is synchronized with the temperature and salt fields and takes the same form the physical process term is expressed specifically as 2 physics c i v c i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k v c i z s i v c i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k v c i z and s i are the advection turbulent diffusion and source sink terms respectively k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients respectively in this model we used the smagorinsky eddy parameterization method smagorinsky 1963 to calculate the horizontal diffusion coefficient and the mellor and yamada 1982 2 5 level turbulent closure model for the vertical eddy viscosity and the thermal diffusion coefficient details of the equations and parameters of the physical biogeochemical model can be found in the appendix the hydrodynamics model was forced by tidal elevations the harmonic constants were derived from the tpxo global model of ocean tides at the open boundary and wind field data were from the observations provided by weather stations in jzb the flux of rivers was provided by qingdao water conservancy bureau and the terrigenous discharge fluxes were provided by qingdao municipal bureau of ecology and environment the input of nutrient concentration was obtained by the cruise observation and soil water tool assessment the heat flux was collected from the reanalysis data provided by national centers for environmental prediction the initial field was provided by field observations before the rainfall event 2 4 sensitivity experiments to better understand the complex mechanism behind ecosystem response to extreme precipitation events a set of sensitivity experiments se 1 was conducted to investigate the role of rainfall induced river runoff and atmospheric deposition in in nutrients cycling and chlorophyll a dynamics the nutrient concentrations in the various sensitivity experiments allow us to quantify imported fluxes and understand the processes involved river inputs caused by the heavy rainfall were excluded in se 1 1 and atmospheric deposition was excluded in se 1 2 both river inputs and atmospheric deposition were excluded in se 1 3 table 1 se 2 was conducted to investigate how increased river flow affects water exchange thus different nutrients flux inputs by rivers were set in se 2 1 se 2 2 se 2 3 and se 2 4 table 1 respectively the river fluxes remained constant but the nutrient concentration carried by river was changed taking the reference experiment re as the standard the nutrients flux of se 2 1 was 0 times than that of the re similarly the nutrients flux input by river of se 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 was 0 5 2 and 5 times than that of the re respectively 3 results 3 1 model verification the hydrodynamic environment in jzb is dominated by the tides physical models were used previously to study the effects of land reclamation on tidal dynamics in jzb the hydrodynamics sediment model was used previously to study the effects of land reclamation on tidal dynamics in jzb gao et al 2014 and on suspended sediment dynamics when waves were negligible gao et al 2018a it was also used to study the effect of each wave current interaction mechanism gao et al 2018b the model was thoroughly calibrated and applied in these studies the model tidal ellipse harmonic parameters for the dominant m2 tide had been compared with the field observations gao et al 2014 the mean errors of the m2 tide semi major axis semi minor axis inclination and phase averaged over the six different stations and the surface middle and bottom layers were 3 0 cm s 1 1 2 cm s 1 5 6 and 6 6 respectively the results of skill scores ss and correlation coefficients cc for field data showed that the model can used with good confidence for example the ss and cc are 0 94 0 96 0 86 0 89 and 0 71 0 78 for water elevations eastward velocities and northward velocities respectively gao et al 2017 it then gave us confidence for simulate the advection and diffusion processes of nutrients and chlorophyll a reasonably the numerical modeling experiments successfully captured the heavy rainfall event and reproduced the regional din dip chlorophyll a salinity and temperature with the root mean square error of 13 61 μmol l 0 57 μmol l 3 00 μg l 1 06 psu and 1 18 c respectively table 2 the discrepancies between model results and observations may arise from the timing mismatch between the daily averaged model data and instantaneous observation data it also can be seen from fig 2 and fig 3 that the modeled and measured values of din dip chlorophyll a salinity and temperature in jzb are fairly similar therefore it indicates that the physical biological model well captures the response of nutrients and chlorophyll a to the extreme precipitation event it enhances the confidence to investigate underlying mechanisms the blank areas near the northwestern part of the jzb coast is the tidal flat it is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide which was also blanked in previous studies gao et al 2014 gao et al 2018a gao et al 2018b qu et al 2020 li et al 2020 3 1 1 distribution of major nutrients and chlorophyll a before the heavy rainfall the din in jzb fluctuated in the range of 7 93 46 47 μmol l with an average of 23 00 μmol l and the dip ranged from 0 31 to 1 96 μmol l with an average of 0 69 μmol l high values of din and dip were observed in the northeast of jzb fig 2 the northeastern region is adjacent to downtown qingdao and three large wastewater treatment plants are located in the estuaries along the eastern coast in addition the capacity of water exchange in the east is weaker than that in the west shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 which is conducive to the retention of nutrients chlorophyll a varied from 1 04 to 6 38 μg l mean 3 32 μg l before the event and gradually decreased from the bay bottom to the mouth the salinity and temperature were in the range of 28 66 30 86 psu and 22 63 25 07 c respectively fig 3 one day after the rainfall precipitation resulted in higher concentrations of din and dip and a more significant increase was in dip concentration the mean concentration of din increased by 37 5 from 10 06 to 120 72 μmol l and the mean concentration of dip increased by 81 1 from 0 45 to 4 89 μmol l the heavy rainfall event led to a significant increase in surface runoff and terrestrial input resulting in significant increases in din and dip fluxes into jzb indicating that the rainfall process was generally accompanied by an increase in nutrient concentrations in a short period chlorophyll a ranged from 0 11 0 87 μg l with an average value of 0 44 μg l and concentration in surface water was considerably low in the whole jzb fig 2 the mean value of salinity dropped 0 41 psu but the mean value of temperature rose almost 2 55 c 18 days after the rainfall event din and dip decreased compared to the concentrations 1 day after the rainfall with the average value of 23 94 μmol l range 11 16 61 49 μmol l and 0 98 μmol l range 0 49 2 94 μmol l respectively fig 2 while chlorophyll a gradually increased from 0 31 to 8 23 μg l mean 2 58 μg l which is closely associated with abundant nutrients the rainfall induced high nutrient concentration enhanced phytoplankton growth triggered an increase of chlorophyll a and then consumed in the progress of phytoplankton growth the average salinity showed little change but the mean value of temperature dropped 1 85 c fig 3 3 1 2 temporal variation of major nutrients and chlorophyll a furthermore in order to analyze the effect of the heavy rainfall event on the variation of biogenic elements model simulated time series of din dip and chlorophyll a concentrations were plotted fig 4 din increased by an order of magnitude within 24 h after the rainfall and reached a maximum before it declined indicating that heavy rain is a crucial contributor to the increased fluxes of nitrogen the variation of dip had the same trend as the variation in din the peak value of dip appeared when rainfall emerged with the peak flow and almost at the same time with the peak of the din concentration chlorophyll a declined continuously before the heavy rainfall with the concentration dropped from an initial level of 3 3 μg l to the level around 0 8 μg l the decline was related to a rainfall event occurred in the upper reaches of rivers before 17 july fig 1 and resulted in higher chlorophyll a concentrations than normal concentrations after this rainfall event nutrient levels are insufficient to maintain the high concentration thus the chlorophyll a concentration gradually decreased and dropped to a low level before typhoon damrey previous study also found that the average of chlorophyll a in the study area were not very high in 2012 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 which supported our simulation after the extreme rainfall event associated with typhoon damery chlorophyll a increased slightly and slowly and a rapid increase was observed 7 10 days after the heavy rainfall the effect of the heavy rainfall event on chlorophyll a may be delayed probably due to the time needed for phytoplankton growth the post rainfall period was divided into four periods according to the growth rate of chlorophyll a fig 4 termed period i nutrient accumulation ii rapid chlorophyll a increase iii high chlorophyll and low nutrient and iv poor nutrition during the period i rainfall induced runoff inputs and atmospheric deposition significantly increased concentrations of nutrients with a slight increase of chlorophyll a during period ii high nutrient concentration stimulated phytoplankton growth leading to a rapid increase in chlorophyll a during period iii phytoplankton consumed nutrients and lea to a low level of nutrients but a high level of chlorophyll a when chlorophyll a concentration was steady during period iv phytoplankton was in a nutrient poor environment with a decrease in chlorophyll a concentration 3 2 experiments on source identifications the average din of the experiment without river runoff decreased by 45 3 mean 17 30 μmol l max 26 39 μmol l min 9 78 μmol l compared to the re mean 31 62 μmol l max 120 72 μmol l min 10 06 μmol l on 5 august followed by 22 august mean 10 71 μmol l max 14 50 μmol l min 8 86 μmol l when the average din decreased by 55 3 fig 5 the exclusion of runoff resulted in significantly reduced din concentration the concentration of din was close to zero on 22 august obviously different from the re however there was no obvious difference in din between the experiment without atmospheric deposition and the reference experiment the average din concentration only decreased by 6 2 mean 29 65 μmol l max 119 08 μmol l min 9 38 μmol l on 5 august and decreased by 8 0 mean 22 02 μmol l max 62 68 μmol l min 10 03 μmol l on 22 august the spatial distribution also showed an insignificant difference yet it was noteworthy that there was a difference on 22 august between the sensitivity experiment and reference experiment the contour line of din in the central area shifted northward slightly and the concentration decreased slightly suggesting that atmospheric deposition may enhance din concentration in the central region of jzb when runoff and atmospheric deposition were all not included the average din decreased by 44 1 on 5 august mean 17 67 μmol l max 27 21 μmol l min 9 68 μmol l and decreased by 54 7 on 22 august mean 10 85 μmol l max 13 77 μmol l min 8 90 μmol l compared with the re in general the result of exp 1 3 without river runoff and atmospheric deposition was highly similar to the result of exp 1 1 only without river runoff suggesting that rainfall induced river runoff was undoubtedly the dominant source of din in jzb although atmospheric deposition was also recognized as a nutrients source to ecosystems it was not a substantial source of din relative to river discharge fueled by precipitation it also could be found that river input was the predominant source of dip fig 6 and chlorophyll a fig 7 this pattern of higher concentrations when flow was highest was common in estuaries where dip was transported in river from its terrestrial source and rainfall took an increase of surface runoff similarly when the input of atmosphere deposition was not considered a slight decline of dip concentration could be observed in the central region the higher dip tongue that extended seaward disappeared indicating that atmosphere deposition maybe an important source of dip in the offshore area the time series of the mean din dip and chlorophyll a of the re and se also suggested that the high concentrations of main biological elements were related to the pulse input caused by the heavy rainfall fig 8 when rainfall induced river input was excluded the heavy rainfall had a limited impact on the ecosystem in jzb and nutrients and chlorophyll a showed little response to it 3 3 experiments on the variation of nutrients fluxes through river the sensitivity experiments showed that the rivers were the main carriers of nutrients during the heavy rainfall event whereas atmospheric deposition played only a supplementary role thus the second set of analyses was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to different nutrient fluxes of surface runoff an increase in concentration was observed in the riverine influenced area of the estuary and the contour line expanded toward the mouth gradually with the gradual increases in terrigenous nutrients input figs 9 11 when the nutrients flux input by rivers were 0 and 50 of the nutrient flux of the re the average din concentration on 5 august decreased by 41 5 and 20 8 mean 18 49 μmol l 25 06 μmol l respectively and on 22 august decreased by 48 4 and 24 4 mean 12 36 μmol l 18 10 μmol l respectively when the nutrients flux of river discharge was 2 and 5 times the average din concentration on 5 august increased by 40 2 and 160 8 mean 44 33 μmol l 82 47 μmol l respectively and on 22 august increased by 50 and 204 4 35 91 μmol l 72 87 μmol l respectively similarly an increase in dip and chlorophyll a concentration also could be observed with the increase of river nutrients fluxes tables s7 and s8 a series of experiments with varying surface flux demonstrated that the concentration of din and dip increased corresponding to the enhanced nutrient fluxes of river input although the nutrients remained a tendency of decreasing from the inshore to offshore when the nutrients fluxes of river input were increased a strong spatial gradient could be observed compared with the re the enhanced terrestrial input contributed to a higher concentration of nutrients with the spatial gradient increased because the variation of chlorophyll a was strongly correlated with nutrient concentrations fulton et al 2015 the increase in nutrient fluxes would be of significant importance to chlorophyll a and would lead to a more uneven distribution when higher intensity rainfall events appeared with global warming and then induced an increase of nutrients input by rivers the din dip and chlorophyll a concentrations will greatly be boosted and so will the spatial gradient 4 discussion 4 1 impact of heavy rain on din and dip influenced by the extreme precipitation event din and dip rose sharply and immediately after the rainfall event and then decreased in the following days fig 2 the significant increases were probably due to the high intensity and long duration of the heavy rainfall brought by typhoon damrey which led to a significant increase in land load of nutrients as well as intensified deposition of nutrients from the atmosphere specifically strong scouring and disturbance of the flood waters aggravated the loss of nitrogen especially phosphorus from the sediments in the ditches and rivers leading to an increase in runoff and nutrient levels the decrease of nutrients following the heavy rainfall was possibly due to biological uptake and water exchange between jzb and the yellow sea although nutrient levels inside jzb may be influenced to some extent by the exchange with the yellow sea the water exchange capacity was limited because of the quite narrow mouth only 7 of the total amount of water in jzb is exchanged per tidal cycle liu et al 2004 and the flushing time for the water in jzb at high tide is 28 days and at low tide is 43 days liu et al 2012 the average residence time is about 52 days liu et al 2004 which is longer than the rainy duration 2 days in this study and is over 37 simulated days after the rainfall event thus water exchange played a relatively minor role in nutrients decrease furthermore the limited exchange capacity indicated the weakness of capability to transport nutrients from the inside to outside of jzb precipitation induced especially sudden heavy rainfall short term and large amounts of nutrients input will bring jzb to the risk of eutrophication the heavy rainfall event changed the distribution pattern of nutrients in jzb before the rainfall higher din and dip concentration was in the northeast where the water exchange capacity was weak shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 therefore hydrodynamic conditions were conducive to the accumulation of nutrients and phytoplankton growth phytoplankton also obtained lots of organic pollutants in long term and the coastal rivers flowed through human intensive areas with urbanization the eastern coastal estuaries had become conduits of wastewater carrying 75 of the city sewage into jzb gao et al 2008 sewage direct input and intense respiration led to the northeast acting as a strong source of nutrients in contrast the impact of urbanization in the west was weaker and the natural ecosystem was healthier yuan et al 2016 thus the highest din and dip values were in the northeast after the rainfall the difference between the northeast and northwest was not significant because the heavy rainfall event promoted river input in the western and eastern portions of jzb simultaneously before the rainfall event being consistent with observation the mean n p ratios were mostly above 25 and it is above the redfield value 16 1 suggesting a comparative n abundance and p limitation status the high n p ratio was found in the area near tuan dao wastewater treatment plants and dagu river basin the heavy rainfall event did not instantly alter n p which increased significantly after 20 days compared with the temporal variation of din dip and chlorophyll a illustrated in fig 12 the increase of n p lagged behind the changes in chlorophyll a which indicated that the consumption of nutrients by high phytoplankton mass may trigger an increase of n p and ultimately caused phosphorus limitation in surface water during period iii the growth rate of chlorophyll a decreased in response to enhanced phosphorus limitation the spatial distribution of n p also changed with the high ratio appearing in nearshore areas fig 12e which was similar to fig 2r it indicated that the heavy rainfall event inducing nutrients input had no discernible effect on n p but high nutrients aggregated phytoplankton growth which enhanced phosphorus limitation in jzb especially in nearshore areas rainfall indirectly changed the nutrient structure and may ultimately affect the biological community composition 4 2 impact of heavy rain on phytoplankton growth before the rainfall event chlorophyll a decreased suggesting nutrient availability was not sufficient to sustain phytoplankton growth rates precipitation enhanced river input causing a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus substances to be released into the water meanwhile n p ratio was about 25 close to the redfield values which provided suitable conditions for phytoplankton growth thus the heavy rainfall event brought another explosive phytoplankton growth and ultimately led to an increase in chlorophyll a concentration and significantly exceeded pre rainfall levels a phytoplankton bloom exceeding 10 μg l was generated in the nearshore area fig 13 it can be concluded that the heavy rainfall and induced runoff from the land delivered large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus into the water which was likely to induce a bloom in a semi enclosed bay the occurrence of bloom showed regional differences and the more serious bloom located in the northeast where nutrient concentration was also higher the peak value of chlorophyll a was higher in the northeast and the time required to reach its peak was longer the longer term was probably because the nutrient level in the northeast was much higher the higher nutrient concentration the longer phytoplankton growing period naturally resulting in a higher peak moreover the weaker water exchange capacity in the region shi et al 2011 yuan et al 2021 induced phytoplankton gathering which resulted in a longer period of phytoplankton growth li et al 2017 found strong primary production in the west however a lower level of nutrients could be found in the northeast compared to those in the northeast fig 2 the strong primary production and lower nutrient concentration may lead to a significant reduction of time to the peak value in the northwest 4 3 contributions of increased river runoff and atmospheric deposition induced by heavy rainfall the se 2 indicated that the majority of increased nutrient concentrations were attributed to inputs from rainfall induced river runoff accounting for a higher percentage of the total external inputs of nutrients in jzb during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus input from river runoff were 1 80 and 2 14 times that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the increase of chlorophyll a concentration than that supported by atmospheric deposition that was partially due to many rivers in the study area and rainfall induced relatively high runoff although rainfall induced atmospheric deposition represented a low level of fertilization effect in the whole bay it played a role in nutrients supplement and caused a wide range effect on the area relatively far from the shore such as the central bay where the effects of river input weakened significantly as the distance increases after the rainfall event the nutrients emissions into jzb were dominated by rainfall induced river runoff indicating the major source of nutrients in jzb was terrigenous discharge and more attention should be paid to the environmental assessment and management nutrient loadings by river runoff and atmosphere deposition produce a lag increase in the n p ratio of bay waters fig 14 when the river input was excluded the n p ratio had been declining significantly whereas the n p ratio was almost the same when the atmosphere deposition was excluded it indicated that rainfall induced river runoff was the main factor causing the variation of the n p ratio because rainfall induced river runoff was the predominant source of nutrients as we noted above in the environments without nutrients input from atmospheric deposition phytoplankton growth seemed to cause more severely p limited conditions and the n p ratio finally reached a higher peak it suggested that the n p ratio of atmospheric deposition has a limited but important impact in the long term for alleviating phosphorus limitation in jzb the alleviating contribution tended to be larger one month after the heavy rainfall event the line representing the n p ratio of re the green line was always between the blue line experiment with no atmosphere deposition and the orange line experiment with no river runoff suggesting that the effects of river runoff and atmosphere deposition on the n p ration were opposite because of their different composition of nutrients 5 conclusions extreme precipitation events are rare but likely to occur more frequently under the warming climate this study took the extreme precipitation event during typhoon damrey as an example to examine how the short term heavy rain affected the ecosystem in a semi enclosed bay region based on the bay scale observation of three voyages from july to august 2012 the concentration of important biogenic elements and chlorophyll a were obtained before and after the rainfall event we have successfully simulated the nutrients dynamics and chlorophyll a dynamics during the heavy rainfall event using a three dimensional physical biological coupled model with high resolution configured for jzb the model can also be used for biogeochemical simulations during future extreme weather events ecological responses were well reproduced by the coupled physical biological model nutrients din and dip and chlorophyll a exhibited remarkable changes in response to the heavy rainfall event one day after the rainfall event the precipitation enhanced riverine input and atmospheric deposition caused an increase in din and dip after 7 10 days chlorophyll a concentration rose in response to high nutrient concentration which also caused a decrease of nutrients as it rises rainfall induced nutrient input will lead to blooms in semi enclosed bays especially in nearshore area where the water residence time is long temporal variation of the nutrient stoichiometric ratios induced by the heavy rainfall event was investigated after 20 days the n p ratio increased significantly behind the variation of chlorophyll a the heavy rainfall event did not alter n p directly but it induced a large amount of nutrients input which aggregated phytoplankton growth and enhanced phosphorus limitation in jzb indirectly the difference in nutrient composition resulted in that the effect of river runoff and atmosphere deposition to the n p ratio in jzb was opposite during the extreme precipitation event the contributions of river runoff and atmosphere deposition were quantified the majority of increased nutrients were attributed to the rainfall induced river runoff din dip and chlorophyll a all increased following the increase of riverine nutrients flux during the heavy rainfall event the nitrogen and phosphorus input from rivers were 1 80 and 2 14 times that from atmospheric deposition respectively river inputs supported 2 14 times the productivity than that supported by atmospheric deposition our findings extended past research and pointed that the frequent occurrence of extreme precipitation events likely caused an increase in the occurrence of blooms especially in the semi enclosed bay which were easily impacted by anthropogenic activities the impacts of future extreme precipitation events may be even more devastating to estuarine water quality than anticipated as more human derived pollutants will be discharged to coastal waters especially in areas with development and increasing populations wiegner et al 2013 reducing the discharge of human produced sewage and effective coastal management may be the critical factors in avoiding eutrophication in addition enhancing

2357,dew as an important contribution of non rainfall water nrw is found to be an important hydrological component for ecosystem water stress alleviation and further ecosystem functions maintenance during rainless seasons the north china plain ncp is facing severe water shortage mainly due to intensive agricultural irrigation however few studies have examined the variations and controlling mechanism of dew in the typical croplands predisposed to drought here seasonal variation in dew was examined during growing period in a wheat and maize rotation cropland in the ncp over 3 years 2008 2010 based on the eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux le during nighttime and the ecosystem drought was defined to occur when the relative extractable water content rew in the soil dropped below 0 4 results showed that annual from april to september mean dew amount for this cropland was 7 61 0 02 mm accounting for 2 5 of precipitation ppt and the annual mean dew amount during drought period was 3 11 mm accounting for 3 4 of ppt seasonal variation in dew was mainly regulated by relative humidity rh and surface stomatal conductance gs furthermore dew was influenced by gs and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the wheat growing period and by gs during maize growing period 51 1 72 0 of drought events occurred during wheat growing season compared to maize growing season with higher nocturnal evapotranspiration etn the higher frequency of dew occurrence during wheat growing season had reduced the etn amount drought timing duration and degree together influenced dew amount long term drought e g 1 month drought would induce an increase of dew amount after drought period our findings clarified the temporal dynamics in dew across different crop growing periods such as wheat and maize and contribute to the sustainable utilization of non rainfall water especially dew in cropland in the context of extreme climate such as droughts in the future keywords biophysical control dew drought eddy covariance cropland the north china plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction undoubtedly rainfall is the major water input form for most ecosystems in the world and is essential for maintaining ecosystem functions kaseke and wang 2018 riedl et al 2022 wang et al 2016 however in dry environments with low precipitation ppt dew as an important component of non rainfall water nrw constitutes a constant water resource for the ecological processes of plants animals and microorganisms agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2016 feng et al 2021 guo et al 2022 kidron et al 2002 kidron and starinsky 2019 dew also influence the magnitude of water and energy flux and ecological processes during the ecosystem water stress beysens 2006 dew can increase the leaf water content through foliar water uptakes dew evaporation can suppress transpiration facilitate carbon assimilation and shows a positive influence on the water use efficiency wue of during water stress gerlein safdi et al 2018 oliveira et al 2021 tian et al 2021 studies also showed that dew water has emerged as means to meet supplement irrigation demand for reforestation and agriculture in water scarcely regions gao et al 2020b jacobs et al 2006 liu et al 2020a tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 globally cropland dependent on irrigation provide 40 of food production by consuming about 90 of the global fresh water supply of which 43 is from groundwater pei et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 2013 xiao et al 2017 the over exploitation of groundwater high water demand of intensive agriculture and extreme droughts events intensify the water shortage in regions where annual evaporative water loss exceeds annual ppt huang et al 2016 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2021 in dryland a key strategy for maintaining crop yields without over exploitation the scarce water resource is by increasing wue of plants daryanto et al 2017 therefore more attention should be focused on the utilization of dew in the croplands except for the great many studies reported the effects of dew on a variety of croplands cosh et al 2009 kabela et al 2009 meng and wen 2016 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 xu et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2021 its inter annual seasonal characteristics and biophysical controlling mechanisms remain unclear previous studies reported that dew amount was positively correlated with relative humidity rh and air temperature ta guo et al 2016 lekouch et al 2012 ye et al 2007 and increased with wind speed ws before a threshold of 4 4 m s 1 beysens 2016 and decreased when the ws became larger beysens 2018 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 ppt can affect dew through the direct impact on water vapor from soil i e soil volumetric water content swc or in the air represented by rh high swc would facilitate soil evaporation which would contribute high humidity in the air the warming of solar radiation on surface determines the termination of dew formation besides the biotic factors can also show influence on dew formation incomplete surface stomatal conductance gs at nighttime would facilitate the dew water uptake through leaves and supports a non trivial level of transpiration caird et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 hayat et al 2021a snyder et al 2003 furthermore the species variation might cause the difference in leaf temperature and thus the difference in condensation rate variations of dew and its response to biophysical variables may vary among plant species and landscapes due to the different living strategies of plants and the microclimate hayat et al 2021b furthermore it is also different at multiple timescales and special period e g drought due to the human intervention in agriculture land use in the context of climate change therefore a multiple temporal scales analysis of biophysical control mechanisms of dew formation in cropland is needed guo et al 2021 field measurements and models have been used to quantify dew guo et al 2016 field measurements based on weighing dew gauges lysimeters and leaf wetness sensors can detect dew formation at plant level or small scale cosh et al 2009 duvdevani 1947 gao et al 2020a pan et al 2010 zangvil 1996 however the eddy covariance ec method allows for continuous long term measurements of latent heat flux le papale et al 2006 and has been applied to the examination of dew dynamics on ecosystem scale hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 ec measurements usually underestimate the flux during night with low turbulence so carefully outliers eliminating and gaps filling can ensure the accuracy there are empirical and analytical models used for dew estimation tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 penman monteith model as a typical analytical model has the advantage of considering both the physiological and physical regulators of dew which can be used to estimate dew and fill gaps in ec measurement however novick et al 2009 has evaluated the main models for filling gaps in nocturnal water flux and concluded that the marginal distribution sampling mds method was best for it can explore the covariations between le and meteorological factors and their temporal autocorrelation based on the methods of look up tables lut and mean diurnal course mdc and has been widely used novick et al 2009 wutzler et al 2018 the north china plain ncp is one of the main grain production base of china accounting for 25 of wheat and 18 of maize production over 2002 2011 and winter wheat summer maize cropland accounts for about 55 of the ncp zhang et al 2019 the ncp is also one of the regions facing serious water shortage problem min et al 2018 pei et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 yuan and shen 2013 due to the mismatch between ppt and solar thermal resources in the ncp liu et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 the 420 mm yr 1 of average crop water demand substantially exceeds the average annual ppt of 280 mm yr 1 during winter wheat growing period shen et al 2013 sun et al 2010 and thus 140 mm yr 1 of water needs to be irrigated to guarantee the high crop yield approximately 75 of the total agricultural water use come from groundwater sun et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 which is the primary reason that led to the groundwater over exploitation liu et al 2020b sun et al 2021 to resolve this problem more attention should be concentrated on the water resource utilization efficiency improvement besides other freshwater input such as dew should be evaluated however the characteristics of dew formation and its controlling mechanisms have not been fully understood in the typical wheat maize cropland in the ncp in this study we measured water vapor fluxes over a wheat maize rotation cropland in the ncp over three year period 2008 2010 with eddy covariance ec technique zhang et al 2020 the 3 year dataset provides opportunity to investigate site characteristics of dew formation and its relevance to drought the specific objectives of our study were to 1 examine the dynamics of dew at multiple temporal scales i e daily monthly and seasonally 2 determine the controlling variables in dew formation at seasonal and during wheat and maize growing period respectively and 3 evaluate the response of dew to drought and its effect on nocturnal evapotranspiration we hypothesized that 1 dew in different crops growing period was mostly controlled by rh and gs 2 drought would induce the increase of dew and dew would reduce evapotranspiration and relief water stress our results will enhance the understanding of the biophysical controls of dew formation in agriculture in the context of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions field datasets were collected at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station lca 37 53 n 114 41 e elevation 50 1 m a s l which is 25 km

global terrestrial observing system zhang et al 2013 the climate of the region is semi humid and semi arid with a long winter from november to february and a short spring from march to april bao et al 2022 the air temperature in the lca ranged from 3 3 c in january to 26 5 c in july with average annual air temperature of 12 8 c 1990 2008 shen et al 2013 the mean annual pan evapotranspiration was

september while relatively little ppt occurred in march may when winter wheat grows rapidly shen et al 2013 the measurement periods cover extremely high annual precipitation amount 598 mm in 2008 and low amount 366 mm in 2010 compared with the mean annual precipitation range relative to the past 30 years rotation of winter wheat and summer maize dominates agricultural activities in the lca the growing season of winter wheat is from early october to mid june of the coming year summer maize is sowed at the end of winter wheat growing season and harvested in late september pei et al 2017 irrigation ranged from 130 to 330 mm annually during the study with irrigation applications concentrated during the winter wheat season to compensate the low seasonal precipitation the groundwater table depth has decreased dramatically from 11 m in 1975 to 47 m in 2015 representing a draw down rate of approximately 0 9 m per year influenced by the irrigations during the period from march to june the water table depth goes down and then rises after the monsoon season from june to august due to the ppt recharge pei et al 2017 the soil type of lca is silt loam with a field capacity of 35

gateway were used to characterize vegetation cover including its density and greenness ma et al 2019 the daily energy balance closure ebc in our study ranged from 0 84 to 0 99 and the nighttime ebc showed an acceptable energy closure fraction of about 68 slope 0 68 r2 0 88 which falls in the range of 0 55 0 99 reported for fluxnet guo et al 2016 we judged that the range of the ebc from our data is satisfactory for analysis 2 3 data qa qc and gap filling all of the 10 hz turbulence measurements were used to calculate half hourly water vapor heat and co2 fluxes the mad test median of absolute deviation was applied to eliminate some outliers spikes from the data selected and then the spike test was used oliveira et al 2021 papale et al 2006 the mad test was first applied to co2 flux data by papale et al 2006 and first used for despiking raw ec data by mauder et al 2013 mauder et al 2013 the mad test identified as outlier all values that outside the following range 1 m e d i a n x qmad 0 6745 x i m e d i a n x qmad 0 6745 where the factor of 0 6745 stems from the gaussian distribution and q is a threshold value that must be determined depending on the specific data set while mad test is used when the measured values to be examined scatter only slightly around a mean value the spike test is used for more scattering data the spike test was used in the final stage of data processing during which it determines the sd standard deviation of the entire data set and excludes all values that deviate by a multiple of the sd oliveira et al 2021 instrument failure and maintenance resulted in 6 6 27 7 and 22 3 missing records of flux data in 2008 2010 respectively the data lost to spike eliminating resulted in 2 8 3 2 and 2 0 missing records in 2008 2010 respectively the friction velocity u threshold was used to eliminate inaccurate flux especially during night schmidt walter et al 2020 the determination of u thresholds were conducted using the fluxnet method reddyproc package in r 4 1 0 in order to retain relatively more nightly data for exploring the biophysical controlling mechanisms finally the u over the three year period were 0 07 0 06 and 0 05 m s 1 which were led to 50 2 55 7 and 45 3 of total nighttime data being gap filled from 2008 to 2010 respectively gaps of less than 2 h in h2o vapor fluxes and all other variables were filled by linear interpolation longer gaps in h2o vapor fluxes were filled by mds method liu et al 2022 wutzler et al 2018 missing data in temperature and ppt were obtained from an automatic weather station about 200 m distant away from the flux tower longer gaps of vapor pressure in 2009 and 2010 which was not recorded by the field automatic weather station were filled by using the hourly values measured at the luancheng meteorological station close by longer gaps less than 14 days in other meteorological variables were filled by the mdc method falge et al 2001 and for missing flux data that extended beyond 14 days daily mean values from different years were used to calculate and fill gaps 2 4 dew and nocturnal evapotranspiration negative latent heat flux at night was used to estimate dew however the le data around sunrise needs to be carefully interpreted for the entrainment of air from free troposphere might cause a peak of negative le but this does not mean stronger condensation therefore the daytime and nighttime le flux was distinguished by par at the conservative threshold of 5 µmol m 2 s 1 guo et al 2016 the positive values of hourly le at night were considered as nocturnal evapotranspiration etn the negative le at night par 5 µmol m 2 s 1 and together when ts was below the dew point temperature td was considered as dew besides the half hourly amount of dew were eliminated during half hourly rainfall 0 and furthermore hourly amount of dew were limited by the maximum rate of 0 07 mm h 1 during clear nights groh et al 2018 monteith and unsworth 2013 the rate of dew or etn was then estimated as 2 e le λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 kj kg 1 the dew point temperature was calculated using the magnus tetens approximation method lawrence 2005 as 3 t d b γ t a r h a

7 rew vwc vwc min vwc max vwc min where vwcmin and vwcmax are the minimum and maximum soil volumetric water content during the observation period in each year according to the definition of long and short term drought and the actual situation at our study site we defined long term droughts whenever rew 0 4 occurred for more than one month whereas periods with rew 0 4 for less than one month were classified as short term droughts ma et al 2019 2 6 dew amount verification the leaf wetness sensor lws was used as in situ measurement of dew to verify the day dew amount obtained from the ec data three lwss were plated 2 0 m in maize cropland from 1 august to 12 september in 2021 the voltage recorded by lws was calibrated and converted into amount of condensation followed the method by guo et al 2022 as lws can not only be used for monitoring the duration of dew but also for calculating the amount of dew guo et al 2022 the days with rainfall was excluded finally there are 34 events of daily dew amount were selected for comparison with ec obtained values the pear correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and relative error bias were selected in the present study for accuracy verification 2 7 growing season and statistical analysis the whole growing season of wheat was not considered in our research we take april september as the growing season including the main growing period of wheat i e jointing heading milking and maturity periods from april 1 to june 15 and the whole growing period of maize from june 16 to september 30 li et al 2017 the growing period of wheat and maize from april to september over 2008 to 2010 was detailed descripted in table 1 linear quadratic and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the effects of biophysical effects i

describe the correlation between biophysical factors and dew daily values of ndvi were derived by linearly interpolating measurements response variables were bin averaged prior to regression ma et al 2018 linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between vpd and gs during drought periods in order to explore the relationship between dew and gs during drought period vpds were divided into two datasets by the threshold of 1 0 kpa regression significance was evaluated using the f statistic at a significance level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 biophysical factors during the observation

increased from spring to summer and then decreased in autumn which ranged from 4 1 c on 30 september in 2008 to 29 4 c on 30 july in 2010 mean ta during growing season over the three years was slightly higher in 2010 with the mean value of 20 1 c the growing season mean nocturnal vpd was highest in 2010 0 8 kpa and lowest in 2008 0 3 kpa vpd was highest in june table 2 rh showed contrary tendency with vpd with the range of nocturnal mean in the years 2008 2010 were 31 5 97 5 33 5 96 0 29 4 83 5 respectively fig 3b ws exhibited higher rate in spring and summer and stayed at a relative lower rate in autumn fig 3c with the highest value of 6 7 ms 1 in the april of 2010 soil volumetric water content at 20 cm swc 20 and 40 cm swc 40 showed similar variations which were both influenced by ppt however swc 20 was more affected by ppt events which were less than 20 mm day 1 and swc 40 responded mainly to ppt events larger than 20 mm day 1 fig 3d both the nocturnal mean swc 20 and swc 40 at night were highest in 2009 and were lowest in 2008 table 2 the total ppt amount during april to september from 2008 to 2010 was 53 55 and 85 in annual ppt amount respectively the ppt amounts over april june were 118 0 mm 103 7 mm and 24 8 mm which were accounted for 37 4 35 3 and 8 0 of the growing season over the three years respectively it seemed that wheat growing period lived through a relatively less ppt amount than maize growing period and this phenomenon was more obvious in 2010 the gs exhibited double peaks during the growing season that one peak usually occurred at the jointing and heading stage of wheat growing period and the other occurred at heading and flowering stage of maize growing period fig 3e the annual mean nocturnal gs over the growing season period was highest in 2008 2 8 mm s 1 and lowest in 2010 0 9 mm s 1 table 2 the ndvi peaked during the flowering time of maize growing period fig 3f the number of days during droughts rew 0 4 over the three years mainly occurred during wheat growing period fig 3g the basic irrigation was put once at the beginning of jointing stages during wheat growing period from 2008 to 2010 ranged about 60 80 mm and also irrigated around seeding of maize growing period in 2009 and 2010 table 1 there was no irrigation during maize seeding stage due to the heavy rain before 56 6 mm from 3 june to 15 june and after seeding 55 0 mm from 25 june to 5 july in 2008 other irrigations which were implemented during the jointing stage of maize growing period in 2008 and 2010 and the heading stage of wheat growing period in 2010 was due to the relatively low ppt input table 1 the information of irrigation rew and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index pdsi table s1 together indicated that the year 2010 endured heave drought and the drought was especially heavier during wheat growing period when the total ppt from april to june was 24 8 mm which accounted for 8 0 of ppt during the whole growing season 3 2 diurnal seasonal and interannual variations in dew the non gapfilled le data were used to describe the diurnal dew variations at hourly scale dew stayed at a relative higher amount before 21 00 and then a significant descending trend occurred afterwards however it showed a slight increase between 1 00 and 5 00 fig 4 the overall trend of monthly mean diurnal dew amount was decreasing during the period of 18 00 8 00 from april to september fig 4 and the decreasing trend was more obvious in 2010 than 2009 and it seemed the diurnal dew amount was higher in 2010 followed by 2009 and 2008 the monthly mean diurnal dew amount exhibited higher amount in summer months than in spring monthly mean diurnal dew amount in april was relatively low compared to other months all of three years fig 4 fig 5 depicts the comparison of lws derived daily dew amount versus the ec calculated value over the study period from 1 august to 11 september in 2021 it was clear that the ec obtained daily dew amount correlated well with the lws derived values with a significant correlation of 0 88 and an rmse of approximately 0 06 mm moreover a slight of 0 02 mm was found between the two datasets fig 5b all these results indicate that the ec method could provide reliable estimates of dew amount after carefully abnormal value elimination and filling gaps in particular the underestimated daily dew amount by ec method fig 5a was also attributed to the stable stratification of the air below the sensors nevertheless it was evident that the ec obtained dew amount still had a high degree of agreement with the lws derived dew amount the gap filled hourly values were merged into daily and annual values annual total amount of dew was largest in 2010 and lowest in 2009 table 2 the maximum daily dew amount was 0 20 mm day 1 on 28 june 0 15 mm day 1 on 24 april 0 16 mm day 1 on 27 may over 2008 to 2010 respectively fig 6 daily dew amount and duration showed a similar trend which showed obvious dividing line between the wheat and maize growing period fig 6a b the total dew amount during the wheat growing period accounted for the amounts in the whole growing season from 2008 to 2010 were 43 7 47 6 and 78 8 respectively the variations of daily dew amount were different in wheat periods within the three years the daily dew amount was highest in april and decreased to the end of wheat growing period in june in 2008 and 2009 however it peaked in may in 2010 fig 6b the nocturnal evapotranspiration etn showed a trend which peaked twice intra annually with one was during the wheat growing period and the other was during the maize growing period 3 3 biophysical regulations on dew amount on seasonal scales there are different correlations between dew and biophysical factors figs 7 s1 and table 3 results of pearson correlation coefficient and quadratic regression revealed that dew over the growing season showed no significant relationship with ta among the three years and this was further proved by the linear regression between daily dew and ta which showed that ta only explained 41 of dew in 2010 and showed no relationship with dew in 2008 and 2009 fig 7 a s1a and table 3 quadratic regressions between daily dew and biophysical factors showed that seasonal variations of vpd exhibited a negative influence on dew r2 0 28 p 0 05 from the three years perspective and it explained 96 37 and 98 of the dew variation over 2008 to 2010 respectively figs 7b and s1b daily dew was significantly influenced by rh r2 0 43 p 0 01 fig 7c which rh explained 24 70 and 30 of dew from 2008 to 2010 respectively fig s1c pearson correlation coefficients between dew and ws showed no significant relationship on seasonal scales over the three years fig s1d table 3 however the quadrative regression results exhibited weak negative influence of ws on dew fig 7d which dew decreased as ws increased swc 40 showed no significant linear relationship with dew in 2008 and 2009 however dew showed positively correlation with swc 40 in 2010 r2 0 30 p 0 05 figs 7 and s1e significant pearson correlation coefficients between dew and gs were found during the growing seasons from 2008 to 2010 table 3 and quadratic regression showed that gs explained 22 of dew over the three years and it independently explained 32 and 93 of dew variations in 2009 and 2010 fig s1f ndvi showed significantly influence on dew r2 0 50 table 4 g however it explained 73 of dew in 2009 and showed no significant correlations with dew in 2008 and 2010 fig s1g the multiple regression between dew and biophysical factors showed that gs and rh were the dominant factors in controlling dew over all the three years table 3 besides dew was controlled by gs and vpd during wheat growing period and by gs and ta during maize growing period table 3 hourly values of dew and biophysical factors during the three years were pooled together and divided into two data sets according to the wheat and maize growing period relationships between dew and biophysical factors at wheat and maize growing period showed significant difference fig 8 ta could explain 43 of dew during wheat growing period but it showed no significant correlation with dew during maize time fig 8a it seems that vpd was the dominant factor on dew both during wheat and maize growing period which dew decrease as vpd increased fig 8b rh showed opposite influence on dew compared to vpd which rh can explain 68 and 71 of dew variations during wheat and maize growing period fig 8c linear regressions between dew and gs showed that dew increased as gs increased and dew response to gs significantly in wheat growing period than in maize time fig 8d swc 20 and swc 40 showed similar patterns in controlling dew both during wheat and maize growing period which dew increased as swc increased to a certain threshold then it began to decrease fig 8e f dew decreased as swc 20 surpass the values of 0 40 and 0 50 m3 m 3 during wheat and maize growing time and the thresholds of swc 40 for dew to decrease were 0 43 and 0 55 m3 m 3 at wheat and maize time respectively fig 8e f ws showed no significant influence on dew formation both at wheat and maize time fig 8g dew increased as ndvi increase during maize time but there was no significant correlation at wheat growing period fig 8h multiple regressions analysis showed that vpd and gs were the dominant factors in controlling dew during wheat growing period and dew was mainly controlled by gs during maize growing period over the three years table 3 3 4 response of dew to droughts and its relationship with etn the number of days during drought period accounted for the whole growing season was highest in 2009 49 7 followed by 45 9 in 2010 the droughts during wheat growing period last longer than the number of days that during maize season which with 51 1 72 0 of days in drought occurred during wheat growing season table 4 the dew amount during drought period was 50 5 of the total amount during the growing season in 2009 and 29 9 in 2008 and 41 7 in 2010 the dew amount during drought period accounted 3 4 of corresponding ppt amount dew was mainly controlled by rh and gs during drought period in 2008 doy 145 182 187 216 and by rh during the drought period in 2009 doy 92 108 119 129 135 166 243 273 and by vpd and gs in 2010 doy92 122 141 183 265 274 table 4 there was a significant negative relationship between gs and vpd during the drought period r2 0 58 fig 9 a when vpd 1 0 kpa dew increased as gs increased before gs 10 0 mm s 1 and it may decrease when gs 1 0 mm s 1 fig 9b the total etn amounts were highest in 2009 then followed by 24 15 mm in 2010 and it was lowest in 2008 20 63 mm etn during wheat growing period accounted for 60 2 40 5 and 38 7 of the whole amount during the growing season respectively dew and etn were two opposite phenomena at night and there was a clear negative relationship between dew and etn during wheat growing period from 2008 to 2010 38 0 of etn was controlled by dew in 2008 and 12 0 of etn was explained by dew in 2009 and dew could reduce 22 0 of etn in 2010 however there was only a weak negative correlation between dew and etn during maize growing period in 2008 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 measurements issues eddy covariance method can be used to observe latent heat flux le for its advantage of continuous long term and high frequency measurements guo et al 2021 2016 due to the stable stratification of the air below the sensors which was indicated by u below a certain level ec method usually underestimates the le and lead to the uncertainties when calculating dew amount fisher et al 2007 the underestimation was also identified through the comparison between the lws derived and the e obtained dew amount in our site we excluded the nocturnal le values by using a detected eliminating criterion of u this process was in consistent with our previous studies which analyzed dew or nocturnal evapotranspiration based on ec method guo et al 2016 hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 novick et al 2009 besides the mds method which we selected for gap filling in our study was suitable falge et al 2001 novick et al 2009 however the negative le was not considered as dew directly in our research we considered the negative le as dew when the canopy temperature below the dew point temperature besides we also eliminated the corresponding dew values when rain occurred and limited dew amount with the threshold of 0 07 mm h 1 the sequence of pre processing procedures can assure the precision of dew estimation fig 2 the unfilled gaps were used to analyze the biophysical controlling mechanisms at different timescales as the moderate uncertainty in le measured by ec method would not affect the process relationship in our study figs 7 and 8 the relationship was robust and was not affected by the uncertainties in the energy closure balance however in order to retain more valid data for analysis a conserve threshold of u which was smaller compared to the other studies in the same site was obtained through u filtering processing in the eddyproc package in r software shen et al 2013 thus might lead to underestimation of dew amount 4 2 dew amount annual ranges of dew amount accumulated during the growing season 6 5 9 9 mm accounted for the 2 0 3 0 of the total ppt which is much smaller than that reported in desert environments 7 2 for the desert shrub ecosystem in mu us desert 35 0 for negev desert 66 7 of the total ppt in summer in taklimakan desert 94 0 of ppt during the dry period in the mediterranean 6 6 of the ppt amounts during the growing season in the gravel desert ecosystem guo et al 2016 hao et al 2012 kidron and lázaro 2020 uclés et al 2014 when compared with the other croplands the dew amount during growing season at our site was generally lower than the results reported in an arid artificial oasis cropland spring maize in zhangye gansu province 9 9 mm of dew amount accounted for 9 5 of ppt and it was still lower compared with soybean land and paddy land in sanjiang plain 12 0 mm and 30 2 mm respectively xu et al 2012 yao and wen 2016 these differences might be attributed to the difference in plant species composition microclimate and irrigation events in the artificial oasis cropland in 2012 the single spring maize was flood irrigated four times irrigation would lead to the high swc and high vapor in the air thus facilitating the dew formation besides ndvi was higher in spring maize than in wheat maize rotation cropland i e in our site higher ndvi could supply more condensation surface for dew deposition the lai of paddy and soybean land in the sanjiang plain were 2 9 9 0 m2 m 2 and 1 5 5 0 m2 m 2 respectively and these were higher than the range of 0 3 4 9 m2 m 2 in our site besides the moister water vapor in paddy land would also help the dew formation compared with the drier climate in the ncp the humid and semi humid climate of sanjiang plain might also facilitate dew formation when compared with the study of the same site dew amounts in our research were much smaller than the results reported by yao and wen 2016 which was 20 2 mm accounting for 4 1 of ppt yao and wen 2016 the much smaller amount of dew may be attributed to the measurement method we measured dewfall by ec method which may underestimate latent fluxes at night while the measurement in yao and wen 2016 was based on flux profile method which they adjusted the height of instrument along with the crop s growing period yao and wen 2016 4 3 biophysical controls on dew variation at multiple timescales the response of dew to biophysical variables varied seasonally and in different crop growing periods during the growing season of all the three years we found that seasonal variations in dew was mostly determined by rh and gs table 3 rh was the dominant factor in regulating dew this result is consistent with results reported in other ecosystems guo et al 2016 yao and wen 2016 zhuang et al 2021 in addition to abiotic factors biotic factors also showed influence on the seasonal variation of dew agam and berliner 2006 kidron and starinsky 2019 xu et al 2012 at our site the positive correlation between dew and gs over the three years was attributed to the water stress in 2009 and 2010 as it experienced a light drought in the spring of 2009 a severe drought from may to july in 2010 with the drought period lasting 91 and 84 days respectively the weak correlation between swc and dew discovered in 2010 fig s1e was due to the concentration of large ppt during maize growing period which induced the increasement of swc and dew however the weak correlation between dew and swc at growing season but relatively strong correlation in each wheat and maize growing period can be explained that the swc was highly dependent on ppt and irrigation in this cropland and hourly swc can snap the variation information and better reflect the relationship between soil water condition of dew formation conversely the daily swc may miss the diurnal variations besides the drought events can accelerate the soil evaporation and enrich the water vapor in the air and that also lead dew more sensitive to swc we can also conclude that due to the different swc range of the two crops fig 8e f wheat is facing water stress during the fast growing season from april to june while maize is not compared with dew variations on the whole growing season scale the variations of dew during the wheat growing period or heavy drought period mainly in 2010 were controlled to a greater extent by vpd and gs during april june which was a critical period in wheat growing when drought frequently occurred tables 3 and 4 water stress potentially hindered canopy development and lead lower ndvi in 2009 and 2010 the fewer ppt amounts during wheat growing period in 2010 and unevenly distributed ppt events in 2009 highlight the likelihood that the unusual ppt in amount or frequency would directly affect the occurrence of drought and overall might impact the growing of crops and dew formation dew amount in the seven days after the irrigation almost showed an increasing trend indicated reasonable irrigation support could relieve water stress and supply water vapor in the air 4 4 dew response to droughts and etn the timing and duration of drought play a significant role in regulating dew the number of drought days over the three years showed a positive relationship with dew amount table 4 the larger number of days in drought the higher percentage of dew amount during droughts in total dew amount and the higher the percentages of dew amount in the corresponding ppt the larger number of drought days occurred during wheat growing period also induced the higher dew amount during wheat growing period and in whole growing season table 4 besides dew amount was also regulated by the drought degree the total dew amount was 5 33 mm during the wheat growing period and it was up to 78 8 of dew amounts in the whole growing season and up to 21 5 of corresponding ppt during the drought in 2010 and that was attributed to the drought degree the year of 2010 suffered a severe atmospheric drought period from may to july heavy drought would urge the soil evaporation and influenced the surface temperature and this facilitate dew formation drought has not only simultaneous impacts but also cumulative and lagged impacts on dew jiao et al 2022 our study found that the long term droughts period one month during maize growing period in 2008 and 2009 and during wheat growing period in 2009 and 2010 led to the increase in dew amount next month right after that period tables 1 and 4 which showed lagged influence by drought on dew formation it can be explained that vpd was relatively high and gs was low during the long term droughts thus lead to lower dew amount however when the drought relieved more water vapor in the air can promote dew formation besides dew water can be absorbed much through leaves thus leading to smaller amount during drought period than that after drought vpd was lower during short term drought period one month dew will increase as gs increased therefore there was no significant lagged influence of short term drought on dew formation dew usually forms in drought period during which dew amount can even exceed ppt and supply the water needed during seed germination and faster growing beysens 1995 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 wang et al 2019 although the percentage of dew in ppt during drought was not large compared with our former study in a desert shrubland in the northwest china 96 18 guo et al 2022 however it did larger than the percentage during the whole growing season in this cropland etn was also influenced by drought this was also attributed to the interaction of gs and vpd together during droughts dios et al 2015 the increase of vpd during the droughts induces stomatal closure resulting in a decrease in canopy photosynthetic and ndvi ma et al 2019 xie et al 2016 however daily etn decreased as dew increased indicating the suppression effect of dew on etn especially during drought period fig 10 chávez sahagún et al 2019 gerlein safdi et al 2018 liu et al 2020a it has been identified in the previous studies that dew can relief the drought stress on crops through water uptake by leaf and the leaf wetting by dew reduces evaporative demand by increasing humidity near the leaf surface and decreases the leaf temperature and thus reduces evapotranspiration gerlein safdi et al 2018 liu et al 2020a yokoyama et al 2021 besides previous studies have proved that dew could suppress evapotranspiration especially in the morning during dew evaporation however our study did not get the conclusion due to the lack of suitable observation experiment besides previous studies proved dew showed positive effects on the wue of plants however what extent dew affect the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis and finally affect the water use efficiency wue in this wheat maize rotation cropland is still unclear especially under water stressed conditions therefore studies about the influence of dew on wue should be undertaken in the future 5 conclusions characteristics of dew in a wheat maize rotation cropland in the north china plain were examined together with the controlling mechanisms of biophysical variables at different timescales besides the relevance of dew to droughts and etn was also explored during the 3 year observation period diurnal variation of dew in the cropland showed a decreasing tendency from 18 00 to 8 00 with the annual sum of 6 45 0 03 6 51 0 03 and 9 86 0 04 mm from 2008 to 2010 respectively variation of dew during the growing season was mainly controlled by the rh and gs however dew in wheat growing period was controlled by gs and vpd and by gs during maize growing period the timing duration and degree of drought had important influence on dew amount resulting more dew amount during drought period besides we have found that long term droughts had a legacy effect on increasing dew amount right after the drought period dew could reduce etn especially during wheat growing period our study not only provides a novel understanding of dew characteristics in the cropland but also uncovers its significant ecological relevant to droughts in the context of continued global warming having an important potential effect on ecosystem water use efficiency in the future credit authorship contribution statement xiaonan guo conceptualization

2357,dew as an important contribution of non rainfall water nrw is found to be an important hydrological component for ecosystem water stress alleviation and further ecosystem functions maintenance during rainless seasons the north china plain ncp is facing severe water shortage mainly due to intensive agricultural irrigation however few studies have examined the variations and controlling mechanism of dew in the typical croplands predisposed to drought here seasonal variation in dew was examined during growing period in a wheat and maize rotation cropland in the ncp over 3 years 2008 2010 based on the eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux le during nighttime and the ecosystem drought was defined to occur when the relative extractable water content rew in the soil dropped below 0 4 results showed that annual from april to september mean dew amount for this cropland was 7 61 0 02 mm accounting for 2 5 of precipitation ppt and the annual mean dew amount during drought period was 3 11 mm accounting for 3 4 of ppt seasonal variation in dew was mainly regulated by relative humidity rh and surface stomatal conductance gs furthermore dew was influenced by gs and vapor pressure deficit vpd during the wheat growing period and by gs during maize growing period 51 1 72 0 of drought events occurred during wheat growing season compared to maize growing season with higher nocturnal evapotranspiration etn the higher frequency of dew occurrence during wheat growing season had reduced the etn amount drought timing duration and degree together influenced dew amount long term drought e g 1 month drought would induce an increase of dew amount after drought period our findings clarified the temporal dynamics in dew across different crop growing periods such as wheat and maize and contribute to the sustainable utilization of non rainfall water especially dew in cropland in the context of extreme climate such as droughts in the future keywords biophysical control dew drought eddy covariance cropland the north china plain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction undoubtedly rainfall is the major water input form for most ecosystems in the world and is essential for maintaining ecosystem functions kaseke and wang 2018 riedl et al 2022 wang et al 2016 however in dry environments with low precipitation ppt dew as an important component of non rainfall water nrw constitutes a constant water resource for the ecological processes of plants animals and microorganisms agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2016 feng et al 2021 guo et al 2022 kidron et al 2002 kidron and starinsky 2019 dew also influence the magnitude of water and energy flux and ecological processes during the ecosystem water stress beysens 2006 dew can increase the leaf water content through foliar water uptakes dew evaporation can suppress transpiration facilitate carbon assimilation and shows a positive influence on the water use efficiency wue of during water stress gerlein safdi et al 2018 oliveira et al 2021 tian et al 2021 studies also showed that dew water has emerged as means to meet supplement irrigation demand for reforestation and agriculture in water scarcely regions gao et al 2020b jacobs et al 2006 liu et al 2020a tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 globally cropland dependent on irrigation provide 40 of food production by consuming about 90 of the global fresh water supply of which 43 is from groundwater pei et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 2013 xiao et al 2017 the over exploitation of groundwater high water demand of intensive agriculture and extreme droughts events intensify the water shortage in regions where annual evaporative water loss exceeds annual ppt huang et al 2016 jia et al 2019 liu et al 2021 in dryland a key strategy for maintaining crop yields without over exploitation the scarce water resource is by increasing wue of plants daryanto et al 2017 therefore more attention should be focused on the utilization of dew in the croplands except for the great many studies reported the effects of dew on a variety of croplands cosh et al 2009 kabela et al 2009 meng and wen 2016 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 xu et al 2015 yokoyama et al 2021 its inter annual seasonal characteristics and biophysical controlling mechanisms remain unclear previous studies reported that dew amount was positively correlated with relative humidity rh and air temperature ta guo et al 2016 lekouch et al 2012 ye et al 2007 and increased with wind speed ws before a threshold of 4 4 m s 1 beysens 2016 and decreased when the ws became larger beysens 2018 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 ppt can affect dew through the direct impact on water vapor from soil i e soil volumetric water content swc or in the air represented by rh high swc would facilitate soil evaporation which would contribute high humidity in the air the warming of solar radiation on surface determines the termination of dew formation besides the biotic factors can also show influence on dew formation incomplete surface stomatal conductance gs at nighttime would facilitate the dew water uptake through leaves and supports a non trivial level of transpiration caird et al 2007 dawson et al 2007 hayat et al 2021a snyder et al 2003 furthermore the species variation might cause the difference in leaf temperature and thus the difference in condensation rate variations of dew and its response to biophysical variables may vary among plant species and landscapes due to the different living strategies of plants and the microclimate hayat et al 2021b furthermore it is also different at multiple timescales and special period e g drought due to the human intervention in agriculture land use in the context of climate change therefore a multiple temporal scales analysis of biophysical control mechanisms of dew formation in cropland is needed guo et al 2021 field measurements and models have been used to quantify dew guo et al 2016 field measurements based on weighing dew gauges lysimeters and leaf wetness sensors can detect dew formation at plant level or small scale cosh et al 2009 duvdevani 1947 gao et al 2020a pan et al 2010 zangvil 1996 however the eddy covariance ec method allows for continuous long term measurements of latent heat flux le papale et al 2006 and has been applied to the examination of dew dynamics on ecosystem scale hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 ec measurements usually underestimate the flux during night with low turbulence so carefully outliers eliminating and gaps filling can ensure the accuracy there are empirical and analytical models used for dew estimation tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 penman monteith model as a typical analytical model has the advantage of considering both the physiological and physical regulators of dew which can be used to estimate dew and fill gaps in ec measurement however novick et al 2009 has evaluated the main models for filling gaps in nocturnal water flux and concluded that the marginal distribution sampling mds method was best for it can explore the covariations between le and meteorological factors and their temporal autocorrelation based on the methods of look up tables lut and mean diurnal course mdc and has been widely used novick et al 2009 wutzler et al 2018 the north china plain ncp is one of the main grain production base of china accounting for 25 of wheat and 18 of maize production over 2002 2011 and winter wheat summer maize cropland accounts for about 55 of the ncp zhang et al 2019 the ncp is also one of the regions facing serious water shortage problem min et al 2018 pei et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 yuan and shen 2013 due to the mismatch between ppt and solar thermal resources in the ncp liu et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 the 420 mm yr 1 of average crop water demand substantially exceeds the average annual ppt of 280 mm yr 1 during winter wheat growing period shen et al 2013 sun et al 2010 and thus 140 mm yr 1 of water needs to be irrigated to guarantee the high crop yield approximately 75 of the total agricultural water use come from groundwater sun et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 which is the primary reason that led to the groundwater over exploitation liu et al 2020b sun et al 2021 to resolve this problem more attention should be concentrated on the water resource utilization efficiency improvement besides other freshwater input such as dew should be evaluated however the characteristics of dew formation and its controlling mechanisms have not been fully understood in the typical wheat maize cropland in the ncp in this study we measured water vapor fluxes over a wheat maize rotation cropland in the ncp over three year period 2008 2010 with eddy covariance ec technique zhang et al 2020 the 3 year dataset provides opportunity to investigate site characteristics of dew formation and its relevance to drought the specific objectives of our study were to 1 examine the dynamics of dew at multiple temporal scales i e daily monthly and seasonally 2 determine the controlling variables in dew formation at seasonal and during wheat and maize growing period respectively and 3 evaluate the response of dew to drought and its effect on nocturnal evapotranspiration we hypothesized that 1 dew in different crops growing period was mostly controlled by rh and gs 2 drought would induce the increase of dew and dew would reduce evapotranspiration and relief water stress our results will enhance the understanding of the biophysical controls of dew formation in agriculture in the context of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions field datasets were collected at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station lca 37 53 n 114 41 e elevation 50 1 m a s l which is 25 km southeast from shijiazhuang hebei province located in the central piedmont of the ncp fig 1 a the lca is one of the ecosystem stations of chinese ecological research network and also a member of the global terrestrial observing system zhang et al 2013 the climate of the region is semi humid and semi arid with a long winter from november to february and a short spring from march to april bao et al 2022 the air temperature in the lca ranged from 3 3 c in january to 26 5 c in july with average annual air temperature of 12 8 c 1990 2008 shen et al 2013 the mean annual pan evapotranspiration was 1100 mm 1990 2008 annual ppt ranged from 366 to 598 mm representing 80 130 of the long term mean value of 455 mm 1990 2008 in which 60 80 of mean annual ppt occurred during the maize season june september while relatively little ppt occurred in march may when winter wheat grows rapidly shen et al 2013 the measurement periods cover extremely high annual precipitation amount 598 mm in 2008 and low amount 366 mm in 2010 compared with the mean annual precipitation range relative to the past 30 years rotation of winter wheat and summer maize dominates agricultural activities in the lca the growing season of winter wheat is from early october to mid june of the coming year summer maize is sowed at the end of winter wheat growing season and harvested in late september pei et al 2017 irrigation ranged from 130 to 330 mm annually during the study with irrigation applications concentrated during the winter wheat season to compensate the low seasonal precipitation the groundwater table depth has decreased dramatically from 11 m in 1975 to 47 m in 2015 representing a draw down rate of approximately 0 9 m per year influenced by the irrigations during the period from march to june the water table depth goes down and then rises after the monsoon season from june to august due to the ppt recharge pei et al 2017 the soil type of lca is silt loam with a field capacity of 35 umair et al 2017 the bulk density in the upper 180 cm is 1 53 g cm3 soil organic matter content in the top 20 cm layer is 1 80 pei et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 2 2 flux meteorological and vegetation measurements the eddy covariance ec system was used to obtain the sensible and latent heat fluxes le guo et al 2021 the ec system consist of a three dimensional sonic anemometers csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut and an open path infrared gas analyzer li7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa the ec system was set at 3 5 m height on a 10 m flux tower with fetch 200 m fig 1b the three dimensional wind velocity water vapor and co2 concentrations were measured at a frequency of 10 hz monitoring results were averaged in 30 min intervals and processed with eddypro li cor according to the requirement of chinaflux for quality control shen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 net radiation rn w m 2 was monitored with a cnr 1 net radiometer kipp zonen delft the netherlands and soil heat flux g w m

scientific inc shen et al 2013 irrigation was estimated with a water flowmeter besides modis ndvi normalized difference vegetation index mod13q1 products obtained from the earth observing system data gateway were used to characterize vegetation cover including its density and greenness ma et al 2019 the daily energy balance closure ebc in our study ranged from 0 84 to 0 99 and the nighttime ebc showed an acceptable energy closure fraction of about 68 slope 0 68 r2 0 88 which falls in the range of 0 55 0 99 reported for fluxnet guo et al 2016 we judged that the range of the ebc from our data is satisfactory for analysis 2 3 data qa qc and gap filling all of the 10 hz turbulence measurements were used to calculate half hourly water vapor heat and co2 fluxes the mad test median of absolute deviation was applied to eliminate some outliers spikes from the data selected and then the spike test was used oliveira et al 2021 papale et al 2006 the mad test was first applied to co2 flux data by papale et al 2006 and first used for despiking raw ec data by mauder et al 2013 mauder et al 2013 the mad test identified as outlier all values that outside the following range 1 m e d i a n x qmad 0 6745 x i m e d i a n x qmad 0 6745 where the factor of 0 6745 stems from the gaussian distribution and q is a threshold value that must be determined depending on the specific data set while mad test is used when the measured values to be examined scatter only slightly around a mean value the spike test is used for more scattering data the spike test was used in the final stage of data processing during which it determines the sd standard deviation of the entire data set and excludes all values that deviate by a multiple of the sd oliveira et al 2021 instrument failure and maintenance resulted in 6 6 27 7 and 22 3 missing records of flux data in 2008 2010 respectively the data lost to spike eliminating resulted in 2 8 3 2 and 2 0 missing records in 2008 2010 respectively the friction velocity u threshold was used to eliminate inaccurate flux especially during night schmidt walter et al 2020 the determination of u thresholds were conducted using the fluxnet method reddyproc package in r 4 1 0 in order to retain relatively more nightly data for exploring the biophysical controlling mechanisms finally the u over the three year period were 0 07 0 06 and 0 05 m s 1 which were led to 50 2 55 7 and 45 3 of total nighttime data being gap filled from 2008 to 2010 respectively gaps of less than 2 h in h2o vapor fluxes and all other variables were filled by linear interpolation longer gaps in h2o vapor fluxes were filled by mds method liu et al 2022 wutzler et al 2018 missing data in temperature and ppt were obtained from an automatic weather station about 200 m distant away from the flux tower longer gaps of vapor pressure in 2009 and 2010 which was not recorded by the field automatic weather station were filled by using the hourly values measured at the luancheng meteorological station close by longer gaps less than 14 days in other meteorological variables were filled by the mdc method falge et al 2001 and for missing flux data that extended beyond 14 days daily mean values from different years were used to calculate and fill gaps 2 4 dew and nocturnal evapotranspiration negative latent heat flux at night was used to estimate dew however the le data around sunrise needs to be carefully interpreted for the entrainment of air from free troposphere might cause a peak of negative le but this does not mean stronger condensation therefore the daytime and nighttime le flux was distinguished by par at the conservative threshold of 5 µmol m 2 s 1 guo et al 2016 the positive values of hourly le at night were considered as nocturnal evapotranspiration etn the negative le at night par 5 µmol m 2 s 1 and together when ts was below the dew point temperature td was considered as dew besides the half hourly amount of dew were eliminated during half hourly rainfall 0 and furthermore hourly amount of dew were limited by the maximum rate of 0 07 mm h 1 during clear nights groh et al 2018 monteith and unsworth 2013 the rate of dew or etn was then estimated as 2 e le λ where λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 kj kg 1 the dew point temperature was calculated using the magnus tetens approximation method lawrence 2005 as 3 t d b γ t a r h a γ t a r h 4 γ t a r h a t a b t a l n r h 100 where t d is dew point temperature c and parameters a 17 27 and b 237 7 are constants 2 5 surface conductance and relative extractable water content we estimated the surface conductance gs mm s 1 by inverting the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 2013 i e 5 g s γ l e g a δ r n g ρ c p v p d g a l e δ γ where γ is the psychrometric constant kpa k 1 ρ is the air density 1 23 kg m 3 cp is the specific heat of air j kg 1 k 1 vpd is the water vapor pressure deficit kpa and ga is the aerodynamic conductance m s 1 whereby 6 g a w s u 2 6 2 u 0 67 1 where u and ws are the estimated friction velocity and wind velocity both in m s 1 half hourly values of gs were calculated only for non rainy days ecosystem drought responses were analyzed in terms of relative extractable water content rew in the soil soil water stress was assumed to occur when rew dropped below 0 4 granier et al 2007 zhou et al 2013 daily rew is calculated as 7 rew vwc vwc min vwc max vwc min where vwcmin and vwcmax are the minimum and maximum soil volumetric water content during the observation period in each year according to the definition of long and short term drought and the actual situation at our study site we defined long term droughts whenever rew 0 4 occurred for more than one month whereas periods with rew 0 4 for less than one month were classified as short term droughts ma et al 2019 2 6 dew amount verification the leaf wetness sensor lws was used as in situ measurement of dew to verify the day dew amount obtained from the ec data three lwss were plated 2 0 m in maize cropland from 1 august to 12 september in 2021 the voltage recorded by lws was calibrated and converted into amount of condensation followed the method by guo et al 2022 as lws can not only be used for monitoring the duration of dew but also for calculating the amount of dew guo et al 2022 the days with rainfall was excluded finally there are 34 events of daily dew amount were selected for comparison with ec obtained values the pear correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and relative error bias were selected in the present study for accuracy verification 2 7 growing season and statistical analysis the whole growing season of wheat was not considered in our research we take april september as the growing season including the main growing period of wheat i e jointing heading milking and maturity periods from april 1 to june 15 and the whole growing period of maize from june 16 to september 30 li et al 2017 the growing period of wheat and maize from april to september over 2008 to 2010 was detailed descripted in table 1 linear quadratic and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the effects of biophysical effects i e ta vpd rh swc ws gs and ndvi on dew at different timescales the linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between dew and etn pearson correlation coefficient was used to describe the correlation between biophysical factors and dew daily values of ndvi were derived by linearly interpolating measurements response variables were bin averaged prior to regression ma et al 2018 linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between vpd and gs during drought periods in order to explore the relationship between dew and gs during drought period vpds were divided into two datasets by the threshold of 1 0 kpa regression significance was evaluated using the f statistic at a significance level of 0 05 3 results 3 1 biophysical factors during the observation period all the biophysical factors showed significant interannual variations seasonal patterns of ta and tc showed similar trend among the three years fig 3 a and table 2 daily mean ta at night increased from spring to summer and then decreased in autumn which ranged from 4 1 c on 30 september in 2008 to 29 4 c on 30 july in 2010 mean ta during growing season over the three years was slightly higher in 2010 with the mean value of 20 1 c the growing season mean nocturnal vpd was highest in 2010 0 8 kpa and lowest in 2008 0 3 kpa vpd was highest in june table 2 rh showed contrary tendency with vpd with the range of nocturnal mean in the years 2008 2010 were 31 5 97 5 33 5 96 0 29 4 83 5 respectively fig 3b ws exhibited higher rate in spring and summer and stayed at a relative lower rate in autumn fig 3c with the highest value of 6 7 ms 1 in the april of 2010 soil volumetric water content at 20 cm swc 20 and 40 cm swc 40 showed similar variations which were both influenced by ppt however swc 20 was more affected by ppt events which were less than 20 mm day 1 and swc 40 responded mainly to ppt events larger than 20 mm day 1 fig 3d both the nocturnal mean swc 20 and swc 40 at night were highest in 2009 and were lowest in 2008 table 2 the total ppt amount during april to september from 2008 to 2010 was 53 55 and 85 in annual ppt amount respectively the ppt amounts over april june were 118 0 mm 103 7 mm and 24 8 mm which were accounted for 37 4 35 3 and 8 0 of the growing season over the three years respectively it seemed that wheat growing period lived through a relatively less ppt amount than maize growing period and this phenomenon was more obvious in 2010 the gs exhibited double peaks during the growing season that one peak usually occurred at the jointing and heading stage of wheat growing period and the other occurred at heading and flowering stage of maize growing period fig 3e the annual mean nocturnal gs over the growing season period was highest in 2008 2 8 mm s 1 and lowest in 2010 0 9 mm s 1 table 2 the ndvi peaked during the flowering time of maize growing period fig 3f the number of days during droughts rew 0 4 over the three years mainly occurred during wheat growing period fig 3g the basic irrigation was put once at the beginning of jointing stages during wheat growing period from 2008 to 2010 ranged about 60 80 mm and also irrigated around seeding of maize growing period in 2009 and 2010 table 1 there was no irrigation during maize seeding stage due to the heavy rain before 56 6 mm from 3 june to 15 june and after seeding 55 0 mm from 25 june to 5 july in 2008 other irrigations which were implemented during the jointing stage of maize growing period in 2008 and 2010 and the heading stage of wheat growing period in 2010 was due to the relatively low ppt input table 1 the information of irrigation rew and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index pdsi table s1 together indicated that the year 2010 endured heave drought and the drought was especially heavier during wheat growing period when the total ppt from april to june was 24 8 mm which accounted for 8 0 of ppt during the whole growing season 3 2 diurnal seasonal and interannual variations in dew the non gapfilled le data were used to describe the diurnal dew variations at hourly scale dew stayed at a relative higher amount before 21 00 and then a significant descending trend occurred afterwards however it showed a slight increase between 1 00 and 5 00 fig 4 the overall trend of monthly mean diurnal dew amount was decreasing during the period of 18 00 8 00 from april to september fig 4 and the decreasing trend was more obvious in 2010 than 2009 and it seemed the diurnal dew amount was higher in 2010 followed by 2009 and 2008 the monthly mean diurnal dew amount exhibited higher amount in summer months than in spring monthly mean diurnal dew amount in april was relatively low compared to other months all of three years fig 4 fig 5 depicts the comparison of lws derived daily dew amount versus the ec calculated value over the study period from 1 august to 11 september in 2021 it was clear that the ec obtained daily dew amount correlated well with the lws derived values with a significant correlation of 0 88 and an rmse of approximately 0 06 mm moreover a slight of 0 02 mm was found between the two datasets fig 5b all these results indicate that the ec method could provide reliable estimates of dew amount after carefully abnormal value elimination and filling gaps in particular the underestimated daily dew amount by ec method fig 5a was also attributed to the stable stratification of the air below the sensors nevertheless it was evident that the ec obtained dew amount still had a high degree of agreement with the lws derived dew amount the gap filled hourly values were merged into daily and annual values annual total amount of dew was largest in 2010 and lowest in 2009 table 2 the maximum daily dew amount was 0 20 mm day 1 on 28 june 0 15 mm day 1 on 24 april 0 16 mm day 1 on 27 may over 2008 to 2010 respectively fig 6 daily dew amount and duration showed a similar trend which showed obvious dividing line between the wheat and maize growing period fig 6a b the total dew amount during the wheat growing period accounted for the amounts in the whole growing season from 2008 to 2010 were 43 7 47 6 and 78 8 respectively the variations of daily dew amount were different in wheat periods within the three years the daily dew amount was highest in april and decreased to the end of wheat growing period in june in 2008 and 2009 however it peaked in may in 2010 fig 6b the nocturnal evapotranspiration etn showed a trend which peaked twice intra annually with one was during the wheat growing period and the other was during the maize growing period 3 3 biophysical regulations on dew amount on seasonal scales there are different correlations between dew and biophysical factors figs 7 s1 and table 3 results of pearson correlation coefficient and quadratic regression revealed that dew over the growing season showed no significant relationship with ta among the three years and this was further proved by the linear regression between daily dew and ta which showed that ta only explained 41 of dew in 2010 and showed no relationship with dew in 2008 and 2009 fig 7 a s1a and table 3 quadratic regressions between daily dew and biophysical factors showed that seasonal variations of vpd exhibited a negative influence on dew r2 0 28 p 0 05 from the three years perspective and it explained 96 37 and 98 of the dew variation over 2008 to 2010 respectively figs 7b and s1b daily dew was significantly influenced by rh r2 0 43 p 0 01 fig 7c which rh explained 24 70 and 30 of dew from 2008 to 2010 respectively fig s1c pearson correlation coefficients between dew and ws showed no significant relationship on seasonal scales over the three years fig s1d table 3 however the quadrative regression results exhibited weak negative influence of ws on dew fig 7d which dew decreased as ws increased swc 40 showed no significant linear relationship with dew in 2008 and 2009 however dew showed positively correlation with swc 40 in 2010 r2 0 30 p 0 05 figs 7 and s1e significant pearson correlation coefficients between dew and gs were found during the growing seasons from 2008 to 2010 table 3 and quadratic regression showed that gs explained 22 of dew over the three years and it independently explained 32 and 93 of dew variations in 2009 and 2010 fig s1f ndvi showed significantly influence on dew r2 0 50 table 4 g however it explained 73 of dew in 2009 and showed no significant correlations with dew in 2008 and 2010 fig s1g the multiple regression between dew and biophysical factors showed that gs and rh were the dominant factors in controlling dew over all the three years table 3 besides dew was controlled by gs and vpd during wheat growing period and by gs and ta during maize growing period table 3 hourly values of dew and biophysical factors during the three years were pooled together and divided into two data sets according to the wheat and maize growing period relationships between dew and biophysical factors at wheat and maize growing period showed significant difference fig 8 ta could explain 43 of dew during wheat growing period but it showed no significant correlation with dew during maize time fig 8a it seems that vpd was the dominant factor on dew both during wheat and maize growing period which dew decrease as vpd increased fig 8b rh showed opposite influence on dew compared to vpd which rh can explain 68 and 71 of dew variations during wheat and maize growing period fig 8c linear regressions between dew and gs showed that dew increased as gs increased and dew response to gs significantly in wheat growing period than in maize time fig 8d swc 20 and swc 40 showed similar patterns in controlling dew both during wheat and maize growing period which dew increased as swc increased to a certain threshold then it began to decrease fig 8e f dew decreased as swc 20 surpass the values of 0 40 and 0 50 m3 m 3 during wheat and maize growing time and the thresholds of swc 40 for dew to decrease were 0 43 and 0 55 m3 m 3 at wheat and maize time respectively fig 8e f ws showed no significant influence on dew formation both at wheat and maize time fig 8g dew increased as ndvi increase during maize time but there was no significant correlation at wheat growing period fig 8h multiple regressions analysis showed that vpd and gs were the dominant factors in controlling dew during wheat growing period and dew was mainly controlled by gs during maize growing period over the three years table 3 3 4 response of dew to droughts and its relationship with etn the number of days during drought period accounted for the whole growing season was highest in 2009 49 7 followed by 45 9 in 2010 the droughts during wheat growing period last longer than the number of days that during maize season which with 51 1 72 0 of days in drought occurred during wheat growing season table 4 the dew amount during drought period was 50 5 of the total amount during the growing season in 2009 and 29 9 in 2008 and 41 7 in 2010 the dew amount during drought period accounted 3 4 of corresponding ppt amount dew was mainly controlled by rh and gs during drought period in 2008 doy 145 182 187 216 and by rh during the drought period in 2009 doy 92 108 119 129 135 166 243 273 and by vpd and gs in 2010 doy92 122 141 183 265 274 table 4 there was a significant negative relationship between gs and vpd during the drought period r2 0 58 fig 9 a when vpd 1 0 kpa dew increased as gs increased before gs 10 0 mm s 1 and it may decrease when gs 1 0 mm s 1 fig 9b the total etn amounts were highest in 2009 then followed by 24 15 mm in 2010 and it was lowest in 2008 20 63 mm etn during wheat growing period accounted for 60 2 40 5 and 38 7 of the whole amount during the growing season respectively dew and etn were two opposite phenomena at night and there was a clear negative relationship between dew and etn during wheat growing period from 2008 to 2010 38 0 of etn was controlled by dew in 2008 and 12 0 of etn was explained by dew in 2009 and dew could reduce 22 0 of etn in 2010 however there was only a weak negative correlation between dew and etn during maize growing period in 2008 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 measurements issues eddy covariance method can be used to observe latent heat flux le for its advantage of continuous long term and high frequency measurements guo et al 2021 2016 due to the stable stratification of the air below the sensors which was indicated by u below a certain level ec method usually underestimates the le and lead to the uncertainties when calculating dew amount fisher et al 2007 the underestimation was also identified through the comparison between the lws derived and the e obtained dew amount in our site we excluded the nocturnal le values by using a detected eliminating criterion of u this process was in consistent with our previous studies which analyzed dew or nocturnal evapotranspiration based on ec method guo et al 2016 hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 novick et al 2009 besides the mds method which we selected for gap filling in our study was suitable falge et al 2001 novick et al 2009 however the negative le was not considered as dew directly in our research we considered the negative le as dew when the canopy temperature below the dew point temperature besides we also eliminated the corresponding dew values when rain occurred and limited dew amount with the threshold of 0 07 mm h 1 the sequence of pre processing procedures can assure the precision of dew estimation fig 2 the unfilled gaps were used to analyze the biophysical controlling mechanisms at different timescales as the moderate uncertainty in le measured by ec method would not affect the process relationship in our study figs 7 and 8 the relationship was robust and was not affected by the uncertainties in the energy closure balance however in order to retain more valid data for analysis a conserve threshold of u which was smaller compared to the other studies in the same site was obtained through u filtering processing in the eddyproc package in r software shen et al 2013 thus might lead to underestimation of dew amount 4 2 dew amount annual ranges of dew amount accumulated during the growing season 6 5 9 9 mm accounted for the 2 0 3 0 of the total ppt which is much smaller than that reported in desert environments 7 2 for the desert shrub ecosystem in mu us desert 35 0 for negev desert 66 7 of the total ppt in summer in taklimakan desert 94 0 of ppt during the dry period in the mediterranean 6 6 of the ppt amounts during the growing season in the gravel desert ecosystem guo et al 2016 hao et al 2012 kidron and lázaro 2020 uclés et al 2014 when compared with the other croplands the dew amount during growing season at our site was generally lower than the results reported in an arid artificial oasis cropland spring maize in zhangye gansu province 9 9 mm of dew amount accounted for 9 5 of ppt and it was still lower compared with soybean land and paddy land in sanjiang plain 12 0 mm and 30 2 mm respectively xu et al 2012 yao and wen 2016 these differences might be attributed to the difference in plant species composition microclimate and irrigation events in the artificial oasis cropland in 2012 the single spring maize was flood irrigated four times irrigation would lead to the high swc and high vapor in the air thus facilitating the dew formation besides ndvi was higher in spring maize than in wheat maize rotation cropland i e in our site higher ndvi could supply more condensation surface for dew deposition the lai of paddy and soybean land in the sanjiang plain were 2 9 9 0 m2 m 2 and 1 5 5 0 m2 m 2 respectively and these were higher than the range of 0 3 4 9 m2 m 2 in our site besides the moister water vapor in paddy land would also help the dew formation compared with the drier climate in the ncp the humid and semi humid climate of sanjiang plain might also facilitate dew formation when compared with the study of the same site dew amounts in our research were much smaller than the results reported by yao and wen 2016 which was 20 2 mm accounting for 4 1 of ppt yao and wen 2016 the much smaller amount of dew may be attributed to the measurement method we measured dewfall by ec method which may underestimate latent fluxes at night while the measurement in yao and wen 2016 was based on flux profile method which they adjusted the height of instrument along with the crop s growing period yao and wen 2016 4 3 biophysical controls on dew variation at multiple timescales the response of dew to biophysical variables varied seasonally and in different crop growing periods during the growing season of all the three years we found that seasonal variations in dew was mostly determined by rh and gs table 3 rh was the dominant factor in regulating dew this result is consistent with results reported in other ecosystems guo et al 2016 yao and wen 2016 zhuang et al 2021 in addition to abiotic factors biotic factors also showed influence on the seasonal variation of dew agam and berliner 2006 kidron and starinsky 2019 xu et al 2012 at our site the positive correlation between dew and gs over the three years was attributed to the water stress in 2009 and 2010 as it experienced a light drought in the spring of 2009 a severe drought from may to july in 2010 with the drought period lasting 91 and 84 days respectively the weak correlation between swc and dew discovered in 2010 fig s1e was due to the concentration of large ppt during maize growing period which induced the increasement of swc and dew however the weak correlation between dew and swc at growing season but relatively strong correlation in each wheat and maize growing period can be explained that the swc was highly dependent on ppt and irrigation in this cropland and hourly swc can snap the variation information and better reflect the relationship between soil water condition of dew formation conversely the daily swc may miss the diurnal variations besides the drought events can accelerate the soil evaporation and enrich the water vapor in the air and that also lead dew more sensitive to swc we can also conclude that due to the different swc range of the two crops fig 8e f wheat is facing water stress during the fast growing season from april to june while maize is not compared with dew variations on the whole growing season scale the variations of dew during the wheat growing period or heavy drought period mainly in 2010 were controlled to a greater extent by vpd and gs during april june which was a critical period in wheat growing when drought frequently occurred tables 3 and 4 water stress potentially hindered canopy development and lead lower ndvi in 2009 and 2010 the fewer ppt amounts during wheat growing period in 2010 and unevenly distributed ppt events in 2009 highlight the likelihood that the unusual ppt in amount or frequency would directly affect the occurrence of drought and overall might impact the growing of crops and dew formation dew amount in the seven days after the irrigation almost showed an increasing trend indicated reasonable irrigation support could relieve water stress and supply water vapor in the air 4 4 dew response to droughts and etn the timing and duration of drought play a significant role in regulating dew the number of drought days over the three years showed a positive relationship with dew amount table 4 the larger number of days in drought the higher percentage of dew amount during droughts in total dew amount and the higher the percentages of dew amount in the corresponding ppt the larger number of drought days occurred during wheat growing period also induced the higher dew amount during wheat growing period and in whole growing season table 4 besides dew amount was also regulated by the drought degree the total dew amount was 5 33 mm during the wheat growing period and it was up to 78 8 of dew amounts in the whole growing season and up to 21 5 of corresponding ppt during the drought in 2010 and that was attributed to the drought degree the year of 2010 suffered a severe atmospheric drought period from may to july heavy drought would urge the soil evaporation and influenced the surface temperature and this facilitate dew formation drought has not only simultaneous impacts but also cumulative and lagged impacts on dew jiao et al 2022 our study found that the long term droughts period one month during maize growing period in 2008 and 2009 and during wheat growing period in 2009 and 2010 led to the increase in dew amount next month right after that period tables 1 and 4 which showed lagged influence by drought on dew formation it can be explained that vpd was relatively high and gs was low during the long term droughts thus lead to lower dew amount however when the drought relieved more water vapor in the air can promote dew formation besides dew water can be absorbed much through leaves thus leading to smaller amount during drought period than that after drought vpd was lower during short term drought period one month dew will increase as gs increased therefore there was no significant lagged influence of short term drought on dew formation dew usually forms in drought period during which dew amount can even exceed ppt and supply the water needed during seed germination and faster growing beysens 1995 tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 wang et al 2019 although the percentage of dew in ppt during drought was not large compared with our former study in a desert shrubland in the northwest china 96 18 guo et al 2022 however it did larger than the percentage during the whole growing season in this cropland etn was also influenced by drought this was also attributed to the interaction of gs and vpd together during droughts dios et al 2015 the increase of vpd during the droughts induces stomatal closure resulting in a decrease in canopy photosynthetic and ndvi ma et al 2019 xie et al 2016 however daily etn decreased as dew increased indicating the suppression effect of dew on etn especially during drought period fig 10 chávez sahagún et al 2019 gerlein safdi et al 2018 liu et al 2020a it has been identified in the previous studies that dew can relief the drought stress on crops through water uptake by leaf and the leaf wetting by dew reduces evaporative demand by increasing humidity near the leaf surface and decreases the leaf temperature and thus reduces evapotranspiration gerlein safdi et al 2018 liu et al 2020a yokoyama et al 2021 besides previous studies have proved that dew could suppress evapotranspiration especially in the morning during dew evaporation however our study did not get the conclusion due to the lack of suitable observation experiment besides previous studies proved dew showed positive effects on the wue of plants however what extent dew affect the evapotranspiration and photosynthesis and finally affect the water use efficiency wue in this wheat maize rotation cropland is still unclear especially under water stressed conditions therefore studies about the influence of dew on wue should be undertaken in the future 5 conclusions characteristics of dew in a wheat maize rotation cropland in the north china plain were examined together with the controlling mechanisms of biophysical variables at different timescales besides the relevance of dew to droughts and etn was also explored during the 3 year observation period diurnal variation of dew in the cropland showed a decreasing tendency from 18 00 to 8 00 with the annual sum of 6 45 0 03 6 51 0 03 and 9 86 0 04 mm from 2008 to 2010 respectively variation of dew during the growing season was mainly controlled by the rh and gs however dew in wheat growing period was controlled by gs and vpd and by gs during maize growing period the timing duration and degree of drought had important influence on dew amount resulting more dew amount during drought period besides we have found that long term droughts had a legacy effect on increasing dew amount right after the drought period dew could reduce etn especially during wheat growing period our study not only provides a novel understanding of dew characteristics in the cropland but also uncovers its significant ecological relevant to droughts in the context of continued global warming having an important potential effect on ecosystem water use efficiency in the future credit authorship contribution statement xiaonan guo conceptualization

2358,water use efficiency wue is a key parameter that measures the balance between carbon gain and water loss in an ecosystem achieving better understanding of how wue responds to environmental drivers is critical for revealing ecohydrological processes and mechanisms and for biophysical modelling to investigate the interactions between vegetation and the changing environment karst landforms cover 10 of the earth s land surface however to date few studies have focused on the behaviours of wue in karstic ecosystems to fill these knowledge gaps a two year experiment was conducted to investigate the wue and its drivers in a climax karst forest in southwestern china results showed that both the gpp gross primary production and et evapotranspiration showed exponential relationships to ta air temperature p 0 05 but linear relationships to rn net radiation r 2 0 38 gpp and 0 78 et p 0 05 and vpd water vapour pressure deficit r 2 0 36 gpp and 0 28 et p 0 05 being quite different from those in other ecosystems the reasons would be the different habits of the karstic plants and the facts that the root zone water availability rarely dropped to low levels due to the frequent precipitation the wue with the mean of 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o exhibited negative relationships to vpd r 2 0 23 p 0 05 rn r 2 0 28 p 0 05 and ta air temperature r 2 0 42 p 0 05 and a positive linear relationship to the bowen ratio r 2 0 17 p 0 05 besides these results also showed that the effects of a specific driver e g vpd on wue was affected obviously by other factors e g ta rn indicating that whether a driver is important or not to wue depends strongly on the environmental conditions as the wue response formulas are often used to investigate and model the interactions between vegetation and environment these findings suggested that the modelers should caution the versatility of the wue response formulas keywords water use efficiency water depletion ecohydrology plant water relationship data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction vegetation plays a vital role in maintaining the earth s habitability by absorbing carbon dioxide co2 and releasing oxygen fu et al 2020 this is especially important in environments where atmospheric co2 concentrations are expected to rise such that carbon assimilation in forests will help to mitigate the effects of global warming zhu et al 2016 thus many studies have been dedicated to examining the responses of vegetation to climatic and environmental changes chan et al 2018 cristiano et al 2020 fu et al 2020 kuglitsch et al 2008 to some extents variabilities in water use efficiency wue reflect the balance between water loss and carbon gain by vegetation yu et al 2008 thus wue has long been used as a metric to represent the vegetation s behaviours niu et al 2011 generally in an ecosystem wue is defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to evapotranspiration et or transpiration jiang et al 2020 ponton et al 2006 as et and carbon assimilation processes are significantly affected by climatic physiological and vegetation species related factors the wue also strongly depends on these factors jiang et al 2020 van der molen et al 2011 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2008 for example many studies reported that wue exhibits significant positive relationships to air temperature ta and net radiation rn li et al 2018 lin et al 2018 and negative relationship to water vapour pressure deficit vpd yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 however the processes of evapotranspiration et and photosynthesis are complex reichstein et al 2002 yu et al 2008 and the interactions between wue and its potential drivers often differ dramatically among different plant species and climate zones as a result there is still no scientific consensus on the physiological mechanisms responsible for how wue responds to its driving forces for instance the wue may be negatively correlated to ta jiang et al 2020 the relationship between wue and vpd may be parabolic lin et al 2018 or may exhibit significant seasonality reichstein et al 2002 sometimes the responses of wue to a climatic or vegetation factor may be opposite in different cases jiang et al 2020 these phenomena can be attributed to the facts that the impacts of a specific driver e g vpd on wue would be affected or even offset by other factors e g ta yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 for example li et al 2018 found that rn has a greater effect on et than gpp and causes wue and rn to be negatively correlated yang et al 2010 found that wue responds differently to soil water potential at low and high vpd conditions and some studies pointed out that droughts can decrease wue reichstein et al 2002 whereas some other studies reported the opposite effects linderson et al 2012 xie et al 2016b such findings demonstrate the complex relationships between wue and its drivers it is also notable that these complexities are not only reflected by the diverse wue behaviours among various ecosystems but also by the interactive responses of wue to drivers under different conditions e g root zone soil water content meteorological conditions therefore investigating the interactive responses of wue to its drivers is important for understanding and modelling how and to what extents the wue responds to environmental changes on the other hand karst landforms differ from many other landscapes in hydrogeology as they are generally characterized by shallow soil layer high infiltration capacity and complex topography wilcox et al 2007 unlike the non karst landforms where surface runoff and subsurface runoff dominate runoff confluence the quickly infiltrated water on karstic slopes would rapidly move into the underground rivers conduits through enlarged fissures cracks and conduits in the weathered rocks hartmann et al 2014 heilman et al 2014 and lead to water bypassing the root zone arbel et al 2010 dasgupta et al 2006 these hydrogeological features cause the ecohydrological processes that operate in karst ecosystems to differ from those in other ecosystems du et al 2021 hartmann et al 2014 liu et al 2018 to adapt to the karst environment e g low root zone water availability seasonal drought soil nutrient deficiency primeval woody species in karst regions often develop strong and long roots to obtain more water and nutrients from both soil and the epikarst zone e g cracks conduits nie et al 2012 schwinning 2008 these suggest that karstic ecosystems would have different plant water relations from the non karst ecosystems efe 2014 liu et al 2016 and consequently different responses of wue to environmental drivers however to date few studies have focused on this issue to fill these knowledge gaps a two year field experiment was conducted in a karst climax forest based on eddy covariance ec techniques aiming to 1 quantify the influencing factors that control wue in a humid climax karstic forest and 2 investigate the interactive responses of wue to environmental drivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the two year experiment 2018 2019 was carried out in the mulun national nature reserve fig 1 which is located in a typical karst terrain in southwestern china the mulun nature reserve was established in 1991 with the aim of protecting the native subtropical karst ecosystem yang et al 2017 the topography is characterized by steep hills separated by lowland depressions with many potholes caves as well as underground streams du et al 2017 this region has a dominantly subtropical monsoon climate zhang et al 2018 with the mean temperature of 18 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm yr 1 the precipitation is mainly received as rainfall because the air temperature rarely drops to be negative and most of the precipitation 80 is received during the period from april to october precipitation in this region is frequent averagely there are about 160 rainy days per year 1960 2016 the longest dry spell in each year between two consecutive rainfall events has a mean duration of 25 9 8 0 days 1960 2016 the experimental site 25 07 59 n 108 00 38 e 486 m a s l is located in a flat valley where the slope ranges from 1 to 14 fig 1 b in this valley the rate of rock outcrop is 38 5 30 6 and the mean soil depth is 26 8 15 9 cm though it can reach to be 2 0 m in some areas fig 1 f this area is currently a primeval forest yang et al 2017 which belongs to the subtropical evergreen deciduous broad leaved mixed forest zheng 1999 the forest age is 70 years the canopy density of the forest is higher than 0 80 fig 1 g and the canopy height is around 15 m the tree species are dominated by cryptocarya microcarpa f n wei and lindera communis hemsl table 1 besides these due to the high canopy density there are few understory plants in this area fig 1 d which are dominated by elatostema involucratum and pteris fauriei 2 2 field measurements three plots 30 m 40 m were established to investigate the dominant species that thrive in the region and their diameter at breast height dbh only the plants with a dbh 1 0 cm were recorded table 1 three pits were excavated at two corners and the central point of each plot to determine the soil properties of the shallow layers 0 40 cm each pit had dimensions of 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m width length depth soil volume m3 m 3 was determined by using a water tank after stones and roots were picked out from 2018 to 2019 an ec system fig 1 was installed to detect the flux exchanges of co2 water vapor and sensible heat this ec system was installed at a height of 28 5 m and consisted of a li 7500a open path co2 h2o gas analyser li cor inc lincoln ne usa and an ultrasonic anemometer gill windmaster pro uk all data were recorded at 10 hz by using a smartflux module 7550 200 and then block averaged over 30 min periods for analysis meteorological factors such as radiation air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were measured every 30 min based on a meteorological station soil water content was detected using the time domain reflectometry probes tdr hydra probe ii https www fondriest com and recorded every 30 min using a cr1000 data logger the tdr probes were installed within the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm depth horizons 2 3 data quality control and the water use efficient wue before analysis the data were checked for their quality some of the data were deleted according to the following criteria 1 data collected during periods when normal instrumental operations were interrupted e g by rainfall or power failure were excluded 2 data collected when the friction velocity u was 0 2 m s 1 were excluded and 3 data collected when the sensible flux or latent heat flux was negative were excluded following these exclusions a total of 4839 acceptable daytime from 8 00 am to 6 00 pm half hourly samples were collected including nee net ecosystem co2 exchange et evapotranspiration bowen ratio calculated using the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux swc soil water content vpd water vapor pressure deficit rn net radiation and ta air temperature the main reasons for that 4839 samples were acceptable are the frequent rainfalls 300 rainy days in these two years and low friction velocity u however the selected samples covered well all the months and could reliably represent the results of this forest the wue was defined as the ratio of gpp gross primary production to et evapotranspiration calculated using the latent heat fluxes in this study 1 wue g p p e t where et was measured directly by the ec technique the latent heat fluxes as the ec system directly measures the net ecosystem co2 exchange nee but not the gpp the gpp was estimated as 2 gpp n e p r e n e e r e where r e is the ecosystem respiration which was estimated using the night time nee here particularly the night time data e g when shortwave radiation 20 0 w m 2 were filtered according to the same criteria mentioned above based on the selected samples the relationships between night time nee night time r e because photosynthesis ceased in this case and the environmental factors e g ta swc were investigated by using regression methods results showed a strong relationship r 2 0 69 p 0 05 between r e and ta fig 2 lloyd and taylor 1994 yu et al 2008 the regression model fig 2 was then used to estimate the half hourly daytime r e 3 r e 3 66 e 0 127 t a 16 9 on the other hand the mean swc was estimated by using the following equation 4 swc k 1 k sw k d k k 1 k d k where k is the number of soil layers swk is the soil moisture content in the k th layer and dk is the depth or thickness of the k th layer 2 4 data analysis the dynamic patterns of meteorological factors were analysed firstly after then based on the 4839 samples the relationships between gpp et and meteorological factors and swc were fitted using polynormal exponential logarithmic and power equations the regression model with the highest determination coefficient r 2 were selected as the optimized model note that statistically significant were determined with p 0 05 similarly linear and or nonlinear equations e g polynormal exponential logarithmic and power equations were used to fit the relationships between wue and its drivers including ta vpd rn swc and the bowen ratio according to the relationship between wue and each driver a multiple nonlinear regression model for predicting wue was developed using the least squares method and stepwise regression method particularly the stepwise regression method was used to avoid the multicollinearity problem in the stepwise regression the independent variables were transformed using the corresponding regression model mentioned above for example if the relationship between wue and ta can be expressed best by using an exponential function e g wue a exp b ta a and b are coefficients then the term exp b ta but not ta was used as the independent variable in the stepwise regression note that in the stepwise regression the entrance and exit tolerances for the p values of f statistics was set to be 0 05 and 0 1 respectively then the selected variables based on the stepwise regression were used as the variables in the final wue model which was developed using the least squares method on the other hand the relationship between wue and a specific driver e g vpd denoted as the secondary variable here in this case can be affected significantly by other drivers e g swc ta or rn denoted as the tertiary variable here in this case to investigate the interactive response of wue to the potential drivers pearson correlation analyses were conducted between wue and each secondary variable as tertiary variables changed concomitantly for example when investigating the impacts of vpd on the responses of wue to ta all the data were divided into six parts according to the vpd which was divided into six equally intervals e g vpd 0 61 kpa 0 61 vpd 1 22 kpa 1 22 vpd 1 83 kpa 1 83 vpd 2 44 kpa 2 44 vpd 3 06 kpa and vpd 3 06 kpa table 2 then the pearson correlation analyses were conducted between wue and ta in each vpd interval and finally a total of six correlations could be obtained based on these the impacts of vpd on the response of wue to ta was investigated by analysing the relationship between these correlations and vpd note here that the correlation was considered to be significant when the p value was lower than 0 05 e g p 0 05 the same procedure was conducted for all the five drivers e g vpd ta rn swc and bowen ration table 2 3 results 3 1 dynamics of environmental factors during the two experimental years there were a total of 312 rainy days e g mean of 156 days per year which represents 42 7 of the experiment s duration this result was close to the region s long term mean of 161 0 days per year fig 3 a the longest dry spell was 23 days which was also close to the long term mean of 25 9 8 0 days the mean annual precipitation was 1284 0 mm yr 1 of which 84 8 was received between april and october the air temperature was mainly higher than 10 0 c in winter and lower than 30 0 c in summer fig 3 b with the mean being 18 7 7 0 c the wind speed fluctuated around 1 0 m s 1 fig 3 d with a mean of 0 88 0 33 m s 1 the mean daily net radiation was 10 0 6 7 mj m

respectively the mean vpd over the two year period was 0 25 0 2 kpa fig 3 f frequent precipitation during this period caused the swc to remain high although it decreased to 0 30 cm3 cm 3 on rare occasions fig 3 g overall the mean swc was 0 44 cm3 cm 3 being slightly lower than the saturated swc table 1 3 2 dynamics of gpp et and their influencing factors seasonal dynamics of gpp and et half hourly in this forest are shown in fig 4 like the ta and rn fig 3 both the gpp and et increased gradually from low values in january and reached to their highest levels in august and then decreased again to relative low levels in december fig 4 results showed that the mean gpp in spring march june summer july october autumn september november and winter december february in the next year were 0 76 0 33 mg m 2 s 1 1 24 0 30 mg m 2 s 1 0 99 0 33 mg m 2 s 1 and 0 46 0 18 mg m 2 s 1 respectively and the mean et were 0 055 0 036 g m 2 s 1 0 096 0 040 g m 2 s 1 0 077 0 041 g m 2 s 1 and 0 029 0 018 g m 2 s 1 respectively during the two years the overall mean gpp and et were 0 85 0 41 mg m 2 s 1 and 0 064 0 043 g m 2 s 1 respectively the optimized relationships e g the regression models among gpp et and their potential drivers are shown in fig 5 it is notable that relationships between gpp et and ta could be fitted well p 0 05 by using exponential equations of which the r 2 values were 0 80 gpp and 0 46 et respectively fig 5 b e linear functions provided a good fit p 0 05 for the relationships among gpp et rn and vpd with the r 2 being approximately 0 40 fig 5 c d f g however no significant relationship could be found between gpp and swc or between et and swc overall the gpp and et could both be expressed well p 0 05 by two similar equations with ta vpd and rn being the independent variables 5 gpp 0 124 e 0 071 t a 6 8 10 4 r n 7 2 10 6 v p d r 2 0 84 6 et 4 4 10 4 e 0 135 t a 2 2 10 4 r n 1 1 10 5 v p d r 2 0 86 on the other hand the gpp also showed a strong and linear relationship to et with the determination coefficient r 2 of 0 56 fig 5 a particularly the gpp and et were closely coupled when et was relatively low e g 0 10 g m 2 s 1 but showed a large dispersion when et was relatively high e g 0 10 g m 2 s 1 fig 5 a 3 3 wue and its drivers seasonal dynamics of wue are shown in fig 6 being opposite to the gpp and et fig 4 relatively high wue were observed in winter and low wue were recorded in summer fig 6 the mean gpp in spring summer autumn and winter were 8 68 4 33 mg co2 g 1 h2o 4 69 3 01 mg co2 g 1 h2o 7 41 4 38 mg co2 g 1 h2o and 12 79 4 67 mg co2 g 1 h2o respectively and the overall mean wue during the two years was 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o the wue exhibited close relationships with meteorological factors and swc fig 7 the relationship between wue and vpd was expressed best by an exponential function r 2 0 23 p 0 05 fig 7 a other functions proposed in previous studies e g power function beer et al 2009 katul et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 produced relatively poorer determination coefficients e g r 2 0 15 when using a power function no significant relationship between wue and swc fig 7 b could be found when all the data were used

relationships between wue and ta r 2 0 42 p 0 05 and between wue and rn r 2 0 28 p 0 05 fig 7 d fig 7 e besides these a significant correlation was found between wue and the bowen ratio r 2 0 17 p 0

cm3 cm 3 c and w m 2 respectively 3 4 interactive responses of wue to its drivers as shown in fig 7 the relationship between wue and any specific driver e g vpd was noticeably affected by other factors e g swc to investigate the interactive responses of wue to its drivers correlation analyses were conducted between wue and a secondary factor e g vpd while tertiary factors e g rn swc ta and bowen ratio varied concomitantly table 2 the changes of the correlations and the corresponding tertiary factors are illustrated in fig 9 clearly the correlations between wue and bowen ratio were mainly positive but those for ta swc rn and vpd were generally negative regardless of the tertiary factors fig 9 however all these correlations changed significantly along with the tertiary factors particularly the correlations for bowen ratio meaning the correlations between wue and bowen ratio generally decreased with increasing vpd fig 9 a1 ta fig 9 a3 and rn fig 9 a4 and increased decreased with increasing swc when swc was lower higher than 0 35 cm3 cm 3 fig 9 a2 as for the vpd the correlations mainly increased with increasing bowen ratio but decreased with increasing swc ta and rn fig 9 b1 b4 those correlations for ta generally increased with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 c1 and decreased with increasing swc fig 9 c2 and rn fig 9 c4 and were strongest when vpd was lower than 1 22 kpa fig 9 c3 as for swc the correlations showed a decreasing trend with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 d1 and ta fig 9 d2 and decreasing trend with increasing rn fig 9 d4 and initially decreased and then increased with increases in the vpd and was strongest when 1 22 vpd 1 83 kpa fig 9 d3 and the correlations for the rn mainly increased with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 e1 and decreased with increasing ta fig 9 e2 vpd fig 9 e3 and swc fig 9 e4 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of gpp and et and the factors the meteorological data indicated that 2018 and 2019 were normal years in terms of the weather conditions as the number of rainy days the longest dry spell total precipitation amount and air temperature were close to the long term mean values section 2 1 fig 3 in these two years the mean gpp and et were 0 85 0 41 mg m 2 s 1 and 0 064 0 043 g m 2 s 1 respectively these values were similar to those reported in previous studies in similar climate zones yu et al 2008 being consistent with the previous findings du et al 2021 ma et al 2019 saugier et al 1997 the gpp and et were correlated strongly to the meteorological factors fig 5 though the individual responses of gpp and et to these factors were different particularly gpp and et showed exponential relationships to ta fig 5 b e but linear relationships to rn and vpd fig 5 c d f g the linear relationship between gpp and vpd is quite unexpected because many studies suggested that gpp is nonlinearly related to vpd because gpp can be limited by high vpd goodrich et al 2015 gui et al 2021 yu et al 2008 for example yu et al 2008 pointed out that gpp is suppressed when vpd 1 75 kpa in a subtropical coniferous plantation 26 44 n 115 03 e and goodrich et al 2015 reported that gpp in summer is limited by high vpd in a new zealand bog besides these in some ecosystems or regions high ta and rn also have the potential to reduce gpp for example yu et al 2008 found that gpp is suppressed when ta 25 c and rn 580 w m 2 in a subtropical coniferous forest and is suppressed when ta 21 c in a subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest 23 10 n 112 34 e the explanation for the linear relationships among gpp vpd and rn here might be that each biome having different species the climatic conditions and the root zone water availability chen et al 2021 moreover the broadly similar responses of gpp and et to meteorological factors fig 5 suggested that variances in climatic drivers promote photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes to approximately equal degrees yu et al 2008 this could be demonstrated by the strong linear correlation between gpp and et fig 5 a although extensive dispersion occurred when et 0 10 g m 2 s 1 overall the meteorological factors ta rn and vpd could account for 85 of variances in gpp and et indicated by the determination coefficient r 2 0 85 of the regression models e g eq 5 and eq 6 however no significant relationship among swc gpp and et could be found these did not mean that swc is not important for gpp and et the reasonable explanation would be the high swc fig 3 g which stopped plants from experiencing water stress du et al 2021 from this perspective the high swc could also express the linear relationships among gpp vpd and rn fig 5 b c because when root zone water is abundant the plants would not have to close their stomata to regulate water balance which generally tends to depress photosynthesis and reduce gpp chen et al 2021 goodrich et al 2015 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 4 2 responses of wue to environmental factors the temporal dynamic patterns of wue fig 6 were consistent with the findings in many previous studies conducted in tropical and subtropical regions cristiano et al 2020 kim et al 2021 the observed mean wue 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o was also within the normal ranges of ecosystem wue e g approximately 2 4 19 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o kim et al 2021 kuglitsch et al 2008 lin et al 2018 xie et al 2016a yu et al 2008 and in good agreement with the findings in similar climate zones li et al 2019 liu et al 2015 song et al 2017 yu et al 2008 for example the mean wue is 6 7 mg co2 g 1 h2o in dinghushan 23 10 n 112 34 e yu et al 2008 and is 9 09 mg co2 g 1 h2o in ailaoshan 24 32 n 101 01 e song et al 2017 beside these results showed that wue was strongly correlated to the meteorological factors and swc fig 7 tan et al 2015 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 generally the relationships between wue and vpd rn ta and the bowen ratio were more significant than those between wue and swc fig 7 b the negative relationships among wue ta vpd and rn matched those in previous studies beer et al 2009 chen et al 2021 cristiano et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 xie et al 2016b as et and gpp were positively correlated to ta vpd and rn fig 5 disproportionate increases in et and gpp with increasing ta vpd and rn could explain these negative relationships jiang et al 2020 note here that positive correlations could be also observed between wue ta rn in some ecosystems song et al 2017 xie et al 2016a overall the relationship between swc and wue was relatively weak compared to other factors fig 7 b the reason should be the high swc which was caused by frequent precipitation generally 0 3 cm3 cm 3 fig 3 g du et al 2021 however when swc dropped to low level e g during dry spells swc become highly influential on wue fig 7 b for example when vpd 1 5 kpa swc affected wue significantly e g wue 20 32 swc 12 07 r 2 0 13 p 0 05 fig 7 b by contrast it is notable that wue was positively and linearly correlated to the bowen ratio indicating that high wue is generally associated with high bowen ratio fig 7 c the explanation is that the bowen ratio can reflect the energy balance between the ecosystem and atmosphere generally a high bowen ratio means more energy e g solar radiation transforms into sensible heat when the vegetation is water stressed usually slightly water stressed vegetation would have a higher wue which can be demonstrated by the negative correlation between wue and swc presented above though the wue was significantly correlated to the potential drivers fig 7 the calculated determination coefficients r2 were low generally r 2 0 4 suggesting that individual driver e g ta vpd could not satisfactorily account for the variances in wue the main reason would be that the impacts that a specific driver has on wue could be affected obviously by other factors fig 9 for example the negative correlation between wue and vpd decreased with increasing swc fig 9 b2 meaning that wue was more reduced by high values of vpd when swc was high similarly the negative correlation between wue and swc was subdued with increasing vpd fig 9 d3 indicating that high swc could cause more significant decrease in wue when vpd was high these results are reasonable because higher swc and vpd often lead to higher transpiration rates in this region high vpd usually occurs with high temperature and enhanced solar radiation thus in periods with high vpd more water is transpired for cooling but not for co2 fixation and consequently lead to low wue these findings are in good agreement with those in yang et al 2010 who found that wue responds to soil water potential in opposite ways depending on vpd therefore it can be concluded that the importance of a driver for wue depends strongly on the environmental conditions nevertheless though wue and its drivers have many mutually related response patterns the wue could be satisfactorily expressed by these environmental drivers e g eq 7 r 2 0 78 fig 8 in eq 7 the regression coefficients for vpd swc ta and rn are negative and that for the bowen ratio is positive eq 7 matching well the negative or positive correlations shown in fig 7 the determination coefficient r 2 0 78 of this regression model indicated that the variances in vpd ta rn the bowen ratio and swc could jointly account for the major part e g 78 of the changes in wue the underlying drivers for rest part e g 22 which could not be expressed by eq 7 would be the interactive responses of wue to these drivers fig 9 and the changes of the biological factors such as the leaf area index growth status besides the advantages there are still some limitations of this study first these results are based on half hourly measurements previous studies pointed out that the responses of wue to its drivers at different time scales e g daily or longer may be different song et al 2017 yu et al 2008 moreover because some of the data were not available acceptable due to the frequent precipitation the limited samples would also result in some uncertainties though the selected data covered all the months well second the two experimental years are two normal years though some dry spells did exist therefore it is hard to obtain more information for the wue behaviours under extreme conditions e g during droughts third this study focused on the impacts of environmental factors on wue however other factors especially the biological factors e g leaf area index mortality would have important roles in affecting wue nevertheless this study demonstrated that the wue is jointly and interactively controlled by multiple factors and the importance of a driver to wue strongly depends on the environmental conditions 4 3 implications of the findings water use efficiency is a critical index for describing carbon water coupling in terrestrial ecosystems niu et al 2011 which has long been used as an effective metric to represent the vegetation s behaviours in many studies the wue is used to estimate gpp beer et al 2007 or et yang et al 2013 and to identify the ecosystem responses to environmental changes especially in a changing environment with rising air co2 and temperature cheng et al 2017 in these studies the vpd is often used as the key environmental factor to quantify the wue cheng et al 2017 for example using the relationship of wue vpd 1 meaning that wue is assumed to be proportional to 1 vpd dewar 1997 or wue vpd 0 5 meaning that wue is assumed to be proportional to 1 vpd0 5 which is derived based on the stomatal optimization theory at leaf level beer et al 2009 katul et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 more recently yang et al 2010 provided evidences that the ecosystem wue also follows the wue vpd 0 5 at the canopy scale however the findings in this study demonstrated that the wue was neither proportional to vpd 1 nor to vpd 0 5 but exhibited large dispersion which could be fitted using an exponential function fig 7 a this large dispersion should be caused by the mutually related impacts of other potential drivers on wue including ta rn swc fig 9 and the complexity of the canopy structures and components therefore these findings implied that in modelling the interactions among vegetation water and carbon the modelers should be cautious about the versatility of the model especially when applying wue response models at environmental conditions different from those at which they are derived 5 conclusions this study conducted a two year experiment to investigate wue and its drivers in a karstic climax forest in southwestern china results showed that the mean wue was 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o which was not only closely related to meteorological factors and swc but also affected obviously by the bowen ratio though no single environmental factor could satisfactorily explain the changes in wue the environmental factors e g vpd swc rn ta and the bowen ratio could jointly account for the majority 78 of it the residual error of the wue predicting model r 2 0 78 would be that besides the biological factors the responses of wue to a specific factor was affected obviously by other coexisting factors these indicated that the importance of a factor to wue strongly depends on the environment as the wue response formulas are often used to model the interactions between vegetation and environment these findings above suggested that modelers should be cautious when applying wue response formulas to predict the ecosystem s responses to the changing environment and more works are still needed to further reveal the complex ecosystem behaviours induced by environmental

2358,water use efficiency wue is a key parameter that measures the balance between carbon gain and water loss in an ecosystem achieving better understanding of how wue responds to environmental drivers is critical for revealing ecohydrological processes and mechanisms and for biophysical modelling to investigate the interactions between vegetation and the changing environment karst landforms cover 10 of the earth s land surface however to date few studies have focused on the behaviours of wue in karstic ecosystems to fill these knowledge gaps a two year experiment was conducted to investigate the wue and its drivers in a climax karst forest in southwestern china results showed that both the gpp gross primary production and et evapotranspiration showed exponential relationships to ta air temperature p 0 05 but linear relationships to rn net radiation r 2 0 38 gpp and 0 78 et p 0 05 and vpd water vapour pressure deficit r 2 0 36 gpp and 0 28 et p 0 05 being quite different from those in other ecosystems the reasons would be the different habits of the karstic plants and the facts that the root zone water availability rarely dropped to low levels due to the frequent precipitation the wue with the mean of 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o exhibited negative relationships to vpd r 2 0 23 p 0 05 rn r 2 0 28 p 0 05 and ta air temperature r 2 0 42 p 0 05 and a positive linear relationship to the bowen ratio r 2 0 17 p 0 05 besides these results also showed that the effects of a specific driver e g vpd on wue was affected obviously by other factors e g ta rn indicating that whether a driver is important or not to wue depends strongly on the environmental conditions as the wue response formulas are often used to investigate and model the interactions between vegetation and environment these findings suggested that the modelers should caution the versatility of the wue response formulas keywords water use efficiency water depletion ecohydrology plant water relationship data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction vegetation plays a vital role in maintaining the earth s habitability by absorbing carbon dioxide co2 and releasing oxygen fu et al 2020 this is especially important in environments where atmospheric co2 concentrations are expected to rise such that carbon assimilation in forests will help to mitigate the effects of global warming zhu et al 2016 thus many studies have been dedicated to examining the responses of vegetation to climatic and environmental changes chan et al 2018 cristiano et al 2020 fu et al 2020 kuglitsch et al 2008 to some extents variabilities in water use efficiency wue reflect the balance between water loss and carbon gain by vegetation yu et al 2008 thus wue has long been used as a metric to represent the vegetation s behaviours niu et al 2011 generally in an ecosystem wue is defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to evapotranspiration et or transpiration jiang et al 2020 ponton et al 2006 as et and carbon assimilation processes are significantly affected by climatic physiological and vegetation species related factors the wue also strongly depends on these factors jiang et al 2020 van der molen et al 2011 yang et al 2019 yu et al 2008 for example many studies reported that wue exhibits significant positive relationships to air temperature ta and net radiation rn li et al 2018 lin et al 2018 and negative relationship to water vapour pressure deficit vpd yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 however the processes of evapotranspiration et and photosynthesis are complex reichstein et al 2002 yu et al 2008 and the interactions between wue and its potential drivers often differ dramatically among different plant species and climate zones as a result there is still no scientific consensus on the physiological mechanisms responsible for how wue responds to its driving forces for instance the wue may be negatively correlated to ta jiang et al 2020 the relationship between wue and vpd may be parabolic lin et al 2018 or may exhibit significant seasonality reichstein et al 2002 sometimes the responses of wue to a climatic or vegetation factor may be opposite in different cases jiang et al 2020 these phenomena can be attributed to the facts that the impacts of a specific driver e g vpd on wue would be affected or even offset by other factors e g ta yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 for example li et al 2018 found that rn has a greater effect on et than gpp and causes wue and rn to be negatively correlated yang et al 2010 found that wue responds differently to soil water potential at low and high vpd conditions and some studies pointed out that droughts can decrease wue reichstein et al 2002 whereas some other studies reported the opposite effects linderson et al 2012 xie et al 2016b such findings demonstrate the complex relationships between wue and its drivers it is also notable that these complexities are not only reflected by the diverse wue behaviours among various ecosystems but also by the interactive responses of wue to drivers under different conditions e g root zone soil water content meteorological conditions therefore investigating the interactive responses of wue to its drivers is important for understanding and modelling how and to what extents the wue responds to environmental changes on the other hand karst landforms differ from many other landscapes in hydrogeology as they are generally characterized by shallow soil layer high infiltration capacity and complex topography wilcox et al 2007 unlike the non karst landforms where surface runoff and subsurface runoff dominate runoff confluence the quickly infiltrated water on karstic slopes would rapidly move into the underground rivers conduits through enlarged fissures cracks and conduits in the weathered rocks hartmann et al 2014 heilman et al 2014 and lead to water bypassing the root zone arbel et al 2010 dasgupta et al 2006 these hydrogeological features cause the ecohydrological processes that operate in karst ecosystems to differ from those in other ecosystems du et al 2021 hartmann et al 2014 liu et al 2018 to adapt to the karst environment e g low root zone water availability seasonal drought soil nutrient deficiency primeval woody species in karst regions often develop strong and long roots to obtain more water and nutrients from both soil and the epikarst zone e g cracks conduits nie et al 2012 schwinning 2008 these suggest that karstic ecosystems would have different plant water relations from the non karst ecosystems efe 2014 liu et al 2016 and consequently different responses of wue to environmental drivers however to date few studies have focused on this issue to fill these knowledge gaps a two year field experiment was conducted in a karst climax forest based on eddy covariance ec techniques aiming to 1 quantify the influencing factors that control wue in a humid climax karstic forest and 2 investigate the interactive responses of wue to environmental drivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the two year experiment 2018 2019 was carried out in the mulun national nature reserve fig 1 which is located in a typical karst terrain in southwestern china the mulun nature reserve was established in 1991 with the aim of protecting the native subtropical karst ecosystem yang et al 2017 the topography is characterized by steep hills separated by lowland depressions with many potholes caves as well as underground streams du et al 2017 this region has a dominantly subtropical monsoon climate zhang et al 2018 with the mean temperature of 18 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 1389 mm yr 1 the precipitation is mainly received as rainfall because the air temperature rarely drops to be negative and most of the precipitation 80 is received during the period from april to october precipitation in this region is frequent averagely there are about 160 rainy days per year 1960 2016 the longest dry spell in each year between two consecutive rainfall events has a mean duration of 25 9 8 0 days 1960 2016 the experimental site 25 07 59 n 108 00 38 e 486 m a s l is located in a flat valley where the slope ranges from 1 to 14 fig 1 b in this valley the rate of rock outcrop is 38 5 30 6 and the mean soil depth is 26 8 15 9 cm though it can reach to be 2 0 m in some areas fig 1 f this area is currently a primeval forest yang et al 2017 which belongs to the subtropical evergreen deciduous broad leaved mixed forest zheng 1999 the forest age is 70 years the canopy density of the forest is higher than 0 80 fig 1 g and the canopy height is around 15 m the tree species are dominated by cryptocarya microcarpa f n wei and lindera communis hemsl table 1 besides these due to the high canopy density there are few understory plants in this area fig 1 d which are dominated by elatostema involucratum and pteris fauriei 2 2 field measurements three plots 30 m 40 m were established to investigate the dominant species that thrive in the region and their diameter at breast height dbh only the plants with a dbh 1 0 cm were recorded table 1 three pits were excavated at two corners and the central point of each plot to determine the soil properties of the shallow layers 0 40 cm each pit had dimensions of 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 4 m width length depth soil volume m3 m 3 was determined by using a water tank after stones and roots were picked out from 2018 to 2019 an ec system fig 1 was installed to detect the flux exchanges of co2 water vapor and sensible heat this ec system was installed at a height of 28 5 m and consisted of a li 7500a open path co2 h2o gas analyser li cor inc lincoln ne usa and an ultrasonic anemometer gill windmaster pro uk all data were recorded at 10 hz by using a smartflux module 7550 200 and then block averaged over 30 min periods for analysis meteorological factors such as radiation air pressure air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were measured every 30 min based on a meteorological station soil water content was detected using the time domain reflectometry probes tdr hydra probe ii https www fondriest com and recorded every 30 min using a cr1000 data logger the tdr probes were installed within the 0 5 cm 5 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm depth horizons 2 3 data quality control and the water use efficient wue before analysis the data were checked for their quality some of the data were deleted according to the following criteria 1 data collected during periods when normal instrumental operations were interrupted e g by rainfall or power failure were excluded 2 data collected when the friction velocity u was 0 2 m s 1 were excluded and 3 data collected when the sensible flux or latent heat flux was negative were excluded following these exclusions a total of 4839 acceptable daytime from 8 00 am to 6 00 pm half hourly samples were collected including nee net ecosystem co2 exchange et evapotranspiration bowen ratio calculated using the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux swc soil water content vpd water vapor pressure deficit rn net radiation and ta air temperature the main reasons for that 4839 samples were acceptable are the frequent rainfalls 300 rainy days in these two years and low friction velocity u however the selected samples covered well all the months and could reliably represent the results of this forest the wue was defined as the ratio of gpp gross primary production to et evapotranspiration calculated using the latent heat fluxes in this study 1 wue g p p e t where et was measured directly by the ec technique the latent heat fluxes as the ec system directly measures the net ecosystem co2 exchange nee but not the gpp the gpp was estimated as 2 gpp n e p r e n e e r e where r e is the ecosystem respiration which was estimated using the night time nee here particularly the night time data e g when shortwave radiation 20 0 w m 2 were filtered according to the same criteria mentioned above based on the selected samples the relationships between night time nee night time r e because photosynthesis ceased in this case and the environmental factors e g ta swc were investigated by using regression methods results showed a strong relationship r 2 0 69 p 0 05 between r e and ta fig 2 lloyd and taylor 1994 yu et al 2008 the regression model fig 2 was then used to estimate the half hourly daytime r e 3 r e 3 66 e 0 127 t a 16 9 on the other hand the mean swc was estimated by using the following equation 4 swc k 1 k sw k d k k 1 k d k where k is the number of soil layers swk is the soil moisture content in the k th layer and dk is the depth or thickness of the k th layer 2 4 data analysis the dynamic patterns of meteorological factors were analysed firstly after then based on the 4839 samples the relationships between gpp et and meteorological factors and swc were fitted using polynormal exponential logarithmic and power equations the regression model with the highest determination coefficient r 2 were selected as the optimized model note that statistically significant were determined with p 0 05 similarly linear and or nonlinear equations e g polynormal exponential logarithmic and power equations were used to fit the relationships between wue and its drivers including ta vpd rn swc and the bowen ratio according to the relationship between wue and each driver a multiple nonlinear regression model for predicting wue was developed using the least squares method and stepwise regression method particularly the stepwise regression method was used to avoid the multicollinearity problem in the stepwise regression the independent variables were transformed using the corresponding regression model mentioned above for example if the relationship between wue and ta can be expressed best by using an exponential function e g wue a exp b ta a and b are coefficients then the term exp b ta but not ta was used as the independent variable in the stepwise regression note that in the stepwise regression the entrance and exit tolerances for the p values of f statistics was set to be 0 05 and 0 1 respectively then the selected variables based on the stepwise regression were used as the variables in the final wue model which was developed using the least squares method on the other hand the relationship between wue and a specific driver e g vpd denoted as the secondary variable here in this case can be affected significantly by other drivers e g swc ta or rn denoted as the tertiary variable here in this case to investigate the interactive response of wue to the potential drivers pearson correlation analyses were conducted between wue and each secondary variable as tertiary variables changed concomitantly for example when investigating the impacts of vpd on the responses of wue to ta all the data were divided into six parts according to the vpd which was divided into six equally intervals e g vpd 0 61 kpa 0 61 vpd 1 22 kpa 1 22 vpd 1 83 kpa 1 83 vpd 2 44 kpa 2 44 vpd 3 06 kpa and vpd 3 06 kpa table 2 then the pearson correlation analyses were conducted between wue and ta in each vpd interval and finally a total of six correlations could be obtained based on these the impacts of vpd on the response of wue to ta was investigated by analysing the relationship between these correlations and vpd note here that the correlation was considered to be significant when the p value was lower than 0 05 e g p 0 05 the same procedure was conducted for all the five drivers e g vpd ta rn swc and bowen ration table 2 3 results 3 1 dynamics of environmental factors during the two experimental years there were a total of 312 rainy days e g mean of 156 days per year which represents 42 7 of the experiment s duration this result was close to the region s long term mean of 161 0 days per year fig 3 a the longest dry spell was 23 days which was also close to the long term mean of 25 9 8 0 days the mean annual precipitation was 1284 0 mm yr 1 of which 84 8 was received between april and october the air temperature was mainly higher than 10 0 c in winter and lower than 30 0 c in summer fig 3 b with the mean being 18 7 7 0 c the wind speed fluctuated around 1 0 m s 1 fig 3 d with a mean of 0 88 0 33 m s 1 the mean daily net radiation was 10 0 6 7 mj m

respectively the mean vpd over the two year period was 0 25 0 2 kpa fig 3 f frequent precipitation during this period caused the swc to remain high although it decreased to 0 30 cm3 cm 3 on rare occasions fig 3 g overall the mean swc was 0 44 cm3 cm 3 being slightly lower than the saturated swc table 1 3 2 dynamics of gpp et and their influencing factors seasonal dynamics of gpp and et half hourly in this forest are shown in fig 4 like the ta and rn fig 3 both the gpp and et increased gradually from low values in january and reached to their highest levels in august and then decreased again to relative low levels in december fig 4 results showed that the mean gpp in spring march june summer july october autumn september november and winter december february in the next year were 0

gpp et and their potential drivers are shown in fig 5 it is notable that relationships between gpp et and ta could be fitted well p 0 05 by using exponential equations of which the r 2 values were 0 80 gpp and 0 46 et respectively fig 5 b e linear functions provided a good fit p 0 05 for the relationships among gpp et rn and vpd with the r 2 being approximately 0 40 fig 5 c d f g however no significant relationship could be found between gpp and swc or between et and swc overall the gpp and et could both be expressed well p 0 05 by two similar equations with ta vpd and rn being the

linear relationship to et with the determination coefficient r 2 of 0 56 fig 5 a particularly the gpp and et were closely coupled when et was relatively low e g 0 10 g m 2 s 1 but showed a large dispersion when et was relatively high e g 0 10 g m 2 s 1 fig 5 a 3 3 wue and its drivers seasonal dynamics of wue are shown in fig 6 being opposite to the gpp and et fig 4 relatively high wue were observed in winter and low wue were recorded in summer fig 6 the mean gpp in spring summer autumn and winter were 8 68 4 33 mg co2 g 1 h2o 4 69 3 01 mg co2 g 1 h2o 7 41 4 38 mg co2 g 1 h2o and 12 79 4

2014 produced relatively poorer determination coefficients e g r 2 0 15 when using a power function no significant relationship between wue and swc fig 7 b could be found when all the data were used

factors e g swc to investigate the interactive responses of wue to its drivers correlation analyses were conducted between wue and a secondary factor e g vpd while tertiary factors e g rn swc ta and bowen ratio varied concomitantly table 2 the changes of the correlations and the corresponding tertiary factors are illustrated in fig 9 clearly the correlations between wue and bowen ratio were mainly positive but those for ta swc rn and vpd were generally negative regardless of the tertiary factors fig 9 however all these correlations changed significantly along with the tertiary factors particularly the correlations for bowen ratio meaning the correlations between wue and bowen ratio generally decreased with increasing vpd fig 9 a1 ta fig 9 a3 and rn fig 9 a4 and increased decreased with increasing swc when swc was lower higher than 0 35 cm3 cm 3 fig 9 a2 as for the vpd the correlations mainly increased with increasing bowen ratio but decreased with increasing swc ta and rn fig 9 b1 b4 those correlations for ta generally increased with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 c1 and decreased with increasing swc fig 9 c2 and rn fig 9 c4 and were strongest when vpd was lower than 1 22 kpa fig 9 c3 as for swc the correlations showed a decreasing trend with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 d1 and ta fig 9 d2 and decreasing trend with increasing rn fig 9 d4 and initially decreased and then increased with increases in the vpd and was strongest when 1 22 vpd 1 83 kpa fig 9 d3 and the correlations for the rn mainly increased with increasing bowen ratio fig 9 e1 and decreased with increasing ta fig 9 e2 vpd fig 9 e3 and swc fig 9 e4 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of gpp and et and the factors the meteorological data indicated that 2018 and 2019 were normal years in terms of the weather conditions as the number of rainy days the longest dry spell total precipitation amount and air temperature were close to the long term mean values section 2 1 fig 3 in these two years the mean gpp and et were 0 85 0 41 mg m 2 s 1 and 0 064 0 043 g m 2 s 1 respectively these values were similar to those reported in previous studies in similar climate zones yu et al 2008 being consistent with the previous findings du et al 2021 ma et al 2019 saugier et al 1997 the gpp and et were correlated strongly to the meteorological factors fig 5 though the individual responses of gpp and et to these factors were different particularly gpp and et showed exponential relationships to ta fig 5 b e but linear relationships to rn and vpd fig 5 c d f g the linear relationship between gpp and vpd is quite unexpected because many studies suggested that gpp is nonlinearly related to vpd because gpp can be limited by high vpd goodrich et al 2015 gui et al 2021 yu et al 2008 for example yu et al 2008 pointed out that gpp is suppressed when vpd 1 75 kpa in a subtropical coniferous plantation 26 44 n 115 03 e and goodrich et al 2015 reported that gpp in summer is limited by high vpd in a new zealand bog besides these in some ecosystems or regions high ta and rn also have the potential to reduce gpp for example yu et al 2008 found that gpp is suppressed when ta 25 c and rn 580 w m 2 in a subtropical coniferous forest and is suppressed when ta 21 c in a subtropical evergreen broad leaved forest 23 10 n 112 34 e the explanation for the linear relationships among gpp vpd and rn here might be that each biome having different species the climatic conditions and the root zone water availability chen et al 2021 moreover the broadly similar responses of gpp and et to meteorological factors fig 5 suggested that variances in climatic drivers promote photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes to approximately equal degrees yu et al 2008 this could be demonstrated by the strong linear correlation between gpp and et fig 5 a although extensive dispersion occurred when et 0 10 g m 2 s 1 overall the meteorological factors ta rn and vpd could account for 85 of variances in gpp and et indicated by the determination coefficient r 2 0 85 of the regression models e g eq 5 and eq 6 however no significant relationship among swc gpp and et could be found these did not mean that swc is not important for gpp and et the reasonable explanation would be the high swc fig 3 g which stopped plants from experiencing water stress du et al 2021 from this perspective the high swc could also express the linear relationships among gpp vpd and rn fig 5 b c because when root zone water is abundant the plants would not have to close their stomata to regulate water balance which generally tends to depress photosynthesis and reduce gpp chen et al 2021 goodrich et al 2015 yu et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 4 2 responses of wue to environmental factors the temporal dynamic patterns of wue fig 6 were consistent with the findings in many previous studies conducted in tropical and subtropical regions cristiano et al 2020 kim et al 2021 the observed mean wue 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o was also within the normal ranges of ecosystem wue e g approximately 2 4 19 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o kim et al 2021 kuglitsch et al 2008 lin et al 2018 xie et al 2016a yu et al 2008 and in good agreement with the findings in similar climate zones li et al 2019 liu et al 2015 song et al 2017 yu et al 2008 for example the mean wue is 6 7 mg co2 g 1 h2o in dinghushan 23 10 n 112 34 e yu et al 2008 and is 9 09 mg co2 g 1 h2o in ailaoshan 24 32 n 101 01 e song et al 2017 beside these results showed that wue was strongly correlated to the meteorological factors and swc fig 7 tan et al 2015 yang et al 2009 yang et al 2010 generally the relationships between wue and vpd rn ta and the bowen ratio were more significant than those between wue and swc fig 7 b the negative relationships among wue ta vpd and rn matched those in previous studies beer et al 2009 chen et al 2021 cristiano et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 xie et al 2016b as et and gpp were positively correlated to ta vpd and rn fig 5 disproportionate increases in et and gpp with increasing ta vpd and rn could explain these negative relationships jiang et al 2020 note here that positive correlations could be also observed between wue ta rn in some ecosystems song et al 2017 xie et al 2016a overall the relationship between swc and wue was relatively weak compared to other factors fig 7 b the reason should be the high swc which was caused by frequent precipitation generally 0 3 cm3 cm 3 fig 3 g du et al 2021 however when swc dropped to low level e g during dry spells swc become highly influential on wue fig 7 b for example when vpd 1 5 kpa swc affected wue significantly e g wue 20 32 swc 12 07 r 2 0 13 p 0 05 fig 7 b by contrast it is notable that wue was positively and linearly correlated to the bowen ratio indicating that high wue is generally associated with high bowen ratio fig 7 c the explanation is that the bowen ratio can reflect the energy balance between the ecosystem and atmosphere generally a high bowen ratio means more energy e g solar radiation transforms into sensible heat when the vegetation is water stressed usually slightly water stressed vegetation would have a higher wue which can be demonstrated by the negative correlation between wue and swc presented above though the wue was significantly correlated to the potential drivers fig 7 the calculated determination coefficients r2 were low generally r 2 0 4 suggesting that individual driver e g ta vpd could not satisfactorily account for the variances in wue the main reason would be that the impacts that a specific driver has on wue could be affected obviously by other factors fig 9 for example the negative correlation between wue and vpd decreased with increasing swc fig 9 b2 meaning that wue was more reduced by high values of vpd when swc was high similarly the negative correlation between wue and swc was subdued with increasing vpd fig 9 d3 indicating that high swc could cause more significant decrease in wue when vpd was high these results are reasonable because higher swc and vpd often lead to higher transpiration rates in this region high vpd usually occurs with high temperature and enhanced solar radiation thus in periods with high vpd more water is transpired for cooling but not for co2 fixation and consequently lead to low wue these findings are in good agreement with those in yang et al 2010 who found that wue responds to soil water potential in opposite ways depending on vpd therefore it can be concluded that the importance of a driver for wue depends strongly on the environmental conditions nevertheless though wue and its drivers have many mutually related response patterns the wue could be satisfactorily expressed by these environmental drivers e g eq 7 r 2 0 78 fig 8 in eq 7 the regression coefficients for vpd swc ta and rn are negative and that for the bowen ratio is positive eq 7 matching well the negative or positive correlations shown in fig 7 the determination coefficient r 2 0 78 of this regression model indicated that the variances in vpd ta rn the bowen ratio and swc could jointly account for the major part e g 78 of the changes in wue the underlying drivers for rest part e g 22 which could not be expressed by eq 7 would be the interactive responses of wue to these drivers fig 9 and the changes of the biological factors such as the leaf area index growth status besides the advantages there are still some limitations of this study first these results are based on half hourly measurements previous studies pointed out that the responses of wue to its drivers at different time scales e g daily or longer may be different song et al 2017 yu et al 2008 moreover because some of the data were not available acceptable due to the frequent precipitation the limited samples would also result in some uncertainties though the selected data covered all the months well second the two experimental years are two normal years though some dry spells did exist therefore it is hard to obtain more information for the wue behaviours under extreme conditions e g during droughts third this study focused on the impacts of environmental factors on wue however other factors especially the biological factors e g leaf area index mortality would have important roles in affecting wue nevertheless this study demonstrated that the wue is jointly and interactively controlled by multiple factors and the importance of a driver to wue strongly depends on the environmental conditions 4 3 implications of the findings water use efficiency is a critical index for describing carbon water coupling in terrestrial ecosystems niu et al 2011 which has long been used as an effective metric to represent the vegetation s behaviours in many studies the wue is used to estimate gpp beer et al 2007 or et yang et al 2013 and to identify the ecosystem responses to environmental changes especially in a changing environment with rising air co2 and temperature cheng et al 2017 in these studies the vpd is often used as the key environmental factor to quantify the wue cheng et al 2017 for example using the relationship of wue vpd 1 meaning that wue is assumed to be proportional to 1 vpd dewar 1997 or wue vpd 0 5 meaning that wue is assumed to be proportional to 1 vpd0 5 which is derived based on the stomatal optimization theory at leaf level beer et al 2009 katul et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 more recently yang et al 2010 provided evidences that the ecosystem wue also follows the wue vpd 0 5 at the canopy scale however the findings in this study demonstrated that the wue was neither proportional to vpd 1 nor to vpd 0 5 but exhibited large dispersion which could be fitted using an exponential function fig 7 a this large dispersion should be caused by the mutually related impacts of other potential drivers on wue including ta rn swc fig 9 and the complexity of the canopy structures and components therefore these findings implied that in modelling the interactions among vegetation water and carbon the modelers should be cautious about the versatility of the model especially when applying wue response models at environmental conditions different from those at which they are derived 5 conclusions this study conducted a two year experiment to investigate wue and its drivers in a karstic climax forest in southwestern china results showed that the mean wue was 8 0 4 8 mg co2 g 1 h2o which was not only closely related to meteorological factors and swc but also affected obviously by the bowen ratio though no single environmental factor could satisfactorily explain the changes in wue the environmental factors e g vpd swc rn ta and the bowen ratio could jointly account for the majority 78 of it the residual error of the wue predicting model r 2 0 78 would be that besides the biological factors the responses of wue to a specific factor was affected obviously by other coexisting factors these indicated that the importance of a factor to wue strongly depends on the environment as the wue response formulas are often used to model the interactions between vegetation and environment these findings above suggested that modelers should be cautious when applying wue response formulas to predict the ecosystem s responses to the changing environment and more works are still needed to further reveal the complex ecosystem behaviours induced by environmental

2359,to investigate the statistical roughness properties of gravel bed surfaces in meandering channels a meandering channel model is constructed the flowrate is selected as the control variable and the cross sectional water levels cross sectional velocities and bed surface elevations are measured the experimental results show that the elevation probability distributions of the detrended water worked bed surfaces in the meandering channel are positively skewed and leptokurtic with the increasing flowrate the elevation standard deviation and the elevation skewness increases but the elevation kurtosis decreases the armoring layer in the meandering channel can resist a certain extent of increasing flow strength but its protective ability is very limited once the armoring layer is destructed the bed surface roughness will increase significantly the bed surface roughness and the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains are large in the main stream path while those in the main stream separating areas are small and decrease along the longitudinal direction for any local zone the roughness and the averaged influence scale in the longitudinal direction are obviously larger compared with the corresponding values in the lateral direction keywords meandering channel gravel bed surface roughness properties statistical parameters variogram data availability all data used during the study are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction mountain riverbeds are usually covered with gravel gravel bed surface roughness is closely related to flow structure sediment transport the river resistance and riverbed evolution smart et al 2004 paphitis and collins 2005 oldmeadow and church 2006 influenced by natural random factors such as grain morphology spatial distribution grain size distribution and flow conditions gravel bed structures in mountain rivers are very complex and variable how to reasonably quantify gravel bed surface roughness has always been a difficult problem in river dynamics pender et al 2001 haynes and pender 2007 the research results are critically important for clarifying riverbed evolution mechanisms accurately estimating river resistance and improving river simulations piedra et al 2012 luo et al 2020 at present there are four methods for quantifying gravel bed surface roughness the representative grain size method the exposure coefficient method the fractal analysis method and the statistical analysis method the representative grain size method is the most traditional one of these and usually associates the surface roughness with several times of a representative grain size namely ks mdi where ks m di represent the bed surface roughness the multiple factor and representative grain size respectively for instance ackers and white 1973 thought ks 1 25 d 35 kamphuis 1974 considered ks 2 0 d 90 hammond et al 1984 applied ks 6 6 d 50 powell 2014 considered ks 3 5 d 84 the representative grain size method entirely ignores the effects of grain morphology spatial distribution and grain size distribution on the bed surface thus it is fairly inaccurate in quantifying gravel bed surface roughness the exposure coefficient method considers that the roughness of a gravel bed surface relates to the shelter exposure relationships among the adjacent grains and primarily uses the exposure coefficient exposure angle and their probability density function to characterize the bed surface roughness for example wu et al 2000 presented an exposure coefficient to quantify the cluster effects of gravel bed surfaces xu et al 2008 established a new incipient velocity formula by considering the hiding and exposure effect of nonuniform sediment bai et al 2013 found that the random location of a gravel grain near the bed surface can be described by an exposure degree xing et al 2016 found that the exposure angles of a gravel bed surface follow a normal distribution despite having a clear physical concept the relevant and contemporary studies of the exposure coefficient method are not comprehensive and lack practical value due to measurement difficulties the fractal analysis method belongs to the category of nonlinear theory and its most basic feature is to describe the self similarity between any part and the overall morphology of a bed surface using fractal dimensions for instance sapozhnikov and foufoula georgiou 1996 found that the fractal dimension in the downstream direction of a water worked gravel surface is greater than that in the cross stream direction robert 1991 thought that grain morphology spatial distribution and grain size distribution together control the fractal dimension of a gravel bed surface butler et al 2001 used two dimensional variogram to estimate the fractal dimensions of water worked gravel surfaces qin et al 2012 found that gravel bed surfaces exhibit multifractal behavior papanicolaou et al 2012 concluded that fractal dimensions can effectively quantify the self similarity of a gravel bed huang and wang 2012 established the relationship between gravel bed surface roughness and fractal dimension aubeneau et al 2015 investigated the effects of riverbed fractal properties on the residence time distributions of solutes the fractal properties of a gravel bed only exist within a limited scale range which is usually named the scale free range mandelbrot 1998 there are many methods to determine the scale free range but the using conditions of those methods are fairly different which makes them difficult determine in practical engineering applications this greatly limits the promotion of the fractal analysis method wu 2002 for the statistical analysis method a gravel surface is usually considered a random elevation field and the statistical parameters and variograms are used to quantify its roughness properties for example nikora et al 1998 concluded that the elevation probability distribution of a gravel surface follows a normal distribution marion et al 2003 suggested that gravel surface stability can be evaluated using two dimensional variogram nikora and walsh 2004 found that the multiscaling behaviors of a water worked gravel surfaces were sensitive to the flow direction aberle and nikora 2006 found that the armoring effects and grain orientations of gravel bed surfaces can be effectively quantified using two dimensional variogram hodge et al 2010 studied the influence of median grain size on the elevation probability distributions of natural gravel bed surfaces mao et al 2011 compared the statistical roughness properties of static armoring layers with those of mobile armoring layers ockelford and haynes 2013 investigated the scaling behaviors of gravel beds in a straight open channel using statistical parameters and two dimensional variogram berlin and friedrich 2014 evaluated the suitabilities of the available topography measurement techniques for the statistical roughness analyses of gravel bed surfaces powell et al 2016 discussed the effect of flow stress on the statistical roughness properties of gravel beds perret et al 2020 held that two dimensional variogram can be used to differentiate the roughness scales of gravel bed surfaces pan et al 2022a discussed the effects of average particle size and non uniformity on the statistical roughness characteristics of gravel bed surfaces compared with the other three methods the statistical analysis method can be used not only for the qualitative analysis of macroscale bed surface morphologies but also for the quantitative description of fine bed surface structures thus it is more suitable for quantifying bed surface roughness properties natural rivers are essentially meandering features in fig 1 in addition to gravity frictional forces and hydrodynamic pressure the fluid particles will also be controlled by centrifugal forces when flow enters a curved channel due to the existence of the additional centrifugal force the fluid motion in a curved channel is obviously different from that in a straight channel this is demonstrated for example by the generation of lateral water surface gradient the formation of secondary flow and the increased loss of mechanical energy pan et al 2022b the particular flow movement in a curved channel will inevitably generate a special gravel bed surface structure throughout the literature mentioned above many of the gravel surfaces studied by previous researchers were artificially paved or consisted of straight water worked channels while the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in curved channels are still unknown therefore this study constructed a meandering channel model and the flowrate was selected as the control variable the cross sectional water levels cross sectional velocities and bed surface elevations were respectively obtained by a water level altimeter an acoustic doppler velocimeter and a laser scanner and the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in the meandering channel are discussed using statistical theory 2 experimental arrangements the plane shape of a stable meandering channel in nature is close to a sinusoidal curve pan et al 2019 shiono et al 2008 as a rough approximation we can use a series of arcs and straight lines to fit the plane shape this experiment was carried out in a stable meandering channel model in fig 2 whose sinuosity l λ 1 38 was selected based on the sinuosity range 1 1 3 0 shao and wang 2010 of the changjiang river in china a triangular weir was equipped at the model inlet a tail water outlet was constructed at the model outlet and a measuring bridge including an electrical control system and a measuring platform was installed across the model sidewalls the channel bottom was level and the shape parameters of the measured complete meander mainly including the meander belt width w meander belt wavelength λ flow path length l crossover area length l channel depth h channel width b central angle φ and curvature radius rc are presented in fig 2 in the measured complete meander thirteen cross sections cs01 cs13 in fig 2 are arranged in each cross section there are eleven measured lines 1 11 in fig 2 spaced 7 cm apart water level measurements were carried out for all measured lines using a water level altimeter in fig 3 a with the measuring precision of 0 1 mm and a recording frequency of 100 hz therein the measuring duration for any measured line was not less than 90 s instantaneous velocities were recorded only for the measured lines 2 9 using an acoustic doppler velocimeter in fig 3 b with a measuring precision of 1 mm s and a recording frequency of 25 hz therein the velocity measurements of a vertical line started near the water surface and ended near the bed surface and the vertical spaces between the adjacent measured points was set as 1 cm with the measuring duration at any measured point being not less than 90 s before the actual measurements the experimenters first installed the water level altimeter and acoustic doppler velocimeter on the measuring platform then the measuring devices could be moved horizontally or vertically by the electrical control system to meet the measurement requirements in addition the experimental bed surface morphologies were measured using a laser scanner in fig 3 c with a measuring precision of 0 1 mm and a sampling density of 1 point mm2 five sets of experimental cases with flowrates of 25 52 33 45 42 09 51 37 and 65 68 l s were designed and their outlet conditions were always free outflow natural sediment with the grain size distribution shown in fig 4 was used to artificially pave the initial bed surface and the specific operations were as follows all the natural sediment was fully mixed and then an appropriate volume of natural sediment was filled into the channel and then the sediment was horizontally scraped to a thickness of about 10 cm by a gradienter then a proper volume of water was slowly injected into the channel to make the sediment layer naturally dense the sediment layer was horizontally scraped again to a thickness of about 8 cm by the gradienter thus the initial bed surface was prepared after that the experimenters started the pump and set the flowrate as 25 52 l s to scour the initial bed surface for approximately 48 h after 48 h the bed load was collected at the outlet and weighed by an electronic balance in fig 4 a with a measuring precision of 1 g every hour when the large grain motion near the bed surface could not be seen by the unaided eyes and the bed load transport rate was smaller than 50 g h we regarded the bed surface to be in the stable state and started the water level and velocity measurements after the above measurements were finished the experimenters turned off the pump and then waited for the bed surface to be naturally dry then the bed surface morphology was scanned by the laser scanner next the flowrate was set as 33 45 l s to constantly scour the bed surface after the bed surface stabilized again the relevant measurements were repeated the remaining experimental cases were performed as described above 3 calculation methods 3 1 detrended bed surface to facilitate the following analyses a coordinate system shown in fig 2 is established the bottom midpoint of cs01 is set as the origin the x axis positive direction is along the flow path the y axis positive direction is toward the right sidewall and the z axis positive direction is vertically upward as shown in fig 5 a the raw bed surfaces exhibit large scale macroscopic fluctuations due to experimental errors or sediment transport when analyzing the fine structures of the gravel bed surfaces these large scale macroscopic fluctuations easily blur the roughness properties generated by the shelter exposure relationships among the adjacent grains therefore it is necessary to detrend the raw bed surfaces when analyzing the bed surface roughness properties the detrending method presented by smart et al 2002 is adopted here and its specific operations are as follows 1 square grids with a node space of 1 1 mm are used to sufficiently cover the measured meandering channel 2 the raw elevation scatter points for each experimental case are used to linearly interpolate the grid nodes however the grid nodes that fall outside the measured meander are considered invalid and not interpolated 3 taking an effective grid node as the center and taking the 2 5 d 90 33 mm in fig 4 b of the original sediment as the diameter a circular domain corresponding to the effective grid node is constructed then the average elevations of the interpolated grid nodes located within the circular domain are calculated and assigned to the circle center after the above operations are conducted for all the effective grid nodes a gridded trend surface is generated in fig 5 b 4 after subtracting the gridded trend surface from the gridded raw bed surface the detrended bed surface is obtained in fig 5 c 3 2 statistical parameters the statistical parameters primarily include standard deviation σ skewness sk and kurtosis ku these can be calculated according to formulas 1 3 where zsd z sd and m represent the detrended bed surface elevations the sample mean and the total sample number respectively the standard deviation expresses the averaged deviation level of the detrended elevation samples relative to the sample mean which essentially characterizes the bed surface roughness skewness is used to describe the symmetry of an elevation probability distribution therein sk less than 0 sk 0 and sk 0 are associated with a negatively skewed distribution a symmetrical distribution and a positively skewed distribution respectively kurtosis is used to reflect the steepness of an elevation probability distribution therein ku less than 3 ku 3 and ku 3 correspond to a platykurtic distribution a normal distribution and a leptokurtic distribution respectively 1 σ 1 m i 1 m z sd z sd 2 2 s k 1 m σ 3 i 1 m z sd z sd 3 3 k u 1 m σ 4 i 1 m z sd z sd 4 3 3 variogram the variogram is usually defined as half of the squared average increment of the elevation point pairs that share the same calculation interval and follow a definite direction and its mathematical expression is as follows 4 γ 1 2 n h x h y k 1 n h x h y z sd x i h x y j h y z sd x i y j 2 where xi and yj are the location coordinates zsd is the detrended bed surface elevation γ represents the variogram hx and hy represent the calculation intervals in the x axis and y axis directions respectively and n hx hy represents the total point pair number as a special case when hy 0 but hx changes or hx 0 but hy changes formula 4 can be used to analyze the elevation variability in the x axis or y axis direction respectively there are many theoretical models for the variogram and the spherical model formula 5 is the most common one for quantitatively describing the elevation variability of a gravel surface zhong et al 2017 in practical calculations when the calculation interval changes along a definite direction a series of variogram scatter points can be obtained according to formula 4 then two important variogram parameters s 0 s and a can be ascertained by fitting the variogram scatter points to the spherical model with the least square method tarantola and valette 1982 therein s 0 s is named the sill which can be used to characterize the bed surface roughness in the specific direction a is called the correlation length which is linked with the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains 5 γ 0 h 0 s 0 s 3 2 h a 1 2 h a 3 0 h a s 0 s h a where h represents the calculation interval therein when hy 0 but hx changes h hx and when hx 0 but hy changes h hy 3 4 hydraulic parameters the time averaged longitudinal and lateral velocities u v the depth averaged longitudinal velocity up and the longitudinal and lateral turbulence intensities tu tv are adopted for the auxiliary analyses and can be calculated according to formulas 6 10 in addition the line linking the locations where the maximum cross sectional depth averaged longitudinal velocity appears is defined as the main streamline and the zones near the main streamline are referred to as the main stream path 6 z w 1 δ t 0 δ t z w d t 7 u i 1 δ t 0 δ t u i d t 8 u p 1 z w z s z w u d z 9 u i u i u i 10 t i u i 2 where δ t and t represent the measuring duration and measuring time respectively z w and zw represent the time averaged and instantaneous water levels respectively u i ui and u i represent the time averaged instantaneous and fluctuating velocities respectively zs represents the raw bed surface elevation tensor notations are adopted for u i ui u i and t i 4 results and discussion 4 1 elevation probability distributions of the detrended bed surfaces as shown in fig 6 the elevation probability distribution of the detrended initial bed surface is roughly symmetrical relative to zsd 0 but the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s is positively skewed and its width obviously decreases and its height significantly increases the positively skewed shape of the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s is mainly caused by the local bulges of the large grains near the bed surface as shown in fig 5 for the flowrate of 25 52 l s except for the zones of cs02 cs06 and 0 y b 2 cs08 cs12 and b 2 y 0 many small grains near the bed surface are scoured away which exposes the large grains near the bed surface the exposed large grains increase the quantity ratio of the higher elevation points relative to the total elevation samples thus the elevation probability distribution is positively skewed the decreasing width and the increasing height of the elevation probability distribution indicate that the bed surface roughness decreases compared with the initial bed surface roughness when the small grains are transported downstream by the flow and encounter local hollows near the bed surface that were caused by the artificial paving process those small grains are likely to be deposited into the hollows which can generate a smoothing effect for the bed surface in addition when the fluids flow through the initial bed surface the fluid turbulence can cause the bed surface to vibrate slightly driven by this slight vibration the small grains near the bed surface will adaptively embed into the spaces among the adjacent large grains which can also generate a smoothing effect for the bed surface these two smoothing effects produce the decreasing width and the increasing height of the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s as the flowrate increases to 33 45 42 09 51 37 and 65 68 l s the widths of the probability distributions continuously increase and the heights gradually decrease which indicates that the bed surface roughness increases with the increasing flowrate it can also be seen that as the flowrate increases from 25 25 to 33 45 42 09 and 51 37 l s in turn the change extents of the elevation probability distributions gradually decrease which indicates that the erosion rates of the bed surfaces gradually decrease and the bed surface stabilities gradually increases as shown in fig 7 the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface increase with the increasing flowrate and then the longitudinal shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface also increase because of these increases the small grains near the bed surface are continuously scoured away which increases the average grain size of the bed surface constituents with the increasing average grain size the shelter and frictional effects among the grains increase and then the bed surface can resist a stronger flow namely the bed surface stability increases in addition when the fluids flow through the bed surface the slight bed surface vibration caused by the fluid turbulence will make the grains near the bed surface adaptively embed themselves into the most stable locations this can lead to the compaction of the bed surface which also enhances the bed surface stability as the experiment progresses the compacting effect caused by the fluid turbulence becomes more persistent during subsequent experimental runs and higher flowrates this means that the bed surface is more stable during the later experimental cases after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the elevation probability distribution changes significantly this is mainly because the flow strength at this stage is too large and the armoring layer formed by the 51 37 l s flowrate cannot resist the flow driven scour at this greater flowrate and is destructed this implies that although the armoring layer provides a certain protective effect on the riverbed and can resist a certain extent of increasing flow strength its protective ability is limited once the flowrate increment surpasses the limit that the armoring layer can withstand the armoring layer cannot resist the flow driven scour 4 2 statistical parameters of the detrended bed surface elevations as shown in fig 8 the elevation standard deviation of the detrended initial bed surface is 2 25 mm and the elevation skewness is close to 0 and the elevation kurtosis is approximately equal to 3 which implies that the elevation probability distribution of the detrended initial bed surface roughly follows a normal distribution this distribution property is mainly caused by the loose cluster effect of the constituent grains and the random errors of the artificially paving operations the elevation standard deviation of the detrended bed surface for the flowrate of 25 52 l s becomes 2 03 mm and the elevation skewness becomes 0 53 and the elevation kurtosis becomes 5 21 which indicates that the bed surface roughness in this stage decreases and the elevation probability distribution is positively skewed and leptokurtic thereafter with the increasing flowrate the elevation standard deviation and the elevation skewness gradually increase and the elevation kurtosis gradually decreases with the increasing flowrate the longitudinal shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface increase and then the small grains near the bed surface are continuously eroded away by the flow then the large grains near the bed surface are further exposed and the bed surface becomes rougher thus the elevation standard deviation increases and the elevation kurtosis decreases the increasingly exposed extents of the large grains near the bed surface increase the quantity ratio of the higher elevation points relative to the total elevation samples therefore the elevation skewness increases in addition after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the elevation standard deviation increases sharply which indicates that the bed surface roughness will increase significantly once the armoring layer is destructed 4 3 variograms of the detrended bed surface elevations as shown in fig 9 a for the small calculation intervals of 10 mm hx 10 mm and 10 mm hy 10 mm the two dimensional variogram contours for the detrended initial bed surface are roughly circular which means that the initial bed surface is approximately isotropic this approximately isotropic property is mainly due to the artificially paving operations before filling the meandering channel with sediment all the natural sediment was first fully mixed which made the sediment gradations in any two zones of the paved bed surface essentially homogenous after filling the meandering channel with the fully mixed sediment the experimenters horizontally and randomly scraped the bed surface with a gradienter which made the grain arrangements completely random under the conditions mentioned above the initial bed surface was naturally approximately isotropic the two dimensional variogram contours for the water worked bed surfaces especially in the crossover areas exhibit approximate ellipses whose long axes and short axes are roughly in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively this means that the water worked bed surfaces are completely anisotropic and their roughness properties in the longitudinal and lateral directions are obviously different as shown in fig 9 b as the calculation interval increases the two dimensional variograms for the initial bed surface or the water worked bed surfaces gradually increase and finally arrive at a relatively stable state in any direction the variogram trends are completely consistent with the spherical model which indicates that the spherical model is an appropriate theoretical model for analyzing the bed surface roughness properties as shown in fig 10 when the fluids flow into a curved segment any fluid particle near the water surface will be dominated by the centrifugal force dfc in addition to gravity dg water pressure and frictional force centrifugal force and gravity are both mass forces the centrifugal force points horizontally toward the concave side and the gravitational force is oriented vertically downward thus the resultant mass force acting on any fluid particle near the water surface will deviate toward the concave sidewall as an isobaric surface under a steady flow condition the resultant mass force acting on any fluid particle near the water surface is roughly perpendicular to the lateral tangent line passing through the location of the fluid particle this geometric relationship is valid only when the concave side water surface is higher than the convex side water surface in other words the existence of the additional centrifugal force raises the concave side water level and lowers the convex side water level generating the lateral water surface gradient the existing lateral water surface gradient can produce lateral pressure differences that are constant in the water depth direction and point horizontally toward the convex side the time averaged longitudinal velocity gradually increases from the bed surface to the water surface and the squared time averaged longitudinal velocity is proportional to the centrifugal force thus the centrifugal force gradually increases from the bed surface to the water surface after the lateral pressure differences and the centrifugal forces are combined the resultant force acting on the upper fluids points toward the concave side and the resultant force acting on the lower fluids points toward the convex side which is equivalent to a force couple it is the rotational effect of this equivalent force couple that generates the secondary flow in fig 11 the existing secondary flows make the cross sectional morphologies and the time averaged resultant velocities in the different zones of the meandering channel obviously different which inevitably causes significant differences in the bed surface structures in the different zones therefore it is necessary to compare the bed surface roughness properties in the different zones as mentioned above the roughness properties of the water worked bed surfaces are obviously different in the longitudinal and lateral directions therefore in addition to comparing the bed surface roughness properties in the different zones we should also focus on comparing the roughness properties in the longitudinal and lateral directions for any analytical zone the following analyses expand on this idea as shown in fig 12 for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the specific values in the different zones of the initial bed surface are roughly equal which means that the initial bed surface structures in the different zones are approximately homogeneous for the flowrate of 25 52 l s the variogram parameters in the zones of cs01 cs02 and 0 y b 2 cs02 cs08 and b 2 y 0 and cs08 cs13 and 0 y b 2 increase which is closely related to the main stream path as shown in fig 13 when the fluids reach a bending apex the main stream is close to the convex sidewall which is mainly due to the large sinuosity of the meandering channel dash and khatua 2016 kim et al 2020 this phenomenon can also be explained by the self adaptability of the flow if there is an outstanding factor hindering the flow to excrete downstream in a channel the fluid motion always tends to weaken that factor pan et al 2022b due to the large curvature of the curved segments and the short crossover areas the sinuosity of the experimental meandering channel is too large which seriously hinders the flow to excrete downstream the main stream close to the convex side obviously tends to weaken the sinuosity which is a clear reflection of the flow self adaptability when the main stream reaches the bending apex the main stream direction cannot be changed in time due to inertia and then the main stream directly collides against the opposite concave sidewall thereafter the main stream quickly changes its direction and flows along the sidewall linking the concave side of the adjacent upstream curve with the convex side of the adjacent downstream curve due to the considerable kinetic energy of the main stream the main stream path experiences more intense erosion and the average grain size in the main stream path become large as the average grain size increases the bed surface in the main stream path becomes rougher and the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains increases and then the sills and the correlation lengths in the main stream path increase for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the specific values in the different zones of the main stream path are actually different the variogram parameters in the zones of cs02 cs03 and b 2 y 0 cs08 cs09 and 0 y b 2 are larger which is mainly caused by the main stream colliding against the opposite concave sidewalls when the main stream collides against the sidewalls intense fluid turbulence subsequently occurs which substantially increases the bed surface erosions in these two zones and then the average grain sizes are larger and then the variogram parameters are larger the variogram parameters in the zones of cs03 cs05 and b 2 y 0 cs09 cs11 and 0 y b 2 are larger which is mainly caused by the laterally narrowing effect of the deposited sediment to the channel as the sediment deposition volumes in the crossover areas are large the laterally narrowing effects are also large and then the time averaged longitudinal velocities are also large and then the bed surfaces in the crossover areas are rougher and then the variogram parameters are larger for the flowrate of 25 52 l s the variogram parameters in the zones of cs02 cs06 and 0 y b 2 cs08 cs12 and b 2 y 0 decrease which is closely related to the main stream separations and the secondary underflows in the apex sectional downstream zones as shown in fig 13 when the main stream reaches a bending apex its direction cannot be adjusted in time due to inertia and then the main stream directly collides against the opposite concave sidewall which causes the zones mentioned above to be main stream separating areas as shown in fig 7 a the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream separating areas are relatively small which provides the basic condition for sediment deposition when the upstream sediment is transported to a bending apex by the main stream part of the transported sediment can enter the main stream separating area because of the lateral driving effect of the secondary underflows and subsequently become deposited after the sediment deposition reaches a certain volume a long and narrow sediment depositional feature is finally formed in the main stream separating area due to the low strengths of the secondary underflows the secondary underflows can only drive some small grains into the main stream separating area therefore the average grain size of the depositional feature is small which is why the variogram parameters in the main stream separating areas decrease after the initial bed surface is scoured in addition since the fluid kinetic energies in the main stream separating area are gradually dissipated along the longitudinal direction the grain size of the deposited sediment decreases along the longitudinal direction and then the variogram parameters decrease along the longitudinal direction the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls cs01 cs02 and b 2 y 0 cs06 cs08 and 0 y b 2 cs12 cs13 and b 2 y 0 are greater than the corresponding values in the main stream separating areas and smaller than the corresponding values in the main stream path which is closely related to the main stream path and the rotational directions of the secondary flows since the main stream is close to the convex sidewall when the fluids reach a bending apex the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewall are not scoured by the main stream and then the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls are smaller compared with the corresponding values in the main stream path as shown in fig 11 the rotational directions of the secondary flows change at the downstream locations of the crossover area outlets which prevents the tail ends of the sediment deposition features from extending into the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls therefore the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls are greater than the corresponding values in the main stream separating areas after the flowrate increases to 33 45 42 09 and 51 37 l s in turn the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface continuously increase and then the shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface also increase which causes the small grains near the bed surface to continuously become scoured away and then the average grain size of the bed surface constituents increases and then the variogram parameters increase after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream path increase again and then the average grain size in the main stream path also increases again which causes the variogram parameters to increase again as well however the variogram parameters in the main stream separating areas decrease but are greater than the corresponding values for the flowrate of 25 52 l s after the flowrate is set as 65 68 l s the armoring layer formed by the flowrate of 51 37 l s cannot resist flow driven scour and is destructed due to the excessively large flow strength at this stage after the armoring layer formed by the flowrate of 51 37 l s is destructed the small grains near the bed surface are subsequently exposed and transported downstream when the exposed small grains were transported to a bending apex many small grains enter the main stream separating areas because of the lateral driving effect of the secondary underflows and are again deposited which decreases the average grain sizes of the bed surface constituents in the main stream separating areas thereby decreasing the variogram parameters as shown in figs 7 and 11 after the flowrate increases to 65 68 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream separating areas do not substantially increase compared with the flowrate of 25 52 l s but the lateral underflows in the main stream separating areas are obviously strengthened which enables the lateral underflows near the bending apexes to drive larger grains into the main stream separating areas for final deposition in other words after the second instance of small grain deposition the average grain size in any main stream separating area is greater than the corresponding value for the flowrate of 25 52 l s therefore although the variogram parameters in any main stream separating area decrease when the flowrate is set as 65 68 l s they are consistently greater than the corresponding values for the flowrate of 25 52 l s for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the longitudinal value in any local zone of the meandering channel is clearly greater than the lateral value the longitudinal sill is greater than the lateral sill which indicates that the longitudinal roughness is greater than the lateral roughness which is closely related to the fluid turbulence the fluid turbulence can make the grain arrangements near the bed surface more disordered which can also increase the bed surface roughness as shown in fig 14 the longitudinal turbulence intensities near the bed surface are clearly larger compared with the lateral turbulence intensities the larger longitudinal turbulence intensities make the grain arrangements more disordered in the longitudinal direction than the lateral situation which makes the longitudinal roughness greater than the lateral roughness the longitudinal correlation length is clearly greater than the lateral correlation length which indicates that the averaged longitudinal influence scale is obviously greater than the averaged lateral influence scale and is mainly caused by the long axis trends of the grains near the bed surface as shown in figs 7 and 11 the time averaged longitudinal velocities at most locations are much greater than the time averaged lateral velocities thus the longitudinal driving forces of the fluids acting on the bed surfaces are much greater than the lateral driving forces after being scoured by the flow for a long time the long axis trends of the grains near the surface deviate toward the longitudinal direction due to the dominant longitudinal driving forces it is this long axis deviation toward the longitudinal direction that makes the averaged longitudinal influence scale obviously greater than the averaged lateral influence scale 5 conclusions natural sediment was used to artificially pave the bed surface in a meandering channel model and the flowrate was selected as the control variable the cross sectional water levels cross sectional velocities and bed surface elevations were measured and the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in the meandering channel were discussed using statistical theory the main findings of this study can be drawn 1 the elevation probability distributions of the detrended water worked bed surfaces in the meandering channel are positively skewed and leptokurtic with the increasing flowrate the elevation standard deviation and the elevation skewness increase but the elevation kurtosis decreases 2 the armoring layer in the meandering channel provides a certain protective effect on the riverbed and can resist a certain extent of increasing flow strength but its protective ability is very limited once the flowrate increment surpasses the limit that the armoring layer can withstand the armoring layer will be destructed and the bed surface roughness will increase significantly 3 the bed surface structures in the different zones of the meandering channel are obviously different the bed surface roughness and the averaged influence scale

during the study are available from the corresponding author by request 1 introduction mountain riverbeds are usually covered with gravel gravel bed surface roughness is closely related to flow structure sediment transport the river resistance and riverbed evolution smart et al 2004 paphitis and collins 2005 oldmeadow and church 2006 influenced by natural random factors such as grain morphology spatial distribution grain size distribution and flow conditions gravel bed structures in mountain rivers are very complex and variable how to reasonably quantify gravel bed surface roughness has always been a difficult problem in river dynamics pender et al 2001 haynes and pender 2007 the research results are critically important for clarifying riverbed evolution mechanisms accurately estimating river resistance and improving river simulations piedra et al 2012 luo et al 2020 at present there are four methods for quantifying gravel bed surface roughness the representative grain size method the exposure coefficient method the fractal analysis method and the statistical analysis method the representative grain size method is the most traditional one of these and usually associates the surface roughness with several times of a representative grain size namely ks mdi where ks m di represent the bed surface roughness the multiple factor and representative grain size respectively for instance ackers and white 1973 thought ks 1 25 d 35 kamphuis 1974 considered ks 2 0 d 90 hammond et al 1984 applied ks 6 6 d 50 powell 2014 considered ks 3 5 d 84 the representative grain size method entirely ignores the effects of grain morphology spatial distribution and grain size distribution on the bed surface thus it is fairly inaccurate in quantifying gravel bed surface roughness the exposure coefficient method considers that the roughness of a gravel bed surface relates to the shelter exposure relationships among the adjacent grains and primarily uses the exposure coefficient exposure angle and their probability density function to characterize the bed surface roughness for example wu et al 2000 presented an exposure coefficient to quantify the cluster effects of gravel bed surfaces xu et al 2008 established a new incipient velocity formula by considering the hiding and exposure effect of nonuniform sediment bai et al 2013 found that the random location of a gravel grain near the bed surface can be described by an exposure degree xing et al 2016 found that the exposure angles of a gravel bed surface follow a normal distribution despite having a clear physical concept the relevant and contemporary studies of the exposure coefficient method are not comprehensive and lack practical value due to measurement difficulties the fractal analysis method belongs to the category of nonlinear theory and its most basic feature is to describe the self similarity between any part and the overall morphology of a bed surface using fractal dimensions for instance sapozhnikov and foufoula georgiou 1996 found that the fractal dimension in the downstream direction of a water worked gravel surface is greater than that in the cross stream direction robert 1991 thought that grain morphology spatial distribution and grain size distribution together control the fractal dimension of a gravel bed surface butler et al 2001 used two dimensional variogram to estimate the fractal dimensions of water worked gravel surfaces qin et al 2012 found that gravel bed surfaces exhibit multifractal behavior papanicolaou et al 2012 concluded that fractal dimensions can effectively quantify the self similarity of a gravel bed huang and wang 2012 established the relationship between gravel bed surface roughness and fractal dimension aubeneau et al 2015 investigated the effects of riverbed fractal properties on the residence time distributions of solutes the fractal properties of a gravel bed only exist within a limited scale range which is usually named the scale free range mandelbrot 1998 there are many methods to determine the scale free range but the using conditions of those methods are fairly different which makes them difficult determine in practical engineering applications this greatly limits the promotion of the fractal analysis method wu 2002 for the statistical analysis method a gravel surface is usually considered a random elevation field and the statistical parameters and variograms are used to quantify its roughness properties for example nikora et al 1998 concluded that the elevation probability distribution of a gravel surface follows a normal distribution marion et al 2003 suggested that gravel surface stability can be evaluated using two dimensional variogram nikora and walsh 2004 found that the multiscaling behaviors of a water worked gravel surfaces were sensitive to the flow direction aberle and nikora 2006 found that the armoring effects and grain orientations of gravel bed surfaces can be effectively quantified using two dimensional variogram hodge et al 2010 studied the influence of median grain size on the elevation probability distributions of natural gravel bed surfaces mao et al 2011 compared the statistical roughness properties of static armoring layers with those of mobile armoring layers ockelford and haynes 2013 investigated the scaling behaviors of gravel beds in a straight open channel using statistical parameters and two dimensional variogram berlin and friedrich 2014 evaluated the suitabilities of the available topography measurement techniques for the statistical roughness analyses of gravel bed surfaces powell et al 2016 discussed the effect of flow stress on the statistical roughness properties of gravel beds perret et al 2020 held that two dimensional variogram can be used to differentiate the roughness scales of gravel bed surfaces pan et al 2022a discussed the effects of average particle size and non uniformity on the statistical roughness characteristics of gravel bed surfaces compared with the other three methods the statistical analysis method can be used not only for the qualitative analysis of macroscale bed surface morphologies but also for the quantitative description of fine bed surface structures thus it is more suitable for quantifying bed surface roughness properties natural rivers are essentially meandering features in fig 1 in addition to gravity frictional forces and hydrodynamic pressure the fluid particles will also be controlled by centrifugal forces when flow enters a curved channel due to the existence of the additional centrifugal force the fluid motion in a curved channel is obviously different from that in a straight channel this is demonstrated for example by the generation of lateral water surface gradient the formation of secondary flow and the increased loss of mechanical energy pan et al 2022b the particular flow movement in a curved channel will inevitably generate a special gravel bed surface structure throughout the literature mentioned above many of the gravel surfaces studied by previous researchers were artificially paved or consisted of straight water worked channels while the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in curved channels are still unknown therefore this study constructed a meandering channel model and the flowrate was selected as the control variable the cross sectional water levels cross sectional velocities and bed surface elevations were respectively obtained by a water level altimeter an acoustic doppler velocimeter and a laser scanner and the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in the meandering channel are discussed using statistical theory 2 experimental arrangements the plane shape of a stable meandering channel in nature is close to a sinusoidal curve pan et al 2019 shiono et al 2008 as a rough approximation we can use a series of arcs and straight lines to fit the plane shape this experiment was carried out in a stable meandering channel model in fig 2 whose sinuosity l λ 1 38 was selected based on the sinuosity range 1 1 3 0 shao and wang 2010 of the changjiang river in china a triangular weir was equipped at the model inlet a tail water outlet was constructed at the model outlet and a measuring bridge including an electrical control system and a measuring platform was installed across the model sidewalls the channel bottom was level and the shape parameters of the measured complete meander mainly including the meander belt width w meander belt wavelength λ flow path length l crossover area length l channel depth h channel width b central angle φ and curvature radius rc are presented in fig 2 in the measured complete meander thirteen cross sections cs01 cs13 in fig 2 are arranged in each cross section there are eleven measured lines 1 11 in fig 2 spaced 7 cm apart water level measurements were carried out for all measured lines using a water level altimeter in fig 3 a with the measuring precision of 0 1 mm and a recording frequency of 100 hz therein the measuring duration for any measured line was not less than 90 s instantaneous velocities were recorded only for the measured lines 2 9 using an acoustic doppler velocimeter in fig 3 b with a measuring precision of 1 mm s and a recording frequency of 25 hz therein the velocity measurements of a vertical line started near the water surface and ended near the bed surface and the vertical spaces between the adjacent measured points was set as 1 cm with the measuring duration at any measured point being not less than 90 s before the actual measurements the experimenters first installed the water level altimeter and acoustic doppler velocimeter on the measuring platform then the measuring devices could be moved horizontally or vertically by the electrical control system to meet the measurement requirements in addition the experimental bed surface morphologies were measured using a laser scanner in fig 3 c with a measuring precision of 0 1 mm and a sampling density of 1 point mm2 five sets of experimental cases with flowrates of 25 52 33 45 42 09 51 37 and 65 68 l s were designed and their outlet conditions were always free outflow natural sediment with the grain size distribution shown in fig 4 was used to artificially pave the initial bed surface and the specific operations were as follows all the natural sediment was fully mixed and then an appropriate volume of natural sediment was filled into the channel and then the sediment was horizontally scraped to a thickness of about 10 cm by a gradienter then a proper volume of water was slowly injected into the channel to make the sediment layer naturally dense the sediment layer was horizontally scraped again to a thickness of about 8 cm by the gradienter thus the initial bed surface was prepared after that the experimenters started the pump and set the flowrate as 25 52 l s to scour the initial bed surface for approximately 48 h after 48 h the bed load was collected at the outlet and weighed by an electronic balance in fig 4 a with a measuring precision of 1 g every hour when the large grain motion near the bed surface could not be seen by the unaided eyes and the bed load transport rate was smaller than 50 g h we regarded the bed surface to be in the stable state and started the water level and velocity measurements after the above measurements were finished the experimenters turned off the pump and then waited for the bed surface to be naturally dry then the bed surface morphology was scanned by the laser scanner next the flowrate was set as 33 45 l s to constantly scour the bed surface after the bed surface stabilized again the relevant measurements were repeated the remaining experimental cases were performed as described above 3 calculation methods 3 1 detrended bed surface to facilitate the following analyses a coordinate system shown in fig 2 is established the bottom midpoint of cs01 is set as the origin the x axis positive direction is along the flow path the y axis positive direction is toward the right sidewall and the z axis positive direction is vertically upward as shown in fig 5 a the raw bed surfaces exhibit large scale macroscopic fluctuations due to experimental errors or sediment transport when analyzing the fine structures of the gravel bed surfaces these large scale macroscopic fluctuations easily blur the roughness properties generated by the shelter exposure relationships among the adjacent grains therefore it is necessary to detrend the raw bed surfaces when analyzing the bed surface roughness properties the detrending method presented by smart et al 2002 is adopted here and its specific operations are as follows 1 square grids with a node space of 1 1 mm are used to sufficiently cover the measured meandering channel 2 the raw elevation scatter points for each experimental case are used to linearly interpolate the grid nodes however the grid nodes that fall outside the measured meander are considered invalid and not interpolated 3 taking an effective grid node as the center and taking the 2 5 d 90 33 mm in fig 4 b of the original sediment as the diameter a circular domain corresponding to the effective grid node is constructed then the average elevations of the interpolated grid nodes located within the circular domain are calculated and assigned to the circle center after the above operations are conducted for all the effective grid nodes a gridded trend surface is generated in fig 5 b 4 after subtracting the gridded trend surface from the gridded raw bed surface the detrended bed surface is obtained in fig 5 c 3 2 statistical parameters the statistical parameters primarily include standard deviation σ skewness sk and kurtosis ku these can be calculated according to formulas 1 3 where zsd z sd and m represent the detrended bed surface elevations the sample mean and the total sample number respectively the standard deviation expresses the averaged deviation level of the detrended elevation samples relative to the sample mean which essentially characterizes the bed surface roughness skewness is used to describe the symmetry of an elevation probability distribution therein sk less than 0 sk 0 and sk 0 are associated with a negatively skewed distribution a symmetrical distribution and a positively skewed distribution respectively kurtosis is used to reflect the steepness of an elevation probability distribution therein ku less than 3 ku 3 and ku 3 correspond to a platykurtic distribution a normal distribution and a leptokurtic distribution respectively 1 σ 1 m i 1 m z sd z sd 2 2 s k 1 m σ 3 i 1 m z sd z sd 3 3 k u 1 m σ 4 i 1 m z sd z sd 4 3 3 variogram the variogram is usually defined as half of the squared average increment of the elevation point pairs that share the same calculation interval and follow a definite direction and its mathematical expression is as follows 4 γ 1 2 n h x h y k 1 n h x h y z sd x i h x y j h y z sd x i y j 2 where xi and yj are the location coordinates zsd is the detrended bed surface elevation γ represents the variogram hx and hy represent the calculation intervals in the x axis and y axis directions respectively and n hx hy represents the total point pair number as a special case when hy 0 but hx changes or hx 0 but hy changes formula 4 can be used to analyze the elevation variability in the x axis or y axis direction respectively there are many theoretical models for the variogram and the spherical model formula 5 is the most common one for quantitatively describing the elevation variability of a gravel surface zhong et al 2017 in practical calculations when the calculation interval changes along a definite direction a series of variogram scatter points can be obtained according to formula 4 then two important variogram parameters s 0 s and a can be ascertained by fitting the variogram scatter points to the spherical model with the least square method tarantola and valette 1982 therein s 0 s is named the sill which can be used to characterize the bed surface roughness in the specific direction a is called the correlation length which is linked with the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains 5 γ 0 h 0 s 0 s 3 2 h a 1 2 h a 3 0 h a s 0 s h a

the depth averaged longitudinal velocity up and the longitudinal and lateral turbulence intensities tu tv are adopted for the auxiliary analyses and can be calculated according to formulas 6 10 in addition the line linking the locations where the maximum cross sectional depth averaged longitudinal velocity appears is defined as the main streamline and the zones near the main streamline are referred to as the main stream path 6 z w 1 δ t 0 δ t z w d t 7 u i 1 δ t 0 δ t u i d t 8 u p 1 z w z s z w u d z 9 u i u i u i 10 t i u i 2 where δ t and t represent the measuring duration and measuring time respectively z w and zw represent the time averaged and instantaneous water levels respectively u i ui and u i represent the time averaged instantaneous and fluctuating velocities respectively zs represents the raw bed surface elevation tensor notations are adopted for u i ui u i and t i 4 results and discussion 4 1 elevation probability distributions of the detrended bed surfaces as shown in fig 6 the elevation probability distribution of the detrended initial bed surface is roughly symmetrical relative to zsd 0 but the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s is positively skewed and its width obviously decreases and its height significantly increases the positively skewed shape of the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s is mainly caused by the local bulges of the large grains near the bed surface as shown in fig 5 for the flowrate of 25 52 l s except for the zones of cs02 cs06 and 0 y b 2 cs08 cs12 and b 2 y 0 many small grains near the bed surface are scoured away which exposes the large grains near the bed surface the exposed large grains increase the quantity ratio of the higher elevation points relative to the total elevation samples thus the elevation probability distribution is positively skewed the decreasing width and the increasing height of the elevation probability distribution indicate that the bed surface roughness decreases compared with the initial bed surface roughness when the small grains are transported downstream by the flow and encounter local hollows near the bed surface that were caused by the artificial paving process those small grains are likely to be deposited into the hollows which can generate a smoothing effect for the bed surface in addition when the fluids flow through the initial bed surface the fluid turbulence can cause the bed surface to vibrate slightly driven by this slight vibration the small grains near the bed surface will adaptively embed into the spaces among the adjacent large grains which can also generate a smoothing effect for the bed surface these two smoothing effects produce the decreasing width and the increasing height of the elevation probability distribution for the flowrate of 25 52 l s as the flowrate increases to 33 45 42 09 51 37 and 65 68 l s the widths of the probability distributions continuously increase and the heights gradually decrease which indicates that the bed surface roughness increases with the increasing flowrate it can also be seen that as the flowrate increases from 25 25 to 33 45 42 09 and 51 37 l s in turn the change extents of the elevation probability distributions gradually decrease which indicates that the erosion rates of the bed surfaces gradually decrease and the bed surface stabilities gradually increases as shown in fig 7 the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface increase with the increasing flowrate and then the longitudinal shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface also increase because of these increases the small grains near the bed surface are continuously scoured away which increases the average grain size of the bed surface constituents with the increasing average grain size the shelter and frictional effects among the grains increase and then the bed surface can resist a stronger flow namely the bed surface stability increases in addition when the fluids flow through the bed surface the slight bed surface vibration caused by the fluid turbulence will make the grains near the bed surface adaptively embed themselves into the most stable locations this can lead to the compaction of the bed surface which also enhances the bed surface stability as the experiment progresses the compacting effect caused by the fluid turbulence becomes more persistent during subsequent experimental runs and higher flowrates this means that the bed surface is more stable during the later experimental cases after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the elevation probability distribution changes significantly this is mainly because the flow strength at this stage is too large and the armoring layer formed by the 51 37 l s flowrate cannot resist the flow driven scour at this greater flowrate and is destructed this implies that although the armoring layer provides a certain protective effect on the riverbed and can resist a certain extent of increasing flow strength its protective ability is limited once the flowrate increment surpasses the limit that the armoring layer can withstand the armoring layer cannot resist the flow driven scour 4 2 statistical parameters of the detrended bed surface elevations as shown in fig 8 the elevation standard deviation of the detrended initial bed surface is 2 25 mm and the elevation skewness is close to 0 and the elevation kurtosis is approximately equal to 3 which implies that the elevation probability distribution of the detrended initial bed surface roughly follows a normal distribution this distribution property is mainly caused by the loose cluster effect of the constituent grains and the random errors of the artificially paving operations the elevation standard deviation of the detrended bed surface for the flowrate of 25 52 l s becomes 2 03 mm and the elevation skewness becomes 0 53 and the elevation kurtosis becomes 5 21 which indicates that the bed surface roughness in this stage decreases and the elevation probability distribution is positively skewed and leptokurtic thereafter with the increasing flowrate the elevation standard deviation and the elevation skewness gradually increase and the elevation kurtosis gradually decreases with the increasing flowrate the longitudinal shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface increase and then the small grains near the bed surface are continuously eroded away by the flow then the large grains near the bed surface are further exposed and the bed surface becomes rougher thus the elevation standard deviation increases and the elevation kurtosis decreases the increasingly exposed extents of the large grains near the bed surface increase the quantity ratio of the higher elevation points relative to the total elevation samples therefore the elevation skewness increases in addition after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the elevation standard deviation increases sharply which indicates that the bed surface roughness will increase significantly once the armoring layer is destructed 4 3 variograms of the detrended bed surface elevations as shown in fig 9 a for the small calculation intervals of 10 mm hx 10 mm and 10 mm hy 10 mm the two dimensional variogram contours for the detrended initial bed surface are roughly circular which means that the initial bed surface is approximately isotropic this approximately isotropic property is mainly due to the artificially paving operations before filling the meandering channel with sediment all the natural sediment was first fully mixed which made the sediment gradations in any two zones of the paved bed surface essentially homogenous after filling the meandering channel with the fully mixed sediment the experimenters horizontally and randomly scraped the bed surface with a gradienter which made the grain arrangements completely random under the conditions mentioned above the initial bed surface was naturally approximately isotropic the two dimensional variogram contours for the water worked bed surfaces especially in the crossover areas exhibit approximate ellipses whose long axes and short axes are roughly in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively this means that the water worked bed surfaces are completely anisotropic and their roughness properties in the longitudinal and lateral directions are obviously different as shown in fig 9 b as the calculation interval increases the two dimensional variograms for the initial bed surface or the water worked bed surfaces gradually increase and finally arrive at a relatively stable state in any direction the variogram trends are completely consistent with the spherical model which indicates that the spherical model is an appropriate theoretical model for analyzing the bed surface roughness properties as shown in fig 10 when the fluids flow into a curved segment any fluid particle near the water surface will be dominated by the centrifugal force dfc in addition to gravity dg water pressure and frictional force centrifugal force and gravity are both mass forces the centrifugal force points horizontally toward the concave side and the gravitational force is oriented vertically downward thus the resultant mass force acting on any fluid particle near the water surface will deviate toward the concave sidewall as an isobaric surface under a steady flow condition the resultant mass force acting on any fluid particle near the water surface is roughly perpendicular to the lateral tangent line passing through the location of the fluid particle this geometric relationship is valid only when the concave side water surface is higher than the convex side water surface in other words the existence of the additional centrifugal force raises the concave side water level and lowers the convex side water level generating the lateral water surface gradient the existing lateral water surface gradient can produce lateral pressure differences that are constant in the water depth direction and point horizontally toward the convex side the time averaged longitudinal velocity gradually increases from the bed surface to the water surface and the squared time averaged longitudinal velocity is proportional to the centrifugal force thus the centrifugal force gradually increases from the bed surface to the water surface after the lateral pressure differences and the centrifugal forces are combined the resultant force acting on the upper fluids points toward the concave side and the resultant force acting on the lower fluids points toward the convex side which is equivalent to a force couple it is the rotational effect of this equivalent force couple that generates the secondary flow in fig 11 the existing secondary flows make the cross sectional morphologies and the time averaged resultant velocities in the different zones of the meandering channel obviously different which inevitably causes significant differences in the bed surface structures in the different zones therefore it is necessary to compare the bed surface roughness properties in the different zones as mentioned above the roughness properties of the water worked bed surfaces are obviously different in the longitudinal and lateral directions therefore in addition to comparing the bed surface roughness properties in the different zones we should also focus on comparing the roughness properties in the longitudinal and lateral directions for any analytical zone the following analyses expand on this idea as shown in fig 12 for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the specific values in the different zones of the initial bed surface are roughly equal which means that the initial bed surface structures in the different zones are approximately homogeneous for the flowrate of 25 52 l s the variogram parameters in the zones of cs01 cs02 and 0 y b 2 cs02 cs08 and b 2 y 0 and cs08 cs13 and 0 y b 2 increase which is closely related to the main stream path as shown in fig 13 when the fluids reach a bending apex the main stream is close to the convex sidewall which is mainly due to the large sinuosity of the meandering channel dash and khatua 2016 kim et al 2020 this phenomenon can also be explained by the self adaptability of the flow if there is an outstanding factor hindering the flow to excrete downstream in a channel the fluid motion always tends to weaken that factor pan et al 2022b due to the large curvature of the curved segments and the short crossover areas the sinuosity of the experimental meandering channel is too large which seriously hinders the flow to excrete downstream the main stream close to the convex side obviously tends to weaken the sinuosity which is a clear reflection of the flow self adaptability when the main stream reaches the bending apex the main stream direction cannot be changed in time due to inertia and then the main stream directly collides against the opposite concave sidewall thereafter the main stream quickly changes its direction and flows along the sidewall linking the concave side of the adjacent upstream curve with the convex side of the adjacent downstream curve due to the considerable kinetic energy of the main stream the main stream path experiences more intense erosion and the average grain size in the main stream path become large as the average grain size increases the bed surface in the main stream path becomes rougher and the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains increases and then the sills and the correlation lengths in the main stream path increase for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the specific values in the different zones of the main stream path are actually different the variogram parameters in the zones of cs02 cs03 and b 2 y 0 cs08 cs09 and 0 y b 2 are larger which is mainly caused by the main stream colliding against the opposite concave sidewalls when the main stream collides against the sidewalls intense fluid turbulence subsequently occurs which substantially increases the bed surface erosions in these two zones and then the average grain sizes are larger and then the variogram parameters are larger the variogram parameters in the zones of cs03 cs05 and b 2 y 0 cs09 cs11 and 0 y b 2 are larger which is mainly caused by the laterally narrowing effect of the deposited sediment to the channel as the sediment deposition volumes in the crossover areas are large the laterally narrowing effects are also large and then the time averaged longitudinal velocities are also large and then the bed surfaces in the crossover areas are rougher and then the variogram parameters are larger for the flowrate of 25 52 l s the variogram parameters in the zones of cs02 cs06 and 0 y b 2 cs08 cs12 and b 2 y 0 decrease which is closely related to the main stream separations and the secondary underflows in the apex sectional downstream zones as shown in fig 13 when the main stream reaches a bending apex its direction cannot be adjusted in time due to inertia and then the main stream directly collides against the opposite concave sidewall which causes the zones mentioned above to be main stream separating areas as shown in fig 7 a the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream separating areas are relatively small which provides the basic condition for sediment deposition when the upstream sediment is transported to a bending apex by the main stream part of the transported sediment can enter the main stream separating area because of the lateral driving effect of the secondary underflows and subsequently become deposited after the sediment deposition reaches a certain volume a long and narrow sediment depositional feature is finally formed in the main stream separating area due to the low strengths of the secondary underflows the secondary underflows can only drive some small grains into the main stream separating area therefore the average grain size of the depositional feature is small which is why the variogram parameters in the main stream separating areas decrease after the initial bed surface is scoured in addition since the fluid kinetic energies in the main stream separating area are gradually dissipated along the longitudinal direction the grain size of the deposited sediment decreases along the longitudinal direction and then the variogram parameters decrease along the longitudinal direction the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls cs01 cs02 and b 2 y 0 cs06 cs08 and 0 y b 2 cs12 cs13 and b 2 y 0 are greater than the corresponding values in the main stream separating areas and smaller than the corresponding values in the main stream path which is closely related to the main stream path and the rotational directions of the secondary flows since the main stream is close to the convex sidewall when the fluids reach a bending apex the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewall are not scoured by the main stream and then the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls are smaller compared with the corresponding values in the main stream path as shown in fig 11 the rotational directions of the secondary flows change at the downstream locations of the crossover area outlets which prevents the tail ends of the sediment deposition features from extending into the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls therefore the variogram parameters in the zones near the apex sectional concave sidewalls are greater than the corresponding values in the main stream separating areas after the flowrate increases to 33 45 42 09 and 51 37 l s in turn the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface continuously increase and then the shear stresses of the fluids acting on the bed surface also increase which causes the small grains near the bed surface to continuously become scoured away and then the average grain size of the bed surface constituents increases and then the variogram parameters increase after the flowrate increases from 51 37 to 65 68 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream path increase again and then the average grain size in the main stream path also increases again which causes the variogram parameters to increase again as well however the variogram parameters in the main stream separating areas decrease but are greater than the corresponding values for the flowrate of 25 52 l s after the flowrate is set as 65 68 l s the armoring layer formed by the flowrate of 51 37 l s cannot resist flow driven scour and is destructed due to the excessively large flow strength at this stage after the armoring layer formed by the flowrate of 51 37 l s is destructed the small grains near the bed surface are subsequently exposed and transported downstream when the exposed small grains were transported to a bending apex many small grains enter the main stream separating areas because of the lateral driving effect of the secondary underflows and are again deposited which decreases the average grain sizes of the bed surface constituents in the main stream separating areas thereby decreasing the variogram parameters as shown in figs 7 and 11 after the flowrate increases to 65 68 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the main stream separating areas do not substantially increase compared with the flowrate of 25 52 l s but the lateral underflows in the main stream separating areas are obviously strengthened which enables the lateral underflows near the bending apexes to drive larger grains into the main stream separating areas for final deposition in other words after the second instance of small grain deposition the average grain size in any main stream separating area is greater than the corresponding value for the flowrate of 25 52 l s therefore although the variogram parameters in any main stream separating area decrease when the flowrate is set as 65 68 l s they are consistently greater than the corresponding values for the flowrate of 25 52 l s for the same variogram parameter i e the sill or the correlation length the longitudinal value in any local zone of the meandering channel is clearly greater than the lateral value the longitudinal sill is greater than the lateral sill which indicates that the longitudinal roughness is greater than the lateral roughness which is closely related to the fluid turbulence the fluid turbulence can make the grain arrangements near the bed surface more disordered which can also increase the bed surface roughness as shown in fig 14 the longitudinal turbulence intensities near the bed surface are clearly larger compared with the lateral turbulence intensities the larger longitudinal turbulence intensities make the grain arrangements more disordered in the longitudinal direction than the lateral situation which makes the longitudinal roughness greater than the lateral roughness the longitudinal correlation length is clearly greater than the lateral correlation length which indicates that the averaged longitudinal influence scale is obviously greater than the averaged lateral influence scale and is mainly caused by the long axis trends of the grains near the bed surface as shown in figs 7 and 11 the time averaged longitudinal velocities at most locations are much greater than the time averaged lateral velocities thus the longitudinal driving forces of the fluids acting on the bed surfaces are much greater than the lateral driving forces after being scoured by the flow for a long time the long axis trends of the grains near the surface deviate toward the longitudinal direction due to the dominant longitudinal driving forces it is this long axis deviation toward the longitudinal direction that makes the averaged longitudinal influence scale obviously greater than the averaged lateral influence scale 5 conclusions natural sediment was used to artificially pave the bed surface in a meandering channel model and the flowrate was selected as the control variable the cross sectional water levels cross sectional velocities and bed surface elevations were measured and the roughness properties of the gravel bed surfaces in the meandering channel were discussed using statistical theory the main findings of this study can be drawn 1 the elevation probability distributions of the detrended water worked bed surfaces in the meandering channel are positively skewed and leptokurtic with the increasing flowrate the elevation standard deviation and the elevation skewness increase but the elevation kurtosis decreases 2 the armoring layer in the meandering channel provides a certain protective effect on the riverbed and can resist a certain extent of increasing flow strength but its protective ability is very limited once the flowrate increment surpasses the limit that the armoring layer can withstand the armoring layer will be destructed and the bed surface roughness will increase significantly 3 the bed surface structures in the different zones of the meandering channel are obviously different the bed surface roughness and the averaged influence scale of the constituent grains are large in the main stream path while those in the main stream separating areas are small and decrease along the longitudinal direction for any local zone the roughness and the averaged influence scale in the longitudinal direction are obviously larger compared with the corresponding values in the lateral direction declaration of competing interest the authors declare
