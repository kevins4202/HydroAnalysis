3620,advance forecast of water inrush can help ensure operational safety in underground engineering in this study a coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model is developed to simulate the process of water inrush from collapse columns in coal mines with complex geological environments specifically nonlinear fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media associated with the erosion and damage of collapse columns are considered this numerical model is validated against water inrush field data from two coal mines with regard to flow rate fluid pressure and temperature profiles over time are also investigated there is a water pressure accumulation phenomenon in hidden collapse columns temperature is found to change more significantly than velocity in the early stages of water inrush in addition the spatial variation of temperature can be divided into three zones during the process of water inrush according to the rules governing the spatio temporal variation of temperature a novel method utilizing a real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri and a water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit is proposed to determine whether and where water inrushes will occur this study demonstrates how this novel method can predict water inrush and overcome the main limitations in previous studies where temperature was used as a predictor this method has the potential to be applied in practice to better understand the risks related to coal mine management and water inrush and thus improves mine safety keywords water inrush hydraulics temperature collapse column risk index 1 introduction water inrush is a common geological disaster resulting in both considerable economic losses and even loss of life liu et al 2020 li et al 2020 cui et al 2020 therefore many hydrogeologists and researchers consider the mitigation of mine water hazards as key objectives yin et al 2018 ding et al 2019 water inrush typically occurs through porous and fractured strata that can include collapse columns or karst regions hou et al 2018 mao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 see fig 1 faults xue et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and mining induced fractures ma et al 2019 liu et al 2018a the causes of water inrush are generally interactions between different variables in complex geological environments including ground temperature water pressure wang et al 2020 and ground stress cheng et al 2013 and thus resulting in mechanical and thermal induced rock damage qiu et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and water rock interaction induced erosion ma et al 2019 murray et al 2019 these impacts increase the permeability of porous and fractured strata leading to an increase in water velocities from confined aquifers to working faces that can result in a water inrush disaster multi environmental factor induced water inrush has motivated researchers to consider coupling models of temperature fluid flow and mechanical deformation to develop thermal hydraulic mechanical thm models for predicting water inrush cheng et al 2013 nie et al 2020 groundwater from a higher or lower temperature zone can heat or cool the temperature of the zone it flows through respectively change in temperature of groundwater is generally used to estimate groundwater discharge and has been applied in many fields for purposes e g measuring groundwater discharge to a stream becker et al 2004 briggs et al 2018 identifying the depth of the halocline in a coastal fracture gamble et al 2003 locating zones of groundwater discharge to surface water hare et al 2015 and predicting water inrush bai et al 2015 when a water inrush occurs groundwater flows from a deep or shallow aquifer through fractured rocks to the working face and either increases or decreases the temperature of the zone that it flows through monitoring this temperature change can be used to predict mine water inrush bai et al 2015 bai et al 2015 measured the temperature change in a coal seam and used 1 5 c and 2 4 c as thresholds to divide warning levels into dangerous and extremely dangerous fault water inrush categories wang et al 2017 found that a temperature change ranging from 2 8 helped to predict water inrush from a collapse column liu et al 2018b found that a temperature change from 1 2 helped to predict water inrush from a fault the values of temperature change used to predict water inrush are different in different studies to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the rules governing the spatio temporal variation of temperature to predict water inrush some existing models have incorporated thermal analysis to analyze water inrush gui and xu 2017 wang et al 2017 however there are a few limitations in these models 1 the examined temperature change was limited to a specific case study or a geothermal environment 2 steady state heat transfer was often used but the dynamic changes in temperature during the entire process of water inrush was not studied and 3 temperature variations at different locations in coal mines e g confined aquifer collapse column mining induced damage zone and working face have not been explored as a result temperature has not been used widely to predict water inrush due to these three limitations the use of specific criteria that can be applied in more cases will help mine managers and researchers to judge when and where a water inrush will occur the governing equations for groundwater flow in a confined aquifer fractured strata and a working face have been studied widely many researchers have used linear equations i e darcy s law to describe flow in a confined aquifer and fractured strata and have obtained meaningful results that have helped predict water inrush yang et al 2003 yuan and harrison 2004 recently many studies have incorporated nonlinear flow phenomena with a high reynolds number in fractured strata by applying non darcy flow such as the forchheimer murray et al 2016 shi et al 2018 or brinkman equation liu et al 2018c xue et al 2019 these studies have shown that the water flowing through fractured porous media experiences darcy flow in a confined aquifer gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 non darcy flow in the fractured zone of a collapse column or fault and navier stokes flow shi et al 2018 in working faces i e in the mine voids after exploitation of the coal seams non darcy flow in the fractured zone of a fault can be governed by the brinkman or forchheimer equation combining ground temperature with nonlinear flow equations more accurate temperature changes can be obtained however to the best of our knowledge there is no existing water inrush model that combines the heat transfer equation with nonlinear flow equations in porous media to address the limitations discussed above the objective of this study is to develop a coupled thm model of water inrush the coupled thm model is numerically simulated by the comsol multiphysics and the results are compared with field data and existing research to validate the model according to our findings a new method for using temperature to predict water inrush is proposed in this method the real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri is defined to replace the value of temperature and a tri threshold is adopted as the criterion for predicting water inrush to address the first limitation of requiring values applicable to different case studies then the tri change over time is studied to overcome the second limitation of dynamic change the spatial temperature variations along the bottom of a coal seam and working face are different and can be divided into three zones the original temperature zone ot mining induced low temperature mlt and water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit the wit is used to determine the location of a water inrush to address the above mentioned third limitation 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model assumptions prior to the mathematical formulation the assumptions of this framework are as follows the aquifer collapse column coal seam and the other strata are firstly assumed to be porous media in addition the heat transfer in porous media satisfies the assumption of local thermal equilibrium the temperature in an aquifer is assumed to be the same during the process of water inrushes since the reynolds number in porous media is less than 300 kaviany 1991 the flow is assumed to be laminar further the dynamic viscosity μ and mass density ρ of groundwater remain constant and do not vary with temperature i e μ 10 3 pa s and ρ 103 kg m3 the working faces tunnels are assumed to be flooded at the initial time xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 this is because it is not essential and practical to study the process of filling the working faces tunnels with groundwater this process is difficult to be captured and simulated and thus it is also challenging to determine the space occupied by water i e the domain governed by the navier stokes equation in the process however the outlet boundary for the navier stokes equation should be initially prescribed as a consequence if the working face is not assumed to be flooded the outlet boundary is difficult to set therefore the working faces tunnels are usually assumed to be flooded to simplify the model to simulate water inrush xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in addition even if the boundaries in this process can be determined the results obtained by setting these boundaries as outlet boundaries have small errors compared with those obtained by setting the boundaries of the flooded space i e b 5 and b 6 this is mainly because the variation in the heights of the above outlet boundaries is much less than the total height of the model i e the thickness between the aquifer and the outlet boundaries the pressure drop within such a small change of height is much less than the total pressure drop such a pressure drop then has a small impact on the ground temperature and velocity of groundwater as a result the error caused by the assumption can be safely ignored 2 2 water flow equations darcy s law the brinkman equation and the navier stokes equation are adopted to simulate the water flow in a confined aquifer collapse column and working face respectively darcy s law has been widely used as a framework to describe groundwater flow in a confined aquifer combining darcy s law the continuity equation and the storage term the governing equations for the flow in confined aquifers becomes 1 ρ f s p t ρ f k μ p ρ f g 0 where k is the permeability m2 p is the fluid pressure pa ρ f is the fluid density kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and s is the storage coefficient and can be calculated by mathias et al 2019 2 s ϕ χ f α b ϕ 1 α b k d where ϕ is the porosity χ f is the fluid compressibility k d is the drained bulk modulus α b is biot s coefficient associated with the total stress and effective stress chen et al 2020 3 σ σ t α b p where σ and σ t are the effective stress and total stress respectively and α b is the effective stress coefficient α b is related to the drained bulk modulus k d and the solid bulk modulus k s 4 α b 1 k d k s the drained bulk modulus is always smaller than the solid bulk modulus since a solid block has a greater stiffness than a porous block made of the same material therefore the effective stress coefficient always has a range of 0 1 a soft porous matrix has an effective stress coefficient close to 1 since the drained bulk modulus is much smaller than the solid bulk modulus a stiff matrix is close to its porosity since k d 1 ϕ k s the brinkman equation is adopted to describe nonlinear flow in a collapse column and is described as ergun and orning 1949 nield and bejan 2006 amiri et al 2019 5 ρ f ϕ v t v v ϕ p 1 ϕ μ v v t μ k ρ f β v v ρ f g 6 α v 1 k a 1 ϕ 2 d 2 ϕ 3 7 β b 1 ϕ d ϕ 3 where v is the darcy velocity m s α v is the viscous resistance coefficient 1 m2 β is the inertial resistance coefficient 1 m and d is particle size m the constants a and b are 150 and 1 75 respectively in the original ergun correlation ergun and orning 1949 many researchers have found that these values are different for each packed bed and should be empirically determined for each case montillet et al 2007 lacroix et al 2007 du plessis et al 2013 du plessis and woudberg 2008 amiri et al 2019 summarized some values of a and b from some literatures and obtained a ranging 170 200 and b ranging 1 35 2 00 with a porosity ranging 0 2 0 8 according to du plessis and woudberg 2008 the maximum values of a and b are adopted in our study i e a and b are set at 200 and 2 respectively the brinkman equation can also be used to simulate flow in intact strata by neglecting the forchheimer term βρv 2 stokes flow with the darcy term μv k in the brinkman equation can be used to govern the pressure gradient in viscous penetration dominated flow the brinkman equation without the forchheimer term βρv 2 is used to simulate the flow in intact strata the navier stokes equation has been adopted to describe nonlinear flow in working faces and is expressed as 8 ρ f v t ρ v v p μ v v t ρ f g moreover the above equations can then be combined with the continuity equation 9 t ϕ ρ f ρ f v 0 2 3 heat transfer equations the heat transfer equations for porous media fluids and solids are adopted to model the temperature change in a confined aquifer collapse column working face a coal seam and overlying strata heat transfer in porous media satisfies the assumption of local thermal equilibrium that is the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases is much smaller than the one at the pore level as a result the method of volume averaging can be applied to thermophysical properties heat transfer in a confined aquifer and collapse column follows the process of heat transfer in porous media whose governing equation is kaviany 1991 bear and bachmat 1990 10 ρ f c f eff t t ρ f c f v t q 0 where t is the temperature k and ρ f c f eff is the effective volumetric heat capacity j m3 k defined as 11 ρ f c f eff 1 ϕ ρ s c s ϕ ρ f c f where ρ s is the density of the porous matrix kg m3 and c s and c f are the heat capacity of a porous matrix and a fluid j kg k respectively q is the conductive heat flux j s m2 written as 12 q k eff t where k eff is the effective thermal conductivity w m k defined as 13 k eff 1 ϕ k s ϕ k f where k s and k f are the thermal conductivity of a porous matrix and a fluid respectively w m k the governing equation for heat transfer in fluids i e working faces can be obtained by setting ϕ 1 while the one in solids i e overlying strata and coal seams can be obtained by setting ϕ 0 2 4 erosion equation the erosion equation in a collapse column is established based on the erosion constitutive equation papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 this equation is expressed as 14 d ϕ 0 t j ρ s r where j is the rate of eroded mass stems from a solid skeleton kg m3 s and r is the porosity change rate over time r is complex and affected by many factors such as chemical corrosion and seepage induced erosion according to some water rock interaction experiments r has a large range e g 3 30 10 9 1 29 10 8 1 s lin et al 2019 in chemical corrosion experiments and 1 48167 10 6 2 667 10 5 1 s tian et al 2020 and 9 38 10 4 1 19 10 2 1 s hu et al 2019 in fluid erosion experiments the water rock interaction in a collapse column includes chemical corrosion and seepage induced erosion the water pressure used in seepage induced erosion experiments is generally larger than that of the actual rock generally a water pressure in the order of mpa is applied on specimens with a height of 0 1 1 m for example hu et al 2019 applied a water pressure of 1 5 5 5 mpa on a specimen with a height of 1 m however since the height of collapse columns in coal mines is generally hundreds of meters and the water pressure of aquifers is generally not more than 10 mpa a reasonable value of r should be in the middle of the values obtained in the above experiments in this study the range of r is assumed to be constant and set as 1 10 8 1 10 5 1 s 2 5 damage equations the mechanical equilibrium equation is expressed as 15 σ f where σ is the effective stress pa and f is the volume force n m3 the strain displacement relation equation is described as 16 ε 1 2 u t u and the stress strain relation equation generalized hooke law is written as 17 ε x 1 e σ x μ σ y σ z ε y 1 e σ y μ σ z σ x ε z 1 e σ z μ σ x σ y γ xy 1 g τ xy γ yz 1 g τ yz γ zx 1 g τ zx in this study the damage equation as proposed by zhu et al 2009 is adopted as follows 18 f 1 σ 3 f t 0 19 f 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 sin θ 1 sin θ f c 0 where σ 3 is the minimum principal stress pa σ 1 is the maximum principal stress pa θ is the internal friction angle in radians f t 0 is the uniaxial tensile strength pa and f c 0 is the uniaxial compressive strength pa tensile damage occurs when f 1 0 and compression damage occurs when f 2 0 then a damage parameter can be defined as 20 d 0 f 1 0 f 2 0 1 ε t 0 ε 3 n f 1 0 1 ε c 0 ε 1 n f 2 0 where ε t 0 is the maximum tensile principal strain when tensile damage occurs ε c 0 is the maximum compression principal strain when compression damage occurs ε 3 is the minimum principal strain ε 1 is the maximum principal strain and n is the damage coefficient damage with a value of 2 zhu et al 2009 the damage equation is implemented to simulate the mechanical impact of underground stresses on the permeability of strata 2 6 porosity and permeability the porosity in a confined aquifer collapse column and intact strata is governed by the following equation rutqvist and tsang 2002 zhu et al 2009 21 ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ r exp α ϕ σ v ϕ r where ϕ 0 is the porosity when the stress is zero ϕ r is the limit value of porosity under high compressive stress α ϕ is the stress sensitivity index of porosity set as 5 10 8 pa 1 rutqvist and tsang 2002 and σ v is the mean effective stress 22 σ v σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 considering the damage parameter the permeability in the collapse column and mining induced damage zone is zhu et al 2009 23 k d 2 ϕ 3 a 1 ϕ 2 exp α k d and the permeability in the confined aquifer and intact strata is expressed as 24 k k c ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 exp α k d where α k is the sensitivity coefficient of the influence of damage on permeability and k c is a permeability coefficient independent of the porosity of the rock 2 7 the water inrush coefficient wic the water inrush coefficient wic is an important value and can be used to predict the occurrence of water inrush it was proposed based on the statistical analysis of long term water inrush data and was defined in the detailed regulations for coal mine water prevention and control nmsa 2018 as an empirical formula li et al 2018 25 k p m where k is the wic mpa m p is the water pressure applied to the bottom of the aquifuge mpa and m is the thickness of the water resisting strata intact strata m the critical water inrush coefficient is 0 1 mpa m i e water inrush will occur when the coefficient is above 0 1 mpa m and will not occur when it is less than or equal to 0 1 mpa m in summary the coupled processes of the complex geological environment in this model are shown in fig 2 3 model setup and validation in this study two cases of water inrush an exposed collapse column in the bailong coal mine and a hidden collapse column in the xiaoyun coal mine are used to validate the model water flow rate the only directly measured field data available can be used to validate water inrush models yao et al 2018 no other research other than that by yao et al 2018 has used flow rate to validate a water inrush model because the flow rate depends on the complex interaction of many factors and it is challenging to simulate the change in flow rate over time without considering these interactions therefore the simulation of this model is validated against actual flow rate field data in general the measurement and calculation of flow rate have an approximately 20 error rate xue 2010 when water inrush occurs the flow rate increases exponentially which implies that mine staff need to leave the working face to a safer environment due to the rapid and overwhelming flow during water inrush the flow rate is usually estimated by the volume of the submerged roadway which causes an even greater error in the measured flow rate in this study we use the smaller estimated error of 20 to ensure the validity of the field data in addition when water inrush occurs equipment is submerged and the flow rate cannot be measured in real time which causes a temporal error although there is no relevant study on this temporal error field results show that it is not small in this study the temporal error is assumed to be 10 of the time interval 3 1 background of the hydrogeological characteristics and numerical model setup the above mentioned mines are both located in the northern region of china due to the presence of collapse columns water inrush has occurred in both mines the field data of the flow rates during the water inrush process in the two cases is shown in fig 3 in case 1 the water inrush occurred in the 2 1101 working face of the bailong coal mine in china on march 13 2007 the no 572 collapse column was exposed in the bailong coal mine on march 18 the water inflow was 50 60 m3 h with tests indicating that the water was from limestone the flow rate increased from 140 m3 h on march 25 to 800 m3 h on april 2 and increased to 1200 m3 h on april 5 in case 2 the water inrush occurred in working face 1313 of the xiaoyun coal mine the flow rate increased from 40 50 m3 h at 00 10 on september 11 to 400 m3 h at 03 10 on september 11 and about 3600 m3 h at 22 00 on september 11 the model geometries are set up considering the history of the coal mine see fig 4 in case 1 the maximum and the minimum ground elevations are 837 m and 540 m respectively with an average ground elevation of 690 m the height of the coal seam collapse column and confined aquifer is 4 5 m 110 m and 30 m respectively the elevation of the coal seam is 370 m and the length of the bottom of the working face is 13 m then we can obtain the average thickness of the overlying strata as about 320 m which is set as 50 m in this geometrical model and the remaining thickness of 320 m is set as a top boundary load of about 6 7 mpa the water pressure in the confined aquifer is 3 2 mpa in case 2 the height of the coal seam collapse column and confined aquifer is 3 8 m 158 m and 30 m respectively the elevation of the coal seam is 632 5 m and the length of the bottom of the working face is 90 m the average height of the overlying strata is about 632 5 m which is set as 100 m in this model with the remaining height set as a top boundary load of about 13 3 mpa the height of the strata between the collapse column and the working face scw is 42 m there is a saddle shaped damage zone in the scw caused by the mining of the coal seam guo et al 2016 this damage zone would not exist in the scw if the scw was not affected by mining and thus the scw would have originally been composed of intact and water resisting strata the flow rate field data is usually estimated from the volume of the submerged roadway the product of the area of these seepage zones cross section and the average velocity is equal to the total flow rate which in turn facilitates the calculation of the flow rate in the model since a two dimensional model is used in this study the cross section is assumed to vary in only one direction with a fixed width this is because the magnitude of the velocity mainly depends on the length of the cross section along this direction the length reflects the distance between the working face tunnel and the collapse column the closer the working face is to the collapse column the greater is the velocity in the section and the higher is the possibility of the occurrence of water inrush is the fixed width represents the width of the overlapping part of the working faces tunnels and the collapse columns the contribution of the width to the magnitude of the velocity is less than that of the length the widths for case 1 and case 2 are 37 m and 3 m respectively according to the actual situation in the field the water inrush area is the product of the fixed width and the length of the bottom of the working face 3 2 model parameters and initial and boundary conditions there are many rock strata with various properties such as coarse sandstone fine sandstone siltstone mudstone and limestone between the confined aquifers and the working faces the thickness of these strata is usually in the hundreds of meters the properties of the different rock strata and even of the same stratum vary given the difficulty of directly measuring the parameter values for all the strata values from the literature is adopt as listed in table 1 the values of these parameters are determined as follows the parameters in the thermal model include the thermal conductivities of the fluid and solid matrix as well as the heat capacities of the fluid and solid matrix the stratified geology is simplified by means of a homogeneous material characterized by average values of properties note that the same thermal conductivity is assigned to all the rocks however the effective thermal conductivities are not the same they are governed by eq 13 and thus depend on the porosity and thermal conductivities of the rocks and fluids coal is the solid matrix comprising the porous media of coal seams and its thermal conductivity is determined to be 0 6 w m k the parameters in the solid mechanical model cover the uniaxial compressive strength uniaxial tensile strength elastic modulus internal friction angle in radians poisson s ratio and density collapse columns are generally formed by clay and the fragmentation of rock the clay and pores among the rock fragments make the elastic modulus of collapse columns relatively small for example lin et al 2021 obtained that the elastic modulus of a collapse column is 0 15 0 3 gpa the modulus of elasticity of coal is generally smaller than that of rock and has a wide range for example the elastic modulus of some soft coals can be as low as 0 061 gpa tang et al 2021 while some hard rocks can be as high as 4 gpa han et al 2020 the parameters in the hydraulic model include the dynamic viscosity fluid density and properties of porous media the dynamic viscosity and density of groundwater are generally 1 10 3 pa s and 1 103 kg m3 respectively in general the porosity and particle size in water inrush models are determined and calibrated by the permeability of fractured strata this is because collapse columns and mining induced damage zones are usually hundreds of meters thick and the porosity and particle size vary at such large scales it is not practical to measure the porosity and particle size of crushed stone in the entire area of a collapse column and the mining induced damage zone in an scw the order of magnitude of the permeability of fractured strata during water inrush is generally in the range of 1 10 13 1 10 9 m2 hou et al 2018 yao et al 2018 many mine disasters including water inrush are more likely to occur in deep mines chen et al 2019 case 2 has a deeper working face and collapse column than case 1 according to the accident reports from cases 1 and 2 the groundwater was from the ordovician limestone confined aquifer in both cases 1 and 2 ordovician limestone confined aquifers in different cases have different properties the water abundance in the aquifers and ground pressure in case 2 are larger than those in case 1 the mining impact on the increase in permeability in case 2 is greater than that in case 1 therefore the porosity porosity change rate particle size and sensitivity coefficient in case 2 are greater than those in case 1 the parameters of the intact strata and the coal seam are the same in these two cases the limestone aquifers have a stiff matrix and therefore α b is set as the porosity of the confined aquifer it is noted that the biot s coefficient is often assumed to be proportional to porosity ramos da silva et al 2010 the sensitivity of the results to the biot s coefficient should be analyzed and will be discussed in the following the model is numerically solved using the comsol multiphysics software the comsol module settings are shown in table 2 the initial and boundary conditions and model boundaries and domains for case 1 and 2 are shown in fig 4 and table 3 the model boundaries and domains are numbered by b and d see fig 4 for the mechanical model the bottom and top boundaries of the geologic model are set as a fixed constraint and a boundary load respectively a slipping constraint is applied to the boundaries on both sides the boundary load represents the load imposed by overlying strata above the top boundaries of the geological model for the hydraulic model the bottom boundaries of the geologic model are set as a pressure to represent the groundwater pressure applied by the confined aquifer the top and right boundaries of the working face are also set as a pressure to obtain a continuous solution at the common boundaries of the confined aquifer collapse column scw and working faces the pressure and velocity at the common boundaries are set to be equal the hydrostatic pressure ph in intact strata collapse column and working face are expressed by the initial conditions for the thermal model the bottom boundaries are set with a constant temperature and the top right and left boundaries are set with no heat flux the initial temperature in the working faces is set with constant values and the initial temperature in the other zones is dependent on the geothermal gradients the process of the thm numerical simulation is as follows 1 the pressure of strata water pressure of confined aquifer temperature of confined aquifer and geothermal gradient are inputs to the model 2 then the governing equations are solved by comsol 3 lastly the velocity and temperature are output which are used to study the relationship between velocity and temperature during the process of water inrush and predict a water inrush 3 3 model mesh independence analysis the computational geometry and mesh are created in the comsol multiphysics software and all the partial differential equations acting also as the governing equations are solved numerically by the finite element method the number of mesh elements and the simulated water flow rates in the different types of mesh are listed in table 4 moreover the water flow rates over time are shown in fig 3 for the different types of mesh since the maximum flow rate represents the intensity of water inrush it is set as a reference variable to evaluate the optimal mesh i e the flow rate after 18 days in the bailong coal mine and 16 h in the xiaoyun coal mine the mesh is made gradually finer from the mesh type ⅰ to iv until the relative deviation in the flow rate of the two cases became 0 6 and 0 8 respectively which indicates that the mesh types iii and iv are optimal in this study a fine unstructured mesh near any no slip boundary and an increasingly coarser mesh in the middle zone are set to resolve the boundary layer and reduce the computational cost as a result mesh type iv is selected as the optimal mesh and is used in the rest of the study 3 4 model validation the field versus model flow rate data over time in different types of mesh for case 1 is shown in fig 3a the simulated data in mesh types iii and iv are in good agreement with the field data in the initial stages i e the first field data and the late stages the last two field data there is a deviation between the simulated data and the field data in the middle stage i e the second field data which can be ascribed to a greater temporal time error the interval is seven days and there is no other data between the first and second field data which can have created a larger temporal error although there is a discrepancy in the middle stage it can be acceptable for water inrush prediction this is because more attention is usually paid to the flow rate in the initial and late stages the flow rate in the initial stage is used to judge whether there will be water inrush the flow rate in the late stage is used to judge how serious the water inrush disaster will be and how much property loss it will cause which is the reason why previous studies focused on the prediction of flow rate in the late stage the field versus model flow rate data over time in different types of mesh for case 2 is shown in fig 3b the simulated data in mesh types ⅱ iii and iv are in good agreement with most of the field data in addition the occurrence of water inrush from a hidden collapse column depends on whether there is a mining induced damage zone between the working face and the hidden collapse column if the middle zone is not affected by the excavation of coal seams no mining induced damage zone forms and water inrush will not occur according to the field data the flow rate with no water inrush is about 20 35 m3 h in this study the simulated flow rate under the condition of no mining induced damage zone is compared with the actual field data to validate the model see fig 3c the mesh statistics and simulated flow rate after 16 h in different types of mesh are shown in table 4 the relative deviation in the flow rate between mesh types iii and iv is 0 3 we can see that the simulated data in mesh type iv agrees well with the field data 4 results three data sets in lines 1 2 and 3 are selected in every case study see fig 4 line 1 is used to study the variation in velocity pressure and temperature along the bottom of the working face line 2 corresponds to the water flow path from the aquifer through the collapse column to the working face and thus line 2 is used to study the variation in pressure and temperature along the water flow path line 3 corresponds to the bottom of the working face and coal seam and represents the locations where data could be readily measured in the field and thus line 3 is used to study the temperature change along the working face and its neighboring zones 4 1 mining induced damage zone porosity and permeability while the mining induced damage zone is shown in fig 5 the porosity and permeability in the collapse column are depicted in figs 6 and 7 respectively three time frames are also plotted to demonstrate the transient behaviors of porosity and permeability in each mine as can be seen the porosity and permeability are not uniform under the impact of stress and mining induced damage the porosity and permeability in the collapse column have a significant increase over time the average porosity increases from 0 172 to 0 373 and from 0 145 to 0 393 in cases 1 and 2 respectively during the process of water inrush meanwhile the maximum and minimum porosities increase from 0 294 and 0 020 to 0 640 and 0 039 in case 1 and from 0 151 and 0 118 to 0 411 and 0 320 in case 2 respectively on the other hand the average permeability greatly increases from 1 05 10 12 m2 to 1 89 10 11 m2 and 8 64 10 12 m2 to 8 74 10 10 m2 in cases 1 and 2 respectively during the process of water inrush the maximum and minimum permeability significantly rise from 4 23 10 11 m2 and 5 33 10 15 m2 to 1 67 10 9 m2 and 4 79 10 14 m2 in case 1 and from 7 19 10 10 m2 and 3 81 10 12 m2 to 3 01 10 8 m2 and 2 09 10 10 m2 in case 2 respectively the porosity and permeability in the remaining zones vary spatially see fig 8 due to the spatial changes in the mechanical variables i e stress and mining damage the stress remains almost unchanged with time because the change with time in α b p is far smaller than σ t see eq 3 which makes the porosity and permeability in the remaining zones remain almost unchanged with time table 5 shows the average and extreme values of porosity and permeability in these zones the locations of the extreme values are marked in figs 7 and 8 4 2 water pressure fig 9 a b shows the water pressure along line 2 the pressure decreases along the flow path while the rate of the pressure drop increased this is because there are inertial and viscous resistances in the collapse column and their sum is larger than the viscous resistance in the confined aquifer the pressure drop in a confined aquifer is generally called pressure relief which has been identified in many studies xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 this phenomenon occurs when there is a direct connection between an exposed collapse column and the working face e g in the bailong model the pressure decreases with time in the confined aquifer and collapse column this may differ when there are strata between the collapse column and the working face the scw is damaged by coal mining a mining induced damage will then be formed in the scw in the case of no coal mining the scw is composed by water resisting strata however these previous studies did not investigate the pressure drop associated with hidden collapse columns fig 9b shows the pressure change over time in the hidden collapse column in the xiaoyun coal mine with the increase in time the pressure decreases in the confined aquifer but increases in the collapse column this is because there is an erosion effect in the collapse column causing its permeability to increase with time yao et al 2018 the permeability of an scw is mainly affected by mining damage usually does not change after rock damage and is usually less than that of the collapse column therefore in our model the pressure drop of the scw is reduced and the pressure accumulates and increases with time in the upper part of the collapse column and the lower part of the damaged area this pressure accumulation phenomenon also reveals the reason for the water inrush from the hidden collapse column generally there is no damage to the mining induced damage zone and water inrush does not occur when coal seams are not mined in the xiaoyun coal mine if the impact of mining damage on permeability is not considered and the mining induced damage zone is considered as intact rock water inrush does not occur see fig 10 a the velocity of groundwater in the scw with damage see fig 10b is more than several hundred times that with no damage pressure accumulation is more obvious and the pressure is higher compared with that obtained from the damage model see fig 10c d the change in the average pressure over time at the top boundary of the collapse column with damage and no damage is shown in fig 11 the wic change over time can be calculated using the pressure under the condition of no mining induced damage zone in the scw the scw is water resisting strata when there is no mining induced damage zone then the wic of the scw is calculated by the pressure under the condition of no mining induced damage zone divided by the thickness of the scw as shown in fig 11 the wic is above the critical value after 1 3 h and reaches 0 11 after 16 h in case 2 which indicates that water inrush will occur if the scw is affected by the mining induced damage zone historical events show that water inrush did occur after coal seam excavation 4 3 temperature the effective heat capacities and effective thermal conductivities in the collapse column confined aquifer intact strata and scw are depicted in figs 12 and 13 respectively three time frames are also plotted to demonstrate transient behaviors in each mine as can be seen the heat capacities and thermal conductivities are not uniform and change with the porosity the average maximum and minimum heat capacities increase from 2 51 106 j m3 k 2 76 106 j m3 k and 2 20 106 j m3 k to 2 92 106 j m3 k 3 46 106 j m3 k and 2 24 106 j m3 k in the collapse column of case 1 and from 2 46 106 j m3 k 2 47 106 j m3 k and 2 40 106 j m3 k to 2 96 106 j m3 k 3 00 106 j m3 k and 2 81 106 j m3 k in the collapse column of case 2 respectively during the process of water inrush meanwhile the average maximum and minimum thermal conductivities decrease from 2 17 w m k 2 46 w m k and 1 94 w m k to 1 79 w m k 2 43 w m k and 1 28 w m k in the collapse column of case 1 and from 2 22 w m k 2 28 w m k and 2 21 w m k to 1 75 w m k 1 89 w m k and 1 72 w m k in the collapse column of case 2 respectively during the process of water inrush the average maximum and minimum heat capacities and thermal conductivities in the confined aquifer intact strata and scw are shown in table 5 the heat capacities and thermal conductivities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face do not change with porosity because they are governed by the heat transfer equation of solids or fluids the extreme values of the heat capacities have the same locations as the extreme values of the porosities the maximum values of the thermal conductivities have the same locations as the minimum values of the porosities and the minimum values of the thermal conductivities have the same locations as the maximum values of the porosities the heat capacities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face are 1 68 106 j m3 k 2 25 106 j m3 k and 4 20 106 j m3 k respectively and the thermal conductivities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face are 0 6 w m k 2 5 w m k and 0 6 w m k respectively fig 9c d shows the temperature along line 2 the temperature gradually increases over time in the direction of the water flow this is mainly because the water flowing from the deep aquifer has a higher temperature which causes the temperature in the shallow zones to increase through heat transfer as can be seen in fig 10e f the temperature does not change when the velocity is minimal i e water inrush is absent due to the low heat transfer through convection while the temperature changes when the velocity is very large i e water inrush is present since heat transfer through convection becomes more significant consequently the temperature change can be a good indicator to predict water inrush 4 4 temperature dependent risk index fig 14 a b shows the average temperature and velocity along line 1 the temperature increases faster than the velocity especially in the early stage of water inrush due to mixed conduction convection heat transfer mechanisms indicating that water inrush can be found and predicted earlier by measuring the temperature change however a change in velocity or flow rate is generally used to predict water inrush by coal mine managers and decision makers this delay can cause hesitation in the implementation of safety measures for workers and equipment in the early stages as decision makers remain unsure whether water inrush will occur in view of this a new method for predicting water inrush based on the temperature change is proposed it is not appropriate to use temperature increments to predict water inrush because they are different in different cases the increment is 3 4 in the bailong coal mine but 6 7 in the xiaoyun coal mine the results of temperature changes are also different in previous research such as 1 5 2 4 c bai et al 2015 2 8 wang et al 2017 and 1 2 liu et al 2018b therefore this study uses the proportion of the temperature increment to the total temperature increment to identify a universal value the proportion is defined as 26 r t t i t int t m t int where r t is the proportion of the temperature increment to the total temperature increment named as the real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri t i is the average temperature at different times t int and t m are the initial and maximum average temperatures respectively similarly the velocity dependent risk index vri can be defined as 27 r v v i v int v m v int where v i is the average velocity at different times m s and v int and v m are the initial and maximum average velocity respectively m s fig 14c d shows the tri and vri for cases 1 and 2 to forecast the occurrence of water inrush an indicator value of tri should be determined from the above analysis the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush therefore this tri indicator should be located at the early stage towards a relatively large quantity when the velocity does not increase much or the vri is small in other words the indicator should correspond an obvious change in the temperature at the early stage of water inrush the obvious change in the temperature can be easily monitored thus the tri indicator can identify the occurrence of water inrush in the early stages when the increase in the flow rate is small the determination method and process to obtain the tri indicator is as follows from the results of the tri and vri as shown in fig 14c d the tri in cases 1 and 2 are 0 57 and 0 50 at a vri 0 1 respectively which satisfies that an obvious change in the temperature corresponds a small change in the velocity a more obvious tri indicator can be obtained by setting a lager vri value for example the values of tri in cases 1 and 2 are 0 67 and 0 54 at a vri 0 15 a more conservative indicator can be obtained by setting a smaller vri value however if the indicator is too small it corresponds a fairly small change in the velocity that may be not caused by water inrush and thus it could result in a false forecast the smaller vri value can be determined by the minimum flow rate of water inrush according to nmsa 2018 the amount of flow rate for mine water inrush is divided into four levels and 30 60 m3 h corresponds to the lowest level of water inrush it can be found that the flow rate is about 30 m3 h at a tri 0 4 in case 1 which is the minimum flow rate of water inrush therefore a tri 0 4 can be a reasonable indicator for forecasting water inrush in addition the tri indicator is both 0 4 despite the fact that there is a large difference between the temperature increments in the two cases which indicates that tri 0 4 is a universal indicator fig 14e h shows the velocity and temperature along line 3 as can be seen the velocity results in some points change significantly e g at 85 m in case 1 and 110 m and 115 m in case 2 this is mainly because the permeability at these points changes a lot furthermore the boundary conditions in the common boundaries of the brinkman equation and the navier stokes equation i e b 7 could cause numerical instabilities hou et al 2018 also show some numerical instabilities in velocity see fig 11 in this literature in the two cases in this study the temporal and spatial variation of temperature during the water inrush process at the bottom of the coal seam and the working face is as follows 1 initially the temperature can be divided into two spatial zones i e the original temperature zone ot and the mining induced low temperature mlt zone these zones remain unchanged when the groundwater seepage environment does not change the ot is determined by the geothermal gradient when the coal seam is being mined it is necessary to provide ventilation to guarantee enough oxygen and a lower temperature for workers which causes the mlt if the coal seam is in a shallow location where the temperature in the ot area is suitable for workers only ventilation is required without cooling and there will be only ot in this study we do not study the heat transfer between the air and solids or fluids in the working face but still use an initial direct temperature of the fluid to simulate the mlt shown in table 1 and 2 during the water inrush process the temperature changes in three spatial zones i e the ot the mlt and the water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit between the ot and the mlt the range of the mlt decreases gradually with increasing velocity the range of the wit can be used to judge the location of the water inrush the field data to calculate tri and the three zones can be measured directly easily and accurately aminossadati et al 2010 in the bottom of the coal seam and the working face this method uses tri wit and a judging criterion to judge if when and where water inrush will occur in diverse field sites thereby addressing the limitations of the traditional method for a practical case to be evaluated ti and tint can be measured directly the value of tm should be given in advance however its field data cannot be measured in the early stage of water inrush it is even difficult to be measured in the late stage due to the rapid and overwhelming flow during water inrush thus tm is calculated through numerical simulations on the other hand we can infer that the temperature will reach a steady state in the late stage of water inrush and it will be slightly less than that in the aquifers in this stage tm can also be approximately expressed as the temperature in the aquifers which avoids setting up a numerical model to calculate tm after tm is determined the risk index tri can be obtained when it reaches the value of the indicator 0 4 decision makers can forecast that water inrush will occur 5 discussions 5 1 discussion on model validation and uncertainty in the flow rate field observations and experience have shown that many water inrush seepage zones can occur in the bottom cross section of working faces tunnels any part of the bottom cross section near collapse columns could become a water inrush zone when water inrush occurs it is nearly impossible to accurately measure the total area of these zones in addition to this challenge the flow rates vary in these seepage zones and the field data here is usually estimated by the volume of the submerged roadway therefore the uncertainty of field measurements of the water inrush zones and flow rates cause some difficulties for simulations the simulated water inrush zones may have some errors compared with the real situation moreover the mechanical and material properties of the actual cross section are not uniform while they are generally considered to be uniform in numerical models which leads to errors when simulating water inrush zones these errors are inevitable which becomes a limitation for using flow rate to validate numerical models in addition the model in this study can simulate the following seepage characteristics that the temperature change depends on 1 the zones near the collapse columns are water inrush zones 2 flow rates vary in these seepage zones and generally increase with decreasing distance between the seepage zones and the collapse columns as shown in fig 10a b and 3 the field data of flow rate although there are some uncertainties in the flow rate the above simulated seepage characteristics that govern the temperature changes are reliable therefore these errors have a smaller impact on the results of temperature 5 2 discussion on the universality of tri the characteristics of water inrush from collapse columns vary greatly in different cases due to the various hydrogeological conditions the diversity is mainly in two aspects i e the flow rates and the types of collapse columns to obtain a universal indicator the two cases in this study consider this diversity the time taken for the flow rate to pass from the early to the late stage generally ranges from tens of hours to tens of days in different cases e g 18 days in case 1 and 16 h in case 2 two typical types of collapse columns a hidden collapse column and an exposed collapse column are present in case 1 and case 2 respectively in addition the value of 0 4 for the tri indicator is chosen to provide a universal and conservative indicator for forecasting water inrush the diversity of the two cases and the method of determining the indicator values allow the indicator to a versatile and universal standard however the simulation results of temperature depend highly on the hydrogeological model using temperature to forecast water inrush is mainly based on qualitative analysis in the field due to the lack of quantified temperature field data during the process of water inrush thus the simulation results of the temperature are not validated by actual field data to further validate the model results the tri should be validated by additional field data using more cases in future studies in addition the dynamic change in temperature depends on the dynamic change in velocity and therefore the relationship between the dynamic change in temperature and velocity in different cases is similar that is the flowing parameters and change rules of temperature can be determined when the velocity is determined 1 the temperature change is greater than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush in other words the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush and 2 the vri is generally less than 0 1 when the tri is 0 4 the above two points are similar in different cases point 1 has been validated and widely used on site it is considered as a qualitative index for forecasting water inrush and has been written into the detailed regulations for coal mine water prevention and control nmsa 2018 although point 2 is not yet validated by field data it can be validated by comparing the simulation results from the numerical model presented by gui and xu 2017 figs 12 and 13 in gui and xu 2017 show changes in the velocity and temperature with the permeability at three points in a collapse column the relationship between velocity and temperature can be obtained as shown in fig 15 we can see that the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush fig 16 shows the tri and vri of points a b and c we can see that the vri is less than 0 15 at a tri 0 4 in each of these points in addition using a numerical model to find a temperature dependent risk index is the objective of this study using field temperature data to find the index is difficult because of the lack of quantified field data of the dynamic change in temperature during the process of water inrush there has not been sufficient attention paid to the dynamic changes in temperature in previous studies this model and the tri have the potential to motivate relevant researchers and mine engineers to study dynamic changes in temperature to predict water inrush 5 3 discussion on the sensitivity and validity of the index the temperature geothermal gradient and velocity are different in different cases nevertheless this work emphasizes the introduction of the concept of the risk index that is capable of generalizing the level of risk in the form of a numeric value to aid safety engineers and decision makers it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity and validity of this index to different geothermal conditions and velocities in addition the sensitivity and validity of this index to the dynamic viscosity and biot s coefficient should be studied we have conducted such analyses as follows 1 the sensitivity and validity of the index to different geothermal conditions the velocity is kept unchanged ϕ 00 0 2 and the various boundary conditions of temperature and geothermal gradients are set to case 1 to study the sensitivity and validity of the index to different geothermal conditions geothermal gradients gtg are generally in the range of 0 01 0 03 m the boundary conditions of the temperature for b 3 are set as 25 35 the initial conditions for the domain of the working faces icw are set as 20 30 the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different geothermal conditions are shown in fig 17 the tri does not change when the difference between the temperature in b 1 and the working face remains unchanged the increase in the speed of the tri rise increases with increasing gtg the vri is less than 0 15 when the tri is 0 4 in each of these groups although a tri 0 4 corresponds to a very small vri at gtg 0 01 it can still indicate the occurrence of water inrush because the flow rate is 54 m3 s within 30 60 m3 s note that a tri 0 4 could cause a false forecast of water inrush in the following extreme conditions because it corresponds to a very small vri 1 the geothermal gradient is very small and 2 the difference in temperature between the working face and its surrounding zone is very large in general the above extreme conditions can only be seen in deep mines the temperature could be very high in deep aquifers e g more than 45 and the temperature around the working face is also very high at lower geothermal gradients to provide a suitable temperature for workers and machines the temperature of the working face should be controlled to be less than 30 by ventilation thus the difference between the temperature in the working face and its surrounding zone will be very large under this extreme condition the temperature increases very fast with a small increase in velocity and thus may cause a false forecast of water inrush to avoid this false forecast it is better to set the indicator at a value greater than 0 4 under these extreme conditions 2 the sensitivity and validity of the index to different velocities the boundary conditions of temperature and geothermal gradients are kept unchanged and various velocities are set to case 1 to study the sensitivity and validity of the index to different velocities the initial porosity under the no stress condition in the collapse columns ϕ 00 is set as 0 15 0 25 to get the various velocities the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different velocities are shown in fig 18 as can be seen the increase in the speed of the tri rise increases with the increase in the velocity the vri is less than 0 15 when the tri is 0 4 in each of these groups we can also see that the maximum temperature is close to the temperature in confined aquifers under each geothermal condition and velocity gui and xu 2017 also obtained similar results in a practical scenario the temperature in aquifers can be measured therefore the maximum temperature value can be approximately set as the temperature of aquifers 3 the sensitivity and validity of the index to dynamic viscosity the above results are based on the assumption that the dynamic viscosity is constant and independent of temperature however the dynamic viscosity could decrease with an increasing temperature the changes of dynamic viscosity with temperature will impact the results especially in some cases where high temperature occurs e g xiaoyun coal mine thus the sensitivity and validity of the risk index to dynamic viscosity should be studied the temperature varies from 30 to 40 the dynamic viscosity varies from 0 80 10 3 to 0 66 10 3 pa s in this temperature range the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different dynamic viscosities are shown in fig 19 as can be seen the velocity and temperature decrease with increasing dynamic viscosity although the dynamic viscosity impacts the velocity and temperature the tri and vri have little change with dynamic viscosity 4 the sensitivity and validity of the index to biot s coefficient the above results are based on the assumption that the biot s coefficient is equal to porosity however according to some research ramos da silva et al 2010 the biot s coefficient is not equal to porosity therefore the sensitivity and validity of the index related to the biot s coefficient should be studied the biot s coefficient is set to be 0 5 and 1 respectively changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different biot s coefficient are shown in fig 20 as can be seen the temperature velocity have a little increase and the risk index has little change with increasing biot s coefficient this is because the order of magnitudes of product of αb and p 105 106 is much smaller than that of total stress σt 107 108 and thus has little impact on the effective stress 5 4 discussion on the average values of temperature and velocity used in the tri and vri for a practical case to be evaluated the water inrush should not have occurred and thus any location of the mining induced damage zone could become a water inrush zone there is generally more than one water inrush location all the bottom areas of the working face should be monitored if there is a possibility of water inrush in specific locations one or some locations with higher temperatures can be monitored by data transformation services that are used to monitor the temperature then the tri and vri can be calculated by either of the following two methods 1 using the average temperatures velocities along the monitoring line and 2 using the temperatures velocities in the locations of water inrush the indicator i e tri 0 4 is valid for both of the above two methods for example point a in case 2 see fig 4b with a higher temperature is selected the tri and vri for this point were calculated by method 2 fig 21 shows the temperatures velocity tri and vri in point a and line 1 we can see that the indicator i e tri 0 4 is valid for both point a and line 1 note that the tri calculated by method 2 reaches 0 4 before that calculated by method 1 if water inrush can occur in a specific location i e there are some specific locations with higher temperatures that can be monitored in line 1 method 2 is suggested for using the calculated tri because it can predict water inrush earlier than method 1 however water inrush can occur in a large area instead of specific locations in some cases in this situation method 1 is suggested for using the calculated tri 6 conclusions a novel coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model considering erosion and damage is developed and a new method for using temperature to predict mine water inrush disasters from collapse columns is proposed in this study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the water pressure differs between exposed and hidden collapse columns there is a pressure accumulation phenomenon in hidden collapse columns 2 temperature changes are greater than groundwater velocity changes in the early stage of water inrush which indicates that water inrush can be identified and predicted earlier by making use of the changes in temperature 3 the temperature distribution can be divided into three spatial zones in the water inrush process and the range of the wit can be used to judge the location of the disaster and 4 the tri and the judging criterion are not limited to the differences in the geothermal environment of different cases this method provides a new research approach to make earlier predictions of whether and where water inrush will occur overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that are case specific and cannot predict the time and location of water inrush using temperature this method has the potential to be widely applied in practice to better understand the risks associated with coal mine management and water inrush thereby increasing mine safety credit authorship contribution statement jiyuan zhao writing original draft methodology

3620,advance forecast of water inrush can help ensure operational safety in underground engineering in this study a coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model is developed to simulate the process of water inrush from collapse columns in coal mines with complex geological environments specifically nonlinear fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media associated with the erosion and damage of collapse columns are considered this numerical model is validated against water inrush field data from two coal mines with regard to flow rate fluid pressure and temperature profiles over time are also investigated there is a water pressure accumulation phenomenon in hidden collapse columns temperature is found to change more significantly than velocity in the early stages of water inrush in addition the spatial variation of temperature can be divided into three zones during the process of water inrush according to the rules governing the spatio temporal variation of temperature a novel method utilizing a real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri and a water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit is proposed to determine whether and where water inrushes will occur this study demonstrates how this novel method can predict water inrush and overcome the main limitations in previous studies where temperature was used as a predictor this method has the potential to be applied in practice to better understand the risks related to coal mine management and water inrush and thus improves mine safety keywords water inrush hydraulics temperature collapse column risk index 1 introduction water inrush is a common geological disaster resulting in both considerable economic losses and even loss of life liu et al 2020 li et al 2020 cui et al 2020 therefore many hydrogeologists and researchers consider the mitigation of mine water hazards as key objectives yin et al 2018 ding et al 2019 water inrush typically occurs through porous and fractured strata that can include collapse columns or karst regions hou et al 2018 mao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 see fig 1 faults xue et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and mining induced fractures ma et al 2019 liu et al 2018a the causes of water inrush are generally interactions between different variables in complex geological environments including ground temperature water pressure wang et al 2020 and ground stress cheng et al 2013 and thus resulting in mechanical and thermal induced rock damage qiu et al 2019 huang et al 2019 and water rock interaction induced erosion ma et al 2019 murray et al 2019 these impacts increase the permeability of porous and fractured strata leading to an increase in water velocities from confined aquifers to working faces that can result in a water inrush disaster multi environmental factor induced water inrush has motivated researchers to consider coupling models of temperature fluid flow and mechanical deformation to develop thermal hydraulic mechanical thm models for predicting water inrush cheng et al 2013 nie et al 2020 groundwater from a higher or lower temperature zone can heat or cool the temperature of the zone it flows through respectively change in temperature of groundwater is generally used to estimate groundwater discharge and has been applied in many fields for purposes e g measuring groundwater discharge to a stream becker et al 2004 briggs et al 2018 identifying the depth of the halocline in a coastal fracture gamble et al 2003 locating zones of groundwater discharge to surface water hare et al 2015 and predicting water inrush bai et al 2015 when a water inrush occurs groundwater flows from a deep or shallow aquifer through fractured rocks to the working face and either increases or decreases the temperature of the zone that it flows through monitoring this temperature change can be used to predict mine water inrush bai et al 2015 bai et al 2015 measured the temperature change in a coal seam and used 1 5 c and 2 4 c as thresholds to divide warning levels into dangerous and extremely dangerous fault water inrush categories wang et al 2017 found that a temperature change ranging from 2 8 helped to predict water inrush from a collapse column liu et al 2018b found that a temperature change from 1 2 helped to predict water inrush from a fault the values of temperature change used to predict water inrush are different in different studies to the best of our knowledge no study has investigated the rules governing the spatio temporal variation of temperature to predict water inrush some existing models have incorporated thermal analysis to analyze water inrush gui and xu 2017 wang et al 2017 however there are a few limitations in these models 1 the examined temperature change was limited to a specific case study or a geothermal environment 2 steady state heat transfer was often used but the dynamic changes in temperature during the entire process of water inrush was not studied and 3 temperature variations at different locations in coal mines e g confined aquifer collapse column mining induced damage zone and working face have not been explored as a result temperature has not been used widely to predict water inrush due to these three limitations the use of specific criteria that can be applied in more cases will help mine managers and researchers to judge when and where a water inrush will occur the governing equations for groundwater flow in a confined aquifer fractured strata and a working face have been studied widely many researchers have used linear equations i e darcy s law to describe flow in a confined aquifer and fractured strata and have obtained meaningful results that have helped predict water inrush yang et al 2003 yuan and harrison 2004 recently many studies have incorporated nonlinear flow phenomena with a high reynolds number in fractured strata by applying non darcy flow such as the forchheimer murray et al 2016 shi et al 2018 or brinkman equation liu et al 2018c xue et al 2019 these studies have shown that the water flowing through fractured porous media experiences darcy flow in a confined aquifer gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2019 non darcy flow in the fractured zone of a collapse column or fault and navier stokes flow shi et al 2018 in working faces i e in the mine voids after exploitation of the coal seams non darcy flow in the fractured zone of a fault can be governed by the brinkman or forchheimer equation combining ground temperature with nonlinear flow equations more accurate temperature changes can be obtained however to the best of our knowledge there is no existing water inrush model that combines the heat transfer equation with nonlinear flow equations in porous media to address the limitations discussed above the objective of this study is to develop a coupled thm model of water inrush the coupled thm model is numerically simulated by the comsol multiphysics and the results are compared with field data and existing research to validate the model according to our findings a new method for using temperature to predict water inrush is proposed in this method the real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri is defined to replace the value of temperature and a tri threshold is adopted as the criterion for predicting water inrush to address the first limitation of requiring values applicable to different case studies then the tri change over time is studied to overcome the second limitation of dynamic change the spatial temperature variations along the bottom of a coal seam and working face are different and can be divided into three zones the original temperature zone ot mining induced low temperature mlt and water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit the wit is used to determine the location of a water inrush to address the above mentioned third limitation 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 model assumptions prior to the mathematical formulation the assumptions of this framework are as follows the aquifer collapse column coal seam and the other strata are firstly assumed to be porous media in addition the heat transfer in porous media satisfies the assumption of local thermal equilibrium the temperature in an aquifer is assumed to be the same during the process of water inrushes since the reynolds number in porous media is less than 300 kaviany 1991 the flow is assumed to be laminar further the dynamic viscosity μ and mass density ρ of groundwater remain constant and do not vary with temperature i e μ 10 3 pa s and ρ 103 kg m3 the working faces tunnels are assumed to be flooded at the initial time xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 this is because it is not essential and practical to study the process of filling the working faces tunnels with groundwater this process is difficult to be captured and simulated and thus it is also challenging to determine the space occupied by water i e the domain governed by the navier stokes equation in the process however the outlet boundary for the navier stokes equation should be initially prescribed as a consequence if the working face is not assumed to be flooded the outlet boundary is difficult to set therefore the working faces tunnels are usually assumed to be flooded to simplify the model to simulate water inrush xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 in addition even if the boundaries in this process can be determined the results obtained by setting these boundaries as outlet boundaries have small errors compared with those obtained by setting the boundaries of the flooded space i e b 5 and b 6 this is mainly because the variation in the heights of the above outlet boundaries is much less than the total height of the model i e the thickness between the aquifer and the outlet boundaries the pressure drop within such a small change of height is much less than the total pressure drop such a pressure drop then has a small impact on the ground temperature and velocity of groundwater as a result the error caused by the assumption can be safely ignored 2 2 water flow equations darcy s law the brinkman equation and the navier stokes equation are adopted to simulate the water flow in a confined aquifer collapse column and working face respectively darcy s law has been widely used as a framework to describe groundwater flow in a confined aquifer combining darcy s law the continuity equation and the storage term the governing equations for the flow in confined aquifers becomes 1 ρ f s p t ρ f k μ p ρ f g 0 where k is the permeability m2 p is the fluid pressure pa ρ f is the fluid density kg m3 g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 and s is the storage coefficient and can be calculated by mathias et al 2019 2 s ϕ χ f α b ϕ 1 α b k d where ϕ is the porosity χ f is the fluid compressibility k d is the drained bulk modulus α b is biot s coefficient associated with the total stress and effective stress chen et al 2020 3 σ σ t α b p where σ and σ t are the effective stress and total stress respectively and α b is the effective stress coefficient α b is related to the drained bulk modulus k d and the solid bulk modulus k s 4 α b 1 k d k s the drained bulk modulus is always smaller than the solid bulk modulus since a solid block has a greater stiffness than a porous block made of the same material therefore the effective stress coefficient always has a range of 0 1 a soft porous matrix has an effective stress coefficient close to 1 since the drained bulk modulus is much smaller than the solid bulk modulus a stiff matrix is close to its porosity since k d 1 ϕ k s the brinkman equation is adopted to describe nonlinear flow in a collapse column and is described as ergun and orning 1949 nield and bejan 2006 amiri et al 2019 5 ρ f ϕ v t v v ϕ p 1 ϕ μ v v t μ k ρ f β v v ρ f g 6 α v 1 k a 1 ϕ 2 d 2 ϕ 3 7 β b 1 ϕ d ϕ 3 where v is the darcy velocity m s α v is the viscous resistance coefficient 1 m2 β is the inertial resistance coefficient 1 m and d is particle size m the constants a and b are 150 and 1 75 respectively in the original ergun correlation ergun and orning 1949 many researchers have found that these values are different for each packed bed and should be empirically determined for each case montillet et al 2007 lacroix et al 2007 du plessis et al 2013 du plessis and woudberg 2008 amiri et al 2019 summarized some values of a and b from some literatures and obtained a ranging 170 200 and b ranging 1 35 2 00 with a porosity ranging 0 2 0 8 according to du plessis and woudberg 2008 the maximum values of a and b are adopted in our study i e a and b are set at 200 and 2 respectively the brinkman equation can also be used to simulate flow in intact strata by neglecting the forchheimer term βρv 2 stokes flow with the darcy term μv k in the brinkman equation can be used to govern the pressure gradient in viscous penetration dominated flow the brinkman equation without the forchheimer term βρv 2 is used to simulate the flow in intact strata the navier stokes equation has been adopted to describe nonlinear flow in working faces and is expressed as 8 ρ f v t ρ v v p μ v v t ρ f g moreover the above equations can then be combined with the continuity equation 9 t ϕ ρ f ρ f v 0 2 3 heat transfer equations the heat transfer equations for porous media fluids and solids are adopted to model the temperature change in a confined aquifer collapse column working face a coal seam and overlying strata heat transfer in porous media satisfies the assumption of local thermal equilibrium that is the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases is much smaller than the one at the pore level as a result the method of volume averaging can be applied to thermophysical properties heat transfer in a confined aquifer and collapse column follows the process of heat transfer in porous media whose governing equation is kaviany 1991 bear and bachmat 1990 10 ρ f c f eff t t ρ f c f v t q 0 where t is the temperature k and ρ f c f eff is the effective volumetric heat capacity j m3 k defined as 11 ρ f c f eff 1 ϕ ρ s c s ϕ ρ f c f where ρ s is the density of the porous matrix kg m3 and c s and c f are the heat capacity of a porous matrix and a fluid j kg k respectively q is the conductive heat flux j s m2 written as 12 q k eff t where k eff is the effective thermal conductivity w m k defined as 13 k eff 1 ϕ k s ϕ k f where k s and k f are the thermal conductivity of a porous matrix and a fluid respectively w m k the governing equation for heat transfer in fluids i e working faces can be obtained by setting ϕ 1 while the one in solids i e overlying strata and coal seams can be obtained by setting ϕ 0 2 4 erosion equation the erosion equation in a collapse column is established based on the erosion constitutive equation papamichos and vardoulakis 2005 this equation is expressed as 14 d ϕ 0 t j ρ s r where j is the rate of eroded mass stems from a solid skeleton kg m3 s and r is the porosity change rate over time r is complex and affected by many factors such as chemical corrosion and seepage induced erosion according to some water rock interaction experiments r has a large range e g 3 30

rock interaction in a collapse column includes chemical corrosion and seepage induced erosion the water pressure used in seepage induced erosion experiments is generally larger than that of the actual rock generally a water pressure in the order of mpa is applied on specimens with a height of 0 1 1 m for example hu et al 2019 applied a water pressure of 1 5 5 5 mpa on a specimen with a height of 1 m however since the height of collapse columns in coal mines is generally hundreds of meters and the water pressure of aquifers is generally not more than 10 mpa a reasonable value of r should be in the middle of the values obtained in the above experiments in this study the range of r is assumed to be constant and set as 1 10 8 1 10 5 1 s 2 5 damage equations the mechanical equilibrium equation is expressed as 15 σ f where σ is the effective stress pa and f is the volume force n m3 the strain displacement relation equation is described as 16 ε 1 2 u t u and the stress strain relation equation generalized hooke law is written as 17 ε x 1 e σ x μ σ y σ z ε y 1 e σ y μ σ z σ x ε z 1 e σ z μ σ x σ y γ xy 1 g τ xy γ yz 1 g τ yz γ zx 1 g τ zx in this study the damage equation as proposed by zhu et al 2009 is adopted as follows 18 f 1 σ 3 f t 0 19 f 2 σ 1 σ 3 1 sin θ 1 sin θ f c 0 where σ 3 is the minimum principal stress pa σ 1 is the maximum principal stress pa θ is the internal friction angle in radians f t 0 is the uniaxial tensile strength pa and f c 0 is the uniaxial compressive strength pa tensile damage occurs when f 1 0 and compression damage occurs when f 2 0 then a damage parameter can be defined as 20 d 0 f 1 0 f 2 0 1 ε t 0 ε 3 n f 1 0 1 ε c 0 ε 1 n f 2 0 where ε t 0 is the maximum tensile principal strain when tensile damage occurs ε c 0 is the maximum compression principal strain when compression damage occurs ε 3 is the minimum principal strain ε 1 is the maximum principal strain and n is the damage coefficient damage with a value of 2 zhu et al 2009 the damage equation is implemented to simulate the mechanical impact of underground stresses on the permeability of strata 2 6 porosity and permeability the porosity in a confined aquifer collapse column and intact strata is governed by the following equation rutqvist and tsang 2002 zhu et al 2009 21 ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ r exp α ϕ σ v ϕ r where ϕ 0 is the porosity when the stress is zero ϕ r is the limit value of porosity under high compressive stress α ϕ is the stress sensitivity index of porosity set as 5 10 8 pa 1 rutqvist and tsang 2002 and σ v is the mean effective stress 22 σ v σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 3 considering the damage parameter the permeability in the collapse column and mining induced damage zone is zhu et al 2009 23 k d 2 ϕ 3 a 1 ϕ 2 exp α k d and the permeability in the confined aquifer and intact strata is expressed as 24 k k c ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 exp α k d where α k is the sensitivity coefficient of the influence of damage on permeability and k c is a permeability coefficient independent of the porosity of the rock 2 7 the water inrush coefficient wic the water inrush coefficient wic is an important value and can be used to predict the occurrence of water inrush it was proposed based on the statistical analysis of long term water inrush data and was defined in the detailed regulations for coal mine water prevention and control nmsa 2018 as an empirical formula li et al 2018 25 k p m where k is the wic mpa m p is the water pressure applied to the bottom of the aquifuge mpa and m is the thickness of the water resisting strata intact strata m the critical water inrush coefficient is 0 1 mpa m i e water inrush will occur when the coefficient is above 0 1 mpa m and will not occur when it is less than or equal to 0 1 mpa m in summary the coupled processes of the complex geological environment in this model are shown in fig 2 3 model setup and validation in this study two cases of water inrush an exposed collapse column in the bailong coal mine and a hidden collapse column in the xiaoyun coal mine are used to validate the model water flow rate the only directly measured field data available can be used to validate water inrush models yao et al 2018 no other research other than that by yao et al 2018 has used flow rate to validate a water inrush model because the flow rate depends on the complex interaction of many factors and it is challenging to simulate the change in flow rate over time without considering these interactions therefore the simulation of this model is validated against actual flow rate field data in general the measurement and calculation of flow rate have an approximately 20 error rate xue 2010 when water inrush occurs the flow rate increases exponentially which implies that mine staff need to leave the working face to a safer environment due to the rapid and overwhelming flow during water inrush the flow rate is usually estimated by the volume of the submerged roadway which causes an even greater error in the measured flow rate in this study we use the smaller estimated error of 20 to ensure the validity of the field data in addition when water inrush occurs equipment is submerged and the flow rate cannot be measured in real time which causes a temporal error although there is no relevant study on this temporal error field results show that it is not small in this study the temporal error is assumed to be 10 of the time interval 3 1 background of the hydrogeological characteristics and numerical model setup the above mentioned mines are both located in the northern region of china due to the presence of collapse columns water inrush has occurred in both mines the field data of the flow rates during the water inrush process in the two cases is shown in fig 3 in case 1 the water inrush occurred in the 2 1101 working face of the bailong coal mine in china on march 13 2007 the no 572 collapse column was exposed in the bailong coal mine on march 18 the water inflow was 50 60 m3 h with tests indicating that the water was from limestone the flow rate increased from 140 m3 h on march 25 to 800 m3 h on april 2 and increased to 1200 m3 h on april 5 in case 2 the water inrush occurred in working face 1313 of the xiaoyun coal mine the flow rate increased from 40 50 m3 h at 00 10 on september 11 to 400 m3 h at 03 10 on september 11 and about 3600 m3 h at 22 00 on september 11 the model geometries are set up considering the history of the coal mine see fig 4 in case 1 the maximum and the minimum ground elevations are 837 m and 540 m respectively with an average ground elevation of 690 m the height of the coal seam collapse column and confined aquifer is 4 5 m 110 m and 30 m respectively the elevation of the coal seam is 370 m and the length of the bottom of the working face is 13 m then we can obtain the average thickness of the overlying strata as about 320 m which is set as 50 m in this geometrical model and the remaining thickness of 320 m is set as a top boundary load of about 6 7 mpa the water pressure in the confined aquifer is 3 2 mpa in case 2 the height of the coal seam collapse column and confined aquifer is 3 8 m 158 m and 30 m respectively the elevation of the coal seam is 632 5 m and the length of the bottom of the working face is 90 m the average height of the overlying strata is about 632 5 m which is set as 100 m in this model with the remaining height set as a top boundary load of about 13 3 mpa the height of the strata between the collapse column and the working face scw is 42 m there is a saddle shaped damage zone in the scw caused by the mining of the coal seam guo et al 2016 this damage zone would not exist in the scw if the scw was not affected by mining and thus the scw would have originally been composed of intact and water resisting strata the flow rate field data is usually estimated from the volume of the submerged roadway the product of the area of these seepage zones cross section and the average velocity is equal to the total flow rate which in turn facilitates the calculation of the flow rate in the model since a two dimensional model is used in this study the cross section is assumed to vary in only one direction with a fixed width this is because the magnitude of the velocity mainly depends on the length of the cross section along this direction the length reflects the distance between the working face tunnel and the collapse column the closer the working face is to the collapse column the greater is the velocity in the section and the higher is the possibility of the occurrence of water inrush is the fixed width represents the width of the overlapping part of the working faces tunnels and the collapse columns the contribution of the width to the magnitude of the velocity is less than that of the length the widths for case 1 and case 2 are 37 m and 3 m respectively according to the actual situation in the field the water inrush area is the product of the fixed width and the length of the bottom of the working face 3 2 model parameters and initial and boundary conditions there are many rock strata with various properties such as coarse sandstone fine sandstone siltstone mudstone and limestone between the confined aquifers and the working faces the thickness of these strata is usually in the hundreds of meters the properties of the different rock strata and even of the same stratum vary given the difficulty of directly measuring the parameter values for all the strata values from the literature is adopt as listed in table 1 the values of these parameters are determined as follows the parameters in the thermal model include the thermal conductivities of the fluid and solid matrix as well as the heat capacities of the fluid and solid matrix the stratified geology is simplified by means of a homogeneous material characterized by average values of properties note that the same thermal conductivity is assigned to all the rocks however the effective thermal conductivities are not the same they are governed by eq 13 and thus depend on the porosity and thermal conductivities of the rocks and fluids coal is the solid matrix comprising the porous media of coal seams and its thermal conductivity is determined to be 0 6 w m k the parameters in the solid mechanical model cover the uniaxial compressive strength uniaxial tensile strength elastic modulus internal friction angle in radians poisson s ratio and density collapse columns are generally formed by clay and the fragmentation of rock the clay and pores among the rock fragments make the elastic modulus of collapse columns relatively small for example lin et al 2021 obtained that the elastic modulus of a collapse column is 0 15 0 3 gpa the modulus of elasticity of coal is generally smaller than that of rock and has a wide range for example the elastic modulus of some soft coals can be as low as 0 061 gpa tang et al 2021 while some hard rocks can be as high as 4 gpa han et al 2020 the parameters in the hydraulic model include the dynamic viscosity fluid density and properties of porous media the dynamic viscosity and density of groundwater are generally 1 10 3 pa s and 1 103 kg m3 respectively in general the porosity and particle size in water inrush models are determined and calibrated by the permeability of fractured strata this is because collapse columns and mining induced damage zones are usually hundreds of meters thick and the porosity and particle size vary at such large scales it is not practical to measure the porosity and particle size of crushed stone in the entire area of a collapse column and the mining induced damage zone in an scw the order of magnitude of the permeability of fractured strata during water inrush is generally in the range of 1 10 13 1 10 9 m2 hou et al 2018 yao et al 2018 many mine disasters including water inrush are more likely to occur in deep mines chen et al 2019 case 2 has a deeper working face and collapse column than case 1 according to the accident reports from cases 1 and 2 the groundwater was from the ordovician limestone confined aquifer in both cases 1 and 2 ordovician limestone confined aquifers in different cases have different properties the water abundance in the aquifers and ground pressure in case 2 are larger than those in case 1 the mining impact on the increase in permeability in case 2 is greater than that in case 1 therefore the porosity porosity change rate particle size and sensitivity coefficient in case 2 are greater than those in case 1 the parameters of the intact strata and the coal seam are the same in these two cases the limestone aquifers have a stiff matrix and therefore α b is set as the porosity of the confined aquifer it is noted that the biot s coefficient is often assumed to be proportional to porosity ramos da silva et al 2010 the sensitivity of the results to the biot s coefficient should be analyzed and will be discussed in the following the model is numerically solved using the comsol multiphysics software the comsol module settings are shown in table 2 the initial and boundary conditions and model boundaries and domains for case 1 and 2 are shown in fig 4 and table 3 the model boundaries and domains are numbered by b and d see fig 4 for the mechanical model the bottom and top boundaries of the geologic model are set as a fixed constraint and a boundary load respectively a slipping constraint is applied to the boundaries on both sides the boundary load represents the load imposed by overlying strata above the top boundaries of the geological model for the hydraulic model the bottom boundaries of the geologic model are set as a pressure to represent the groundwater pressure applied by the confined aquifer the top and right boundaries of the working face are also set as a pressure to obtain a continuous solution at the common boundaries of the confined aquifer collapse column scw and working faces the pressure and velocity at the common boundaries are set to be equal the hydrostatic pressure ph in intact strata collapse column and working face are expressed by the initial conditions for the thermal model the bottom boundaries are set with a constant temperature and the top right and left boundaries are set with no heat flux the initial temperature in the working faces is set with constant values and the initial temperature in the other zones is dependent on the geothermal gradients the process of the thm numerical simulation is as follows 1 the pressure of strata water pressure of confined aquifer temperature of confined aquifer and geothermal gradient are inputs to the model 2 then the governing equations are solved by comsol 3 lastly the velocity and temperature are output which are used to study the relationship between velocity and temperature during the process of water inrush and predict a water inrush 3 3 model mesh independence analysis the computational geometry and mesh are created in the comsol multiphysics software and all the partial differential equations acting also as the governing equations are solved numerically by the finite element method the number of mesh elements and the simulated water flow rates in the different types of mesh are listed in table 4 moreover the water flow rates over time are shown in fig 3 for the different types of mesh since the maximum flow rate represents the intensity of water inrush it is set as a reference variable to evaluate the optimal mesh i e the flow rate after 18 days in the bailong coal mine and 16 h in the xiaoyun coal mine the mesh is made gradually finer from the mesh type ⅰ to iv until the relative deviation in the flow rate of the two cases became 0 6 and 0 8 respectively which indicates that the mesh types iii and iv are optimal in this study a fine unstructured mesh near any no slip boundary and an increasingly coarser mesh in the middle zone are set to resolve the boundary layer and reduce the computational cost as a result mesh type iv is selected as the optimal mesh and is used in the rest of the study 3 4 model validation the field versus model flow rate data over time in different types of mesh for case 1 is shown in fig 3a the simulated data in mesh types iii and iv are in good agreement with the field data in the initial stages i e the first field data and the late stages the last two field data there is a deviation between the simulated data and the field data in the middle stage i e the second field data which can be ascribed to a greater temporal time error the interval is seven days and there is no other data between the first and second field data which can have created a larger temporal error although there is a discrepancy in the middle stage it can be acceptable for water inrush prediction this is because more attention is usually paid to the flow rate in the initial and late stages the flow rate in the initial stage is used to judge whether there will be water inrush the flow rate in the late stage is used to judge how serious the water inrush disaster will be and how much property loss it will cause which is the reason why previous studies focused on the prediction of flow rate in the late stage the field versus model flow rate data over time in different types of mesh for case 2 is shown in fig 3b the simulated data in mesh types ⅱ iii and iv are in good agreement with most of the field data in addition the occurrence of water inrush from a hidden collapse column depends on whether there is a mining induced damage zone between the working face and the hidden collapse column if the middle zone is not affected by the excavation of coal seams no mining induced damage zone forms and water inrush will not occur according to the field data the flow rate with no water inrush is about 20 35 m3 h in this study the simulated flow rate under the condition of no mining induced damage zone is compared with the actual field data to validate the model see fig 3c the mesh statistics and simulated flow rate after 16 h in different types of mesh are shown in table 4 the relative deviation in the flow rate between mesh types iii and iv is 0 3 we can see that the simulated data in mesh type iv agrees well with the field data 4 results three data sets in lines 1 2 and 3 are selected in every case study see fig 4 line 1 is used to study the variation in velocity pressure and temperature along the bottom of the working face line 2 corresponds to the water flow path from the aquifer through the collapse column to the working face and thus line 2 is used to study the variation in pressure and temperature along the water flow path line 3 corresponds to the bottom of the working face and coal seam and represents the locations where data could be readily measured in the field and thus line 3 is used to study the temperature change along the working face and its neighboring zones 4 1 mining induced damage zone porosity and permeability while the mining induced damage zone is shown in fig 5 the porosity and permeability in the collapse column are depicted in figs 6 and 7 respectively three time frames are also plotted to demonstrate the transient behaviors of porosity and permeability in each mine as can be seen the porosity and permeability are not uniform under the impact of stress and mining induced damage the porosity and permeability in the collapse column have a significant increase over time the average porosity increases from 0 172 to 0 373 and from 0 145 to 0 393 in cases 1 and 2 respectively during the process of water inrush meanwhile the maximum and minimum porosities increase from 0 294 and 0 020 to 0 640 and 0 039 in case 1 and from 0 151 and 0 118 to 0 411 and 0 320 in case 2 respectively on the other hand the average permeability greatly increases from 1 05 10 12 m2 to 1 89 10 11 m2 and 8 64 10 12 m2 to 8 74 10 10 m2 in cases 1 and 2 respectively during the process of water inrush the maximum and minimum permeability significantly rise from 4 23 10 11 m2 and 5 33 10 15 m2 to 1 67 10 9 m2 and 4 79 10 14 m2 in case 1 and from 7 19 10 10 m2 and 3 81 10 12 m2 to 3 01 10 8 m2 and 2 09 10 10 m2 in case 2 respectively the porosity and permeability in the remaining zones vary spatially see fig 8 due to the spatial changes in the mechanical variables i e stress and mining damage the stress remains almost unchanged with time because the change with time in α b p is far smaller than σ t see eq 3 which makes the porosity and permeability in the remaining zones remain almost unchanged with time table 5 shows the average and extreme values of porosity and permeability in these zones the locations of the extreme values are marked in figs 7 and 8 4 2 water pressure fig 9 a b shows the water pressure along line 2 the pressure decreases along the flow path while the rate of the pressure drop increased this is because there are inertial and viscous resistances in the collapse column and their sum is larger than the viscous resistance in the confined aquifer the pressure drop in a confined aquifer is generally called pressure relief which has been identified in many studies xue et al 2018 hou et al 2018 this phenomenon occurs when there is a direct connection between an exposed collapse column and the working face e g in the bailong model the pressure decreases with time in the confined aquifer and collapse column this may differ when there are strata between the collapse column and the working face the scw is damaged by coal mining a mining induced damage will then be formed in the scw in the case of no coal mining the scw is composed by water resisting strata however these previous studies did not investigate the pressure drop associated with hidden collapse columns fig 9b shows the pressure change over time in the hidden collapse column in the xiaoyun coal mine with the increase in time the pressure decreases in the confined aquifer but increases in the collapse column this is because there is an erosion effect in the collapse column causing its permeability to increase with time yao et al 2018 the permeability of an scw is mainly affected by mining damage usually does not change after rock damage and is usually less than that of the collapse column therefore in our model the pressure drop of the scw is reduced and the pressure accumulates and increases with time in the upper part of the collapse column and the lower part of the damaged area this pressure accumulation phenomenon also reveals the reason for the water inrush from the hidden collapse column generally there is no damage to the mining induced damage zone and water inrush does not occur when coal seams are not mined in the xiaoyun coal mine if the impact of mining damage on permeability is not considered and the mining induced damage zone is considered as intact rock water inrush does not occur see fig 10 a the velocity of groundwater in the scw with damage see fig 10b is more than several hundred times that with no damage pressure accumulation is more obvious and the pressure is higher compared with that obtained from the damage model see fig 10c d the change in the average pressure over time at the top boundary of the collapse column with damage and no damage is shown in fig 11 the wic change over time can be calculated using the pressure under the condition of no mining induced damage zone in the scw the scw is water resisting strata when there is no mining induced damage zone then the wic of the scw is calculated by the pressure under the condition of no mining induced damage zone divided by the thickness of the scw as shown in fig 11 the wic is above the critical value after 1 3 h and reaches 0 11 after 16 h in case 2 which indicates that water inrush will occur if the scw is affected by the mining induced damage zone historical events show that water inrush did occur after coal seam excavation 4 3 temperature the effective heat capacities and effective thermal conductivities in the collapse column confined aquifer intact strata and scw are depicted in figs 12 and 13 respectively three time frames are also plotted to demonstrate transient behaviors in each mine as can be seen the heat capacities and thermal conductivities are not uniform and change with the porosity the average maximum and minimum heat capacities increase from 2 51 106 j m3 k 2 76 106 j m3 k and 2 20 106 j m3 k to 2 92 106 j m3 k 3 46 106 j m3 k and 2 24 106 j m3 k in the collapse column of case 1 and from 2 46 106 j m3 k 2 47 106 j m3 k and 2 40 106 j m3 k to 2 96 106 j m3 k 3 00 106 j m3 k and 2 81 106 j m3 k in the collapse column of case 2 respectively during the process of water inrush meanwhile the average maximum and minimum thermal conductivities decrease from 2 17 w m k 2 46 w m k and 1 94 w m k to 1 79 w m k 2 43 w m k and 1 28 w m k in the collapse column of case 1 and from 2 22 w m k 2 28 w m k and 2 21 w m k to 1 75 w m k 1 89 w m k and 1 72 w m k in the collapse column of case 2 respectively during the process of water inrush the average maximum and minimum heat capacities and thermal conductivities in the confined aquifer intact strata and scw are shown in table 5 the heat capacities and thermal conductivities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face do not change with porosity because they are governed by the heat transfer equation of solids or fluids the extreme values of the heat capacities have the same locations as the extreme values of the porosities the maximum values of the thermal conductivities have the same locations as the minimum values of the porosities and the minimum values of the thermal conductivities have the same locations as the maximum values of the porosities the heat capacities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face are 1 68 106 j m3 k 2 25 106 j m3 k and 4 20 106 j m3 k respectively and the thermal conductivities of the coal seam overlying strata and working face are 0 6 w m k 2 5 w m k and 0 6 w m k respectively fig 9c d shows the temperature along line 2 the temperature gradually increases over time in the direction of the water flow this is mainly because the water flowing from the deep aquifer has a higher temperature which causes the temperature in the shallow zones to increase through heat transfer as can be seen in fig 10e f the temperature does not change when the velocity is minimal i e water inrush is absent due to the low heat transfer through convection while the temperature changes when the velocity is very large i e water inrush is present since heat transfer through convection becomes more significant consequently the temperature change can be a good indicator to predict water inrush 4 4 temperature dependent risk index fig 14 a b shows the average temperature and velocity along line 1 the temperature increases faster than the velocity especially in the early stage of water inrush due to mixed conduction convection heat transfer mechanisms indicating that water inrush can be found and predicted earlier by measuring the temperature change however a change in velocity or flow rate is generally used to predict water inrush by coal mine managers and decision makers this delay can cause hesitation in the implementation of safety measures for workers and equipment in the early stages as decision makers remain unsure whether water inrush will occur in view of this a new method for predicting water inrush based on the temperature change is proposed it is not appropriate to use temperature increments to predict water inrush because they are different in different cases the increment is 3 4 in the bailong coal mine but 6 7 in the xiaoyun coal mine the results of temperature changes are also different in previous research such as 1 5 2 4 c bai et al 2015 2 8 wang et al 2017 and 1 2 liu et al 2018b therefore this study uses the proportion of the temperature increment to the total temperature increment to identify a universal value the proportion is defined as 26 r t t i t int t m t int where r t is the proportion of the temperature increment to the total temperature increment named as the real time monitoring temperature dependent risk index tri t i is the average temperature at different times t int and t m are the initial and maximum average temperatures respectively similarly the velocity dependent risk index vri can be defined as 27 r v v i v int v m v int where v i is the average velocity at different times m s and v int and v m are the initial and maximum average velocity respectively m s fig 14c d shows the tri and vri for cases 1 and 2 to forecast the occurrence of water inrush an indicator value of tri should be determined from the above analysis the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush therefore this tri indicator should be located at the early stage towards a relatively large quantity when the velocity does not increase much or the vri is small in other words the indicator should correspond an obvious change in the temperature at the early stage of water inrush the obvious change in the temperature can be easily monitored thus the tri indicator can identify the occurrence of water inrush in the early stages when the increase in the flow rate is small the determination method and process to obtain the tri indicator is as follows from the results of the tri and vri as shown in fig 14c d the tri in cases 1 and 2 are 0 57 and 0 50 at a vri 0 1 respectively which satisfies that an obvious change in the temperature corresponds a small change in the velocity a more obvious tri indicator can be obtained by setting a lager vri value for example the values of tri in cases 1 and 2 are 0 67 and 0 54 at a vri 0 15 a more conservative indicator can be obtained by setting a smaller vri value however if the indicator is too small it corresponds a fairly small change in the velocity that may be not caused by water inrush and thus it could result in a false forecast the smaller vri value can be determined by the minimum flow rate of water inrush according to nmsa 2018 the amount of flow rate for mine water inrush is divided into four levels and 30 60 m3 h corresponds to the lowest level of water inrush it can be found that the flow rate is about 30 m3 h at a tri 0 4 in case 1 which is the minimum flow rate of water inrush therefore a tri 0 4 can be a reasonable indicator for forecasting water inrush in addition the tri indicator is both 0 4 despite the fact that there is a large difference between the temperature increments in the two cases which indicates that tri 0 4 is a universal indicator fig 14e h shows the velocity and temperature along line 3 as can be seen the velocity results in some points change significantly e g at 85 m in case 1 and 110 m and 115 m in case 2 this is mainly because the permeability at these points changes a lot furthermore the boundary conditions in the common boundaries of the brinkman equation and the navier stokes equation i e b 7 could cause numerical instabilities hou et al 2018 also show some numerical instabilities in velocity see fig 11 in this literature in the two cases in this study the temporal and spatial variation of temperature during the water inrush process at the bottom of the coal seam and the working face is as follows 1 initially the temperature can be divided into two spatial zones i e the original temperature zone ot and the mining induced low temperature mlt zone these zones remain unchanged when the groundwater seepage environment does not change the ot is determined by the geothermal gradient when the coal seam is being mined it is necessary to provide ventilation to guarantee enough oxygen and a lower temperature for workers which causes the mlt if the coal seam is in a shallow location where the temperature in the ot area is suitable for workers only ventilation is required without cooling and there will be only ot in this study we do not study the heat transfer between the air and solids or fluids in the working face but still use an initial direct temperature of the fluid to simulate the mlt shown in table 1 and 2 during the water inrush process the temperature changes in three spatial zones i e the ot the mlt and the water inrush induced increasing temperature zone wit between the ot and the mlt the range of the mlt decreases gradually with increasing velocity the range of the wit can be used to judge the location of the water inrush the field data to calculate tri and the three zones can be measured directly easily and accurately aminossadati et al 2010 in the bottom of the coal seam and the working face this method uses tri wit and a judging criterion to judge if when and where water inrush will occur in diverse field sites thereby addressing the limitations of the traditional method for a practical case to be evaluated ti and tint can be measured directly the value of tm should be given in advance however its field data cannot be measured in the early stage of water inrush it is even difficult to be measured in the late stage due to the rapid and overwhelming flow during water inrush thus tm is calculated through numerical simulations on the other hand we can infer that the temperature will reach a steady state in the late stage of water inrush and it will be slightly less than that in the aquifers in this stage tm can also be approximately expressed as the temperature in the aquifers which avoids setting up a numerical model to calculate tm after tm is determined the risk index tri can be obtained when it reaches the value of the indicator 0 4 decision makers can forecast that water inrush will occur 5 discussions 5 1 discussion on model validation and uncertainty in the flow rate field observations and experience have shown that many water inrush seepage zones can occur in the bottom cross section of working faces tunnels any part of the bottom cross section near collapse columns could become a water inrush zone when water inrush occurs it is nearly impossible to accurately measure the total area of these zones in addition to this challenge the flow rates vary in these seepage zones and the field data here is usually estimated by the volume of the submerged roadway therefore the uncertainty of field measurements of the water inrush zones and flow rates cause some difficulties for simulations the simulated water inrush zones may have some errors compared with the real situation moreover the mechanical and material properties of the actual cross section are not uniform while they are generally considered to be uniform in numerical models which leads to errors when simulating water inrush zones these errors are inevitable which becomes a limitation for using flow rate to validate numerical models in addition the model in this study can simulate the following seepage characteristics that the temperature change depends on 1 the zones near the collapse columns are water inrush zones 2 flow rates vary in these seepage zones and generally increase with decreasing distance between the seepage zones and the collapse columns as shown in fig 10a b and 3 the field data of flow rate although there are some uncertainties in the flow rate the above simulated seepage characteristics that govern the temperature changes are reliable therefore these errors have a smaller impact on the results of temperature 5 2 discussion on the universality of tri the characteristics of water inrush from collapse columns vary greatly in different cases due to the various hydrogeological conditions the diversity is mainly in two aspects i e the flow rates and the types of collapse columns to obtain a universal indicator the two cases in this study consider this diversity the time taken for the flow rate to pass from the early to the late stage generally ranges from tens of hours to tens of days in different cases e g 18 days in case 1 and 16 h in case 2 two typical types of collapse columns a hidden collapse column and an exposed collapse column are present in case 1 and case 2 respectively in addition the value of 0 4 for the tri indicator is chosen to provide a universal and conservative indicator for forecasting water inrush the diversity of the two cases and the method of determining the indicator values allow the indicator to a versatile and universal standard however the simulation results of temperature depend highly on the hydrogeological model using temperature to forecast water inrush is mainly based on qualitative analysis in the field due to the lack of quantified temperature field data during the process of water inrush thus the simulation results of the temperature are not validated by actual field data to further validate the model results the tri should be validated by additional field data using more cases in future studies in addition the dynamic change in temperature depends on the dynamic change in velocity and therefore the relationship between the dynamic change in temperature and velocity in different cases is similar that is the flowing parameters and change rules of temperature can be determined when the velocity is determined 1 the temperature change is greater than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush in other words the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush and 2 the vri is generally less than 0 1 when the tri is 0 4 the above two points are similar in different cases point 1 has been validated and widely used on site it is considered as a qualitative index for forecasting water inrush and has been written into the detailed regulations for coal mine water prevention and control nmsa 2018 although point 2 is not yet validated by field data it can be validated by comparing the simulation results from the numerical model presented by gui and xu 2017 figs 12 and 13 in gui and xu 2017 show changes in the velocity and temperature with the permeability at three points in a collapse column the relationship between velocity and temperature can be obtained as shown in fig 15 we can see that the temperature increases faster than the velocity in the early stage of water inrush fig 16 shows the tri and vri of points a b and c we can see that the vri is less than 0 15 at a tri 0 4 in each of these points in addition using a numerical model to find a temperature dependent risk index is the objective of this study using field temperature data to find the index is difficult because of the lack of quantified field data of the dynamic change in temperature during the process of water inrush there has not been sufficient attention paid to the dynamic changes in temperature in previous studies this model and the tri have the potential to motivate relevant researchers and mine engineers to study dynamic changes in temperature to predict water inrush 5 3 discussion on the sensitivity and validity of the index the temperature geothermal gradient and velocity are different in different cases nevertheless this work emphasizes the introduction of the concept of the risk index that is capable of generalizing the level of risk in the form of a numeric value to aid safety engineers and decision makers it is necessary to analyze the sensitivity and validity of this index to different geothermal conditions and velocities in addition the sensitivity and validity of this index to the dynamic viscosity and biot s coefficient should be studied we have conducted such analyses as follows 1 the sensitivity and validity of the index to different geothermal conditions the velocity is kept unchanged ϕ 00 0 2 and the various boundary conditions of temperature and geothermal gradients are set to case 1 to study the sensitivity and validity of the index to different geothermal conditions geothermal gradients gtg are generally in the range of 0 01 0 03 m the boundary conditions of the temperature for b 3 are set as 25 35 the initial conditions for the domain of the working faces icw are set as 20 30 the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different geothermal conditions are shown in fig 17 the tri does not change when the difference between the temperature in b 1 and the working face remains unchanged the increase in the speed of the tri rise increases with increasing gtg the vri is less than 0 15 when the tri is 0 4 in each of these groups although a tri 0 4 corresponds to a very small vri at gtg 0 01 it can still indicate the occurrence of water inrush because the flow rate is 54 m3 s within 30 60 m3 s note that a tri 0 4 could cause a false forecast of water inrush in the following extreme conditions because it corresponds to a very small vri 1 the geothermal gradient is very small and 2 the difference in temperature between the working face and its surrounding zone is very large in general the above extreme conditions can only be seen in deep mines the temperature could be very high in deep aquifers e g more than 45 and the temperature around the working face is also very high at lower geothermal gradients to provide a suitable temperature for workers and machines the temperature of the working face should be controlled to be less than 30 by ventilation thus the difference between the temperature in the working face and its surrounding zone will be very large under this extreme condition the temperature increases very fast with a small increase in velocity and thus may cause a false forecast of water inrush to avoid this false forecast it is better to set the indicator at a value greater than 0 4 under these extreme conditions 2 the sensitivity and validity of the index to different velocities the boundary conditions of temperature and geothermal gradients are kept unchanged and various velocities are set to case 1 to study the sensitivity and validity of the index to different velocities the initial porosity under the no stress condition in the collapse columns ϕ 00 is set as 0 15 0 25 to get the various velocities the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different velocities are shown in fig 18 as can be seen the increase in the speed of the tri rise increases with the increase in the velocity the vri is less than 0 15 when the tri is 0 4 in each of these groups we can also see that the maximum temperature is close to the temperature in confined aquifers under each geothermal condition and velocity gui and xu 2017 also obtained similar results in a practical scenario the temperature in aquifers can be measured therefore the maximum temperature value can be approximately set as the temperature of aquifers 3 the sensitivity and validity of the index to dynamic viscosity the above results are based on the assumption that the dynamic viscosity is constant and independent of temperature however the dynamic viscosity could decrease with an increasing temperature the changes of dynamic viscosity with temperature will impact the results especially in some cases where high temperature occurs e g xiaoyun coal mine thus the sensitivity and validity of the risk index to dynamic viscosity should be studied the temperature varies from 30 to 40 the dynamic viscosity varies from 0 80 10 3 to 0 66 10 3 pa s in this temperature range the dynamic changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different dynamic viscosities are shown in fig 19 as can be seen the velocity and temperature decrease with increasing dynamic viscosity although the dynamic viscosity impacts the velocity and temperature the tri and vri have little change with dynamic viscosity 4 the sensitivity and validity of the index to biot s coefficient the above results are based on the assumption that the biot s coefficient is equal to porosity however according to some research ramos da silva et al 2010 the biot s coefficient is not equal to porosity therefore the sensitivity and validity of the index related to the biot s coefficient should be studied the biot s coefficient is set to be 0 5 and 1 respectively changes in the temperature velocity tri and vri under different biot s coefficient are shown in fig 20 as can be seen the temperature velocity have a little increase and the risk index has little change with increasing biot s coefficient this is because the order of magnitudes of product of αb and p 105 106 is much smaller than that of total stress σt 107 108 and thus has little impact on the effective stress 5 4 discussion on the average values of temperature and velocity used in the tri and vri for a practical case to be evaluated the water inrush should not have occurred and thus any location of the mining induced damage zone could become a water inrush zone there is generally more than one water inrush location all the bottom areas of the working face should be monitored if there is a possibility of water inrush in specific locations one or some locations with higher temperatures can be monitored by data transformation services that are used to monitor the temperature then the tri and vri can be calculated by either of the following two methods 1 using the average temperatures velocities along the monitoring line and 2 using the temperatures velocities in the locations of water inrush the indicator i e tri 0 4 is valid for both of the above two methods for example point a in case 2 see fig 4b with a higher temperature is selected the tri and vri for this point were calculated by method 2 fig 21 shows the temperatures velocity tri and vri in point a and line 1 we can see that the indicator i e tri 0 4 is valid for both point a and line 1 note that the tri calculated by method 2 reaches 0 4 before that calculated by method 1 if water inrush can occur in a specific location i e there are some specific locations with higher temperatures that can be monitored in line 1 method 2 is suggested for using the calculated tri because it can predict water inrush earlier than method 1 however water inrush can occur in a large area instead of specific locations in some cases in this situation method 1 is suggested for using the calculated tri 6 conclusions a novel coupled thermal hydraulic mechanical thm model considering erosion and damage is developed and a new method for using temperature to predict mine water inrush disasters from collapse columns is proposed in this study the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the water pressure differs between exposed and hidden collapse columns there is a pressure accumulation phenomenon in hidden collapse columns 2 temperature changes are greater than groundwater velocity changes in the early stage of water inrush which indicates that water inrush can be identified and predicted earlier by making use of the changes in temperature 3 the temperature distribution can be divided into three spatial zones in the water inrush process and the range of the wit can be used to judge the location of the disaster and 4 the tri and the judging criterion are not limited to the differences in the geothermal environment of different cases this method provides a new research approach to make earlier predictions of whether and where water inrush will occur overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that are case specific and cannot predict the time and location of water inrush using temperature this method has the potential to be widely applied in practice to better understand the risks associated with coal mine management and water inrush thereby increasing mine safety credit authorship contribution statement jiyuan zhao writing original draft methodology

3621,a horseshoe vortex hv system is formed around a bed mounted circular cylinder in overland water flowing past the cylinder however the effect of bed roughness on hv still lacks clear recognition the present study experimentally investigated the characteristics of hv upstream of a bed mounted circular cylinder in a flume where sand of four grain sizes was glued to the flume bed to produce the bed roughness a particle image velocimetry system was mounted on the flume to facilitate a high resolution 63 pixel mm observation of a flow field a total of 28 cases with flow depths varying from 0 39 to 1 09 cm and cylinder reynolds numbers red varying from 2700 to 5800 were selected to evaluate the effects of the bed roughness on hv in overland flow conditions measurements were then conducted on the upstream flow of a cylinder in the symmetry plane bed roughness significantly affected hv in turn destroying the three vortices subsequently time averaged primary hv features on the three beds with lower roughness levels were analyzed in terms of the separation point location radius and swirling strength with an increase in the bed roughness the separation point moved toward the cylinder and the primary hv moved toward a free surface however the effect on the streamwise location was nonsignificant a positive relationship was observed between the radius of the primary hv and the bed roughness whereas a negative relationship was observed between the swirling strength and bed roughness for beds with the highest roughness levels all vortices were destroyed and there was no clear hv topology in the time average sense finally the motion process of the hv was summarized as showing an increase in the bed roughness the present study investigated hv features with different bed roughness levels and has the potential to enhance our theoretical understanding of the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and the bed roughness keywords bed roughness horseshoe vortex overland flow particle image velocimetry 1 introduction flow passing a circular cylinder has attracted considerable attention for multiple decades because it can create a practical guide for engineering such as when bridge piers are designed for use in a deep open channel flow an understanding of flow passing a circular cylinder will provide insights into the scouring process occurring at the base of vegetation stems according to the results of related studies dargahi 1989 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 chen et al 2017 the presence of a cylinder strongly affects the velocity distribution and the upstream incoming boundary layer separation from the bed because of an adverse pressure gradient caused by bluff bodies more specifically the physical phenomena that occur within the separation zone are highly complex with several vortices rotating in different directions subsequently these vortices wrap around the base of an obstacle and are advected downstream because the track of the vortex is analogous to a horseshoe this coherent structure is called a horseshoe vortex hv in an hv system shear stress and local fluctuation become large and initiate local scouring around the cylinder chen et al 2012 unger and hager 2007 dey and raikar 2007 li et al 2018 akhlaghi et al 2019 the flow characteristics and dynamics around a cylinder are quite complex and studying the characteristics of hvs is necessary for understanding such a complex system as well as providing insights into the scouring process occurring at the base of a circular cylinder using visualization schemes such as the hydrogen bubble dargahi 1989 technique and particle image velocimetry piv ozturk et al 2008 the topologies of hv systems were gradually recorded as presented in fig 1 the stable hv system included a primary large vortex with a clockwise rotation close to the cylinder hv1 and a secondary small vortex hv2 further upstream rotating in the same direction as hv1 another vortex with an anticlockwise rotation hv3 was located between hv1 and hv2 but experimental studies were unable to capture the time averaged hv3 because of the instability of its structure apsilidis et al 2015 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 hv1 is the main vortex for the hv system which has the maximum rotation strength and largest radius here the kinematic characteristics of hv are represented by those of hv1 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 chen et al 2016 in addition to explore the link between hv kinetic characteristics and the obstacle shape the reynolds number based on cylinder diameter red is usually used instead of re eckerle and awad 1991 fleming et al 1993 experimental studies conducted by dargahi 1989 and ozturk et al 2008 demonstrated that the separation point slowly moved toward the cylinder with an increase in red a numerical simulation study by roulund et al 2005 showed that all stages of the separation points varied with red at red 500 the separation point drastically moved upstream at 500 red 8000 the separation point drastically moved downstream at red 8000 the location of the separation point remained stable using piv chen et al 2016 revealed that the separation point moved considerably downstream to a low red whereas it remained stable at a larger red and streamwise and wall normal locations of hv1 had a similar trend another special open channel flow termed overland flow is a shallow open flow along the hillslope under the action of gravity and is susceptible to other influencing factors including vegetation soil particles and stone yang et al 2020 studied the velocities from the flume bed to the free surface by using piv and the results showed that differences existed between the overland flow and open channel flow when the dimensionless flow depth h 550 in terms of the reynolds stress damping constant and integration constant thus overland flow occurred when the dimensionless flow depth h 550 overland flow is the initial stage of surface runoff and provides an initial stimulus for soil erosion li et al 2015 yang et al 2019 investigated the hv kinematic characteristics of overland flow passing a circular cylinder in a smooth bed using piv the results showed that the hv system was gradually compressed with an increasing red in addition as depth increased the separation point moved upstream and the hv moved to a free surface however comprehensive studies of hvs formed upstream of a cylinder in overland flow passing a cylinder are currently limited fluid flow over a rough bed is pervasive in natural slopes and engineering the bed roughness is mainly caused by sand and soil particles previous works have shown differences with respect to the structure and flow characteristics between turbulent flow over smooth and rough beds in open channel flow jiménez 2004 for flow pasting a circular cylinder over a rough bed sadeque et al 2009 conducted experiments to study the effects of the bed roughness on flow characteristics in an open channel flow they found that the hv on the rough bed occupied a relatively greater width than that on the smooth bed however only one grain size was used in their study and there is limited knowledge about the development of hv varying with bed roughness subsequently a few studies focus on the junction flow characteristics over smooth and rough beds in an open channel flow in terms of the flow topology turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow fields apsilidis et al 2015 guan et al 2019 less attention has been given to revealing the effects of bed roughness on hv kinematic characteristics especially for overland flow over a rough bed the effects of bed roughness on hv remain unclear for overland flow passing a circular cylinder a clear understanding of such flows is helpful for recognizing the scouring process and local erosion occurring at the base of a circular cylinder e g vegetation stem chen and jirka 1995 the present study conducted simulation experiments in a hydraulic flume to investigate the effects of the bed roughness on hv kinematic characteristics in overland flow pasting a circular cylinder using high resolution piv in this study the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and bed roughness was explored the present study elucidated the effect of different bed roughness levels on the hv kinematic characteristics in an overland flow passing a cylinder in terms of the separation point hv location hv radius and swirling strength the present study is organized as follows section 2 documents the details of the experimental setup including the apparatus flow conditions and methods used in the present study in section 3 hv kinematic characteristics are discussed and the results of previous studies are compared with those of the present study afterward the variation in the hv model with bed roughness is described in section 4 the main findings of the present study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiments were conducted in a recirculating tilting hydraulic flume system the dimensions of the flume were 12 0 3 0 3 m3 the slope gradient of the flume was fixed at 1 water was pumped from the water tank of the experimental section using a frequency controlled pump from which the discharge q was obtained by changing the pump frequency and measured using an electromagnetic flow meter a series of honeycomb panels were installed at the entrance of the flume to remove large scale structures and straighten the flow a tailgate was installed at the end of the flume which was used to control the water depth and achieve uniform flow conditions the water temperature was measured using a thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c to deduce the kinematic viscosity ν photographs of the test sections are shown in fig 2 to obtain a steady overland flow the test section was placed 7 m away from the entrance an identical black cylinder with a diameter d of 20 mm and a height hc of 100 mm emerged at the water surface and was placed on the centerline of the horizontal platform a fixed bed with different roughness levels was designed the fixed bed was used instead of an erodible bed because in an erodible bed measuring the flow field at the symmetry plane upstream of the cylinder is difficult this is because the camera view can be blocked by an erodible bed due to the presence of a scour hole moreover the bed roughness did not change as the experiments proceeded the flume bed was covered by sand which was sifted into different sizes namely 0 0 5 0 5 1 and 1 2 mm for sand selection we included as many sand types as possible based on the soil particle classification the sifted sand samples with particle sizes of 0 0 5 0 5 1 and 1 2 mm represented fine coarse and very coarse sand respectively moreover the mean diameter ks of the sand samples was 0 25 0 75 and 1 50 mm the ks values were then used to represent different bed roughness levels in the present study yang et al 2017 sand in the test section was blackened to prevent the occurrence of blown highlights a smooth bed without sand was used as the control group the control had a low level of roughness and equaled 0 01 mm zhang et al 2014 prior to the experiments the sifted sand was carefully glued all over the flume bed using varnish and the thickness of the sand layer did not exceed that of a single grain instantaneous flow fields of the symmetry plane upstream of the simulated vegetation stem were measured using piv the particle images were captured using a high speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor coms camera 1248 1024 pixels data were recorded and stored to obtain instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors the frequency of the camera was fixed at 600 hz water was seeded with polyamide sphere trace particles with a diameter of 10 μm and density of 1 06 103 kg m3 which was close to the density of water and illuminated using a laser light sheet launched with a yag laser of 8 w with a continuous wave the piv resolution used in open channel flow generally ranges from 15 to 20 pixels mm chen 2014 chen et al 2017 here the piv system was improved to match the shallow depth measurements first to increase the resolution to measure the shallow depth extension tubes were installed between the camera and lens fig 2a the resolution of all the experiments was as high as 62 pixel mm the actual view captured by the camera was 2 cm upstream of the simulated vegetation stem second the narrower the laser beam was to increase the light intensity the clearer the resulting image the width of the laser beam was 3 cm and the thickness was less than 0 5 cm the cartesian coordinate system was used in the present study the origin of the coordinate system located at the bottom left of a measured area is marked as o in fig 2a the x axis was parallel to the flume bed and oriented along the flow direction the y axis was normal to the flume bed and oriented along the ballistic direction of the light sheet accordingly the velocity components in the directions of the x and y axes were represented by u and v respectively to ensure the representativeness of the samples 5000 pairs of images were captured in each case in view of the periodicity of the hv system one pair of images was captured to derive the velocity field as a tracer particle entered the observation zone and the next pair of images was captured to derive another flow field once the tracer particle had left the observation zone in this manner 5000 hv movements were captured therefore although a set of tests was conducted for each case the interference of random error could be eliminated chen et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the particle images were analyzed using the procedure developed at tsinghua university which used a multipass multigrid window deformation algorithm the outliers were effectively removed using the normalized median test and were displaced using the gaussian interpolation formula two gray level correlation matrices from two adjacent frames with maximum autocorrelations were considered to be the same matrix and the velocity was calculated based on the distances between these two matrices this procedure was proven to be valid the detailed algorithm was documented by chen 2014 in the present study the interrogation window size was 16 16 pixels with an overlap of 50 and interrogation occurred in three iterative steps thus the final distance between the adjacent velocity matrices was 8 pixels afterward each instantaneous flow field was filtered by a 3 3 gaussian filter to eliminate the effects of background noise 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 calculation of the vortex properties the vortex formed at the base of the upstream cylinder was responsible for the scouring of the bed ozturk et al 2008 the method for detecting vortices based on definitions was limited in the application because it cannot distinguish between vortex cores and shear motions the equation is as follows 1 ω v x u y where ω is the vorticity s 1 instead the λci criterion is commonly used to identify vortices due to precise mathematical fundamentals and explicit physical interpretations zhou et al 1999 tomkins and adrian 2003 gao et al 2011 for an arbitrary point in the flows the local 2d velocity gradient tensor m is given as follows 2 m u x u y v x v y the eigen equation of m is given as follows 3 λ 2 p λ q 0 where p and q are the two invariants which are defined as follows 4 p u x v y 5 q u x v y u y v x in addition the discriminant of the eigen equation is as follows 6 δ p 2 4 r when δ is 0 the matrix m has a conjugate of complex eigenvalues λcr λcii where the imaginary parts λci can be regarded as vortex indicators and the vortices can be identified in λci 0 accordingly λci 0 in this part when δ 0 therein λci is the swirling strength of the vortex 2 2 2 vortex radius calculation defining the boundary between the vortex cores and background flow is difficult because of viscosity however no common method is currently available to calculate the vortex radius currently values related to the vortex characteristics such as vorticity and swirling strength selected manually are regarded as the boundary between the vortex and background flow graf and yulistiyanto 1998 varun et al 2008 evidently this method is subjective in another method the point around the vortex core which has the maximum velocity is regarded as the boundary and the radius of the vortex is the distance between this point and the vortex core however this point cannot be easily identified when the flow is affected by other factors such as the presence of a circular cylinder the present study follows the method proposed by carlier and stanislas 2005 which involved fitting the standard vortex function and observing the flow fields to simulate an actual vortex an elliptical vortex is formed because of the circular oseen vortex affected by strong shear stress being exerted by the flume bed thus the equation of an elliptical vortex can be obtained by adding the equation of shear flow to that of the oseen vortex in the cartesian coordinate system the hv equation is given as follows 7 u γ 2 π 1 exp x 2 y 2 r 2 y x 2 y 2 k cos 2 θ y k cos θ sin x 8 v γ 2 π 1 exp x 2 y 2 r 2 x x 2 y 2 k sin θ cos θ

provided in table 1 for convenient expression letters denoting different bed roughness levels and numbers denote different discharge levels to ensure an accurate simulation of the overland flow conditions according to the results of yang et al 2020 the h values of all flow conditions in the present study were less than 550 table 1 the viscous sublayer δ 0 was larger than the height of the bed roughness ks except for ks 1 5 mm thus the surface was hydraulically smooth for ks 0 01 0 25 and 0 75 mm while it was hydraulically rough for ks 1 5 mm in addition the flow depths h without any disturbance by a circular cylinder for all cases were less than 1 1 cm re ranged from 900 to 2100 and the flow regime was that of a transitional flow the fr ranged from 0 4 to 1 3 including supercritical flow and subcritical flow by using 6 ultrasonic level transmitters fully developed and steady overland flow could be obtained for example the flow depth along the flume for a smooth bed ks 0 01 mm is shown in table 2 the results indicated that the flow depth essentially remained stable along the flume and could be seen as fully developed and a steady overland flow in this study the aspect ratios of the flume width 0 3 m to flow depth were greater than 5 therefore no obvious effect of the flume wall was observed on the symmetry planes the flow could be regarded as quasi two dimensional steady flow nezu 2005 3 results and discussions 3 1 recognition of the hv system the λci criterion is used to identify vortices in the present study and the results are shown in fig 4 which also presents the topology of the streamline for different bed roughness levels at a flow discharge q of 0 28 l s for a smooth flume bed with a ks value of 0 01 fig 4a the hv system was clearly recognized which includes three clockwise rotating vortices marked hv1 hv2 and hv3 the topology in the present study is consistent with that of our previous study which focused on shallow water flowing past a cylinder in a smooth flume bed yang et al 2019 both the swirling strength contours and streamlines describe the hv system however the vortex cores recognized by these two methods gradually move apart from one another with an increase in ks because the topology of the streamline results from the combined effects of fluid rotation and shear stress caused by the flume bed the λci criterion only detects the effects of fluid rotation consequently the vortex cores recognized by these two methods overlap because of the low shear stress in the smooth flume bed fig 4a however an opposite effect is observed in larger ks values because of the larger shear stress caused by bed roughness time averaged structures of the hv system were also remarkably affected by the bed roughness three vortices were imaged clearly in terms of the streamline and contours of λci for case a1 with a smooth flume bed fig 4a when the ks value increased to 0 25 mm fig 4b hv1 was clearly observed whereas hv2 became weak and hv3 disappeared when ks increased to 0 75 mm fig 4c hv1 was still clearly recorded by the contours of λci but the envelope line around the vortex cores was significantly lower than that of case a1 and case b1 and the streamlines had a poor ability to capture hv1 in addition hv2 and hv3 disappeared for the maximum bed roughness fig 4d the contours with λci 0 dispersed at the regions where 0 x d 0 6 and 0 y d 0 25 which differed from the three aforementioned cases of contours with λci 0 centered on the vortex cores that were circular simultaneously the streamline topology cannot display any vortex and the reverse flow emanating from the leading edge of the cylinder disappeared to further observe this phenomenon in a flow bed with high bed roughness fig 5 shows the time averaged streamlines superimposed on the λci contour maps for all cases of ks 1 50 mm neither streamline topology could display elliptical vortex cores regardless of the increase in the concentration of contours featured with λci 0 this phenomenon suggested that no distinct eddy structures were formed for a large bed roughness bed although slight rotation for the background flow was observed fluids flowing over beds with a substantial bed roughness have a low kinetic energy and cannot exhibit a reverse flow which results in the disappearance of the hv system in general the hv system was gradually destroyed with an increase in ks thus hv3 hv2 and hv1 vanished in turn the hv system can be destroyed if ks is sufficiently large in the present study the hv system was destroyed on the bed with a ks value of 1 50 mm 3 2 separation point the presence of the cylinder strongly affected the flow and the reverse flow emanating from the leading edge of the cylinder was generated because of an adverse pressure gradient the reverse flow was obstructed by an approaching flow and then a point with u 0 was created which is called a separation point the hv system was restrained at the region downstream of the separation point unger and hager 2007 in view of the local scour at the base of a cylinder caused by hv finding the separation point provides valuable information for controlling the local scour in the present study the separation point was captured as follows locations of the two points with u changing from positive to negative for two layers nearest to the flume bed in flow fields were recorded first and the location of the separation point was obtained via linear extrapolation to the flume bed by using the locations of the aforementioned two points however the separation points for both cases with ks 1 50 mm were not found because the hv system was destroyed due to considerable bed roughness fig 6 shows that the streamwise location of the separation point varies with the cylinder reynolds number red xs represents the distance between the separation point and the leading edge of the cylinder fig 6a also depicts the experimental studies of dargahi 1989 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 and chen et al 2016 as well as the numerical study of roulund et al 2005 all these studies have investigated the characteristics of hv in a deep open channel flow in which the water depth is greater than the cylinder diameter in the present experiments xs d decreased considerably with an increase in red in all cases thus indicating that the separation point moved toward the cylinder with an increase in red table 1 suggests that the fluid kinetic energy was positively correlated with red in the present study thus the separation zone located between the separation point and cylinder was strongly condensed when the kinetic energy of the approaching flow became large fig 6b also depicts the relationship between xs d and red for three bed roughness values according to the scatter results bed roughness exerted a significant effect on xs d and xs d gradually decreased with an increase in ks the separation zones decreased with an increase in bed roughness this was attributed to the decrease in the kinetic energy of the reverse flow caused by bed roughness consequently the separation point moved downstream the curve in fig 6b represents the trend line using linear regression the line flattens with an increase in ks indicating that the separation point slowly moves downstream as the flume bed exhibits an increasing roughness and that the separation zone slowly condenses as red increases the effects of the bed roughness on the location of the separation point were verified using a multicomponent regressive analysis at a confidence level of 0 95 with the results shown in table 3 and the kinematic parameters of hv mentioned later the results suggested that the bed roughness significantly affected the location of the separation point which was negatively correlated with ks 3 3 kinematic characteristics of the vortex the location of the point with a maximum λci in the flow fields is considered the hv location chen et al 2016 yang et al 2019 clearly the vortex core of hv1 has the maximum λci figs 7 and 8 show that the streamwise xc and bed normal yc locations of hv1 vary with red for different bed roughnesses the curvature is the regression line obtained by fitting xc d and yc d in our previous experiments and conducting a smooth flume bed yang et al 2019 the dashed line is the value observed by chen et al 2016 in which the hv location remained stable with an increase in red when red was larger than a critical value in the present study xc d is centered on a critical value roughly equal to 5000 and remains stable at 0 17d upstream of the cylinder overall with an increase in red xc d and yc d first considerably decreased with the power function afterward they became stable and independent of red our present data were satisfactorily consistent with the regression line thus validating the efficiency of the regression equation proposed in our previous study yang et al 2019 the results of table 3 demonstrate that no remarkable regularity was observed with reference to the relationship between xc d and ks thus leading to the inference that bed roughness has a negligible effect on xc d however bed roughness significantly affected yc d fig 8 and a significant negative relation was observed between yc d and ks because the flow velocity was restrained by the bed roughness resulting in a decrease in red generally a significantly negative relationship was observed between yc d and red graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2019 therefore yc d decreased with an increase in ks fig 9 shows the relationship between the hv radius and red for different bed roughness levels the influence of hv varied with red the regression curve of the hv radius and red was obtained in our previous study yang et al 2019 the scatter observed in the present experiments did not align with the regression curve r d increased with an increase in red in the present study which is in contrast to the findings of previous studies chen et al 2016 their results demonstrated a significantly negative correlation between r d and red because the area of the hv system was compressed because of background fluid with high momentum the higher the value of red the higher the momentum to address this issue fig 10 was plotted to show the relationship between the radius of hv and the flow depth the results showed that r d increased linearly with an increase in h d because of space limitations caused by the flow depth as shown in the flow conditions in table 2 corresponding changes occurred in red and h the r d ratio was negatively correlated with red whereas r d was positively related to h therefore a contradiction exists in the variation of r d if red and h change in the same direction the results of the present study show that a predominant effect is the relationship between r d and h for the overland flow features with a shallow depth leading to a positive relationship between r d and red essentially results that were consistent with those of previous studies were obtained yang et al 2019 but red and h changed in opposite directions consequently no contradiction appeared however the predominant effect was the relationship between r d and h because no space limitation existed in deep open channel flow chen et al 2016 the results of table 3 show the significant effect of the bed roughness on r d for example r d increased with an increase in ks the fluid kinetic energy can be restrained leading to the transformation from kinetic energy to pressure energy which indicates an increase in the water depth recalling the aforementioned results r d is positively correlated with h d thus a positive correlation is observed between r d and ks a close relationship was reported between λci and the local scour at the base of the cylinder ozturket al 2008 the law of λci varying with red is beneficial for controlling soil erosion fig 11 shows that the relationship between λci and red is influenced by the bed roughness the results indicate that an increase in red leads to a linear decrease in λci for the same bed roughness in deep open channel flow λci drastically increases with an increase in red because the vortex rotates faster due to having a high kinetic energy zhou et al 1999 however in contrast to the findings of zhou et al 1999 the present study supports the existence of a significantly negative relationship between λci and red associated with r d varying with red an increase in the radius of a vortex causes a slower rotation regardless of the increase in kinetic energy compared with hv in deep open channel flow the kinetic energy increased with an increase in red whereas the radius of the vortex decreased therefore the vortex rotated faster table 3 and fig 11 demonstrate that λci is significantly affected by the bed roughness furthermore they reveal a negative correlation between λci and ks because of the decrease in kinetic energy caused by bed roughness the vortex rotation speed decreased 3 4 hv model influenced by bed roughness summarizing the aforementioned findings of the hv system fig 12 presents sketches of the hv system at the symmetry plane upstream of the cylinder in an overland flow affected by different bed roughness levels in terms of the time averaged features the arrow around the variable represents the change trend of this variable for overland flow over a smooth bed ks 0 01 three vortices with a clockwise rotation were formed on the order of distances to the cylinder which was consistent with the findings of our previous studies yang et al 2019 for overland flow through a fine sand bed ks 0 25 hv3 near the separation point disappears whereas hv2 and hv3 disappear in the overland flow through a coarse sand bed the reason is that the separation point moves toward a cylinder whereas the area of hv1 increases which results in occupying the area where hv3 and hv2 were located therefore hv3 and hv2 were gradually broken and then disappeared in addition hv1 rises along the y axis whereas hv1 mainly stays stable along the x axis with an increase in ks and the swirling strength of hv1 decreases for an overland flow through a very coarse sand bed an alternative phenomenon is presented in which the hv system is completely broken in view of an adverse pressure gradient caused by the cylinder the approaching flow moves down to the flume bed however the kinetic energy of the fluid is not sufficient to form a reverse flow subsequently it does not form an hv system 4 conclusion overland flow passing through a circular cylinder with various bed roughnesses was investigated experimentally using piv in a laboratory flume this study presented the characteristics of hv upstream of cylinders at various bed roughnesses the increase in bed roughness resulted in a weakening of the hv system namely the hv from the far to near cylinder vanished in turn as the bed roughness increased on the very coarse sand bed the time averaged streamline directly impinged on the bed and no clear vortex was recognized the kinematic characteristics including the separation point locations streamwise and bed normal locations radius and swirling strength were investigated to characterize the hv upstream of the cylinder as the bed roughness increased the separation point and swirling strength decreased while the bed normal locations and radius increased no significant effects of the bed roughness on the streamwise location were observed the present study indicates that increasing the roughness around the base of the cylinder is an effective way to prevent local scour because i the separation point moved toward the vegetation stem resulting in hv compression and a slower rotation of the vortex and ii the hv broke completely on a highly coarse sand bed the present study modeled the hv process as the bed roughness increased which is helpful for theoretically understanding the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and bed roughness as well as understanding the scouring process and local erosion occurring at the base of a circular

3621,a horseshoe vortex hv system is formed around a bed mounted circular cylinder in overland water flowing past the cylinder however the effect of bed roughness on hv still lacks clear recognition the present study experimentally investigated the characteristics of hv upstream of a bed mounted circular cylinder in a flume where sand of four grain sizes was glued to the flume bed to produce the bed roughness a particle image velocimetry system was mounted on the flume to facilitate a high resolution 63 pixel mm observation of a flow field a total of 28 cases with flow depths varying from 0 39 to 1 09 cm and cylinder reynolds numbers red varying from 2700 to 5800 were selected to evaluate the effects of the bed roughness on hv in overland flow conditions measurements were then conducted on the upstream flow of a cylinder in the symmetry plane bed roughness significantly affected hv in turn destroying the three vortices subsequently time averaged primary hv features on the three beds with lower roughness levels were analyzed in terms of the separation point location radius and swirling strength with an increase in the bed roughness the separation point moved toward the cylinder and the primary hv moved toward a free surface however the effect on the streamwise location was nonsignificant a positive relationship was observed between the radius of the primary hv and the bed roughness whereas a negative relationship was observed between the swirling strength and bed roughness for beds with the highest roughness levels all vortices were destroyed and there was no clear hv topology in the time average sense finally the motion process of the hv was summarized as showing an increase in the bed roughness the present study investigated hv features with different bed roughness levels and has the potential to enhance our theoretical understanding of the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and the bed roughness keywords bed roughness horseshoe vortex overland flow particle image velocimetry 1 introduction flow passing a circular cylinder has attracted considerable attention for multiple decades because it can create a practical guide for engineering such as when bridge piers are designed for use in a deep open channel flow an understanding of flow passing a circular cylinder will provide insights into the scouring process occurring at the base of vegetation stems according to the results of related studies dargahi 1989 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 chen et al 2017 the presence of a cylinder strongly affects the velocity distribution and the upstream incoming boundary layer separation from the bed because of an adverse pressure gradient caused by bluff bodies more specifically the physical phenomena that occur within the separation zone are highly complex with several vortices rotating in different directions subsequently these vortices wrap around the base of an obstacle and are advected downstream because the track of the vortex is analogous to a horseshoe this coherent structure is called a horseshoe vortex hv in an hv system shear stress and local fluctuation become large and initiate local scouring around the cylinder chen et al 2012 unger and hager 2007 dey and raikar 2007 li et al 2018 akhlaghi et al 2019 the flow characteristics and dynamics around a cylinder are quite complex and studying the characteristics of hvs is necessary for understanding such a complex system as well as providing insights into the scouring process occurring at the base of a circular cylinder using visualization schemes such as the hydrogen bubble dargahi 1989 technique and particle image velocimetry piv ozturk et al 2008 the topologies of hv systems were gradually recorded as presented in fig 1 the stable hv system included a primary large vortex with a clockwise rotation close to the cylinder hv1 and a secondary small vortex hv2 further upstream rotating in the same direction as hv1 another vortex with an anticlockwise rotation hv3 was located between hv1 and hv2 but experimental studies were unable to capture the time averaged hv3 because of the instability of its structure apsilidis et al 2015 chen et al 2016 chen et al 2017 hv1 is the main vortex for the hv system which has the maximum rotation strength and largest radius here the kinematic characteristics of hv are represented by those of hv1 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 chen et al 2016 in addition to explore the link between hv kinetic characteristics and the obstacle shape the reynolds number based on cylinder diameter red is usually used instead of re eckerle and awad 1991 fleming et al 1993 experimental studies conducted by dargahi 1989 and ozturk et al 2008 demonstrated that the separation point slowly moved toward the cylinder with an increase in red a numerical simulation study by roulund et al 2005 showed that all stages of the separation points varied with red at red 500 the separation point drastically moved upstream at 500 red 8000 the separation point drastically moved downstream at red 8000 the location of the separation point remained stable using piv chen et al 2016 revealed that the separation point moved considerably downstream to a low red whereas it remained stable at a larger red and streamwise and wall normal locations of hv1 had a similar trend another special open channel flow termed overland flow is a shallow open flow along the hillslope under the action of gravity and is susceptible to other influencing factors including vegetation soil particles and stone yang et al 2020 studied the velocities from the flume bed to the free surface by using piv and the results showed that differences existed between the overland flow and open channel flow when the dimensionless flow depth h 550 in terms of the reynolds stress damping constant and integration constant thus overland flow occurred when the dimensionless flow depth h 550 overland flow is the initial stage of surface runoff and provides an initial stimulus for soil erosion li et al 2015 yang et al 2019 investigated the hv kinematic characteristics of overland flow passing a circular cylinder in a smooth bed using piv the results showed that the hv system was gradually compressed with an increasing red in addition as depth increased the separation point moved upstream and the hv moved to a free surface however comprehensive studies of hvs formed upstream of a cylinder in overland flow passing a cylinder are currently limited fluid flow over a rough bed is pervasive in natural slopes and engineering the bed roughness is mainly caused by sand and soil particles previous works have shown differences with respect to the structure and flow characteristics between turbulent flow over smooth and rough beds in open channel flow jiménez 2004 for flow pasting a circular cylinder over a rough bed sadeque et al 2009 conducted experiments to study the effects of the bed roughness on flow characteristics in an open channel flow they found that the hv on the rough bed occupied a relatively greater width than that on the smooth bed however only one grain size was used in their study and there is limited knowledge about the development of hv varying with bed roughness subsequently a few studies focus on the junction flow characteristics over smooth and rough beds in an open channel flow in terms of the flow topology turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow fields apsilidis et al 2015 guan et al 2019 less attention has been given to revealing the effects of bed roughness on hv kinematic characteristics especially for overland flow over a rough bed the effects of bed roughness on hv remain unclear for overland flow passing a circular cylinder a clear understanding of such flows is helpful for recognizing the scouring process and local erosion occurring at the base of a circular cylinder e g vegetation stem chen and jirka 1995 the present study conducted simulation experiments in a hydraulic flume to investigate the effects of the bed roughness on hv kinematic characteristics in overland flow pasting a circular cylinder using high resolution piv in this study the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and bed roughness was explored the present study elucidated the effect of different bed roughness levels on the hv kinematic characteristics in an overland flow passing a cylinder in terms of the separation point hv location hv radius and swirling strength the present study is organized as follows section 2 documents the details of the experimental setup including the apparatus flow conditions and methods used in the present study in section 3 hv kinematic characteristics are discussed and the results of previous studies are compared with those of the present study afterward the variation in the hv model with bed roughness is described in section 4 the main findings of the present study are summarized 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus the experiments were conducted in a recirculating tilting hydraulic flume system the dimensions of the flume were 12 0 3 0 3 m3 the slope gradient of the flume was fixed at 1 water was pumped from the water tank of the experimental section using a frequency controlled pump from which the discharge q was obtained by changing the pump frequency and measured using an electromagnetic flow meter a series of honeycomb panels were installed at the entrance of the flume to remove large scale structures and straighten the flow a tailgate was installed at the end of the flume which was used to control the water depth and achieve uniform flow conditions the water temperature was measured using a thermometer with an accuracy of 0 1 c to deduce the kinematic viscosity ν photographs of the test sections are shown in fig 2 to obtain a steady overland flow the test section was placed 7 m away from the entrance an identical black cylinder with a diameter d of 20 mm and a height hc of 100 mm emerged at the water surface and was placed on the centerline of the horizontal platform a fixed bed with different roughness levels was designed the fixed bed was used instead of an erodible bed because in an erodible bed measuring the flow field at the symmetry plane upstream of the cylinder is difficult this is because the camera view can be blocked by an erodible bed due to the presence of a scour hole moreover the bed roughness did not change as the experiments proceeded the flume bed was covered by sand which was sifted into different sizes namely 0 0 5 0 5 1 and 1 2 mm for sand selection we included as many sand types as possible based on the soil particle classification the sifted sand samples with particle sizes of 0 0 5 0 5 1 and 1 2 mm represented fine coarse and very coarse sand respectively moreover the mean diameter ks of the sand samples was 0 25 0 75 and 1 50 mm the ks values were then used to represent different bed roughness levels in the present study yang et al 2017 sand in the test section was blackened to prevent the occurrence of blown highlights a smooth bed without sand was used as the control group the control had a low level of roughness and equaled 0 01 mm zhang et al 2014 prior to the experiments the sifted sand was carefully glued all over the flume bed using varnish and the thickness of the sand layer did not exceed that of a single grain instantaneous flow fields of the symmetry plane upstream of the simulated vegetation stem were measured using piv the particle images were captured using a high speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor coms camera 1248 1024 pixels data were recorded and stored to obtain instantaneous and time averaged velocity vectors the frequency of the camera was fixed at 600 hz water was seeded with polyamide sphere trace particles with a diameter of 10 μm and density of 1 06 103 kg m3 which was close to the density of water and illuminated using a laser light sheet launched with a yag laser of 8 w with a continuous wave the piv resolution used in open channel flow generally ranges from 15 to 20 pixels mm chen 2014 chen et al 2017 here the piv system was improved to match the shallow depth measurements first to increase the resolution to measure the shallow depth extension tubes were installed between the camera and lens fig 2a the resolution of all the experiments was as high as 62 pixel mm the actual view captured by the camera was 2 cm upstream of the simulated vegetation stem second the narrower the laser beam was to increase the light intensity the clearer the resulting image the width of the laser beam was 3 cm and the thickness was less than 0 5 cm the cartesian coordinate system was used in the present study the origin of the coordinate system located at the bottom left of a measured area is marked as o in fig 2a the x axis was parallel to the flume bed and oriented along the flow direction the y axis was normal to the flume bed and oriented along the ballistic direction of the light sheet accordingly the velocity components in the directions of the x and y axes were represented by u and v respectively to ensure the representativeness of the samples 5000 pairs of images were captured in each case in view of the periodicity of the hv system one pair of images was captured to derive the velocity field as a tracer particle entered the observation zone and the next pair of images was captured to derive another flow field once the tracer particle had left the observation zone in this manner 5000 hv movements were captured therefore although a set of tests was conducted for each case the interference of random error could be eliminated chen et al 2017 yang et al 2020 the particle images were analyzed using the procedure developed at tsinghua university which used a multipass multigrid window deformation algorithm the outliers were effectively removed using the normalized median test and were displaced using the gaussian interpolation formula two gray level correlation matrices from two adjacent frames with maximum autocorrelations were considered to be the same matrix and the velocity was calculated based on the distances between these two matrices this procedure was proven to be valid the detailed algorithm was documented by chen 2014 in the present study the interrogation window size was 16 16 pixels with an overlap of 50 and interrogation occurred in three iterative steps thus the final distance between the adjacent velocity matrices was 8 pixels afterward each instantaneous flow field was filtered by a 3 3 gaussian filter to eliminate the effects of background noise 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 calculation of the vortex properties the vortex formed at the base of the upstream cylinder was responsible for the scouring of the bed ozturk et al 2008 the method for detecting vortices based on definitions was limited in the application because it cannot distinguish between vortex cores and shear motions the equation is as follows 1 ω v x u y where ω is the vorticity s 1 instead the λci criterion is commonly used to identify vortices due to precise mathematical fundamentals and explicit physical interpretations zhou et al 1999 tomkins and adrian 2003 gao et al 2011 for an arbitrary point in the flows the local 2d velocity gradient tensor m is given as follows 2 m u x u y v x v y the eigen equation of m is given as follows 3 λ 2 p λ q 0 where p and q are the two invariants which are defined as follows 4 p u x v y 5 q u x v y u y v x in addition the discriminant of the eigen equation is as follows 6 δ p 2 4 r when δ is 0 the matrix m has a conjugate of complex eigenvalues λcr λcii where the imaginary parts λci can be regarded as vortex indicators and the vortices can be identified in λci 0 accordingly λci 0 in this part when δ 0 therein λci is the swirling strength of the vortex 2 2 2 vortex radius calculation defining the boundary between the vortex cores and background flow is difficult because of viscosity however no common method is currently available to calculate the vortex radius currently values related to the vortex characteristics such as vorticity and swirling strength selected manually are regarded as the boundary between the vortex and background flow graf and yulistiyanto 1998 varun et al 2008 evidently this method is subjective in another method the point around the vortex core which has the maximum velocity is regarded as the boundary and the radius of the vortex is the distance between this point and the vortex core however this point cannot be easily identified when the flow is affected by other factors such as the presence of a circular cylinder the present study follows the method proposed by carlier and stanislas 2005 which involved fitting the standard vortex function and observing the flow fields to simulate an actual vortex an elliptical vortex is formed because of the circular oseen vortex affected by strong shear stress being exerted by the flume bed thus the equation of an elliptical vortex can be obtained by adding the equation of shear flow to that of the oseen vortex in the cartesian coordinate system the hv equation is given as follows 7 u γ 2 π 1 exp x 2 y 2 r 2 y x 2 y 2 k cos 2 θ y k cos θ sin x 8 v γ 2 π 1 exp x 2 y 2 r 2 x x 2 y 2 k sin θ cos θ y k sin 2 θ x where γ is the velocity circulation k is the shear rate θ is the angle between the direction of shear flow and flume bed and r is the radius of the oseen vortex here r is extracted and considered the vortex radius of hv fig 3 shows the measured and simulated fields for cases a1 and a2 indicating that a better simulation effect was acquired the r2 values of all cases were larger than

provided in table 1 for convenient expression letters denoting different bed roughness levels and numbers denote different discharge levels to ensure an accurate simulation of the overland flow conditions according to the results of yang et al 2020 the h values of all flow conditions in the present study were less than 550 table 1 the viscous sublayer δ 0 was larger than the height of the bed roughness ks except for ks 1 5 mm thus the surface was hydraulically smooth for ks 0 01 0 25 and 0 75 mm while it was hydraulically rough for ks 1 5 mm in addition the flow depths h without any disturbance by a circular cylinder for all cases were less than 1 1 cm re ranged from 900 to 2100 and the flow regime was that of a transitional flow the fr ranged from 0 4 to 1 3 including supercritical flow and subcritical flow by using 6 ultrasonic level transmitters fully developed and steady overland flow could be obtained for example the flow depth along the flume for a smooth bed ks 0 01 mm is shown in table 2 the results indicated that the flow depth essentially remained stable along the flume and could be seen as fully developed and a steady overland flow in this study the aspect ratios of the flume width 0 3 m to flow depth were greater than 5 therefore no obvious effect of the flume wall was observed on the symmetry planes the flow could be regarded as quasi two dimensional steady flow nezu 2005 3 results and discussions 3 1 recognition of the hv system the λci criterion is used to identify vortices in the present study and the results are shown in fig 4 which also presents the topology of the streamline for different bed roughness levels at a flow discharge q of 0 28 l s for a smooth flume bed with a ks value of 0 01 fig 4a the hv system was clearly recognized which includes three clockwise rotating vortices marked hv1 hv2 and hv3 the topology in the present study is consistent with that of our previous study which focused on shallow water flowing past a cylinder in a smooth flume bed yang et al 2019 both the swirling strength contours and streamlines describe the hv system however the vortex cores recognized by these two methods gradually move apart from one another with an increase in ks because the topology of the streamline results from the combined effects of fluid rotation and shear stress caused by the flume bed the λci criterion only detects the effects of fluid rotation consequently the vortex cores recognized by these two methods overlap because of the low shear stress in the smooth flume bed fig 4a however an opposite effect is observed in larger ks values because of the larger shear stress caused by bed roughness time averaged structures of the hv system were also remarkably affected by the bed roughness three vortices were imaged clearly in terms of the streamline and contours of λci for case a1 with a smooth flume bed fig 4a when the ks value increased to 0 25 mm fig 4b hv1 was clearly observed whereas hv2 became weak and hv3 disappeared when ks increased to 0 75 mm fig 4c hv1 was still clearly recorded by the contours of λci but the envelope line around the vortex cores was significantly lower than that of case a1 and case b1 and the streamlines had a poor ability to capture hv1 in addition hv2 and hv3 disappeared for the maximum bed roughness fig 4d the contours with λci 0 dispersed at the regions where 0 x d 0 6 and 0 y d 0 25 which differed from the three aforementioned cases of contours with λci 0 centered on the vortex cores that were circular simultaneously the streamline topology cannot display any vortex and the reverse flow emanating from the leading edge of the cylinder disappeared to further observe this phenomenon in a flow bed with high bed roughness fig 5 shows the time averaged streamlines superimposed on the λci contour maps for all cases of ks 1 50 mm neither streamline topology could display elliptical vortex cores regardless of the increase in the concentration of contours featured with λci 0 this phenomenon suggested that no distinct eddy structures were formed for a large bed roughness bed although slight rotation for the background flow was observed fluids flowing over beds with a substantial bed roughness have a low kinetic energy and cannot exhibit a reverse flow which results in the disappearance of the hv system in general the hv system was gradually destroyed with an increase in ks thus hv3 hv2 and hv1 vanished in turn the hv system can be destroyed if ks is sufficiently large in the present study the hv system was destroyed on the bed with a ks value of 1 50 mm 3 2 separation point the presence of the cylinder strongly affected the flow and the reverse flow emanating from the leading edge of the cylinder was generated because of an adverse pressure gradient the reverse flow was obstructed by an approaching flow and then a point with u 0 was created which is called a separation point the hv system was restrained at the region downstream of the separation point unger and hager 2007 in view of the local scour at the base of a cylinder caused by hv finding the separation point provides valuable information for controlling the local scour in the present study the separation point was captured as follows locations of the two points with u changing from positive to negative for two layers nearest to the flume bed in flow fields were recorded first and the location of the separation point was obtained via linear extrapolation to the flume bed by using the locations of the aforementioned two points however the separation points for both cases with ks 1 50 mm were not found because the hv system was destroyed due to considerable bed roughness fig 6 shows that the streamwise location of the separation point varies with the cylinder reynolds number red xs represents the distance between the separation point and the leading edge of the cylinder fig 6a also depicts the experimental studies of dargahi 1989 graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 and chen et al 2016 as well as the numerical study of roulund et al 2005 all these studies have investigated the characteristics of hv in a deep open channel flow in which the water depth is greater than the cylinder diameter in the present experiments xs d decreased considerably with an increase in red in all cases thus indicating that the separation point moved toward the cylinder with an increase in red table 1 suggests that the fluid kinetic energy was positively correlated with red in the present study thus the separation zone located between the separation point and cylinder was strongly condensed when the kinetic energy of the approaching flow became large fig 6b also depicts the relationship between xs d and red for three bed roughness values according to the scatter results bed roughness exerted a significant effect on xs d and xs d gradually decreased with an increase in ks the separation zones decreased with an increase in bed roughness this was attributed to the decrease in the kinetic energy of the reverse flow caused by bed roughness consequently the separation point moved downstream the curve in fig 6b represents the trend line using linear regression the line flattens with an increase in ks indicating that the separation point slowly moves downstream as the flume bed exhibits an increasing roughness and that the separation zone slowly condenses as red increases the effects of the bed roughness on the location of the separation point were verified using a multicomponent regressive analysis at a confidence level of 0 95 with the results shown in table 3 and the kinematic parameters of hv mentioned later the results suggested that the bed roughness significantly affected the location of the separation point which was negatively correlated with ks 3 3 kinematic characteristics of the vortex the location of the point with a maximum λci in the flow fields is considered the hv location chen et al 2016 yang et al 2019 clearly the vortex core of hv1 has the maximum λci figs 7 and 8 show that the streamwise xc and bed normal yc locations of hv1 vary with red for different bed roughnesses the curvature is the regression line obtained by fitting xc d and yc d in our previous experiments and conducting a smooth flume bed yang et al 2019 the dashed line is the value observed by chen et al 2016 in which the hv location remained stable with an increase in red when red was larger than a critical value in the present study xc d is centered on a critical value roughly equal to 5000 and remains stable at 0 17d upstream of the cylinder overall with an increase in red xc d and yc d first considerably decreased with the power function afterward they became stable and independent of red our present data were satisfactorily consistent with the regression line thus validating the efficiency of the regression equation proposed in our previous study yang et al 2019 the results of table 3 demonstrate that no remarkable regularity was observed with reference to the relationship between xc d and ks thus leading to the inference that bed roughness has a negligible effect on xc d however bed roughness significantly affected yc d fig 8 and a significant negative relation was observed between yc d and ks because the flow velocity was restrained by the bed roughness resulting in a decrease in red generally a significantly negative relationship was observed between yc d and red graf and yulistiyanto 1998 ozturk et al 2008 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2019 therefore yc d decreased with an increase in ks fig 9 shows the relationship between the hv radius and red for different bed roughness levels the influence of hv varied with red the regression curve of the hv radius and red was obtained in our previous study yang et al 2019 the scatter observed in the present experiments did not align with the regression curve r d increased with an increase in red in the present study which is in contrast to the findings of previous studies chen et al 2016 their results demonstrated a significantly negative correlation between r d and red because the area of the hv system was compressed because of background fluid with high momentum the higher the value of red the higher the momentum to address this issue fig 10 was plotted to show the relationship between the radius of hv and the flow depth the results showed that r d increased linearly with an increase in h d because of space limitations caused by the flow depth as shown in the flow conditions in table 2 corresponding changes occurred in red and h the r d ratio was negatively correlated with red whereas r d was positively related to h therefore a contradiction exists in the variation of r d if red and h change in the same direction the results of the present study show that a predominant effect is the relationship between r d and h for the overland flow features with a shallow depth leading to a positive relationship between r d and red essentially results that were consistent with those of previous studies were obtained yang et al 2019 but red and h changed in opposite directions consequently no contradiction appeared however the predominant effect was the relationship between r d and h because no space limitation existed in deep open channel flow chen et al 2016 the results of table 3 show the significant effect of the bed roughness on r d for example r d increased with an increase in ks the fluid kinetic energy can be restrained leading to the transformation from kinetic energy to pressure energy which indicates an increase in the water depth recalling the aforementioned results r d is positively correlated with h d thus a positive correlation is observed between r d and ks a close relationship was reported between λci and the local scour at the base of the cylinder ozturket al 2008 the law of λci varying with red is beneficial for controlling soil erosion fig 11 shows that the relationship between λci and red is influenced by the bed roughness the results indicate that an increase in red leads to a linear decrease in λci for the same bed roughness in deep open channel flow λci drastically increases with an increase in red because the vortex rotates faster due to having a high kinetic energy zhou et al 1999 however in contrast to the findings of zhou et al 1999 the present study supports the existence of a significantly negative relationship between λci and red associated with r d varying with red an increase in the radius of a vortex causes a slower rotation regardless of the increase in kinetic energy compared with hv in deep open channel flow the kinetic energy increased with an increase in red whereas the radius of the vortex decreased therefore the vortex rotated faster table 3 and fig 11 demonstrate that λci is significantly affected by the bed roughness furthermore they reveal a negative correlation between λci and ks because of the decrease in kinetic energy caused by bed roughness the vortex rotation speed decreased 3 4 hv model influenced by bed roughness summarizing the aforementioned findings of the hv system fig 12 presents sketches of the hv system at the symmetry plane upstream of the cylinder in an overland flow affected by different bed roughness levels in terms of the time averaged features the arrow around the variable represents the change trend of this variable for overland flow over a smooth bed ks 0 01 three vortices with a clockwise rotation were formed on the order of distances to the cylinder which was consistent with the findings of our previous studies yang et al 2019 for overland flow through a fine sand bed ks 0 25 hv3 near the separation point disappears whereas hv2 and hv3 disappear in the overland flow through a coarse sand bed the reason is that the separation point moves toward a cylinder whereas the area of hv1 increases which results in occupying the area where hv3 and hv2 were located therefore hv3 and hv2 were gradually broken and then disappeared in addition hv1 rises along the y axis whereas hv1 mainly stays stable along the x axis with an increase in ks and the swirling strength of hv1 decreases for an overland flow through a very coarse sand bed an alternative phenomenon is presented in which the hv system is completely broken in view of an adverse pressure gradient caused by the cylinder the approaching flow moves down to the flume bed however the kinetic energy of the fluid is not sufficient to form a reverse flow subsequently it does not form an hv system 4 conclusion overland flow passing through a circular cylinder with various bed roughnesses was investigated experimentally using piv in a laboratory flume this study presented the characteristics of hv upstream of cylinders at various bed roughnesses the increase in bed roughness resulted in a weakening of the hv system namely the hv from the far to near cylinder vanished in turn as the bed roughness increased on the very coarse sand bed the time averaged streamline directly impinged on the bed and no clear vortex was recognized the kinematic characteristics including the separation point locations streamwise and bed normal locations radius and swirling strength were investigated to characterize the hv upstream of the cylinder as the bed roughness increased the separation point and swirling strength decreased while the bed normal locations and radius increased no significant effects of the bed roughness on the streamwise location were observed the present study indicates that increasing the roughness around the base of the cylinder is an effective way to prevent local scour because i the separation point moved toward the vegetation stem resulting in hv compression and a slower rotation of the vortex and ii the hv broke completely on a highly coarse sand bed the present study modeled the hv process as the bed roughness increased which is helpful for theoretically understanding the relationship between hv kinematic characteristics and bed roughness as well as understanding the scouring process and local erosion occurring at the base of a circular

3622,this study explores the sensitivity termed scaling factor sf of daily and 30 minute precipitation extremes with several temperature variables i e within day surface air temperature sat and dew point temperature dpt and antecedent sat and dpt corresponding to temperatures one day before a precipitation event denoted as sat c and dpt c across china s mainland to this end we used observed daily meteorological data from cn05 1 dataset and 30 minute precipitation data from the integrated multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg our results reveal a mix of the positive and negative sfs of extreme daily precipitation with sat across climatic zones with peak like structures developing at higher temperatures between 17 and 24 c although almost all the sfs turn to positive when sat c dpt and dpt c are used a peak structure is observed over some parts of each climate zone especially in tropical regions a comparison between the sfs of the full temperature range and the temperature range before peak structure reveals that a single scaling rate is not valid for the entire temperature range moreover the sfs calculated based on the temperature range before the peak structure for all four types of temperatures follow better the clausius clapeyron scaling 7 c than the sfs of the full temperature range except for the tropical region daily sfs based on imerg data are mostly comparable to cn05 1 results with discrepancies mainly in tropical and plateau climates roughly 25 of the study area however imerg s 30 min precipitation extremes do not rise as much as expected even decrease in some parts of the country with increasing temperatures contrary to common observations reported in previous studies it suggests that another precipitation dataset is needed for scaling precipitation extremes at a 30 minute scale at least for china s mainland keywords clausius clapeyron dew point temperature imerg peak structure scaling factor surface air temperature 1 introduction substantial evidence suggests that in the presence of sufficient atmospheric water vapor supply heavier precipitation is likely to occur at higher temperatures hegerl et al 2015 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 tang 2020 indeed based on the clausius clapeyron cc relation the atmosphere s moisture holding capacity increases by 7 per c of warming held and soden 2006 trenberth et al 2003 as a result the precipitation intensity is expected to increase as temperature rises berg et al 2009 gao et al 2020 understanding the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is a crucial step towards grasping how precipitation intensity will change under future global warming bui et al 2019 although the rate of changes in extreme precipitation with increasing temperature is not constant for different storm types and durations however having different scenarios about future changes in extreme precipitation could help us to better estimate the design of hydrological extremes in a warming climate as discussed in sharma et al 2021 to address this issue the sensitivity of precipitation to temperature the rate of increase in precipitation intensity with one degree of warming termed scaling factor sf has been analysed over many regions such as australia hardwick jones et al 2010 herath et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 france drobinski et al 2016 india ali and mishra 2017 japan fujibe 2013 utsumi et al 2011 poland wibig and piotrowski 2018 the united states barbero et al 2017 mishra et al 2012 and united kingdom blenkinsop et al 2015 chen and li 2016 however there are two main barriers to the calculation and interpretation of the sf the first barrier in some regions particularly at low latitudes is negative sf values observed in the relationship between extreme daily and sub daily precipitations and the surface air temperature sat there is a peak structure in the precipitation temperature relation that is extreme precipitation increases at the low medium range of sat but decreases at high sat this reduces the robustness of using sf in estimating extreme daily and sub daily precipitation changes in a warming climate sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the reasons for the occurrence of a peak structure in the daily or sub daily precipitation temperature curve include limitations in moisture availability at high sat hardwick jones et al 2010 the intra seasonal variation of temperature berg et al 2009 decreasing wet time fraction utsumi et al 2011 visser et al 2021 and increasing short convective thunderstorms at high sat westra et al 2014 the cooling effect after precipitation ali and mishra 2017 and solar radiation blocking by heavy cloudiness escrig et al 2013 to deal with the first barrier a few studies calculated sfs separately for each season storm duration or storm type and found that their results are more consistent with the cc relation compared to when the whole data were considered together e g berg et al 2009 2013 panthou et al 2014 some others suggested using dew point temperature dpt instead of sat as an alternative temperature variable e g ali mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 wasko et al 2018 by far the use of dpt provides closer results to our expectation from cc relation because dpt takes into account both temperature and moisture availability at the land surface and sf based on dpt may not be as sensitive to storm duration wasko et al 2018 and precipitation type bui et al 2019 on a global scale ali et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 showed that the results of dpt in scaling extreme daily precipitation are more consistent with the expected cc relation compared to sat similar results were reported for scaling the extreme daily and sub daily precipitation in india ali and mishra 2017 the netherlands lenderink et al 2011 france drobinski et al 2016 western europe lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 canada panthou et al 2014 and australia wasko et al 2018 although positive sf values were reported for the extreme precipitation dpt relationship some studies concluded that the peak structure still remains e g over the netherlands zhang et al 2017 and south korea park and min 2017 more recently visser et al 2020 showed that using the antecedent dry bulb temperature antecedent temperature represents temperature before a precipitation event can address cooling effects on scaling the peak hourly precipitation and result in positive sfs across a wide range of climatic regions however it is not clear whether applying antecedent temperature is useful in addressing the peak structure and then a single scaling rate can be appropriately applied at higher temperatures the second barrier is the limitation of the data practically at a sub daily scale in many parts of the world we do not have enough precipitation data with a fine spatial temporal resolution e g sub daily precipitation trenberth et al 2017 to build a meaningful relationship between precipitation extremes and temperatures lewis et al 2019 tried to break through this barrier by developing a global sub daily rainfall dataset gsdr this quality controlled dataset is becoming one of the primary sources of observed sub daily precipitation data so far several studies have shown the usefulness of this dataset at an hourly scale e g ali et al 2021 barbero et al 2019 li et al 2020 however this dataset does not cover the whole globe it covers only some parts of the land and is not accessible to the public due to the restriction policy fowler et al 2021 stated that we should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of using remotely sensed precipitation datasets as an alternative source to analyse the precipitation temperature relationship although remotely sensed precipitation datasets often suffer low accuracy in comparison to gauge measurements they are a potential alternative source to analyse the perception temperature scaling at a sub daily scale due to their high spatiotemporal resolution global spatial coverage and considerable temporal span therefore the evaluation of using satellite based precipitation datasets in scaling precipitation with a temperature is a real need in this regard wasko et al 2016 presented a quasi global assessment of the tropical rainfall monitoring mission trmm 3b4 for scaling precipitation extremes at 3 hourly and daily time scale they found that the performance of trmm is significantly varied in different regions and time scales however its data can be used in ungauged areas among different remotely sensed precipitation products the integrated multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg as the most current satellite based precipitation dataset might be a valuable option because 1 the imerg provides global 30 minute precipitation intensity 2 the data are accessible to all the researchers without any restrictions hosseini moghari and tang 2020 three questions remain open for investigation 1 what is the effect of antecedent temperature on the peak structure 2 is a single scaling rate valid across the temperature ranges and 3 can the remotely sensed precipitation data be a reliable alternative to in situ precipitation to address the first question we investigate extreme precipitation changes with within day sat and dpt as well as antecedent sat dpt the antecedent sat dpt can be a better proxy than sat dpt particularly over tropical regions the antecedent temperature could potentially reflect the actual temperature attributed to the precipitation event without being affected by the cooling impact of precipitation events and heavy cloud cover that accompanies these events it should be noted that there are already several studies that investigated the relationship between daily and sub daily precipitation extremes and temperatures over china e g gao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2020 and yong et al 2021 however in this study our focus is on the spatial variation of the peak structure based on four types of temperature and the capability of the satellite precipitation product to capture the peak structure to deal with the second question we compare sfs calculated based on temperature range prior to peak structure with sfs for the full temperature range to see how sf rates change across the temperature ranges we address the third question in two steps owing to limitations in the observed data firstly we use the gauge based dataset to quantitatively evaluate the imerg s performance in scaling daily precipitation extremes with temperatures later we use precipitation data from the imerg for scaling 30 minute precipitation extremes with temperatures over china s mainland and compare the results with previous studies and the cc relation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows study area and data are described in section 2 sections 3 4 and 5 show the study s method results and discussion respectively finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area and data we focus on scaling precipitation extremes with temperature variables in china s mainland with a population of 1 4 billion people li et al 2019 china is the world s most populous country natural disasters especially floods and landslides driven by extreme rainfall events cause high economic and social losses in this country han et al 2016 it is estimated that one degree of warming will result in more than us 130 billion flood loss per year throughout the nation jiang et al 2020 therefore understanding the extreme precipitation changes with temperature in china is the key to manage these disasters under future global warming we used the daily climate dataset cn05 1 provided by the national climate center of china meteorological administration wu and gao 2013 cn05 1 is a gridded 0 25 0 25 dataset based on a dense network of 2416 in situ weather stations provided by the chinese meteorological administration yang et al 2017 cn05 1 provides daily meteorological data for the period 1961 2017 we obtained the daily precipitation sat and relative humidity from cn05 1 the dpt was calculated based on sat and relative humidity using the magnus tetens formula barenbrug 1974 in addition to cn05 1 data we utilized the imerg version 6 final run precipitation product at daily and 30 minute timescales the imerg data with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution are available from june 2000 onwards over the entire globe caloiero et al 2021 additional information about the imerg product can be found in huffman et al 2015 we considered a common period to compare imerg with cn05 1 at the daily scale i e 2000 to 2017 at a 30 minute scale storm events are identified using a two hour separator i e two precipitation events are considered independent if they are separated by two consecutive hours of zero precipitation see wasko and sharma 2015 then we considered the maximum 30 minute intensity in each independent strom to calculate sf at the 30 minute scale since the sf is usually dependent on climatic zones panthou et al 2014 we considered the köppen geiger climate classification köppen 1936 peel et al 2007 and classified china s mainland into five climatic zones see fig s1 i e arid northwest continental northeast plateau climate tibetan plateau humid southeast and tropical south islands according to the climate classification map from beck et al 2018 3 method to calculate sf we applied the binning technique with an equal number of events per bin because of its better performance over the approach with equal width temperature bins indeed applying the binning approach with equal width may lead to fewer pairs in bins at the lower and upper ends and in some cases may result in empty bins which would distort the extreme precipitation temperature relationship herath et al 2018 at daily scale similar to previous studies in china e g yin et al 2021 yong et al 2021 the precipitation events higher than 0 1 mm day were grouped with corresponding daily temperatures to apply this technique for each pixel we considered within day sat dpt and antecedent sat dpt from here onwards referred to as sat c dpt c to offset the surface cooling effect during the rainfall then the precipitation temperature pairs were sorted in ascending order bytemperature the pairs were placed into 12 bins with an equal number of pairs per bin if the bins for a given pixel contained less than 101 pairs we omitted that pixel from the calculation i e only those pixels with at least 1212 events 12 bins and more than 100 pairs in each bin were considered in the calculation we then estimated the 99th percentile daily precipitation p99 to represent precipitation extreme and mean sat dpt sat c dpt c t for each bin finally we fitted the following linear regression ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 to the p99 and mean sat dpt sat c dpt c data for each pixel 1 ln p 99 β 1 t β 0 where β 1 and β 0 are slope and intercept of the linear regression respectively eventually the sf was estimated for each pixel by bui et al 2019 2 sf c e β 1 1 100 sf was also calculated based on the median of sat dpt sat c dpt c data in the bins with equal width the results were comparable therefore we only present the results based on mean daily sat dpt sat c dpt c a similar process was applied for the 30 minute scale recall that unlike the daily scale in which we considered all precipitation values larger than 0 1 mm day in calculating scaling factor at a 30 minute scale we use the maximum 30 minute intensity of each independent event with intensity larger than 0 1 mm hr in this way the events with a long duration do not have more weight on the scaling rate than other events to identify a peak structure in the relationship between precipitation and temperature we calculated the difference between the precipitation intensity in the bin with the highest temperature and the maximum precipitation intensity of all the bins a zero difference indicates no peak structure therefore we considered the following two equations to examine the peak structure in the precipitation temperature relationship 3 δ p p 99 m p 99 h p 99 m 100 4 δ t c t p 99 m t p 99 h where δ p indicates the relative difference between the maximum of the 99th percentile of precipitation and the 99th percentile of precipitation in the bin with the highest temperature δ t δ sat δ dpt δ sat c or δ dpt c is the difference between the 99th percentile temperature in the bin corresponding to maximum precipitation intensity and 99th percentile temperature in the bin with the highest temperature p 99 m and p 99 h represent maximum of the 99th percentile precipitation of all the bins and 99th percentile precipitation in the bin with the highest temperature respectively t p 99 m a n d t p 99 h are the temperatures corresponding to the p 99 m a n d p 99 h respectively as discussed in visser et al 2021 the binning technique provides a unique opportunity to analyze precipitation changes within a given temperature range to take advantage of this feature we calculated sf for the entire temperature range and the temperature range before the peak structure to examine peak structure impact on sf rates to avoid calculating sf based on a limited number of data we calculated sfs only for pixels with more than 1212 events 12 bins and more than 100 pairs in each bin before t p 99 m 4 results 4 1 scaling observed daily precipitation extremes with temperatures fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of sfs based on sat dpt sat c and dpt c in different climate zones of china s mainland with respect to the t test at a confidence level of 95 a statistically significant relationship between precipitation and sat is found in 53 7 of pixels this value reaches 98 5 93 7 and 92 8 when dpt sat c and dpt c are used a negative sf based on sat is found in regions of all climate zones except the continental climate zone fig 1a overall a negative sf between precipitation and sat is present in 18 2 of areas concentrated in humid and tropical whereas sf values based on dpt are always positive fig 1b using sat c and dpt c the sfs are positive near everywhere over all zones however the sf values based on dpt are higher than the others the biggest difference can be observed in tropical regions where sf sat varies between 5 6 and 5 1 c while an above cc like scaling is obtained for all pixels based on dpt sat c and dpt c in more than half of the study area sf values based on dpt are not lower than cc conversely based on sat sat c and dpt c more than 81 69 and 80 of areas have a sf value less than cc respectively using sat c and dpt c lead to lower sf values than using dpt however the sf values are always positive based on sat c and dpt c fig 2 illustrates the density scatter plots of extreme daily precipitation versus different temperatures for each climate zone a regression line was fitted between the 99th percentiles of precipitations and corresponding temperatures from fig 2 a peak structure is observed in the relationship between sat and precipitation except for the plateau climate this hook shape relationship expresses a changing scaling from positive to negative occurs in sat ranges from 17 to 24 c across china the use of dpt leads to an absence of the peak structure over the arid and continental areas while the peak remains with a smoother slope over the humid and tropical regions as a result a high positive sf value see fig 1 refers only to the curve s rising limb and is not necessarily linked to an absence of peak structure when sat c is used the results are almost similar to dpt however sat c leads to an almost flat curve at higher temperatures in the humid and tropical regions generally there is no clear peak in the relationship between precipitation and dpt c suggesting that dpt c results are more consistent with our expectation from cc relation it should be noted that fig 2 shows a general behavior over each climate zone which means that it is possible for some pixels not to contribute to the tails of the scatter plots due to their limited temperature range to deal with this issue a pixel by pixel analysis is done below fig 3 shows box plots of δ p and δ t see equations 3 and 4 for five major climate zones the median of δ p based on sat varies from 39 in the plateau region to 87 in the tropical region thus the extreme precipitation of the hottest bin in tropical region is much lower than the maximum extreme precipitation similarly δt shows large variability with the median between 9 3 c in arid region and 4 3 c in tropical region results indicate that the use of other temperature variables reduces δ p and δt in more than 70 67 50 of areas of arid continental and plateau regions δp and δt based on dpt are equal to zero in humid and tropical regions δ p and δt are never equal to zero sat c results are less consistent with the cc scaling than dpt in arid continental and plateau areas whereas the opposite is true in humid and tropical areas results based on dpt c show smaller δ p or δ t in humid and tropical regions with a median of δ p equal to 10 and 18 and a median of δ t equal to 2 4 c and 1 5 c in humid and tropical regions respectively suggesting that sfs based on dpt c follow a better cc relation in these regions the spatial pattern of δ p and δt are presented in figs s2 and s3 fig 4 illustrates box plots of sfs calculated based on the whole temperature range and the temperature range before the peak structure in five major climate zones see method section comparing two panels of fig 4 reveals that sfs before the peak point are stronger than sfs of full temperature range particularly when sat is used sfs based on sat are equal and bigger than sfs of other temperatures when the temperature range is limited to before the peak structure it means that a single sf not only can be quite different based on different temperatures fig 1 but also it varies significantly in different temperature ranges based on a given type of temperature fig 4 the medians of the sf values of full temperature range based on sat dpt sat c dpt c in the arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones are 1 9 6 3 3 9 4 1 4 8 6 4 5 4 4 9 6 6 8 7 5 5 3 9 1 3 5 2 5 1 4 9 and 0 6 12 2 11 3 12 0 c respectively while the medians of sf values reach to 7 1 7 4 4 4 4 7 6 6 6 7 5 5 4 9 9 9 9 0 7 4 5 1 6 2 6 2 5 6 5 3 and 22 0 16 4 17 1 13 0 for the arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones respectively for temperatures range before the peak structure it shows that sfs before the peak structure are more consistent with the expected cc relation in the arid continental plateau and humid regions than sfs computed based on the full temperature range 4 2 scaling daily precipitation extremes with temperatures using the imerg data fig 5 displays the box plots of sfs in different climate zones obtained from the observed and imerg daily precipitation recall that the sfs in this section were computed for 2000 2017 the common period in the observed and imerg datasets generally imerg can reflect the impacts of different temperatures on sfs imerg based sf values are close to cn05 1 results except over the plateau and tropical areas larger sf values over plateau generally above cc like scaling and lower sf values in tropical region generally below cc like scaling are found from imerg results compared to observed ones a comparison between the results of different precipitation datasets and different temperatures reveals sfs are more sensitive to the temperature variable than precipitation datasets at the daily scale in other words accurate sampling has a great impact on sf rates for example in the arid region the difference between average sfs obtained from different temperatures varies from 0 04 a difference when sat c and dpt c are used to 4 81 a difference when sat and dpt are applied while the difference between cn05 1 and imerg varies from 0 09 when dpt c is applied to 2 55 when sat is used the spatial distribution of the difference between calculated sfs based on imerg and cn05 1 using different temperature variables is shown in fig 6 it should be noted that in some pixels there were not a sufficient number of precipitation events to calculate sf during 2000 2017 less than 1212 events see method section indeed about 50 of the arid region and 16 of the plateau region were excluded from the calculations from fig 6 the difference between imerg and cn05 1 results is close to zero over a large part of china s mainland particularly when dpt or dpt c are used the best results were found over continental and arid areas the poorer performance of imerg over the plateau and south parts compared to other regions can be explained by the complexity of precipitation estimation over these areas to compare extreme precipitation temperature curves based on observed and imerg datasets a regression line was fitted between the 99th percentiles of daily precipitations and corresponding temperatures the density scatter plots of imerg extreme daily precipitation versus different temperatures are placed in the supplementary i e fig s4 fig 7 indicates that in many areas the curves from cn05 1 and imerg show similar patterns in general imerg performs better at the medium temperature range than the tails of the curve the main differences come from the amount of precipitation somehow the curves related to imerg are generally located above cn05 1 ones it means that the imerg estimates more precipitation than is reported by observations interestingly imerg can represent the impact of different temperatures on the peak structure well and in most cases shows a quite similar behavior compared to cn05 1 for example the peak structure occurs around 23 c in the tropical area based on both cn05 1 and imerg data sets when sat and dpt are used 4 3 scaling 30 minute precipitation extremes with temperatures based on imerg fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of sfs based on different temperatures at the 30 minute scale along with the box plot of sfs over different climate zones unlike the daily scale the areas with an insignificant relationship between the 30 minute extreme precipitation and temperature are considerable when dpt sat c and dpt c are used with respect to the t test there is no significant relationship between precipitation and sat dpt sat c dpt c in 39 5 33 5 38 33 areas of china s mainland mainly over arid and plateau regions moreover sf values are smaller than the daily scale ones and the influence of different temperatures is negligible compared to its influence on the daily scale compare figs 1 and 8 the largest impact of different temperatures can be seen over tropical lands where the mean of sf values calculated based on dpt and dpt c are at least twice larger than the values obtained from sat and sat c the median of sf values varies between 0 63 1 35 3 44 3 50 3 34 4 21 3 22 3 78 8 81 2 57 based on different temperatures in arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones respectively the negative sfs over tropical land based on all temperatures and a below cc scaling in other parts except some regions in central and southwest of china s mainland reveal that the extreme 30 minute precipitation from the imerg data does not follow the expectations based on the cc relationship for an in depth analysis we plotted the extreme 30 minute precipitations against temperatures in fig 9 this figure illustrates the scatter plots of extreme 30 minute precipitation versus different temperatures for each climate zone there is no relationship between precipitation and temperature in the arid first row and plateau third row regions resulting in regression lines approximately parallel to the horizontal axis however an upward rate with a lower slope than the cc rate is observed without any peak structure in continental and humid regions it indicates that it is more likely that in these areas a selected temperature variable may have less impact on scaling short duration events compared to long duration events unlike other climate zones over tropical region the extreme precipitation temperature relation is sensitive to a temperature variable however none of these temperature variables support a positive scaling of precipitation extremes over this region less impact of temperature on sf values reveals that the precipitation rate plays a more critical role in determining the scaling than the temperature variable at the 30 minute scale 5 discussion 5 1 impact of different temperatures on scaling factor according to the analysis above our results at daily scale indicated that sf based on dtp with a more homogeneous spatial distribution is always positive across china s mainland whereas the opposite is true for sat see fig 1 negative sf values based on sat have been widely reported in previous studies e g ali et al 2018 herath et al 2018 utsumi et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in line with previous results reported for tropical regions of australia bui et al 2019 wasko et al 2018 a mixed negative and positive relationship between sat and extreme daily precipitation were also found in tropical regions of china s mainland while all sf values based on dpt are positive wasko et al 2018 and ali et al 2018 also reported that sf values based on dpt are more uniform in space than those based on sat it is worth mentioning that despite the positive sf values in tropical area based on dpt sat c and dpt c see fig 1 the peak structure remains in some pixels see fig 3 indeed during the heaviest rainfall in the tropical area convective cloud cover and direct surface cooling by rainfall should reduce surface temperatures at the same time tropical storms and typhoons mix the upper overheated sea layer with colder waters of the thermocline making the sat lower than a few days before all together these processes promote the peak structure in the temperature extreme rainfall relationship and bend linear scale factors in agreement with visser et al 2020 our results confirm that using temperature before the precipitation events the sfs become positive based on sat c and dpt c indeed the cooling effect transfers heavy precipitation to the bins with lower temperatures bao et al 2017 therefore sat c and dpt c may help better pairing precipitation and temperature resulted in heavy precipitations staying at the correct bins however at least over many regions of china s mainland moisture limitation is the primary reason that controls heavy precipitation at higher temperatures not the cooling effect and accompanying synoptic systems gao et al 2020 it means that dpt and dpt c are a potentially better proxy than sat c and sat for scaling precipitation extremes more specifically we found that sfs from dpt are more consistent with the expected cc relation in arid continental and plateau regions while dpt c results in humid and tropical regions it suggests that for scaling extreme daily precipitation over china s mainland the relative humidity should be considered in all climate zones while the cooling effect may not critical in all regions this can be explained by the fact that there would be more precipitation time in humid and tropical regions and these precipitation events absorb considerable amounts of latent heat through precipitation evaporation this finding is in line with gao et al 2020 who assessed the relationship between the extreme precipitations and within day mean atmospheric temperature and antecedent maximum atmospheric temperature over china s mainland our results indicate that a peak structure is present in the relationship between sat and the extreme daily precipitation with the sat ranging from 17 to 24 c across china s mainland it suggests decreasing daily precipitation intensity with increasing temperatures see fig 2 a similar temperature range was also reported over ten river basins in china by wang et al 2018 however different breakpoints were reported for sat precipitation relationship over different regions e g 24 c in south korea park and min 2017 22 c in the united kingdom chen and li 2016 20 26 c in australia hardwick jones et al 2010 wasko et al 2018 20 c in the french mediterranean area drobinski et al 2016 18 c in romania busuioc et al 2017 in many regions precipitation is controlled by limited humidity at high temperatures berg et al 2009 herath et al 2018 this limitation in relative humidity is more likely due to the moisture transport reduction from oceans to lands at high temperatures due to high humidity and a large saturation deficit over land gao et al 2020 this implies that for temperature precipitation relationship analysis both moisture holding capacity and available moisture should be considered hardwick jones et al 2010 hence it could be expected that the peak structure may disappear when dpt dpt c is considered as the temperature indicator which takes into account relative humidity however our analysis cannot justify this expectation in all parts of china s mainland see fig 3 it means that other factors than humidity play an important role e g rainfall duration see visser et al 2021 the peak structure in the relationship between extreme precipitation and dpt was also reported in the netherlands zhang et al 2017 and south korea park and min 2017 another issue that needs to be recalled is that sat and dpt represent surface temperature attributes while both relative humidity and temperature significantly change with elevation i e the extreme precipitation largely associated with precipitable water within the air column roderick et al 2020 therefore changes in rate of precipitation intensity with increasing temperature may not necessarily follow the cc relation however we showed the sfs calculated based on temperature range before the peak structure follow the cc scaling much better than the sfs obtained from a full temperature range see fig 4 indeed it suggests that a single scaling rate could not be applied to interpret change in the daily extreme precipitation for all temperature range although using dpt and dpt c eliminates peak like structures in some parts of china s mainland remaining of peak structures in other parts induce uncertainty in estimating extreme precipitation under future global warming the occurrence of peak structures contrasts with modeled precipitation extremes predictions and long term trend analysis of annual maximum daily precipitation bao et al 2017 sun et al 2020 indeed the binning curves for current and future warmer conditions are similar except that the peak occurs at a higher temperature with more intense precipitation in the future zhang et al 2017 therefore the binning scaling may not be reliable for use in projecting the impact of future warming on extreme precipitation under this circumstance a trend scaling zhang et al 2017 may provide a better prediction as sun et al 2020 discussed in detail other studies indicated that sf based on dpt may not be as sensitive to storm duration wasko et al 2018 and the type of precipitation event bui et al 2019 however the shape of the precipitation temperature curve may be affected by the storm duration and precipitation type due to different dynamic processes in fact on a daily scale all precipitation events are considered regardless of their durations because duration of a single rainfall event decreases with increasing temperature gao et al 2018 sf on a daily scale may not be valid in a warmer climate in this regard visser et al 2021 argued that the negative sfs over the australia are due to decrease in the duration of the precipitation event at higher temperatures and not to the decrease in the precipitation rate moreover combining stratiform convective and mixed rainfall types may affect the scaling rate molnar et al 2015 as a stronger increase in convective extremes rainfall was detected compared to the stratiform type rainfall berg et al 2013 due to these uncertainties the relationship between precipitation extremes and temperature cannot be fully understood using the binning method zhang et al 2017 in addition increasing number of short convective thunderstorms at a high sat westra et al 2014 is the another reason for the extreme daily precipitation temperature curve deviating from a monotonic curve precipitation temperature relation only explains the role of temperature in shaping precipitation through thermodynamic processes temperatures alone could not fully explain precipitation change estimating extreme precipitation requires both thermodynamic and dynamic processes jiang et al 2020 muller and takayabu 2020 however the difference between the sf values based on different temperatures indicates that although there are some other influencing factors on precipitation extremes a correct precipitation temperatures sampling is essential in scaling precipitation extremes 5 2 the performance of using imerg in representing the extreme precipitation temperature relationship our results indicated that imerg estimates a larger amount of extreme daily precipitation than cn05 1 see fig 7 this indicates a positive bias in imerg data over china s mainland in all intensity classes of daily precipitation this finding is consistent with the primary assessment of imerg over china s mainland e g chen and li 2016 tang et al 2020 we found that the imerg data can provide useful information about the effects of different temperatures on sf at a daily scale see fig 5 while their effects are less notable on a 30 minute scale see fig 8 we may have no or smoother peak structure at a sub hourly time scale even when sat is used as utsumi et al 2011 reported resulting in a closer sf value in different temperatures in other words the merits of accurate sampling on a coarser time scale are more evident e g daily scale however due to some discrepancies with previous researches the results at the 30 minute scale remain doubtable visser et al 2020 showed that the difference between sfs calculated based on a dry bulb and an antecedent dry bulb temperature is significant at a sub hourly scale moreover our results show sf values at the 30 minute scale are smaller than ones at the daily scale this is not consistent with previous findings that reported a higher sf value for a sub daily scale compared to the daily ones e g ali et al 2021 lenderink et al 2021 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 the root causes of the poorer performance of scaling precipitation extremes by using imerg data at the 30 minute scale compared to the daily scale can be the satellite sensors and imerg algorithm have difficulty estimating the heavy rainfall fang et al 2019 mitra et al 2018 i e it is more likely that the performance of imerg is worse in estimating maximum 30 minute intensity the imerg data are adjusted at a monthly scale hosseini moghari and tang 2020 therefore precipitation at the daily scale might be close to the observation while the intensity of individual precipitation events with a high temporal resolution would not be adjusted well the short precipitation events are hardly captured by satellites due to their limited numbers of overpasses and uneven sampling of the satellites gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 it should be noted that it is better to compare imerg 30 minute results with observed data however this paper does not make a quantitative assessment of imerg at a 30 minute scale due to data availability issues therefore at a 30 minute scale we compared our results with previous studies and the cc relation the different temperatures have more impact on the extreme 30 minute precipitation in the tropical area where these extremes are frequently associated with typhoons see fig 9 at the same time the worst performance of imerg was reported exactly over this region where sfs are negative based on all temperature variables see fig 8 the reason for this mishap can be traced to heavy rainfall associated with tropical depressions storms and hurricanes typhoons as proper estimation of such rainfall events are difficult by imerg omranian et al 2018 yu et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the poor performance of scaling precipitation extreme by using imerg data at the 30 minute scale can also be related to the temperature data as we used daily temperature data for scaling the 30 minute precipitation 6 conclusions in this study the relationship between extreme daily 30 minute precipitation and temperature was explored throughout five climate zones of china s mainland to this end meteorological data from cn05 1 at the daily scale and precipitation data from imerg datasets at the 30 minute scale were considered based on a comprehensive analysis of grid level climatic data our results showed that a stronger relationship is found between extreme precipitation and daily dpt than sat over china s mainland there is a significant linear relationship between extreme precipitation and dpt in 98 5 of areas whereas this value is 53 7 based on sat in 62 areas sf based on dpt is close to or excess of cc like scaling i e 6 c while only 18 areas have sf based on sat over 6 c moreover sf based on dpt is always positive whereas in 18 of areas sf based on sat is negative the most substantial difference in sf values based on sat and dpt was found in tropical regions where the median of the sensitivity of extreme precipitations to sat and dpt is close to zero and 12 2 c respectively the cooling effect is a reason for negative sf based on sat if the antecedent sat is used all sf values turn to positive across all climatic zones however the sf based on sat c is lower than dpt our results based on dpt in arid continental and plateau lands and dpt c in humid and tropical regions are more consistent with the expected cc relation compared to sat c because the peak structure in the precipitation and temperature relationship based on dpt and dpt c is less evident the cooling effect after precipitation and solar radiation blocking by heavy cloudiness in humid and tropical regions in our study these are the tropical islands in south china sea surrounded by permanently warm waters and affected by frequent tropical storms typhoons is likely the reason for following better the expected cc relation by dpt c in comparison to dpt in these regions sf rates calculated based on the temperature range before the peak are close to cc scaling based on all temperatures and in all regions except tropical area it suggests that the results of all temperatures are almost comparable in a limited range of temperatures however the variations of the extreme daily precipitation at higher temperatures based on different temperatures lead to a considerable disagreement between their sfs when the full temperature range is considered therefore a single scaling rate cannot be considered for entire temperature range when analysing the use of within day and antecedent temperatures for deriving sfs and the peak structure at the daily scale imerg shows almost similar results to cn05 1 in most cases except for tropical and plateau regions however extreme precipitations from imerg at a 30 minute scale show no relationship with temperature in many parts of china s mainland moreover sfs values based on imerg at the 30 minute scale are smaller than the daily scale and are not sensitive to different temperature variables used therefore our analysis of the imerg data did not allow us linking precipitation extremes at the 30 minute scale with temperature over china s mainland with all improvements the peak structure persists in precipitation temperature relation at high temperatures therefore for a more precise precipitation prediction the consideration of both thermodynamic and dynamic processes is essential it should be noted that extrapolating the extreme precipitation under global warming using the historical relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature remains a challenge zhang et al 2017 in addition relying solely on temperature is not a perfect approach for estimating extreme precipitations therefore for a better understanding of extreme precipitation changes other factors like moisture source changing atmospheric circulation patterns an d oceanic impact should be included in the calculations ali et al 2018 hardwick jones et al 2010 indeed a carefulcombination of model simulationsand empirical approach based on observations is the best way forward to incorporate changes in extreme precipitation in decision makings such as estimating design hydrologic extremes sharma et al 2021 finally it should be mentioned that the station network in western china s mountainous terrain is sparse so the data in this area may not be considered as a reliable source for imerg evaluations at fine spatial and temporal resolutions therefore it is suggested to conduct a similar analysis at a sub daily or sub hourly scale when and where more observational data will be available funding this study was funded by national natural science foundation of china 41730645 the

3622,this study explores the sensitivity termed scaling factor sf of daily and 30 minute precipitation extremes with several temperature variables i e within day surface air temperature sat and dew point temperature dpt and antecedent sat and dpt corresponding to temperatures one day before a precipitation event denoted as sat c and dpt c across china s mainland to this end we used observed daily meteorological data from cn05 1 dataset and 30 minute precipitation data from the integrated multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg our results reveal a mix of the positive and negative sfs of extreme daily precipitation with sat across climatic zones with peak like structures developing at higher temperatures between 17 and 24 c although almost all the sfs turn to positive when sat c dpt and dpt c are used a peak structure is observed over some parts of each climate zone especially in tropical regions a comparison between the sfs of the full temperature range and the temperature range before peak structure reveals that a single scaling rate is not valid for the entire temperature range moreover the sfs calculated based on the temperature range before the peak structure for all four types of temperatures follow better the clausius clapeyron scaling 7 c than the sfs of the full temperature range except for the tropical region daily sfs based on imerg data are mostly comparable to cn05 1 results with discrepancies mainly in tropical and plateau climates roughly 25 of the study area however imerg s 30 min precipitation extremes do not rise as much as expected even decrease in some parts of the country with increasing temperatures contrary to common observations reported in previous studies it suggests that another precipitation dataset is needed for scaling precipitation extremes at a 30 minute scale at least for china s mainland keywords clausius clapeyron dew point temperature imerg peak structure scaling factor surface air temperature 1 introduction substantial evidence suggests that in the presence of sufficient atmospheric water vapor supply heavier precipitation is likely to occur at higher temperatures hegerl et al 2015 schroeer and kirchengast 2018 tang 2020 indeed based on the clausius clapeyron cc relation the atmosphere s moisture holding capacity increases by 7 per c of warming held and soden 2006 trenberth et al 2003 as a result the precipitation intensity is expected to increase as temperature rises berg et al 2009 gao et al 2020 understanding the relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature is a crucial step towards grasping how precipitation intensity will change under future global warming bui et al 2019 although the rate of changes in extreme precipitation with increasing temperature is not constant for different storm types and durations however having different scenarios about future changes in extreme precipitation could help us to better estimate the design of hydrological extremes in a warming climate as discussed in sharma et al 2021 to address this issue the sensitivity of precipitation to temperature the rate of increase in precipitation intensity with one degree of warming termed scaling factor sf has been analysed over many regions such as australia hardwick jones et al 2010 herath et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 france drobinski et al 2016 india ali and mishra 2017 japan fujibe 2013 utsumi et al 2011 poland wibig and piotrowski 2018 the united states barbero et al 2017 mishra et al 2012 and united kingdom blenkinsop et al 2015 chen and li 2016 however there are two main barriers to the calculation and interpretation of the sf the first barrier in some regions particularly at low latitudes is negative sf values observed in the relationship between extreme daily and sub daily precipitations and the surface air temperature sat there is a peak structure in the precipitation temperature relation that is extreme precipitation increases at the low medium range of sat but decreases at high sat this reduces the robustness of using sf in estimating extreme daily and sub daily precipitation changes in a warming climate sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the reasons for the occurrence of a peak structure in the daily or sub daily precipitation temperature curve include limitations in moisture availability at high sat hardwick jones et al 2010 the intra seasonal variation of temperature berg et al 2009 decreasing wet time fraction utsumi et al 2011 visser et al 2021 and increasing short convective thunderstorms at high sat westra et al 2014 the cooling effect after precipitation ali and mishra 2017 and solar radiation blocking by heavy cloudiness escrig et al 2013 to deal with the first barrier a few studies calculated sfs separately for each season storm duration or storm type and found that their results are more consistent with the cc relation compared to when the whole data were considered together e g berg et al 2009 2013 panthou et al 2014 some others suggested using dew point temperature dpt instead of sat as an alternative temperature variable e g ali mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 wasko et al 2018 by far the use of dpt provides closer results to our expectation from cc relation because dpt takes into account both temperature and moisture availability at the land surface and sf based on dpt may not be as sensitive to storm duration wasko et al 2018 and precipitation type bui et al 2019 on a global scale ali et al 2018 and zhang et al 2019 showed that the results of dpt in scaling extreme daily precipitation are more consistent with the expected cc relation compared to sat similar results were reported for scaling the extreme daily and sub daily precipitation in india ali and mishra 2017 the netherlands lenderink et al 2011 france drobinski et al 2016 western europe lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 canada panthou et al 2014 and australia wasko et al 2018 although positive sf values were reported for the extreme precipitation dpt relationship some studies concluded that the peak structure still remains e g over the netherlands zhang et al 2017 and south korea park and min 2017 more recently visser et al 2020 showed that using the antecedent dry bulb temperature antecedent temperature represents temperature before a precipitation event can address cooling effects on scaling the peak hourly precipitation and result in positive sfs across a wide range of climatic regions however it is not clear whether applying antecedent temperature is useful in addressing the peak structure and then a single scaling rate can be appropriately applied at higher temperatures the second barrier is the limitation of the data practically at a sub daily scale in many parts of the world we do not have enough precipitation data with a fine spatial temporal resolution e g sub daily precipitation trenberth et al 2017 to build a meaningful relationship between precipitation extremes and temperatures lewis et al 2019 tried to break through this barrier by developing a global sub daily rainfall dataset gsdr this quality controlled dataset is becoming one of the primary sources of observed sub daily precipitation data so far several studies have shown the usefulness of this dataset at an hourly scale e g ali et al 2021 barbero et al 2019 li et al 2020 however this dataset does not cover the whole globe it covers only some parts of the land and is not accessible to the public due to the restriction policy fowler et al 2021 stated that we should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of using remotely sensed precipitation datasets as an alternative source to analyse the precipitation temperature relationship although remotely sensed precipitation datasets often suffer low accuracy in comparison to gauge measurements they are a potential alternative source to analyse the perception temperature scaling at a sub daily scale due to their high spatiotemporal resolution global spatial coverage and considerable temporal span therefore the evaluation of using satellite based precipitation datasets in scaling precipitation with a temperature is a real need in this regard wasko et al 2016 presented a quasi global assessment of the tropical rainfall monitoring mission trmm 3b4 for scaling precipitation extremes at 3 hourly and daily time scale they found that the performance of trmm is significantly varied in different regions and time scales however its data can be used in ungauged areas among different remotely sensed precipitation products the integrated multisatellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg as the most current satellite based precipitation dataset might be a valuable option because 1 the imerg provides global 30 minute precipitation intensity 2 the data are accessible to all the researchers without any restrictions hosseini moghari and tang 2020 three questions remain open for investigation 1 what is the effect of antecedent temperature on the peak structure 2 is a single scaling rate valid across the temperature ranges and 3 can the remotely sensed precipitation data be a reliable alternative to in situ precipitation to address the first question we investigate extreme precipitation changes with within day sat and dpt as well as antecedent sat dpt the antecedent sat dpt can be a better proxy than sat dpt particularly over tropical regions the antecedent temperature could potentially reflect the actual temperature attributed to the precipitation event without being affected by the cooling impact of precipitation events and heavy cloud cover that accompanies these events it should be noted that there are already several studies that investigated the relationship between daily and sub daily precipitation extremes and temperatures over china e g gao et al 2020 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2020 and yong et al 2021 however in this study our focus is on the spatial variation of the peak structure based on four types of temperature and the capability of the satellite precipitation product to capture the peak structure to deal with the second question we compare sfs calculated based on temperature range prior to peak structure with sfs for the full temperature range to see how sf rates change across the temperature ranges we address the third question in two steps owing to limitations in the observed data firstly we use the gauge based dataset to quantitatively evaluate the imerg s performance in scaling daily precipitation extremes with temperatures later we use precipitation data from the imerg for scaling 30 minute precipitation extremes with temperatures over china s mainland and compare the results with previous studies and the cc relation the remainder of this paper is organized as follows study area and data are described in section 2 sections 3 4 and 5 show the study s method results and discussion respectively finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area and data we focus on scaling precipitation extremes with temperature variables in china s mainland with a population of 1 4 billion people li et al 2019 china is the world s most populous country natural disasters especially floods and landslides driven by extreme rainfall events cause high economic and social losses in this country han et al 2016 it is estimated that one degree of warming will result in more than us 130 billion flood loss per year throughout the nation jiang et al 2020 therefore understanding the extreme precipitation changes with temperature in china is the key to manage these disasters under future global warming we used the daily climate dataset cn05 1 provided by the national climate center of china meteorological administration wu and gao 2013 cn05 1 is a gridded 0 25 0 25 dataset based on a dense network of 2416 in situ weather stations provided by the chinese meteorological administration yang et al 2017 cn05 1 provides daily meteorological data for the period 1961 2017 we obtained the daily precipitation sat and relative humidity from cn05 1 the dpt was calculated based on sat and relative humidity using the magnus tetens formula barenbrug 1974 in addition to cn05 1 data we utilized the imerg version 6 final run precipitation product at daily and 30 minute timescales the imerg data with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution are available from june 2000 onwards over the entire globe caloiero et al 2021 additional information about the imerg product can be found in huffman et al 2015 we considered a common period to compare imerg with cn05 1 at the daily scale i e 2000 to 2017 at a 30 minute scale storm events are identified using a two hour separator i e two precipitation events are considered independent if they are separated by two consecutive hours of zero precipitation see wasko and sharma 2015 then we considered the maximum 30 minute intensity in each independent strom to calculate sf at the 30 minute scale since the sf is usually dependent on climatic zones panthou et al 2014 we considered the köppen geiger climate classification köppen 1936 peel et al 2007 and classified china s mainland into five climatic zones see fig s1 i e arid northwest continental northeast plateau climate tibetan plateau humid southeast and tropical south islands according to the climate classification map from beck et al 2018 3 method to calculate sf we applied the binning technique with an equal number of events per bin because of its better performance over the approach with equal width temperature bins indeed applying the binning approach with equal width may lead to fewer pairs in bins at the lower and upper ends and in some cases may result in empty bins which would distort the extreme precipitation temperature relationship herath et al 2018 at daily scale similar to previous studies in china e g yin et al 2021 yong et al 2021 the precipitation events higher than 0 1 mm day were grouped with corresponding daily temperatures to apply this technique for each pixel we considered within day sat dpt and antecedent sat dpt from here onwards referred to as sat c dpt c to offset the surface cooling effect during the rainfall then the precipitation temperature pairs were sorted in ascending order bytemperature the pairs were placed into 12 bins with an equal number of pairs per bin if the bins for a given pixel contained less than 101 pairs we omitted that pixel from the calculation i e only those pixels with at least 1212 events 12 bins and more than 100 pairs in each bin were considered in the calculation we then estimated the 99th percentile daily precipitation p99 to represent precipitation extreme and mean sat dpt sat c dpt c t for each bin finally we fitted the following linear regression ali et al 2018 ali and mishra 2017 bui et al 2019 to the p99 and mean sat dpt sat c dpt c data for each pixel 1 ln p 99 β 1 t β 0 where β 1 and β 0 are slope and intercept of the linear regression respectively eventually the sf was estimated for each pixel by bui et al 2019 2 sf c e β 1 1 100 sf was also calculated based on the median of sat dpt sat c dpt c data in the bins with equal width the results were comparable therefore we only present the results based on mean daily sat dpt sat c dpt c a similar process was applied for the 30 minute scale recall that unlike the daily scale in which we considered all precipitation values larger than 0 1 mm day in calculating scaling factor at a 30 minute scale we use the maximum 30 minute intensity of each independent event with intensity larger than 0 1 mm hr in this way the events with a long duration do not have more weight on the scaling rate than other events to identify a peak structure in the relationship between precipitation and temperature we calculated the difference between the precipitation intensity in the bin with the highest temperature and the maximum precipitation intensity of all the bins a zero difference indicates no peak structure therefore we considered the following two equations to examine the peak structure in the precipitation temperature relationship 3 δ p p 99 m p 99 h p 99 m 100 4 δ t c t p 99 m t p 99 h where δ p indicates the relative difference between the maximum of the 99th percentile of precipitation and the 99th percentile of precipitation in the bin with the highest temperature δ t δ sat δ dpt δ sat c or δ dpt c is the difference between the 99th percentile temperature in the bin corresponding to maximum precipitation intensity and 99th percentile temperature in the bin with the highest temperature p 99 m and p 99 h represent maximum of the 99th percentile precipitation of all the bins and 99th percentile precipitation in the bin with the highest temperature respectively t p 99 m a n d t p 99 h are the temperatures corresponding to the p 99 m a n d p 99 h respectively as discussed in visser et al 2021 the binning technique provides a unique opportunity to analyze precipitation changes within a given temperature range to take advantage of this feature we calculated sf for the entire temperature range and the temperature range before the peak structure to examine peak structure impact on sf rates to avoid calculating sf based on a limited number of data we calculated sfs only for pixels with more than 1212 events 12 bins and more than 100 pairs in each bin before t p 99 m 4 results 4 1 scaling observed daily precipitation extremes with temperatures fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of sfs based on sat dpt sat c and dpt c in different climate zones of china s mainland with respect to the t test at a confidence level of 95 a statistically significant relationship between precipitation and sat is found in 53 7 of pixels this value reaches 98 5 93 7 and 92 8 when dpt sat c and dpt c are used a negative sf based on sat is found in regions of all climate zones except the continental climate zone fig 1a overall a negative sf between precipitation and sat is present in 18 2 of areas concentrated in humid and tropical whereas sf values based on dpt are always positive fig 1b using sat c and dpt c the sfs are positive near everywhere over all zones however the sf values based on dpt are higher than the others the biggest difference can be observed in tropical regions where sf sat varies between 5 6 and 5 1 c while an above cc like scaling is obtained for all pixels based on dpt sat c and dpt c in more than half of the study area sf values based on dpt are not lower than cc conversely based on sat sat c and dpt c more than 81 69 and 80 of areas have a sf value less than cc respectively using sat c and dpt c lead to lower sf values than using dpt however the sf values are always positive based on sat c and dpt c fig 2 illustrates the density scatter plots of extreme daily precipitation versus different temperatures for each climate zone a regression line was fitted between the 99th percentiles of precipitations and corresponding temperatures from fig 2 a peak structure is observed in the relationship between sat and precipitation except for the plateau climate this hook shape relationship expresses a changing scaling from positive to negative occurs in sat ranges from 17 to 24 c across china the use of dpt leads to an absence of the peak structure over the arid and continental areas while the peak remains with a smoother slope over the humid and tropical regions as a result a high positive sf value see fig 1 refers only to the curve s rising limb and is not necessarily linked to an absence of peak structure when sat c is used the results are almost similar to dpt however sat c leads to an almost flat curve at higher temperatures in the humid and tropical regions generally there is no clear peak in the relationship between precipitation and dpt c suggesting that dpt c results are more consistent with our expectation from cc relation it should be noted that fig 2 shows a general behavior over each climate zone which means that it is possible for some pixels not to contribute to the tails of the scatter plots due to their limited temperature range to deal with this issue a pixel by pixel analysis is done below fig 3 shows box plots of δ p and δ t see equations 3 and 4 for five major climate zones the median of δ p based on sat varies from 39 in the plateau region to 87 in the tropical region thus the extreme precipitation of the hottest bin in tropical region is much lower than the maximum extreme precipitation similarly δt shows large variability with the median between 9 3 c in arid region and 4 3 c in tropical region results indicate that the use of other temperature variables reduces δ p and δt in more than 70 67 50 of areas of arid continental and plateau regions δp and δt based on dpt are equal to zero in humid and tropical regions δ p and δt are never equal to zero sat c results are less consistent with the cc scaling than dpt in arid continental and plateau areas whereas the opposite is true in humid and tropical areas results based on dpt c show smaller δ p or δ t in humid and tropical regions with a median of δ p equal to 10 and 18 and a median of δ t equal to 2 4 c and 1 5 c in humid and tropical regions respectively suggesting that sfs based on dpt c follow a better cc relation in these regions the spatial pattern of δ p and δt are presented in figs s2 and s3 fig 4 illustrates box plots of sfs calculated based on the whole temperature range and the temperature range before the peak structure in five major climate zones see method section comparing two panels of fig 4 reveals that sfs before the peak point are stronger than sfs of full temperature range particularly when sat is used sfs based on sat are equal and bigger than sfs of other temperatures when the temperature range is limited to before the peak structure it means that a single sf not only can be quite different based on different temperatures fig 1 but also it varies significantly in different temperature ranges based on a given type of temperature fig 4 the medians of the sf values of full temperature range based on sat dpt sat c dpt c in the arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones are 1 9 6 3 3 9 4 1 4 8 6 4 5 4 4 9 6 6 8 7 5 5 3 9 1 3 5 2 5 1 4 9 and 0 6 12 2 11 3 12 0 c respectively while the medians of sf values reach to 7 1 7 4 4 4 4 7 6 6 6 7 5 5 4 9 9 9 9 0 7 4 5 1 6 2 6 2 5 6 5 3 and 22 0 16 4 17 1 13 0 for the arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones respectively for temperatures range before the peak structure it shows that sfs before the peak structure are more consistent with the expected cc relation in the arid continental plateau and humid regions than sfs computed based on the full temperature range 4 2 scaling daily precipitation extremes with temperatures using the imerg data fig 5 displays the box plots of sfs in different climate zones obtained from the observed and imerg daily precipitation recall that the sfs in this section were computed for 2000 2017 the common period in the observed and imerg datasets generally imerg can reflect the impacts of different temperatures on sfs imerg based sf values are close to cn05 1 results except over the plateau and tropical areas larger sf values over plateau generally above cc like scaling and lower sf values in tropical region generally below cc like scaling are found from imerg results compared to observed ones a comparison between the results of different precipitation datasets and different temperatures reveals sfs are more sensitive to the temperature variable than precipitation datasets at the daily scale in other words accurate sampling has a great impact on sf rates for example in the arid region the difference between average sfs obtained from different temperatures varies from 0 04 a difference when sat c and dpt c are used to 4 81 a difference when sat and dpt are applied while the difference between cn05 1 and imerg varies from 0 09 when dpt c is applied to 2 55 when sat is used the spatial distribution of the difference between calculated sfs based on imerg and cn05 1 using different temperature variables is shown in fig 6 it should be noted that in some pixels there were not a sufficient number of precipitation events to calculate sf during 2000 2017 less than 1212 events see method section indeed about 50 of the arid region and 16 of the plateau region were excluded from the calculations from fig 6 the difference between imerg and cn05 1 results is close to zero over a large part of china s mainland particularly when dpt or dpt c are used the best results were found over continental and arid areas the poorer performance of imerg over the plateau and south parts compared to other regions can be explained by the complexity of precipitation estimation over these areas to compare extreme precipitation temperature curves based on observed and imerg datasets a regression line was fitted between the 99th percentiles of daily precipitations and corresponding temperatures the density scatter plots of imerg extreme daily precipitation versus different temperatures are placed in the supplementary i e fig s4 fig 7 indicates that in many areas the curves from cn05 1 and imerg show similar patterns in general imerg performs better at the medium temperature range than the tails of the curve the main differences come from the amount of precipitation somehow the curves related to imerg are generally located above cn05 1 ones it means that the imerg estimates more precipitation than is reported by observations interestingly imerg can represent the impact of different temperatures on the peak structure well and in most cases shows a quite similar behavior compared to cn05 1 for example the peak structure occurs around 23 c in the tropical area based on both cn05 1 and imerg data sets when sat and dpt are used 4 3 scaling 30 minute precipitation extremes with temperatures based on imerg fig 8 shows the spatial pattern of sfs based on different temperatures at the 30 minute scale along with the box plot of sfs over different climate zones unlike the daily scale the areas with an insignificant relationship between the 30 minute extreme precipitation and temperature are considerable when dpt sat c and dpt c are used with respect to the t test there is no significant relationship between precipitation and sat dpt sat c dpt c in 39 5 33 5 38 33 areas of china s mainland mainly over arid and plateau regions moreover sf values are smaller than the daily scale ones and the influence of different temperatures is negligible compared to its influence on the daily scale compare figs 1 and 8 the largest impact of different temperatures can be seen over tropical lands where the mean of sf values calculated based on dpt and dpt c are at least twice larger than the values obtained from sat and sat c the median of sf values varies between 0 63 1 35 3 44 3 50 3 34 4 21 3 22 3 78 8 81 2 57 based on different temperatures in arid continental plateau humid and tropical climate zones respectively the negative sfs over tropical land based on all temperatures and a below cc scaling in other parts except some regions in central and southwest of china s mainland reveal that the extreme 30 minute precipitation from the imerg data does not follow the expectations based on the cc relationship for an in depth analysis we plotted the extreme 30 minute precipitations against temperatures in fig 9 this figure illustrates the scatter plots of extreme 30 minute precipitation versus different temperatures for each climate zone there is no relationship between precipitation and temperature in the arid first row and plateau third row regions resulting in regression lines approximately parallel to the horizontal axis however an upward rate with a lower slope than the cc rate is observed without any peak structure in continental and humid regions it indicates that it is more likely that in these areas a selected temperature variable may have less impact on scaling short duration events compared to long duration events unlike other climate zones over tropical region the extreme precipitation temperature relation is sensitive to a temperature variable however none of these temperature variables support a positive scaling of precipitation extremes over this region less impact of temperature on sf values reveals that the precipitation rate plays a more critical role in determining the scaling than the temperature variable at the 30 minute scale 5 discussion 5 1 impact of different temperatures on scaling factor according to the analysis above our results at daily scale indicated that sf based on dtp with a more homogeneous spatial distribution is always positive across china s mainland whereas the opposite is true for sat see fig 1 negative sf values based on sat have been widely reported in previous studies e g ali et al 2018 herath et al 2018 utsumi et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in line with previous results reported for tropical regions of australia bui et al 2019 wasko et al 2018 a mixed negative and positive relationship between sat and extreme daily precipitation were also found in tropical regions of china s mainland while all sf values based on dpt are positive wasko et al 2018 and ali et al 2018 also reported that sf values based on dpt are more uniform in space than those based on sat it is worth mentioning that despite the positive sf values in tropical area based on dpt sat c and dpt c see fig 1 the peak structure remains in some pixels see fig 3 indeed during the heaviest rainfall in the tropical area convective cloud cover and direct surface cooling by rainfall should reduce surface temperatures at the same time tropical storms and typhoons mix the upper overheated sea layer with colder waters of the thermocline making the sat lower than a few days before all together these processes promote the peak structure in the temperature extreme rainfall relationship and bend linear scale factors in agreement with visser et al 2020 our results confirm that using temperature before the precipitation events the sfs become positive based on sat c and dpt c indeed the cooling effect transfers heavy precipitation to the bins with lower temperatures bao et al 2017 therefore sat c and dpt c may help better pairing precipitation and temperature resulted in heavy precipitations staying at the correct bins however at least over many regions of china s mainland moisture limitation is the primary reason that controls heavy precipitation at higher temperatures not the cooling effect and accompanying synoptic systems gao et al 2020 it means that dpt and dpt c are a potentially better proxy than sat c and sat for scaling precipitation extremes more specifically we found that sfs from dpt are more consistent with the expected cc relation in arid continental and plateau regions while dpt c results in humid and tropical regions it suggests that for scaling extreme daily precipitation over china s mainland the relative humidity should be considered in all climate zones while the cooling effect may not critical in all regions this can be explained by the fact that there would be more precipitation time in humid and tropical regions and these precipitation events absorb considerable amounts of latent heat through precipitation evaporation this finding is in line with gao et al 2020 who assessed the relationship between the extreme precipitations and within day mean atmospheric temperature and antecedent maximum atmospheric temperature over china s mainland our results indicate that a peak structure is present in the relationship between sat and the extreme daily precipitation with the sat ranging from 17 to 24 c across china s mainland it suggests decreasing daily precipitation intensity with increasing temperatures see fig 2 a similar temperature range was also reported over ten river basins in china by wang et al 2018 however different breakpoints were reported for sat precipitation relationship over different regions e g 24 c in south korea park and min 2017 22 c in the united kingdom chen and li 2016 20 26 c in australia hardwick jones et al 2010 wasko et al 2018 20 c in the french mediterranean area drobinski et al 2016 18 c in romania busuioc et al 2017 in many regions precipitation is controlled by limited humidity at high temperatures berg et al 2009 herath et al 2018 this limitation in relative humidity is more likely due to the moisture transport reduction from oceans to lands at high temperatures due to high humidity and a large saturation deficit over land gao et al 2020 this implies that for temperature precipitation relationship analysis both moisture holding capacity and available moisture should be considered hardwick jones et al 2010 hence it could be expected that the peak structure may disappear when dpt dpt c is considered as the temperature indicator which takes into account relative humidity however our analysis cannot justify this expectation in all parts of china s mainland see fig 3 it means that other factors than humidity play an important role e g rainfall duration see visser et al 2021 the peak structure in the relationship between extreme precipitation and dpt was also reported in the netherlands zhang et al 2017 and south korea park and min 2017 another issue that needs to be recalled is that sat and dpt represent surface temperature attributes while both relative humidity and temperature significantly change with elevation i e the extreme precipitation largely associated with precipitable water within the air column roderick et al 2020 therefore changes in rate of precipitation intensity with increasing temperature may not necessarily follow the cc relation however we showed the sfs calculated based on temperature range before the peak structure follow the cc scaling much better than the sfs obtained from a full temperature range see fig 4 indeed it suggests that a single scaling rate could not be applied to interpret change in the daily extreme precipitation for all temperature range although using dpt and dpt c eliminates peak like structures in some parts of china s mainland remaining of peak structures in other parts induce uncertainty in estimating extreme precipitation under future global warming the occurrence of peak structures contrasts with modeled precipitation extremes predictions and long term trend analysis of annual maximum daily precipitation bao et al 2017 sun et al 2020 indeed the binning curves for current and future warmer conditions are similar except that the peak occurs at a higher temperature with more intense precipitation in the future zhang et al 2017 therefore the binning scaling may not be reliable for use in projecting the impact of future warming on extreme precipitation under this circumstance a trend scaling zhang et al 2017 may provide a better prediction as sun et al 2020 discussed in detail other studies indicated that sf based on dpt may not be as sensitive to storm duration wasko et al 2018 and the type of precipitation event bui et al 2019 however the shape of the precipitation temperature curve may be affected by the storm duration and precipitation type due to different dynamic processes in fact on a daily scale all precipitation events are considered regardless of their durations because duration of a single rainfall event decreases with increasing temperature gao et al 2018 sf on a daily scale may not be valid in a warmer climate in this regard visser et al 2021 argued that the negative sfs over the australia are due to decrease in the duration of the precipitation event at higher temperatures and not to the decrease in the precipitation rate moreover combining stratiform convective and mixed rainfall types may affect the scaling rate molnar et al 2015 as a stronger increase in convective extremes rainfall was detected compared to the stratiform type rainfall berg et al 2013 due to these uncertainties the relationship between precipitation extremes and temperature cannot be fully understood using the binning method zhang et al 2017 in addition increasing number of short convective thunderstorms at a high sat westra et al 2014 is the another reason for the extreme daily precipitation temperature curve deviating from a monotonic curve precipitation temperature relation only explains the role of temperature in shaping precipitation through thermodynamic processes temperatures alone could not fully explain precipitation change estimating extreme precipitation requires both thermodynamic and dynamic processes jiang et al 2020 muller and takayabu 2020 however the difference between the sf values based on different temperatures indicates that although there are some other influencing factors on precipitation extremes a correct precipitation temperatures sampling is essential in scaling precipitation extremes 5 2 the performance of using imerg in representing the extreme precipitation temperature relationship our results indicated that imerg estimates a larger amount of extreme daily precipitation than cn05 1 see fig 7 this indicates a positive bias in imerg data over china s mainland in all intensity classes of daily precipitation this finding is consistent with the primary assessment of imerg over china s mainland e g chen and li 2016 tang et al 2020 we found that the imerg data can provide useful information about the effects of different temperatures on sf at a daily scale see fig 5 while their effects are less notable on a 30 minute scale see fig 8 we may have no or smoother peak structure at a sub hourly time scale even when sat is used as utsumi et al 2011 reported resulting in a closer sf value in different temperatures in other words the merits of accurate sampling on a coarser time scale are more evident e g daily scale however due to some discrepancies with previous researches the results at the 30 minute scale remain doubtable visser et al 2020 showed that the difference between sfs calculated based on a dry bulb and an antecedent dry bulb temperature is significant at a sub hourly scale moreover our results show sf values at the 30 minute scale are smaller than ones at the daily scale this is not consistent with previous findings that reported a higher sf value for a sub daily scale compared to the daily ones e g ali et al 2021 lenderink et al 2021 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 the root causes of the poorer performance of scaling precipitation extremes by using imerg data at the 30 minute scale compared to the daily scale can be the satellite sensors and imerg algorithm have difficulty estimating the heavy rainfall fang et al 2019 mitra et al 2018 i e it is more likely that the performance of imerg is worse in estimating maximum 30 minute intensity the imerg data are adjusted at a monthly scale hosseini moghari and tang 2020 therefore precipitation at the daily scale might be close to the observation while the intensity of individual precipitation events with a high temporal resolution would not be adjusted well the short precipitation events are hardly captured by satellites due to their limited numbers of overpasses and uneven sampling of the satellites gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 tian et al 2009 it should be noted that it is better to compare imerg 30 minute results with observed data however this paper does not make a quantitative assessment of imerg at a 30 minute scale due to data availability issues therefore at a 30 minute scale we compared our results with previous studies and the cc relation the different temperatures have more impact on the extreme 30 minute precipitation in the tropical area where these extremes are frequently associated with typhoons see fig 9 at the same time the worst performance of imerg was reported exactly over this region where sfs are negative based on all temperature variables see fig 8 the reason for this mishap can be traced to heavy rainfall associated with tropical depressions storms and hurricanes typhoons as proper estimation of such rainfall events are difficult by imerg omranian et al 2018 yu et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the poor performance of scaling precipitation extreme by using imerg data at the 30 minute scale can also be related to the temperature data as we used daily temperature data for scaling the 30 minute precipitation 6 conclusions in this study the relationship between extreme daily 30 minute precipitation and temperature was explored throughout five climate zones of china s mainland to this end meteorological data from cn05 1 at the daily scale and precipitation data from imerg datasets at the 30 minute scale were considered based on a comprehensive analysis of grid level climatic data our results showed that a stronger relationship is found between extreme precipitation and daily dpt than sat over china s mainland there is a significant linear relationship between extreme precipitation and dpt in 98 5 of areas whereas this value is 53 7 based on sat in 62 areas sf based on dpt is close to or excess of cc like scaling i e 6 c while only 18 areas have sf based on sat over 6 c moreover sf based on dpt is always positive whereas in 18 of areas sf based on sat is negative the most substantial difference in sf values based on sat and dpt was found in tropical regions where the median of the sensitivity of extreme precipitations to sat and dpt is close to zero and 12 2 c respectively the cooling effect is a reason for negative sf based on sat if the antecedent sat is used all sf values turn to positive across all climatic zones however the sf based on sat c is lower than dpt our results based on dpt in arid continental and plateau lands and dpt c in humid and tropical regions are more consistent with the expected cc relation compared to sat c because the peak structure in the precipitation and temperature relationship based on dpt and dpt c is less evident the cooling effect after precipitation and solar radiation blocking by heavy cloudiness in humid and tropical regions in our study these are the tropical islands in south china sea surrounded by permanently warm waters and affected by frequent tropical storms typhoons is likely the reason for following better the expected cc relation by dpt c in comparison to dpt in these regions sf rates calculated based on the temperature range before the peak are close to cc scaling based on all temperatures and in all regions except tropical area it suggests that the results of all temperatures are almost comparable in a limited range of temperatures however the variations of the extreme daily precipitation at higher temperatures based on different temperatures lead to a considerable disagreement between their sfs when the full temperature range is considered therefore a single scaling rate cannot be considered for entire temperature range when analysing the use of within day and antecedent temperatures for deriving sfs and the peak structure at the daily scale imerg shows almost similar results to cn05 1 in most cases except for tropical and plateau regions however extreme precipitations from imerg at a 30 minute scale show no relationship with temperature in many parts of china s mainland moreover sfs values based on imerg at the 30 minute scale are smaller than the daily scale and are not sensitive to different temperature variables used therefore our analysis of the imerg data did not allow us linking precipitation extremes at the 30 minute scale with temperature over china s mainland with all improvements the peak structure persists in precipitation temperature relation at high temperatures therefore for a more precise precipitation prediction the consideration of both thermodynamic and dynamic processes is essential it should be noted that extrapolating the extreme precipitation under global warming using the historical relationship between extreme precipitation and temperature remains a challenge zhang et al 2017 in addition relying solely on temperature is not a perfect approach for estimating extreme precipitations therefore for a better understanding of extreme precipitation changes other factors like moisture source changing atmospheric circulation patterns an d oceanic impact should be included in the calculations ali et al 2018 hardwick jones et al 2010 indeed a carefulcombination of model simulationsand empirical approach based on observations is the best way forward to incorporate changes in extreme precipitation in decision makings such as estimating design hydrologic extremes sharma et al 2021 finally it should be mentioned that the station network in western china s mountainous terrain is sparse so the data in this area may not be considered as a reliable source for imerg evaluations at fine spatial and temporal resolutions therefore it is suggested to conduct a similar analysis at a sub daily or sub hourly scale when and where more observational data will be available funding this study was funded by national natural science foundation of china 41730645 the

3623,there are no doubts that prediction of runoff is one of the crucial hydrological research topics when dealing with catchments it is noteworthy that the rapid land use change in catchments due to urbanization strongly modifies runoff formation and the use of many common rainfall runoff models often is not appropriate in such situations moreover in small catchments with a high percentage of impervious areas highly detailed hydrometeorological data are needed to calibrate the parameters of advanced rainfall runoff models facing the new challenges of urban catchment runoff this work presents a modification of the eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins rainfall runoff model to improve its applicability in urban areas the proposed approach is a combination of the original model with a newly formulated excess rainfall calculation named p4urb that considers pervious and impervious areas indeed the original eba4sub model does not consider impervious areas as a separate form of land use based on results we can conclude that eba4sunurb event based approach for small and ungauged urban basins is better suited for urban catchments because it includes a more rational depiction of how impervious areas influence runoff formation the shape of the design hydrograph and related peak flow are significantly different from those generated from the commonly used nash model the main advantage of eba4sunurb model is that it can be used in ungauged catchments because all parameters are calculated based on catchment characteristics as opposed to being estimated through a calibration process keywords eba4sub model rainfall runoff modeling urban catchment impervious areas 1 introduction it is recognized in literature that the world s urban population is increasing with projections indicating that two thirds of the world s total inhabitants by the year 2050 will be concentrated in cities giving rise to environmental impacts at a global scale united nations 2012 consequently understanding and predicting the causes and consequences of the urbanization process has become a major challenge to environmental risk assessment the urbanization process involves an unsustainable use of natural systems and creates numerous problems both within and outside the city hamdi et al 2011 hydrologically this includes the increase of peak flows runoff volumes frequency of extreme events as well as reduction of water retention the increase of hydrological extremes in urban areas is mainly caused by a reduction of infiltration and as a consequence by an higher excess rainfall kibii et al 2021 the loss of pervious surfaces reduces infiltration in soils while the construction of artificial drainage networks open and closed channels alters natural pathways lizárraga mendiola et al 2017 wałęga et al 2019 this combined physical alteration has a considerable effect on the catchment s hydrological response to rainfall leading to a faster response huang et al 2015 a greater magnitude of river discharge miller et al 2014 and an higher recurrence of small floods braud et al 2013 the increasing imperviousness of urban catchments seems to be a main problem for changes of runoff the study described by xu et al 2020 showed that compared with low density settlements high density settlement areas tend to generate more surface runoff because they have considerably less vegetative surfaces and more land cover characterized by built up areas that way the main measure of the catchment imperviousness appears to be the total area where water does not infiltrate into the soil including roads rooftops sidewalks patios and to some degree compacted soil imperviousness is an integrative indicator and it can be used to estimate or predict cumulative impacts on water resources research in various regions of the world has been consistently showing a strong influence of imperviousness areas on the flood formation phenomenon klein 1979 schueler 1994 may 1996 and literature reveals that this is still an open topic for instance recanatesi et al 2017 and recanatesi and petroselli 2020 investigated the relationship between floods and urbanization in two peri urban areas of the city of rome and found that the hydraulic risk was more pronounced in the part of the selected areas that was more extensively urbanized similar results were achieved by umukiza et al 2021 that demonstrated how the configuration and composition of land use can affect peak discharge and flow volume in selected catchments of narok town kenya therefore impervious surface percentage has been recognized and widely adopted as a key indicator in urban environmental assessment ansari et al 2016 qiao et al 2018 li et al 2019 and should be one of the major parameters in hydrological models in urban areas ren et al 2020 another issue is that the hydrological link between impervious and pervious areas has not well been considered in runoff simulations due to the complexity of flow routing deng et al 2020 epps and hathaway 2018 despite this knowledge regarding the strong influence of impervious surface on surface flow formation in areas where runoff processes are based on hortonian law simple rainfall runoff models are still used blair et al 2012 these models are not able to accurately describe the complexity of runoff as response to rainfall especially for catchments with an heterogeneous distribution of impervious and pervious areas this is a complex problem because even in urbanized catchments natural areas can alter the response to rainfall on the other hand in suburban areas where lawns and other permeable landscapes may be common rainfall can saturate thin soils and produce overland flow which runs off quickly konrad and booth 2002 the dense network of ditches and culverts in cities then allows quick transport to nearby streams and rivers unfortunately the effect of impervious areas on rainfall runoff modeling for small and urbanized catchments has not been fully determined lei et al 2016 hydrological modeling of these catchments is an important tool for analyzing and managing the flood hazard but it requires an understanding of the areas contributing to runoff from the urban parts of the catchment birkinshaw et al 2021 in practice hydrological models may include soil moisture to correctly asses the direct runoff fidal and kjeldsen 2020 or consider high rise buildings to improve runoff predictions yoo et al 2021 for more complex physically based models cea et al 2010 showed that the dynamic wave model is able to predict the peak discharge and its arrival time as well as the shape of the outlet hydrograph while the diffusive wave model gives less accurate results in another example of a complex model perrin and bouvier 2004 used a distributed modeling approach that develops and generalizes the concept of the unit hydrograph to a grid cell structure in a mountainous urban catchment with physiographic heterogeneity and high variability of the rainfall one of the key considerations for modeling the hydrological phenomena not only in urban areas but also in rural catchments is the sensitivity of models to various parameters and methodological approaches sangati and borga 2009 examined the role of river network geometry on the averaging of space time rainfall and on simulated peak discharges after rescaling the rainfall fields to preserve rainfall volumes in small catchments they showed that increasing the resolution length may lead to a distorted geometry of the rainfall field with respect to the river network ballinas gonzález et al 2020 studied the storm water model management swmm and showed that the sensitivity of the parameters depends on the basin under study and on the effects of secondary interactions between the model parameters it was also shown that the most sensitive parameters in a simulation vary according to the storm and the accumulated precipitation saadi et al 2020 showed that gr4h and ihacres two conceptual and continuous models agreed less in reproducing the internal fluxes over the urbanized catchments than over the rural ones as it can be seen knowledge regarding rainfall runoff modeling in catchments characterized by a high percentage of urban cover is still lacking in particular although they can be valuable for representing complex urban hydrology sophisticated physically based models are not preferable in all cases firstly there is often a lack of data in urban catchments for the calibration of advanced models parameters gumindoga et al 2017 indeed the ungauged basin perspective in particular in urbanized catchments poses a challenge in the provision of accurate flood predictions fava et al 2020 secondly climate changes can influence the measured discharges that are used during the calibration process increasing the uncertainty of models one way to address the above issue is to develop a rainfall runoff model that does not present free parameters i e an inherently calibration free rainfall runoff model in reality very little research has been devoted towards developing calibration free hydrological models as it is generally believed that no hydrological model can perform reasonably well without calibration nag and biswal 2019 in their study nag and biswal 2019 argued that a calibration free rainfall runoff model could be used to predict flow duration curves in regions where observed discharge data are inadequate both quantitatively and qualitatively therefore it is very important to find solutions for modeling hydrological phenomena that can avoid the calibration process when the challenges noted above are present specifically approaches are needed to find balance between complex models that have many parameters and thus can generate high uncertainty in simulation and simple conceptual models that can easily describe crucial hydrological processes if simple rainfall runoff theories are to be preferred models including spatial heterogeneity of catchments parameters could be adopted like the hydrological models referred to as variable source area models blazkova and beven 1997 gioia et al 2014 szymczak and krężałek 2018 krężałek 2018 such models may balance the need for accurately representing the effects of urbanization while alleviating the need for extensive calibration one example of a simple rainfall runoff model that does not require a calibration process to estimate its parameters is eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins piscopia et al 2015 petroselli and grimaldi 2018 petroselli et al 2020c eba4sub estimates the hydrograph shape and the related peak flow by employing the same input parameters of the well known rational formula the model has been fully adapted in uncontrolled catchments where agricultural and forest land cover dominate and is based on geographic information systems in doing so optimizing the topographic information contained in the digital elevation model dem indeed eba4sub is a simple kinematic model where the generic pixel velocity value can be calculated with specific equations developed mainly for natural areas that are based on local slope and land use the model was successfully employed in agricultural and forestry catchments in poland młyński et al 2018 2020a b slovakia petroselli et al 2019a vojtek et al 2019 bosnia and herzegovina petroselli et al 2019b and iran petroselli et al 2020a but its use in catchments with high percentage of impervious areas still has not been assessed considering all the aforementioned the overall novelty and objective of this study is to present a conceptual modification of the eba4sub rainfall runoff model to calculate peak discharges and hydrograph shape from catchments with high percentage of impervious area the name of the modified model is eba4sunurb event based approach for small and ungauged urban basins in eba4sunurb model two categories of areas are considered natural or pervious areas and impervious areas for each category of area different approaches for calculating excess rainfall are used it should be emphasized that so far there has been no research regarding the possibility of using the eba4sub model to determine design hydrographs in catchments with a high percentage of impervious areas in the present work eba4sub and eba4sunurb approaches are used to model runoff hydrographs and compare to those obtained using the nash model as a reference 2 study area the selected case study is the serafa river catchment located in the upper vistula basin poland fig 1 the main reason to choose the serafa river catchment is its significant percentage of impervious area such that the basin is characterized by a fast response to rainfall events flash floods are often observed as a consequence a large part of the krakow agglomeration downslope of the serafa river catchment has a high risk of floods the case study catchment area is 72 4 km2 and the length of the main watercourse is 12 7 km the average catchment slope is 3 1 the average river slope is 0 3 and the density of the river network is 0 6 km km 1 this information was derived using a digital elevation model dem provided by usgs united states geological survey with a grid resolution of about 25 m based on the hydrographic division map of poland 2010 and on the corine land cover 2018 database the following forms of land uses shown in fig 2 were identified together with the percentage of the catchment area respectively occupied discontinuous urban fabric 43 3 industrial or commercial unit 9 4 road and rail networks and associated land 2 8 dump sites 0 7 green urban areas 3 9 sport and leisure facilities 0 8 non irrigated arable land 8 7 pastures 8 1 complex cultivation patterns 5 1 land principally occupied by agriculture significant areas of natural vegetation 11 4 broad leaved forest 1 1 mixed forest 2 2 transitional woodland shrub 1 1 and water bodies 2 5 3 methods in this work the new approach eba4sunurb for rainfall runoff modeling in urban catchments was developed by modifying the original eba4sub model the calculations were performed for a 100 year return period as this was the flood management design storm for the local river basin authority the proposed approach is the combination of the original eba4sub with a newly conceived estimate named p4urb for excess rainfall that considers pervious and impervious areas the analysis was carried out in the following stages calculation of design rainfall calculation of excess rainfall determination of design hydrograph by eba4sub and eba4sunurb unfortunately the serafa river is ungauged so the calibration of the model s parameters and the classical verification of performance is not possible further all nearby catchments with similar characteristics to the serafa are ungauged so it is not possible to use observed discharges from other catchments thus the results from eba4sub and eba4sunurb were compared to the commonly used nash model based on cascade of linear reservoirs the nash model is recommended in poland for flood analysis in small and urban catchments banasik et al 2007 for instance design discharges from nash model were used to generate flood hazard zones in krakow area koncepcja 2011 3 1 calculation of design rainfall in this study it was assumed that the maximum flow with a specific frequency qt is caused by the occurrence of a rainfall with the same frequency viglione and blöschl 2008 the analysis was performed for the 100 year return period as noted above calculation of the design rainfall pt was performed by applying the log normal distribution the parameters were established by the maximum likelihood method based on an annual maximum daily rainfall time series from period 1971 2018 the log normal distribution is described as in the following hogg and craig 1978 f x 1 x ε α 2 π e x p 0 5 â ln x ε μ α 2 2 x p e x p μ α 2 e r f 2 1 p 1 ε where xp quantile of the theoretical log normal distribution ε lower string limit erf 2 1 p 1 gauss error function after determining the design rainfall the critical time was established it was assumed this corresponded to the duration of rainfall which causes the maximum peak in design hydrograph the depth of rainfall for the critical time was determined based on lambor s curvers młyński et al 2020b that allow to link rainfall daily values to rainfall values for different durations the same rainfall was assumed for each rainfall runoff model to allow comparison 3 2 nash model for the nash model the excess rainfall was calculated with the scs cn method usda 2004 in the scs cn method the excess rainfall depends on the category of soils land use and antecedent soil moisture all these factors were considered in the cn parameter estimation the amount of excess rainfall was calculated from the relationship xiao et al 2011 soulis and valiantzas 2012 młyński and wałęga 2020 usda 2004 p e p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s w h e n p 0 2 s 0 w h e n p 0 2 s where pe excess rainfall mm p total rainfall mm s maximum potential catchment retention mm the maximum potential retention of the catchment is directly related to the cn parameter ranging from 0 all rainfall becomes infiltration to 100 all rainfall becomes runoff and described by the equation s 25 4 1000 cn 10 the cn parameter was determined for the second moisture level amc ii firstly the cn was assessed for each type of land use and soil type without impervious area according to usda 2004 next the weighted value of cn was calculated taking the sum of each cn value multiplied by its fraction of the total sub catchment area wałęga and salata 2019 in the nash model the catchment is described as a cascade of n linear reservoirs with the retention k parameter of each reservoir the nash model is based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh which is the catchment reaction for a unitary and instantaneous excess rainfall the iuh is described by the following two parameters gamma function nash 1957 u t 1 k â γ n t k n 1 e x p t k where u t ordinates of iuh h 1 t time from the beginning of coordinate system h n number of linear reservoirs k retention parameter of each reservoir h γ n gamma function the characteristic values of iuh hydrograph are peak up time to peak tp and

3 3 eba4sub model eba4sub model determines the runoff hydrograph using the digital elevation model dem of the catchment and the value of the cn parameter the excess rainfall was calculated based on the cn4ga procedure grimaldi et al 2013 this method consists of two stages in the first stage the cumulative excess rainfall is determined based on the scs cn method eq 3 in the second stage the temporal distribution of the excess rainfall within the event is determined using the green ampt equation q 0 t i t f o r t t p k s 1 δ θ δ h i t f o r t t p where q0 infiltration indicator mm h 1 tp ponding time h ks saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 i cumulative infiltration mm δθ change in soil water content between the initial value and the field saturated soil water content δh difference between the pressure head at the soil surface and the matric pressure head at the moving wetting front mm the solution of the equation 9 requires the calibration of the ks parameter the final calibrated value of ks is determined so that the for the cn4ga net rainfall is equal to the cumulative value provided from the scs cn method that is well known in literature to be correct only at event scale and not at sub daily scale moreover the cn4ga procedure is designed to preserve the ponding time information provided by the scs cn method in doing so ks loses its physical meaning and it becomes essentially a calibration parameter linked to cn the reason behind this methodology is that usually is much easier to assess cn based on land use and land cover information than to measure ks in the field for use in calculations after having estimated the amount of excess rainfall and its distribution the width function instantaneous unit hydrograph wfiuh is determined based on the following relationship grimaldi et al 2012 wfiuh t l c x v c x l h x v h x where lc lh hillslope and channel flow paths functions of dem cell respectively m vc vh runoff velocity for hillslope cells and flow channel cells m s 1 after defining wfiuh the final flood hydrograph q t m3 s 1 is determined described by the following relationship q t a 0 t w f i u h t τ p n τ d τ where a catchment area m2 t duration of rainfall s pn t excess rainfall determined by the cn4ga method m s 1 3 4 concept of the eba4sunurb model in the presented concept it was assumed that for impervious areas parking lots roads roofs and so on the net rainfall should be calculated independent from pervious areas in impervious areas identified via land cover data infiltration is not possible and lost rainfall is caused by depression storage in the serafa catchment we assumed that the impervious areas i e industrial or commercial units road and rail networks and or sport and leisure facilities are located throughout the catchment area and are separated by pervious area i e meadows pastures forests and arable area it was assumed that rainfall falls on impervious area where infiltration and depression retention are negligible and subsequently overflows on pervious area assumed that runoff will be calculated from the whole catchment the following procedure p4urb for modeling the runoff is proposed a catchment is divided into two categories pervious area p1 and impervious area p2 where rainfall outflows to area p1 it is a simplification of real situations where some impervious areas drain into one another and are routed directly to nearby streams these detailed analyses of connections between areas with different permeability are possible oi a small scale to prepare local projects for stormwater management in case where larger catchments are analyzed this approach can lead to too complicated models and the advantage with using these models is not too high in comparison to cost and time needed to perform calculations in the impervious areas the excess rainfall is not correctly calculated using the original scs cn method because the original value of the initial abstraction ratio equal to 0 20 usda 2004 is too high and thus runoff can be underestimated circumstance that may have serious consequences in terms of the underestimation of flood risk in these areas krajewski et al 2020 therefore in this concept impervious areas have a d2 depression storage that can occur after rainfall fills such depression storage so d2 is added to the total rainfall occurring on pervious areas depression storage of impervious areas can be calculated based on the following equation krzanowski and wałęga 2007 d2 0 77 jave 0 49 mm 12 where jave average slope of impervious areas m m 1 the total excess rainfall in eba4sunurb is calculated based on cn4ga method in the proposed eba4sub modification the input rainfall for cn4ga is assumed as total equivalent rainfall p calculated based on the following formula 13 p i p 1 i a c a p 2 i where p1 i is the sum of rainfall impulse for each δt mm p2 i is the sum of rainfall impulse for each δt minus d2 from eq 12 mm 14 aca a p 2 a p 1 where ap1 catchment area of category p1 km2 ap2 catchment area of category p2 km2 using this methodology the total equivalent rainfall is the sum of the total rainfall falling on pervious area plus the overland runoff from an impervious area that cannot be stored in depression storage in summary the following procedure eba4sunurb is proposed for hydrograph calculation in urban catchment 1 identification of ap1 and ap2 area based on land cover data 2 calculation of the precipitation p i based on p4urb procedure 3 calculation of the excess rainfall as combination of cn4ga and p4urb procedure cn in cn4ga is calculated only for pervious areas 4 determination of q t based on the wfiuh the cn4ga from p i was used to assess the excess precipitation and perform the convolution integral with wfiuh obtaining q t the critical rainfall duration was determined using a simulation procedure where different durations of rainfall events were assumed and the rainfall duration that caused the maximum peak discharge was selected the same critical time of rainfall was assumed for eba4sub and eba4sunurb models 3 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis for eba4sunurb was conducted using the coefficient of flexibility e which is expressed as wałęga et al 2014 e δ output δ input where δoutput changes in peak flows δinput changes in degree of surface sealing the analysis was performed by changing the degree of surface sealing by increments of 1 if e 1 then the parameter is flexible otherwise if e 1 then the parameter is inflexible 4 results and discussion 4 1 the critical rainfall duration in the first stage of analysis the design rainfall for 100 years return period was determined using log normal function theoretical distribution the results were presented in fig 3 based on these calculations the design rainfall for the return period of 100 years was 86 7 mm the use of a log normal distribution for calculating the design rainfall was supported by research conducted by młyński et al 2019 and it has been shown to be best suited to the empirical rainfall distribution pt the crucial parameter related to design rainfall is the critical duration which is defined as the time that yields the maximum peak flow of the runoff hydrograph for small and urban catchments the critical rainfall duration usually is assumed as the time of concentration meynink and cordery 1976 wałęga et al 2019 the relationship between rainfall duration and peak flows for the serafa catchment is presented in fig 4 the critical rainfall duration for the serafa catchment was 12 5 h a value that is not distant from the theoretic value 10 1 h estimated thanks to kirpich formula the rainfall depth for the critical rainfall duration was found to be 74 1 mm the amount of total rainfall ptot for return period 100 years was determined by reducing the daily amount calculated by log normal distribution to the amount corresponding to a critical rainfall duration equal to 12 5 h the relatively long critical rainfall duration is caused mostly by the relatively high catchment area 72 4 km2 and by the spatial distribution of land use where despite the fact that main land uses in the catchment are impermeable and semi impermeable areas large areas are also covered by agricultural lands furthermore the upper parts of catchment are forested areas a configuration that may lead to a longer response to rainfall events rogger et al 2017 it should be emphasized that determining the critical rainfall duration plays a crucial role in determining the design hydrograph as shown by the study conducted by krvavica and rubinić 2020 this study showed that the method utilized for determining the design rainfall and critical rainfall duration has a significant impact on the flood modeling results and thus can lead to an over or underestimation of peak flow confirming the results obtained by gericke and smithers 2014 the assumption that critical rainfall duration is equal to time of concentration is of course a simplification for instance for the flood hazard assessment the critical rainfall duration is related to both maximum peak flow and maximum volume nguyen et al 2010 moreover in complex and urbanized catchments the rainfall runoff processes are highly non linear and strongly depend on antecedent moisture conditions a circumstance that complicates the prediction of critical rainfall duration schmid 1997 4 2 excess rainfall in order to apply the investigated rainfall runoff models the excess rainfall depth was determined using methods scs cn cn4ga and the cn4ga p4urb combination the results of these calculations are summarized in table 1 while fig 5 shows the excess rainfall and the design rainfall hyetographs and finally fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of direct runoff calculated using scs cn cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb the higher value of cn calculated for the scs cn and cn4ga methods was caused by including all types of land cover in the calculation pervious and impervious areas in case of cn4ga p4urb cn was only calculated for pervious areas where the infiltration process occurs chen and young 2006 the results show that time of excess rainfall calculated by the scs cn method was almost 3 5 times longer than for cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb in fig 5 it can be seen that for the scs cn method the excess rainfall is distributed in a longer time in comparison to cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb as shown in grimaldi et al 2013 this behavior can be explained by different assumptions in the distribution of excess rainfall between the scs cn and cn4ga methods in case of scs cn due the employed empirical formula a long sequence of excess rainfall in the final part of the event is generated the cn4ga procedure which incorporates the green ampt infiltration equation better presents time distribution of excess rainfall depending on change of rainfall rate during the event the shape of design hyetograph may affect the culmination of design hydrograph młyński et al 2018 and petroselli et al 2020b have identified that the eba4sub model is sensitive to changes in the design hyetograph shape usually the highest peak flows have been determined using dvwk method młyński et al 2018 because the serafa river is ungauged the same design rainfall hyetograph was used in calculations the calculated direct runoff values ranged from 3 8 mm to 74 1 mm with the smaller values corresponding to areas with a small cn and vice versa the direct runoff equal to 3 8 mm is related to the portions of the catchment consisting of discontinuous urban fabric where are located soils having low runoff potential and high infiltration rates even when thoroughly wetted the highest value of direct runoff was found for water courses generally the highest direct runoff was observed in northern part of catchment where impervious areas are located for the scs cn and cn4ga methods the direct runoff from impermeable areas ranged from 38 6 mm to 48 5 mm the different values of direct runoff in these areas are caused by variable values of the cn parameter for land uses that are primarily impermeable from 85 to 90 in the cn4ga p4urb method it was assumed that for impermeable areas the rainfall first filled the depression storage the remaining part of the rainfall is then transformed into overland runoff the depression storage calculated based on eq 12 was equal only to 2 54 mm slightly higher than the value reported by skotnicki and sowiński 2015 in an urban catchment in poznań poland the authors calculated a 1 5 mm depression storage value in an urban area that was estimated after calibration using a swmm model as noted above the impervious areas are not included in cn under the cn4ga p4urb approach leading to a lower cn than that calculated for cn4ga or scs cn thus excess rainfall in cn4ga p4urb is higher than in other models table 1 for the cn4ga p4urb method the direct runoff calculated for impermeable areas 71 5 mm was almost 40 higher than average values from scs cn and cn4ga approaches a similar methodology for modeling overland flow formation in impervious areas is utilized in swmm behrouz et al 2020 rossman and huber 2016 4 3 peak discharge and outflow hydrograph in the next stage of this study the design hydrographs were determined using the nash model the eba4sub model and the proposed approach eba4sunurb table 2 summarizes the characteristics of design hydrographs while fig 7 presents their shapes substantial differences were noted between the methodologies as described below because the catchment is relatively flat it is assumed that dem with grid resolution 25 m is sufficient for use in the eba4sub and eba4sunrb calculations in cases where more fine scale dem resolution is available the slope of watercourse and travel time could be more precisely determined and thus velocity of runoff could change the obtained values specifically a smaller pixel dimension like 1 m or 5 m should be used in catchments with higher slopes however higher resolution dems also introduce errors for example grimaldi et al 2007 reported that the number of depressions is inversely proportional to the dem resolution pits depressions can be generated while interpolating dems as part of the process for changing grid spacing resampling a dem to increase the resolution downscaling leads to more pits while decreasing the resolution upscaling reduces the total number of pits but the total percentage area covered by pits increases also the resolution of dem has not shown a strong influence on peak discharges for return periods greater than 5 years petroselli et al 2019a based on the results eba4sub and eba4sunurb provided higher peak flows than nash model with the highest value generated by eba4sunurb the peak discharge from eba4sunurb were 52 higher than from nash model and 20 higher than from eba4sub higher peak flows determined by eba4sub and eba4sunurb in comparison to the nash model are due to the fact that both the models take into account the surface runoff velocity via the wfiuh formulation the analyzed catchment is strongly urbanized circumstance that increases the surface flow velocity therefore the catchment response to rainfall described by eba4sub and eba4sunurb models is faster than for the nash model additionally eba4sub and eba4sunurb discriminate river and hillslope dem pixels to calculate velocity of outflow and thus the catchment response time hillslope velocities are defined using a spatially distributed empirical formula based on the specific pixel information provided by dem and corine data specifically slope and land use conversely in the river network the runoff velocity is assumed constant following the leopold and maddock s findings 1953 that for small basins the increase in the downstream channel velocity is balanced by changes in channel width depth roughness and slope the river network velocity was estimated considering the basin lag time specifically we impose that the projection on the time axis of the median point of the wfiuh that represents the travel time distribution is equal to the basin lag time that is estimated as 60 of the concentration time tc the proposed approach has the ability to consider that in different parts of the catchment the hillslope velocity has different values from pixel to pixel as reported by grimaldi et al 2010 higher velocities usually characterize low contributing area cells upslope areas and the lower velocities are distributed in high contributing areas downslope areas as a result valley bottoms are found to play a major role for the travel time estimation impacting the receding limb of the hydrologic response in the upper part of catchments the dem resolution should be higher to more precisely determine the flow velocity in valleys dem resolution could be smaller indeed the presence of the drainage network can determine a faster time response of catchments jung et al 2017 conversely the nash model does not discriminate river network and hillslopes the disadvantage of such a model structure is that the representation of physical processes is often too crude and the scales of measurements for many hydrologic parameters are incompatible with the scales used in models yu 2015 for this reason the nash model cannot reflect the spatial heterogeneity of catchment topography for eba4sub and eba4sunurb models the surface flow velocity is calculated for each pixel of the dem allowing the characterization of the runoff dynamics for the whole catchment conversely the nash model describes the catchment as a cascade of linear reservoirs whereby parameters are determined from empirical formulas sikorska et al 2012 karabová et al 2012 similar results were reported by młyński et al 2020a where hydrographs determined by the eba4sub scs uh and snyder models were compared młyński et al 2020a also showed higher peak discharge values for eba4sub the differences were 46 and 40 compared to the scs uh and snyder models respectively it should be emphasized that scs uh and snyder are lumped models where the topography information is generalized despite the large differences between peak flows the volume of runoff for the nash model and eba4sub is similar while for eba4sunurb the volume is larger this is due to how the excess rainfall is calculated in cn4ga p4urb approach as described above the flow duration as determined by the nash model is three times longer than the corresponding estimated by eba4sub and eba4sunurb the flow duration is 46 h for nash model and 12 for the other two models the shorter flow duration is the result of the distribution of excess rainfall determined by cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb 2 5 h in the nash model the scs cn method was used to determine excess rainfall and the duration is 8 5 h therefore the excess rainfall determined by cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb is concentrated in a shorter time this is reflected in the design hydrograph analyzing the slenderness coefficients it was concluded that for the hydrograph determined by the nash model the value is greater than 1 0 conversely in eba4sub and eba4sunurb a value smaller than 1 0 is obtained this indicates that for the nash model the flood volume increases until the peak flow and then decreases slowly in eba4sub and eba4sunurb the flood volume in the rising limb of the hydrograph is larger than in the falling limb based on obtained results we can conclude that the proposed approach combining the eba4sub model with a new method for calculating the excess rainfall in urban areas may be an alternative to the nash model for determining the design hydrograph in urban catchments in particular the proposed model is better equipped to represent the flash floods of urban watersheds than the nash model it should also be emphasized that eba4sub model is a parsimonious model in terms of input parameters and reduces the user s subjectivity the model simplicity means that the proposed approach can be fully used by practitioners e g for determining flood zones or designing hydrotechnical infrastructures furthermore the nash model commonly used in urban catchments has some limitations for instance the model s parameters can by determined by various methods sikorska and banasik 2010 and the choice of method affects the obtained results nonetheless the nash model is still commonly applied in urban catchments banasik et al 2007 kołodziejczyk 2017 conversely the parameters of the eba4sub model are determined directly on the basis of physiographic catchment characteristics and in doing so preclude the subjectivity of their determination this plays a crucial role especially in situations where different users aim to determine the design hydrograph for the same catchment and with the same input data in short eba4sub provides similar results when it is used by different practitioners it should also be emphasized that data availability may limit the model selection for that reason simple models are commonly used because for smaller catchments the characteristics are unknown or too expensive to determine sitterson et al 2017 summarizing the proposed approach is based on a lumped procedure different land categories are used to calculate net rainfall from pervious areas the cn4ga procedure is used whereby land uses without impervious areas are used to calculate cn parameter and subsequently net rainfall for impervious areas like roofs roads and parking lots where infiltration does not occur the lost rainfall is assumed as depression storage we identified impervious areas and pervious areas based on land use data from corine land cover information the runoff from impervious areas is added to net runoff from pervious area and input to the kinematic component of model width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph that is a lumped approach 4 4 sensitivity analysis to further test the proposed approach a sensitivity analysis was conducted the sensitivity analysis consisted of calculating the coefficient of flexibility e output values peak flows by varying input values degree of surface sealing the results are presented in figs 8 and 9 the degree of soil sealing is important considering the current trend of land planning in krakow area and throughout the world where permeable areas like arable land and grassland will likely be replaced by impervious areas the results presented in fig 8 indicate that 1 change of degree of surface sealing u produces a change of peak flows of about 2 and similar changes for hydrograph s volume the peak flows increase linearly as the degree of surface sealing was varied from 5 to 25 the results are similar to the ones achieved by wałęga et al 2019 that indicated a similar rise in peak discharges with an increase of impervious areas in sudoł dominkanski another second highly urbanized catchment inside the krakow agglomeration for the serafa river the lowest peak flow was 51 85 m3 s 1 and the highest was 77 65 m3 s 1 it should be emphasized that the lowest peak flow from eba4sunurb for u equal 5 was similar to the peak flow determined by eba4sub such results indicate that eba4sub may be used in catchments where impervious area percentage is up to 5 when the catchment has a greater impervious area percentage the eba4sunurb is likely a better choice the results presented in fig 9 show that the calculated coefficient of flexibility e is ranging from 0 08 to 0 63 in the sensitivity analysis because the obtained values were smaller than 1 0 it means that eba4sunurb is inflexible to the change of u value 5 conclusions urban catchments where the majority of people live are very sensitive areas where any change of runoff might influence dramatically water balance retention and flood risk because of that the aim of this study was to develop a new approach for design hydrograph formulation in urban catchments the proposed approach is a combination of the already existing eba4sub model and a new method for calculating excess rainfall the model estimates by default some important parmeters used for its application this information can be changed by user if more specific data are available leaving the model flexible to be used in either ungauged and gauged basins the first parameter is related to the net rainfall estimation and the second is related to the runoff propagation and is determined using the wfiuh framework in this framework the surface runoff velocity estimation is crucial as a result the new model named eba4sunurb for urban catchment is proposed considering the obtained results it was concluded that eba4sunurb can be a very good alternative to the commonly used nash model in urban catchments because it more reasonably represents the influence of impervious areas on runoff formation and thus provides significantly different peak discharge and flood volume estimates moreover the shape of the design hydrograph in the proposed method is more typical for urban catchments in comparison to the nash model an important benefit of the eba4sunurb model is that it is particularly useful in ungauged catchments because all its input parameters are calculated by default by the model based on more readily available catchment characteristics such as topography land use and soil data and thus does not explicitly require a calibration process of course the input parameters of the model can be more precisely calculated or taken into account when a gauged catchment is investigated finally a sensitivity analysis showed that eba4sunurb is inflexible in terms of degree of impervious of surface the main limitation of eba4sunurb is its inability to consider the role of storm sewer systems during the flood generation thus at the moment the model can be promoted for use by hydrologists aiming to perform preliminary studies for flood protection or design hydraulics structures in case of more detailed and specific analysis process based models should be recommended the future research for developing eba4sunurb model would be aim to 1 test the proposed approach in gauged catchments with high impervious cover percentages 2 include a synthetic time series of rainfall to generate continuous runoff and 3 update the model by including the sewer systems contribution credit authorship

3623,there are no doubts that prediction of runoff is one of the crucial hydrological research topics when dealing with catchments it is noteworthy that the rapid land use change in catchments due to urbanization strongly modifies runoff formation and the use of many common rainfall runoff models often is not appropriate in such situations moreover in small catchments with a high percentage of impervious areas highly detailed hydrometeorological data are needed to calibrate the parameters of advanced rainfall runoff models facing the new challenges of urban catchment runoff this work presents a modification of the eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins rainfall runoff model to improve its applicability in urban areas the proposed approach is a combination of the original model with a newly formulated excess rainfall calculation named p4urb that considers pervious and impervious areas indeed the original eba4sub model does not consider impervious areas as a separate form of land use based on results we can conclude that eba4sunurb event based approach for small and ungauged urban basins is better suited for urban catchments because it includes a more rational depiction of how impervious areas influence runoff formation the shape of the design hydrograph and related peak flow are significantly different from those generated from the commonly used nash model the main advantage of eba4sunurb model is that it can be used in ungauged catchments because all parameters are calculated based on catchment characteristics as opposed to being estimated through a calibration process keywords eba4sub model rainfall runoff modeling urban catchment impervious areas 1 introduction it is recognized in literature that the world s urban population is increasing with projections indicating that two thirds of the world s total inhabitants by the year 2050 will be concentrated in cities giving rise to environmental impacts at a global scale united nations 2012 consequently understanding and predicting the causes and consequences of the urbanization process has become a major challenge to environmental risk assessment the urbanization process involves an unsustainable use of natural systems and creates numerous problems both within and outside the city hamdi et al 2011 hydrologically this includes the increase of peak flows runoff volumes frequency of extreme events as well as reduction of water retention the increase of hydrological extremes in urban areas is mainly caused by a reduction of infiltration and as a consequence by an higher excess rainfall kibii et al 2021 the loss of pervious surfaces reduces infiltration in soils while the construction of artificial drainage networks open and closed channels alters natural pathways lizárraga mendiola et al 2017 wałęga et al 2019 this combined physical alteration has a considerable effect on the catchment s hydrological response to rainfall leading to a faster response huang et al 2015 a greater magnitude of river discharge miller et al 2014 and an higher recurrence of small floods braud et al 2013 the increasing imperviousness of urban catchments seems to be a main problem for changes of runoff the study described by xu et al 2020 showed that compared with low density settlements high density settlement areas tend to generate more surface runoff because they have considerably less vegetative surfaces and more land cover characterized by built up areas that way the main measure of the catchment imperviousness appears to be the total area where water does not infiltrate into the soil including roads rooftops sidewalks patios and to some degree compacted soil imperviousness is an integrative indicator and it can be used to estimate or predict cumulative impacts on water resources research in various regions of the world has been consistently showing a strong influence of imperviousness areas on the flood formation phenomenon klein 1979 schueler 1994 may 1996 and literature reveals that this is still an open topic for instance recanatesi et al 2017 and recanatesi and petroselli 2020 investigated the relationship between floods and urbanization in two peri urban areas of the city of rome and found that the hydraulic risk was more pronounced in the part of the selected areas that was more extensively urbanized similar results were achieved by umukiza et al 2021 that demonstrated how the configuration and composition of land use can affect peak discharge and flow volume in selected catchments of narok town kenya therefore impervious surface percentage has been recognized and widely adopted as a key indicator in urban environmental assessment ansari et al 2016 qiao et al 2018 li et al 2019 and should be one of the major parameters in hydrological models in urban areas ren et al 2020 another issue is that the hydrological link between impervious and pervious areas has not well been considered in runoff simulations due to the complexity of flow routing deng et al 2020 epps and hathaway 2018 despite this knowledge regarding the strong influence of impervious surface on surface flow formation in areas where runoff processes are based on hortonian law simple rainfall runoff models are still used blair et al 2012 these models are not able to accurately describe the complexity of runoff as response to rainfall especially for catchments with an heterogeneous distribution of impervious and pervious areas this is a complex problem because even in urbanized catchments natural areas can alter the response to rainfall on the other hand in suburban areas where lawns and other permeable landscapes may be common rainfall can saturate thin soils and produce overland flow which runs off quickly konrad and booth 2002 the dense network of ditches and culverts in cities then allows quick transport to nearby streams and rivers unfortunately the effect of impervious areas on rainfall runoff modeling for small and urbanized catchments has not been fully determined lei et al 2016 hydrological modeling of these catchments is an important tool for analyzing and managing the flood hazard but it requires an understanding of the areas contributing to runoff from the urban parts of the catchment birkinshaw et al 2021 in practice hydrological models may include soil moisture to correctly asses the direct runoff fidal and kjeldsen 2020 or consider high rise buildings to improve runoff predictions yoo et al 2021 for more complex physically based models cea et al 2010 showed that the dynamic wave model is able to predict the peak discharge and its arrival time as well as the shape of the outlet hydrograph while the diffusive wave model gives less accurate results in another example of a complex model perrin and bouvier 2004 used a distributed modeling approach that develops and generalizes the concept of the unit hydrograph to a grid cell structure in a mountainous urban catchment with physiographic heterogeneity and high variability of the rainfall one of the key considerations for modeling the hydrological phenomena not only in urban areas but also in rural catchments is the sensitivity of models to various parameters and methodological approaches sangati and borga 2009 examined the role of river network geometry on the averaging of space time rainfall and on simulated peak discharges after rescaling the rainfall fields to preserve rainfall volumes in small catchments they showed that increasing the resolution length may lead to a distorted geometry of the rainfall field with respect to the river network ballinas gonzález et al 2020 studied the storm water model management swmm and showed that the sensitivity of the parameters depends on the basin under study and on the effects of secondary interactions between the model parameters it was also shown that the most sensitive parameters in a simulation vary according to the storm and the accumulated precipitation saadi et al 2020 showed that gr4h and ihacres two conceptual and continuous models agreed less in reproducing the internal fluxes over the urbanized catchments than over the rural ones as it can be seen knowledge regarding rainfall runoff modeling in catchments characterized by a high percentage of urban cover is still lacking in particular although they can be valuable for representing complex urban hydrology sophisticated physically based models are not preferable in all cases firstly there is often a lack of data in urban catchments for the calibration of advanced models parameters gumindoga et al 2017 indeed the ungauged basin perspective in particular in urbanized catchments poses a challenge in the provision of accurate flood predictions fava et al 2020 secondly climate changes can influence the measured discharges that are used during the calibration process increasing the uncertainty of models one way to address the above issue is to develop a rainfall runoff model that does not present free parameters i e an inherently calibration free rainfall runoff model in reality very little research has been devoted towards developing calibration free hydrological models as it is generally believed that no hydrological model can perform reasonably well without calibration nag and biswal 2019 in their study nag and biswal 2019 argued that a calibration free rainfall runoff model could be used to predict flow duration curves in regions where observed discharge data are inadequate both quantitatively and qualitatively therefore it is very important to find solutions for modeling hydrological phenomena that can avoid the calibration process when the challenges noted above are present specifically approaches are needed to find balance between complex models that have many parameters and thus can generate high uncertainty in simulation and simple conceptual models that can easily describe crucial hydrological processes if simple rainfall runoff theories are to be preferred models including spatial heterogeneity of catchments parameters could be adopted like the hydrological models referred to as variable source area models blazkova and beven 1997 gioia et al 2014 szymczak and krężałek 2018 krężałek 2018 such models may balance the need for accurately representing the effects of urbanization while alleviating the need for extensive calibration one example of a simple rainfall runoff model that does not require a calibration process to estimate its parameters is eba4sub event based approach for small and ungauged basins piscopia et al 2015 petroselli and grimaldi 2018 petroselli et al 2020c eba4sub estimates the hydrograph shape and the related peak flow by employing the same input parameters of the well known rational formula the model has been fully adapted in uncontrolled catchments where agricultural and forest land cover dominate and is based on geographic information systems in doing so optimizing the topographic information contained in the digital elevation model dem indeed eba4sub is a simple kinematic model where the generic pixel velocity value can be calculated with specific equations developed mainly for natural areas that are based on local slope and land use the model was successfully employed in agricultural and forestry catchments in poland młyński et al 2018 2020a b slovakia petroselli et al 2019a vojtek et al 2019 bosnia and herzegovina petroselli et al 2019b and iran petroselli et al 2020a but its use in catchments with high percentage of impervious areas still has not been assessed considering all the aforementioned the overall novelty and objective of this study is to present a conceptual modification of the eba4sub rainfall runoff model to calculate peak discharges and hydrograph shape from catchments with high percentage of impervious area the name of the modified model is eba4sunurb event based approach for small and ungauged urban basins in eba4sunurb model two categories of areas are considered natural or pervious areas and impervious areas for each category of area different approaches for calculating excess rainfall are used it should be emphasized that so far there has been no research regarding the possibility of using the eba4sub model to determine design hydrographs in catchments with a high percentage of impervious areas in the present work eba4sub and eba4sunurb approaches are used to model runoff hydrographs and compare to those obtained using the nash model as a reference 2 study area the selected case study is the serafa river catchment located in the upper vistula basin poland fig 1 the main reason to choose the serafa river catchment is its significant percentage of impervious area such that the basin is characterized by a fast response to rainfall events flash floods are often observed as a consequence a large part of the krakow agglomeration downslope of the serafa river catchment has a high risk of floods the case study catchment area is 72 4 km2 and the length of the main watercourse is 12 7 km the average catchment slope is 3 1 the average river slope is 0 3 and the density of the river network is 0 6 km km 1 this information was derived using a digital elevation model dem provided by usgs united states geological survey with a grid resolution of about 25 m based on the hydrographic division map of poland 2010 and on the corine land cover 2018 database the following forms of land uses shown in fig 2 were identified together with the percentage of the catchment area respectively occupied discontinuous urban fabric 43 3 industrial or commercial unit 9 4 road and rail networks and associated land 2 8 dump sites 0 7 green urban areas 3 9 sport and leisure facilities 0 8 non irrigated arable land 8 7 pastures 8 1 complex cultivation patterns 5 1 land principally occupied by agriculture significant areas of natural vegetation 11 4 broad leaved forest 1 1 mixed forest 2 2 transitional woodland shrub 1 1 and water bodies 2 5 3 methods in this work the new approach eba4sunurb for rainfall runoff modeling in urban catchments was developed by modifying the original eba4sub model the calculations were performed for a 100 year return period as this was the flood management design storm for the local river basin authority the proposed approach is the combination of the original eba4sub with a newly conceived estimate named p4urb for excess rainfall that considers pervious and impervious areas the analysis was carried out in the following stages calculation of design rainfall calculation of excess rainfall determination of design hydrograph by eba4sub and eba4sunurb unfortunately the serafa river is ungauged so the calibration of the model s parameters and the classical verification of performance is not possible further all nearby catchments with similar characteristics to the serafa are ungauged so it is not possible to use observed discharges from other catchments thus the results from eba4sub and eba4sunurb were compared to the commonly used nash model based on cascade of linear reservoirs the nash model is recommended in poland for flood analysis in small and urban catchments banasik et al 2007 for instance design discharges from nash model were used to generate flood hazard zones in krakow area koncepcja 2011 3 1 calculation of design rainfall in this study it was assumed that the maximum flow with a specific frequency qt is caused by the occurrence of a rainfall with the same frequency viglione and blöschl 2008 the analysis was performed for the 100 year return period as noted above calculation of the design rainfall pt was performed by applying the log normal distribution the parameters were established by the maximum likelihood method based on an annual maximum daily rainfall time series from period 1971 2018 the log normal distribution is described as in the following hogg and craig 1978 f x 1 x ε α 2 π e x p 0 5 â ln x ε μ α 2 2 x p e x p μ α 2 e r f 2 1 p 1 ε where xp quantile of the theoretical log normal distribution ε lower string limit erf 2 1 p 1 gauss error function after determining the design rainfall the critical time was established it was assumed this corresponded to the duration of rainfall which causes the maximum peak in design hydrograph the depth of rainfall for the critical time was determined based on lambor s curvers młyński et al 2020b that allow to link rainfall daily values to rainfall values for different durations the same rainfall was assumed for each rainfall runoff model to allow comparison 3 2 nash model for the nash model the excess rainfall was calculated with the scs cn method usda 2004 in the scs cn method the excess rainfall depends on the category of soils land use and antecedent soil moisture all these factors were considered in the cn parameter estimation the amount of excess rainfall was calculated from the relationship xiao et al 2011 soulis and valiantzas 2012 młyński and wałęga 2020 usda 2004 p e p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s w h e n p 0 2 s 0 w h e n p 0 2 s where pe excess rainfall mm p total rainfall mm s maximum potential catchment retention mm the maximum potential retention of the catchment is directly related to the cn parameter ranging from 0 all rainfall becomes infiltration to 100 all rainfall becomes runoff and described by the equation s 25 4 1000 cn 10 the cn parameter was determined for the second moisture level amc ii firstly the cn was assessed for each type of land use and soil type without impervious area according to usda 2004 next the weighted value of cn was calculated taking the sum of each cn value multiplied by its fraction of the total sub catchment area wałęga and salata 2019 in the nash model the catchment is described as a cascade of n linear reservoirs with the retention k parameter of each reservoir the nash model is based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh which is the catchment reaction for a unitary and instantaneous excess rainfall the iuh is described by the following two parameters gamma function nash 1957 u t 1 k â γ n t k n 1 e x p t k where u t ordinates of iuh h 1 t time from the beginning of coordinate system h n number of linear reservoirs k retention parameter of each reservoir h γ n gamma function the characteristic values of iuh hydrograph are peak up time to peak tp and lag time lag that are connected with the model parameters n and k as tp n 1 k 6 lag n 1 k 7 up 1 k â γ n n 1 e x p n 1 n 1 where n number of linear reservoirs k retention parameter of each reservoir h 3 3 eba4sub model eba4sub model determines the runoff hydrograph using the digital elevation model dem of the catchment and the value of the cn parameter the excess rainfall was calculated based on the cn4ga procedure grimaldi et al 2013 this method consists of two stages in the first stage the cumulative excess rainfall is determined based on the scs cn method eq 3 in the second stage the temporal distribution of the excess rainfall within the event is determined using the green ampt equation q 0 t i t f o r t t p k s 1 δ θ δ h i t f o r t t p where q0 infiltration indicator mm h 1 tp ponding time h ks saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 i cumulative infiltration mm δθ change in soil water content between the initial value and the field saturated soil water content δh difference between the pressure head at the soil surface and the matric pressure head at the moving wetting front mm the solution of the equation 9 requires the calibration of the ks parameter the final calibrated value of ks is determined so that the for the cn4ga net rainfall is equal to the cumulative value provided from the scs cn method that is well known in literature to be correct only at event scale and not at sub daily scale moreover the cn4ga procedure is designed to preserve the ponding time information provided by the scs cn method in doing so ks loses its physical meaning and it becomes essentially a calibration parameter linked to cn the reason behind this methodology is that usually is much easier to assess cn based on land use and land cover information than to measure ks in the field for use in calculations after having estimated the amount of excess rainfall and its distribution the width function instantaneous unit hydrograph wfiuh is determined based on the following relationship grimaldi et al 2012 wfiuh t l c x v c x l h x v h x where lc lh hillslope and channel flow paths functions of dem cell respectively m vc vh runoff velocity for hillslope cells and flow channel cells m s 1 after defining wfiuh the final flood hydrograph q t m3 s 1 is determined described by the following relationship q t a 0 t w f i u h t τ p n τ d τ where a catchment area m2 t duration of rainfall s pn t excess rainfall determined by the cn4ga method m s 1 3 4 concept of the eba4sunurb model in the presented concept it was assumed that for impervious areas parking lots roads roofs and so on the net rainfall should be calculated independent from pervious areas in impervious areas identified via land cover data infiltration is not possible and lost rainfall is caused by depression storage in the serafa catchment we assumed that the impervious areas i e industrial or commercial units road and rail networks and or sport and leisure facilities are located throughout the catchment area and are separated by pervious area i e meadows pastures forests and arable area it was assumed that rainfall falls on impervious area where infiltration and depression retention are negligible and subsequently overflows on pervious area assumed that runoff will be calculated from the whole catchment the following procedure p4urb for modeling the runoff is proposed a catchment is divided into two categories pervious area p1 and impervious area p2 where rainfall outflows to area p1 it is a simplification of real situations where some impervious areas drain into one another and are routed directly to nearby streams these detailed analyses of connections between areas with different permeability are possible oi a small scale to prepare local projects for stormwater management in case where larger catchments are analyzed this approach can lead to too complicated models and the advantage with using these models is not too high in comparison to cost and time needed to perform calculations in the impervious areas the excess rainfall is not correctly calculated using the original scs cn method because the original value of the initial abstraction ratio equal to 0 20 usda 2004 is too high and thus runoff can be underestimated circumstance that may have serious consequences in terms of the underestimation of flood risk in these areas krajewski et al 2020 therefore in this concept impervious areas have a d2 depression storage that can occur after rainfall fills such depression storage so d2 is added to the total rainfall occurring on pervious areas depression storage of impervious areas can be calculated based on the following equation krzanowski and wałęga 2007 d2 0 77 jave 0 49 mm 12 where jave average slope of impervious areas m m 1 the total excess rainfall in eba4sunurb is calculated based on cn4ga method in the proposed eba4sub modification the input rainfall for cn4ga is assumed as total equivalent rainfall p calculated based on the following formula 13 p i p 1 i a c a p 2 i where p1 i is the sum of rainfall impulse for each δt mm p2 i is the sum of rainfall impulse for each δt minus d2 from eq 12 mm 14 aca a p 2 a p 1 where ap1 catchment area of category p1 km2 ap2 catchment area of category p2 km2 using this methodology the total equivalent rainfall is the sum of the total rainfall falling on pervious area plus the overland runoff from an impervious area that cannot be stored in depression storage in summary the following procedure eba4sunurb is proposed for hydrograph calculation in urban catchment 1 identification of ap1 and ap2 area based on land cover data 2 calculation of the precipitation p i based on p4urb procedure 3 calculation of the excess rainfall as combination of cn4ga and p4urb procedure cn in cn4ga is calculated only for pervious areas 4 determination of q t based on the wfiuh the cn4ga from p i was used to assess the excess precipitation and perform the convolution integral with wfiuh obtaining q t the critical rainfall duration was determined using a simulation procedure where different durations of rainfall events were assumed and the rainfall duration that caused the maximum peak discharge was selected the same critical time of rainfall was assumed for eba4sub and eba4sunurb models 3 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis for eba4sunurb was conducted using the coefficient of flexibility e which is expressed as wałęga et al 2014 e δ output δ input where δoutput changes in peak flows δinput changes in degree of surface sealing the analysis was performed by changing the degree of surface sealing by increments of 1 if e 1 then the parameter is flexible otherwise if e 1 then the parameter is inflexible 4 results and discussion 4 1 the critical rainfall duration in the first stage of analysis the design rainfall for 100 years return period was determined using log normal function theoretical distribution the results were presented in fig 3 based on these calculations the design rainfall for the return period of 100 years was 86 7 mm the use of a log normal distribution for calculating the design rainfall was supported by research conducted by młyński et al 2019 and it has been shown to be best suited to the empirical rainfall distribution pt the crucial parameter related to design rainfall is the critical duration which is defined as the time that yields the maximum peak flow of the runoff hydrograph for small and urban catchments the critical rainfall duration usually is assumed as the time of concentration meynink and cordery 1976 wałęga et al 2019 the relationship between rainfall duration and peak flows for the serafa catchment is presented in fig 4 the critical rainfall duration for the serafa catchment was 12 5 h a value that is not distant from the theoretic value 10 1 h estimated thanks to kirpich formula the rainfall depth for the critical rainfall duration was found to be 74 1 mm the amount of total rainfall ptot for return period 100 years was determined by reducing the daily amount calculated by log normal distribution to the amount corresponding to a critical rainfall duration equal to 12 5 h the relatively long critical rainfall duration is caused mostly by the relatively high catchment area 72 4 km2 and by the spatial distribution of land use where despite the fact that main land uses in the catchment are impermeable and semi impermeable areas large areas are also covered by agricultural lands furthermore the upper parts of catchment are forested areas a configuration that may lead to a longer response to rainfall events rogger et al 2017 it should be emphasized that determining the critical rainfall duration plays a crucial role in determining the design hydrograph as shown by the study conducted by krvavica and rubinić 2020 this study showed that the method utilized for determining the design rainfall and critical rainfall duration has a significant impact on the flood modeling results and thus can lead to an over or underestimation of peak flow confirming the results obtained by gericke and smithers 2014 the assumption that critical rainfall duration is equal to time of concentration is of course a simplification for instance for the flood hazard assessment the critical rainfall duration is related to both maximum peak flow and maximum volume nguyen et al 2010 moreover in complex and urbanized catchments the rainfall runoff processes are highly non linear and strongly depend on antecedent moisture conditions a circumstance that complicates the prediction of critical rainfall duration schmid 1997 4 2 excess rainfall in order to apply the investigated rainfall runoff models the excess rainfall depth was determined using methods scs cn cn4ga and the cn4ga p4urb combination the results of these calculations are summarized in table 1 while fig 5 shows the excess rainfall and the design rainfall hyetographs and finally fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of direct runoff calculated using scs cn cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb the higher value of cn calculated for the scs cn and cn4ga methods was caused by including all types of land cover in the calculation pervious and impervious areas in case of cn4ga p4urb cn was only calculated for pervious areas where the infiltration process occurs chen and young 2006 the results show that time of excess rainfall calculated by the scs cn method was almost 3 5 times longer than for cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb in fig 5 it can be seen that for the scs cn method the excess rainfall is distributed in a longer time in comparison to cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb as shown in grimaldi et al 2013 this behavior can be explained by different assumptions in the distribution of excess rainfall between the scs cn and cn4ga methods in case of scs cn due the employed empirical formula a long sequence of excess rainfall in the final part of the event is generated the cn4ga procedure which incorporates the green ampt infiltration equation better presents time distribution of excess rainfall depending on change of rainfall rate during the event the shape of design hyetograph may affect the culmination of design hydrograph młyński et al 2018 and petroselli et al 2020b have identified that the eba4sub model is sensitive to changes in the design hyetograph shape usually the highest peak flows have been determined using dvwk method młyński et al 2018 because the serafa river is ungauged the same design rainfall hyetograph was used in calculations the calculated direct runoff values ranged from 3 8 mm to 74 1 mm with the smaller values corresponding to areas with a small cn and vice versa the direct runoff equal to 3 8 mm is related to the portions of the catchment consisting of discontinuous urban fabric where are located soils having low runoff potential and high infiltration rates even when thoroughly wetted the highest value of direct runoff was found for water courses generally the highest direct runoff was observed in northern part of catchment where impervious areas are located for the scs cn and cn4ga methods the direct runoff from impermeable areas ranged from 38 6 mm to 48 5 mm the different values of direct runoff in these areas are caused by variable values of the cn parameter for land uses that are primarily impermeable from 85 to 90 in the cn4ga p4urb method it was assumed that for impermeable areas the rainfall first filled the depression storage the remaining part of the rainfall is then transformed into overland runoff the depression storage calculated based on eq 12 was equal only to 2 54 mm slightly higher than the value reported by skotnicki and sowiński 2015 in an urban catchment in poznań poland the authors calculated a 1 5 mm depression storage value in an urban area that was estimated after calibration using a swmm model as noted above the impervious areas are not included in cn under the cn4ga p4urb approach leading to a lower cn than that calculated for cn4ga or scs cn thus excess rainfall in cn4ga p4urb is higher than in other models table 1 for the cn4ga p4urb method the direct runoff calculated for impermeable areas 71 5 mm was almost 40 higher than average values from scs cn and cn4ga approaches a similar methodology for modeling overland flow formation in impervious areas is utilized in swmm behrouz et al 2020 rossman and huber 2016 4 3 peak discharge and outflow hydrograph in the next stage of this study the design hydrographs were determined using the nash model the eba4sub model and the proposed approach eba4sunurb table 2 summarizes the characteristics of design hydrographs while fig 7 presents their shapes substantial differences were noted between the methodologies as described below because the catchment is relatively flat it is assumed that dem with grid resolution 25 m is sufficient for use in the eba4sub and eba4sunrb calculations in cases where more fine scale dem resolution is available the slope of watercourse and travel time could be more precisely determined and thus velocity of runoff could change the obtained values specifically a smaller pixel dimension like 1 m or 5 m should be used in catchments with higher slopes however higher resolution dems also introduce errors for example grimaldi et al 2007 reported that the number of depressions is inversely proportional to the dem resolution pits depressions can be generated while interpolating dems as part of the process for changing grid spacing resampling a dem to increase the resolution downscaling leads to more pits while decreasing the resolution upscaling reduces the total number of pits but the total percentage area covered by pits increases also the resolution of dem has not shown a strong influence on peak discharges for return periods greater than 5 years petroselli et al 2019a based on the results eba4sub and eba4sunurb provided higher peak flows than nash model with the highest value generated by eba4sunurb the peak discharge from eba4sunurb were 52 higher than from nash model and 20 higher than from eba4sub higher peak flows determined by eba4sub and eba4sunurb in comparison to the nash model are due to the fact that both the models take into account the surface runoff velocity via the wfiuh formulation the analyzed catchment is strongly urbanized circumstance that increases the surface flow velocity therefore the catchment response to rainfall described by eba4sub and eba4sunurb models is faster than for the nash model additionally eba4sub and eba4sunurb discriminate river and hillslope dem pixels to calculate velocity of outflow and thus the catchment response time hillslope velocities are defined using a spatially distributed empirical formula based on the specific pixel information provided by dem and corine data specifically slope and land use conversely in the river network the runoff velocity is assumed constant following the leopold and maddock s findings 1953 that for small basins the increase in the downstream channel velocity is balanced by changes in channel width depth roughness and slope the river network velocity was estimated considering the basin lag time specifically we impose that the projection on the time axis of the median point of the wfiuh that represents the travel time distribution is equal to the basin lag time that is estimated as 60 of the concentration time tc the proposed approach has the ability to consider that in different parts of the catchment the hillslope velocity has different values from pixel to pixel as reported by grimaldi et al 2010 higher velocities usually characterize low contributing area cells upslope areas and the lower velocities are distributed in high contributing areas downslope areas as a result valley bottoms are found to play a major role for the travel time estimation impacting the receding limb of the hydrologic response in the upper part of catchments the dem resolution should be higher to more precisely determine the flow velocity in valleys dem resolution could be smaller indeed the presence of the drainage network can determine a faster time response of catchments jung et al 2017 conversely the nash model does not discriminate river network and hillslopes the disadvantage of such a model structure is that the representation of physical processes is often too crude and the scales of measurements for many hydrologic parameters are incompatible with the scales used in models yu 2015 for this reason the nash model cannot reflect the spatial heterogeneity of catchment topography for eba4sub and eba4sunurb models the surface flow velocity is calculated for each pixel of the dem allowing the characterization of the runoff dynamics for the whole catchment conversely the nash model describes the catchment as a cascade of linear reservoirs whereby parameters are determined from empirical formulas sikorska et al 2012 karabová et al 2012 similar results were reported by młyński et al 2020a where hydrographs determined by the eba4sub scs uh and snyder models were compared młyński et al 2020a also showed higher peak discharge values for eba4sub the differences were 46 and 40 compared to the scs uh and snyder models respectively it should be emphasized that scs uh and snyder are lumped models where the topography information is generalized despite the large differences between peak flows the volume of runoff for the nash model and eba4sub is similar while for eba4sunurb the volume is larger this is due to how the excess rainfall is calculated in cn4ga p4urb approach as described above the flow duration as determined by the nash model is three times longer than the corresponding estimated by eba4sub and eba4sunurb the flow duration is 46 h for nash model and 12 for the other two models the shorter flow duration is the result of the distribution of excess rainfall determined by cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb 2 5 h in the nash model the scs cn method was used to determine excess rainfall and the duration is 8 5 h therefore the excess rainfall determined by cn4ga and cn4ga p4urb is concentrated in a shorter time this is reflected in the design hydrograph analyzing the slenderness coefficients it was concluded that for the hydrograph determined by the nash model the value is greater than 1 0 conversely in eba4sub and eba4sunurb a value smaller than 1 0 is obtained this indicates that for the nash model the flood volume increases until the peak flow and then decreases slowly in eba4sub and eba4sunurb the flood volume in the rising limb of the hydrograph is larger than in the falling limb based on obtained results we can conclude that the proposed approach combining the eba4sub model with a new method for calculating the excess rainfall in urban areas may be an alternative to the nash model for determining the design hydrograph in urban catchments in particular the proposed model is better equipped to represent the flash floods of urban watersheds than the nash model it should also be emphasized that eba4sub model is a parsimonious model in terms of input parameters and reduces the user s subjectivity the model simplicity means that the proposed approach can be fully used by practitioners e g for determining flood zones or designing hydrotechnical infrastructures furthermore the nash model commonly used in urban catchments has some limitations for instance the model s parameters can by determined by various methods sikorska and banasik 2010 and the choice of method affects the obtained results nonetheless the nash model is still commonly applied in urban catchments banasik et al 2007 kołodziejczyk 2017 conversely the parameters of the eba4sub model are determined directly on the basis of physiographic catchment characteristics and in doing so preclude the subjectivity of their determination this plays a crucial role especially in situations where different users aim to determine the design hydrograph for the same catchment and with the same input data in short eba4sub provides similar results when it is used by different practitioners it should also be emphasized that data availability may limit the model selection for that reason simple models are commonly used because for smaller catchments the characteristics are unknown or too expensive to determine sitterson et al 2017 summarizing the proposed approach is based on a lumped procedure different land categories are used to calculate net rainfall from pervious areas the cn4ga procedure is used whereby land uses without impervious areas are used to calculate cn parameter and subsequently net rainfall for impervious areas like roofs roads and parking lots where infiltration does not occur the lost rainfall is assumed as depression storage we identified impervious areas and pervious areas based on land use data from corine land cover information the runoff from impervious areas is added to net runoff from pervious area and input to the kinematic component of model width function based instantaneous unit hydrograph that is a lumped approach 4 4 sensitivity analysis to further test the proposed approach a sensitivity analysis was conducted the sensitivity analysis consisted of calculating the coefficient of flexibility e output values peak flows by varying input values degree of surface sealing the results are presented in figs 8 and 9 the degree of soil sealing is important considering the current trend of land planning in krakow area and throughout the world where permeable areas like arable land and grassland will likely be replaced by impervious areas the results presented in fig 8 indicate that 1 change of degree of surface sealing u produces a change of peak flows of about 2 and similar changes for hydrograph s volume the peak flows increase linearly as the degree of surface sealing was varied from 5 to 25 the results are similar to the ones achieved by wałęga et al 2019 that indicated a similar rise in peak discharges with an increase of impervious areas in sudoł dominkanski another second highly urbanized catchment inside the krakow agglomeration for the serafa river the lowest peak flow was 51 85 m3 s 1 and the highest was 77 65 m3 s 1 it should be emphasized that the lowest peak flow from eba4sunurb for u equal 5 was similar to the peak flow determined by eba4sub such results indicate that eba4sub may be used in catchments where impervious area percentage is up to 5 when the catchment has a greater impervious area percentage the eba4sunurb is likely a better choice the results presented in fig 9 show that the calculated coefficient of flexibility e is ranging from 0 08 to 0 63 in the sensitivity analysis because the obtained values were smaller than 1 0 it means that eba4sunurb is inflexible to the change of u value 5 conclusions urban catchments where the majority of people live are very sensitive areas where any change of runoff might influence dramatically water balance retention and flood risk because of that the aim of this study was to develop a new approach for design hydrograph formulation in urban catchments the proposed approach is a combination of the already existing eba4sub model and a new method for calculating excess rainfall the model estimates by default some important parmeters used for its application this information can be changed by user if more specific data are available leaving the model flexible to be used in either ungauged and gauged basins the first parameter is related to the net rainfall estimation and the second is related to the runoff propagation and is determined using the wfiuh framework in this framework the surface runoff velocity estimation is crucial as a result the new model named eba4sunurb for urban catchment is proposed considering the obtained results it was concluded that eba4sunurb can be a very good alternative to the commonly used nash model in urban catchments because it more reasonably represents the influence of impervious areas on runoff formation and thus provides significantly different peak discharge and flood volume estimates moreover the shape of the design hydrograph in the proposed method is more typical for urban catchments in comparison to the nash model an important benefit of the eba4sunurb model is that it is particularly useful in ungauged catchments because all its input parameters are calculated by default by the model based on more readily available catchment characteristics such as topography land use and soil data and thus does not explicitly require a calibration process of course the input parameters of the model can be more precisely calculated or taken into account when a gauged catchment is investigated finally a sensitivity analysis showed that eba4sunurb is inflexible in terms of degree of impervious of surface the main limitation of eba4sunurb is its inability to consider the role of storm sewer systems during the flood generation thus at the moment the model can be promoted for use by hydrologists aiming to perform preliminary studies for flood protection or design hydraulics structures in case of more detailed and specific analysis process based models should be recommended the future research for developing eba4sunurb model would be aim to 1 test the proposed approach in gauged catchments with high impervious cover percentages 2 include a synthetic time series of rainfall to generate continuous runoff and 3 update the model by including the sewer systems contribution credit authorship

3624,when transboundary basins are developed in poor regions where freshwater resources are fully committed it becomes important to design economically sustainable action plans to address existing poverty especially in responding to mounting evidence of climate change and population growth increasing competition over shared water resources as well as climate water stress has attracted research efforts internationally addressing the benefits and costs of establishing water sharing treaties despite this ongoing interest few peer reviewed works have investigated water development and use patterns that could produce economic gains for all parties from establishing transboundary water sharing agreements this work develops an approach to address the gap by formulating and applying a basin scale hydro economic optimization model of west africa s volta river basin the work analyzes the effects of a prospective multilateral water allocation and hydropower trade agreement on the size sign and distribution of basin wide economic benefits the model includes two new large storage reservoirs five water use purposes and two climate water supply scenarios with and without a water sharing treaty from that it assesses the net economic benefit maximizing patterns of water use with and without the treaty results show a pareto improving outcome is achievable for all riparian countries from new storage capacity in the basin for which at least one country is better and none is worse off this improvement is achievable with a multilateral water sharing treaty implemented with power trading among the six basin countries results indicate that all basin countries have the potential to secure significant economic gains from additional hydropower production with the treaty under its implementation upstream countries would reduce agricultural water use in exchange for higher valued hydropower benefits under the climate stressed low flow scenario despite potential benefits that are shareable from negotiation practical implementation of such a treaty will require considerable diplomatic skill patience and effort keywords river basin optimization policy poverty

construction of a host of smaller schemes as a more effective approach to improve food production in the semi arid areas van de giesen et al 2005 however there is growing interest in expanding large irrigation areas supplied by existing large multiple use dams as well as building new multipurpose dams with significant irrigation components in the upstream more arid areas six large dams with

transboundary water management among the six riparian countries has started in earnest only recently with the creation of the volta basin authority vba which began operation in 2009 meanwhile increased coordination has occurred on a bilateral basis between burkina faso and ghana although weakly coordinated diplomacy has characterized the basin historically the vba and its six riparian states hope to form an institutional cooperative framework known as the volta water charter to guide the basin s future water development and use for which a draft was published in 2018 world bank 2018 the ongoing search for equitable use and sustainable management of the basin s freshwater resources raises the need for workable implementations to meet that coordinating goal one of the ways to deal with ongoing challenges from climate water stress growing water demands for increasing population and environmental sustainability is to establish and implement multilateral agreements on water allocations un water 2008 sadoff and grey 2005 sadoff and grey 2002 the contribution made by this paper is to address this ongoing search by building testing developing applying and interpreting a hydroeconomic model that guides discovery of a more equitable and sustainable management of the basin s freshwater resources that contribution is described in more detail below despite making several incremental contributions to the water resources literature this study has limitations from a scarcity of research grade hydrologic data challenges of rigorously accounting for benefits of flood damages reduced and difficulties of accounting for existing power imbalances in the basin these limitations are discussed in more detailed in the discussion part of the paper below 1 2 previous work

closed basin with high outflow to sinks in high flow seasons and reduced flows to sinks in low flow seasons obeng asiedu 2004 in this basin it has been believed for many years that new water storage infrastructure development to reallocate water and its services among seasons years and locations could improve the total economic benefits produced by the river system satti et al 2015 keller et al

number of water uses several integrated policy analytic dimensions such as large upstream storage capacity development and increased consumptive water use by other four upstream riparians benin côte d ivoire mali and togo remain untouched to date some studies assert that population growth and climate change will emerge to increase consumptive water use of burkina faso as well as four other upstream countries higher upstream water use could have adverse consequences on power generation capacities of ghana with 98 of basin electricity production 71 produced by power plants at locations close to the basin s outlet mul et al 2018 bekoe et al 2016 bharati et al 2008 rodgers et al 2007 van de giesen et al 2001 van edig et al 2001 in light of the gaps described above this work builds applies and interprets an integrated hydro economic optimization model to discover a prospective mutually beneficial agreement consisting of structured water allocation and hydropower trading in the volta basin in light of recent additional large storage capacity expansion we refer to this water allocation and power trading arrangement as a treaty throughout the rest of the paper strictly speaking it is not a treaty as conventionally used in diplomatic circles the paper s original contribution comes from its formulation of a hydro economic optimization model to investigate the impacts of a prospective agreement in which the five upstream countries supply historical flow patterns to the farthest downstream country ghana in exchange for discounted electricity prices and high quantities of power supplied it takes into account two new upstream large storage capacities on potential system wide economic benefits that result from changes in the quantity of water flows location and timing the paper investigates the impacts of a prospective treaty that accounts for five water management purposes as well as two climate water supply scenarios 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area additional details occupying an area of about 409 000 km2 across varying portions of the six west african countries the volta basin extends from its headwaters in southeast mali southwest north and central burkina faso and northwest benin down to southeastern ghana over a distance of about 1 850 km before draining into the gulf of guinea figs 1 and 2 burkina faso contains most of the drainage area at 42 followed by ghana with 40 5 togo with 6 4 mali benin and côte d ivoire with 4 2 3 8 and 3 1 respectively kolavalli and williams 2016 percentages of land areas drained by the basin are 63 for burkina faso 70 for ghana 47 3 for togo 15 2 for benin 1 2 for mali and 3 9 for côte d ivoire barry et al 2005 five major tributaries contribute to headwater supplies to the volta basin system fig 2 the lower volta tributaries 17 mainly in ghana the oti river 37 the white volta nakambe and red volta nazinon rivers 23 and the black volta mouhoun river 23 goes 2005 the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz greatly influences the basin s climate generating a uni modal rainy season in the upstream section and bi modal rainy seasons in the downstream portion basin flows highly depend on rainfall and display high levels of variability in space and time sylla et al 2016 andreini et al 2000 a south north rainfall gradient characterizes the basin with annual rainfall greater than 1 100 mm in the south between 900 and 1 100 mm in the middle and less than 500 mm in the north mul et al 2016 sylla et al 2016 rodgers et al 2007 about 9 of the basin s rainfall becomes runoff with the other 91 destined for evapotranspiration seepage and other loss sood et al 2013 rodgers et al 2007 potential average open water annual evaporation ranges between 1 350 to 1 500 mm 1 501 to 2 000 mm and 2 001 to 2 500 mm in the south middle and north respectively mul et al 2015 barry et al 2005 van edig et al 2002 the rainfall and evaporation patterns imply more water scarcity in the upstream reaches of the watershed than the south 2 2 data sources this study used observed long term average wet and dry seasonal flows into the basin at the headwaters from the grdc s global runoff database grdc 2019 representing the scenario of historically observed flow reflecting stochastic variation around observed long term average discharge an alternative scenario climate induced low flow represents climate change impacts resulting from a 30 reduction in basin wide mean flows based on rainfall runoff models of climate change predictions where 10 reduction in rainfall lead to about 30

water supply irrigation farming hydroelectric power production recreation and river bank overflow flood damage control in future work we plan to incorporate commercial and industrial uses into our model both of which are comparatively small scale uses as of 2021 bekoe et al 2016 irrigation benefits come from national farm income which is mostly subsistence farming in this region by subsistence agriculture we mean these farmers grow food crops mostly to meet the nutrition needs of their families on small landholdings while the economic principles for valuing subsistence farming are the same as for commercially oriented agriculture food prices are more difficult to measure as are costs of production posel and rogan 2016 despite measurement difficulties farm income remains measured as crop prices multiplied by crop yields minus the production cost to find net returns per unit land those net returns are multiplied by farmland in production to find total farm income for each crop each country each climate scenario and each treaty plan domestic water use consumer surplus barreca et al 2016 armstrong et al 2009 gallai et al 2009 su 2007 brynjolfsson et al 2003 whitehead et al 2000 hausman and newey 1995 morey et al 1993 accounts for benefits from domestic water supply hydroelectricity economic benefits originate from the consumer and producer surpluses from production sale and use of power recreation benefit comes from the use of reservoirs such as boating fishing and other related tourism activities which depend on storage volume it is valued as its incremental benefit from the recreational value of lakes multiplied by reservoir storage volume raised to a power less than one reflecting the degree of responsiveness of recreational benefit to each reservoir s storage amount a flood control benefit function tracks flood damage from those that would have otherwise occurred without the new storage flood damages are calculated for any flood stage levels times the amount of flood damages associated with that flood stage higher flood stage levels cause higher flood damages typically a nonlinear relationship the flood stage by being partly controllable from upstream reservoir development and or management is unknown in advance our model solves for it as part of the overall optimization program in summary our investigation uses economic principles to address the water poverty nexus economic efficiency and sustainability llopis albert et al 2018 basharat and tariq 2014 as discussed next 2 3 1 water poverty nexus by establishing links between technical biological legal and policy sciences to address water poverty a more efficient and just solution for water development and supply can be informed fankhauser and tepic 2007 sullivan et al 2003 sullivan 2002 our investigation aims to discover methods to address poverty in the basin by safeguarding de fraiture et al 2010 namara et al 2010 hanjra et al 2009 khan et al 2009 an adequate quantity of water necessary to sustain economic welfare hutton 2013 for five water uses those five uses are domestic water supply irrigation farming hydroelectric power production recreation and riverbank overflow flood damage control our work implements a view of distributional justice rawls 1999 to address the water poverty nexus for water resources in the volta basin by employing several mathematical constraints safe access for domestic sector withdrawals are effectively constrained by a very low price elasticity of demand for which large price changes have small impacts on domestic water use briscoe 2011 briscoe 1997 our model is implemented to ensure that all water uses are met at a minimal level in the basin s upstream dry areas including areas with the new storage capacities as described in more detail in this paper s appendices a b and c our model implements simplified seasonal minimum environmental flow requirements that mimic the native flow pattern mul and gao 2016 to ensure the efficient management of new upstream dams and protect ecosystems dependent on freshwater and water dependent local culture despite the lack of reliable research grade data on minimum requirements the target flows implemented in our model enable us to account for the benefits of water use forgone by upstream users 2 3 2 economic efficiency our investigation assesses water allocation options for the five purposes described above its aim is to discover maximum economic benefits to all water users consistent with available hydrologic technical economic financial environmental and institutional constraints the model is mathematically constrained to assure that each riparian country in total receives at least as large an overall multi sector economic benefit with the treaty and dam as without them briscoe 2011 a mathematical framework is attached as appendix a the complete gams code is attached in appendix b permitting a complete replication of this paper s results for those with access to the gams software 2 3 3 sustainability achieving sustainability requires lasting outcomes our model implements water development and operations that balance water use for human purposes while respecting to the extent possible the natural functioning of water dependent ecosystems including maintenance of wildlife habitat wetlands and indigenous streamflow dependent culture water for domestic use is based on urban population growth at between 2 and 3 percent per year depending on the historical period of record the model accounts for lower bounds on the sustainable use of water resources in addition to sustained ecosystem resilience and stability in the operation of the new and existing dams with water treaty allocations that account for ecosystem performance in addition a sustainability goal is implemented in our model for the basin s reservoirs with constraints requiring the reservoirs to return to at least their starting level by the last season and last year of the 20 year time horizon requiring reservoirs to return to their initial period ward et al 2019 avoids depleting storage volumes in the last period effectively ensuring water availability for future generations 2 3 4 policy goals several goals guided the development of our model structure economic efficiency o policies will promote economically high productivity and limit low valued uses especially when water scarcity increases for instance water withdrawal at a particular time and location is more economically productive if the use value at that time and place is larger than the value of withdrawing the same river water at another place or time o new storage plans are assessed to see if the movement of water in space and time can generate increases in the economic value of water compared to the added cost of building the storage capacity to assess opportunities for pareto improvement our analysis sought to discover plans for which no riparian is worse off and at least one is better off with a treaty compared to the base policy without a treaty habteyes et al 2015 locally relevant plans the choice of our policy scenarios was also informed by locally formulated elements in the volta basin water charter developed by the basin s stakeholders which states that among all the different types of water use in the basin no particular use shall be given priority over the others however should competing uses of water prevent all the requirements from being met special attention shall be paid to the basic needs of human beings notwithstanding state parties may by mutual agreement set an order of priority among the different types of use of the basin s water resources state parties shall enter into bilateral and multilateral water sharing agreements provided that such agreements comply with the present water charter and that the volta basin authority vba is duly informed of their content world bank 2018 pp 19 20 guided by these policy goals the model tracks hydrological and economic outcomes in each of the riparian countries for each of two policy scenarios policy scenario 1 labelled 1 sto dev wo treaty this label reflects water use patterns that would occur under additional storage development and associated power production without a treaty it is implemented with a system optimization that permits additional storage capacity expansion and power production no trading of the added power production is permitted and no treaty constrains water sharing among the six countries policy scenario 2 labelled 2 sto dev wi treaty this label reflects water use patterns that would occur under additional storage development that would occur with a treaty it reflects a system optimization considering the additional storage capacity expansion with the agreement in place with the water sharing treaty implemented the upstream countries are required to deliver historical average flows to the downstream riparian ghana in exchange for hydropower if the added benefits economically justify the added costs under the treaty new power production and power trading imports and exports occurs but historical water delivery requirements must occur at the relevant international border stream gauges the classical gains from trade are reaped arkolakis et al 2012 bernard et al 2007 besley 1995 krugman 1981 in which the exporting country earns higher incomes than the income produced by using all the produced power for domestic production the importing country secures power at a cheaper cost displaced income than they can supply it domestically this water sharing arrangement has historical precedent as only one example these principles were used to implement the celebrated rio grande compact mix et al 2012 flanigan and haas 2008 ward et al 2007 hill 1974a under that agreement signed in 1938 three us states colorado new mexico and texas agreed to divide the waters under it the states agreed to divide then future flows based on historical flow and use patterns adjusted by natural runoff at selected locations in the basin that had occurred prior to that time that compact whose history is described elsewhere hill 1974b added certainty to future economic development in the region by allowing and encouraging future infrastructure developments in the basin like additional storage in a region where surface water supplies continue to be highly variable in fact additional storage has been built encouraged by the economic development occurring because of the greater predictability of flow rights and responsibilities for each of the three states ward 2013 the text of the rio grande compact is currently posted on a us bureau of reclamation webpage us bureau of reclamation 2021 a similarly principled agreement has the potential to promote organized future developments in the volta basin among other elements it would require a six country commission of some kind to enforce such a water sharing agreement in much the same way as the rio grande compact commission has operated in the us since the original 1938 signing of the compact this would assure all states are meeting their agreed treaty water delivery requirements 2 4 integrated basin scale framework this study defines the economic value of water as the total economic value loomis et al 2000 generated by water within the volta river system the sum of all benefits minus costs to the riparian countries the physical interdependencies of the basin s water use produce economically important positive and negative externalities thus we analyzed the whole volta basin as an interdependent integrated unit our dynamic model integrates the basin s hydrologic economic agronomic institutional and environmental dimensions for the investigation of policy choices with a time step consisting of two seasons per year for a twenty year period the optimization framework seeks and finds basin wide net economic benefits maximizing seasonal water allocation patterns over countries years and seasons in present value terms from the earlier described five uses we applied the gams optimization package and its modeling capabilities to the volta watershed while giving special consideration to regional and local conditions the model structure contains 62 water diversion points two crop types and 13 storage capacities with seven power plants the distribution of locations of basin water withdrawal is 18 in burkina faso two in côte d ivoire two in benin two in togo two in mali and 36 in ghana for which the major ones are shown in fig 2 there are 17 domestic residential water supply areas and two crop types vegetables and cereals grown in 45 farm areas supplied by 13 reservoirs multipurpose and single with over 90 million m3 of storage volume for which 20 gauging stations track stream flows the model is comprehensive in scope bazrkar et al 2013 more so than a smaller scale earlier work by the authors investigating opportunities for economic improvement in the same basin baah kumi and ward 2020 the model determines the values of endogenous unknown variables that maximize economic benefits including water allocations to domestic areas irrigated agriculture irrigated land in production storage levels in reservoirs flood damages avoided dam head turbine flows hydroelectricity generation quantity and price of electricity produced and traded 3 results 3 1 overview all volta basin countries carry the potential to secure significant aggregate economic welfare gains from hydroelectricity generation with a treaty compared to without it under both historically observed and climate stressed flow scenarios for each climate scenario and treaty arrangement we wrote the model code to maximize total economic welfare summed over sectors and years while respecting hydrologic constraints given by flows at the headwaters under the with treaty arrangement deliveries to the border gauge of each country are mathematically constrained to replicate historical delivery patterns so the model results come from maximizing total net economic benefits while respecting historical delivery patterns to each downstream country the basin wide hydropower benefits from added storage capacities harnessed by the two new dams with an agreement show considerable increase those power benefits with the agreement increase by 37 compared to the same without the agreement for historically observed flows it increases by a more modest 36 if the climate induced lower flows would occur a multilateral water and power trade agreement carries the potential to improve basin wide water allocation and use efficiency by increasing electricity access as well as promote a reliable cost efficient power supply with such an agreement ghana which sometimes has faced a national power surplus attended by partly unused power assets can put all its hydropower assets in the basin to beneficial use while securing historical flows from upstream countries selling that power to others at a higher price than its domestic marginal value in use in ghana these results illustrate the classical gains from trade from exporting surpluses compared to using it with less economic efficiency domestically which has been developed in the international trade literature for many years bekchanov et al 2015b garfinkel et al 2015 grafton and horne 2014 grafton et al 2012 rigby et al 2010 heaney et al 2006 calatrava and garrido 2005 hearne and easter 1997 the improvement in storage capacity in the basin from operation of burkina faso s smd on the mouhoun river as well as the presence and operation of ghana s pmd on the nakambe river with an agreement carries the potential to produce a pareto improving outcome habteyes et al 2015 mishra et al 2012 dombrowsky 2009 muñoz piña et al 2008 for which no country is worse off and at least one is better off elevated storage capacity in the basin through the smd and the pmd offers the opportunity for expanded irrigation farmland in burkina faso and ghana by improving access to irrigation water and reducing flood damages the value of irrigation for burkina faso and ghana increases with timely application of water to dry season irrigated farming resulting from the storage regulating capacities of the smd and the pmd 3 2 gauged flows table 2 presents optimized river discharges by riparian country sub catchment stream gauge water availability scenario treaty agreement and season because of space constraints 20 year average gauged stream flows are displayed for each gauge detailed predicted optimized flows for each season for the 20 years are obtainable on request the optimized river flows are shown for twenty gauges on the main river and important tributaries throughout the volta watershed fig 2 gauges of regional interest on the borders of burkina faso and ghana 3rd 4th 6th and 11th ghana and togo 9th as shown in fig 2 and table 2 showing how water flows from the five upstream countries into ghana the figure illustrates impact of the upstream countries water withdrawals and use on the downriver reaches all affecting water availability to ghana table 2 presents key findings on changes in water quantity location and timing due to the presence and the operation of the two new dams smd and the pmd in the basin s middle region the table shows system wide streamflow interdependencies among countries and water use sectors optimized operation of existing lower volta basin large dams akosombo and kpong will be affected by flow reductions due to the construction of the additional large upriver storage capacities and water withdrawals for extending the scope of areas under irrigation without the treaty however with a treaty higher optimized flows to the lower basin dams would occur table 2 also shows that optimized dry season flows are increased due to increased storage capacities but flows increase more with a treaty agreement that effectively allocates the resulting additional flows with increased economic efficiency gauged stream flows influenced by optimized operation of all dams see larger changes in dry seasons than wet seasons for instance due to the construction of burkina faso s smd optimized flows into ghana s bui reservoir about 559 miles 900 km downstream of smd measured at gauge 4 would fall in wet seasons and increase in dry seasons also the biggest lake in the basin ghana s lake volta located near the basin s outlet to the sea is optimized to be significantly impacted by the operation of the two new middle volta basin dams optimized gauged flows into lake volta measured at gauge 18 from the black volta and white volta rivers and other lower volta tributaries as well as the oti river significantly fall in the wet seasons and increase in the dry seasons however lower flows would be experienced at gauge 18 especially under the climate induced low flow scenario without the treaty agreement climate change will not only reduce upriver countries water availability but will also increase their consumptive water use since rain fed agricultural water use will be negatively impacted by reduced rainfall table 2 also reveals that both new as well as existing dams will heavily regulate system wide flows our model predicts that the new storage capacities will reallocate the volta basin waters between seasons so that benefits are optimized while ensuring that upper and middle basin water users receive at least as much as before that is they would receive as much domestic water supply irrigation water use hydropower production and recreation economic benefits with the treaty condition compared to without the treaty condition while respecting key hydrologic institutional and environmental constraints 3 3 irrigation table 3 presents optimized irrigated farmland and water use by riparian state sub catchment crop treaty agreement and water availability scenario we first describe irrigated farmland and water use of burkina faso a headwater country with 42 of basin s land area under the historically observed flow scenario that country is forecasted to produce 43 870 ha of cereal crops and 28 980 ha of vegetable crops per season using optimized seasonal averages of 361 14 million m3 and 180 35 million m3 of water from the river system with the treaty agreement optimized irrigated farmland and water use are reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario without the treaty with even more reduction in water use especially for cereal crops with the treaty irrigation water use and farmland of the other four upriver riparian states with 17 5 of the basin s land area are also described for benin s cereal crop production under the historically observed flow scenario an optimized average of 95 68 million m3 per season et would be used for 10 500 ha per season irrespective of the treaty agreement however with climate induced low flow irrigation water use and land in production would be reduced even more with the treaty agreement côte d ivoire is forecasted to optimally use an average of 168 19 million m3 per season for 18 360 ha of rice irrespective of the treaty agreement mali and togo are also estimated to use optimized seasonal averages of 101 25 and 111 60 million m3 to irrigate 11 300 and 12 400 ha of rice irrespective of the policy configuration however like benin the countries irrigation water use and farmlands are predicted to fall under climate water stress and even further with the treaty policy cereals would be the first to drop out of production in a water stress situation since cereals are a lower valued crop at the margin compared to vegetable crops irrigation land and water use for ghana the only downriver riparian is predicted to remain unchanged irrespective of the treaty agreement configuration especially under the climate induced low flow scenario under the historically observed flow scenario ghana is forecasted to use an optimized seasonal average of 379 71 and 123 42 million m3 of water to grow 44 660 and 22 350 ha of cereal and vegetable crops respectively however 36 080 and 21 390 ha of cereal and vegetable crops would be produced with optimized seasonal averages of 338 53 and 118 35 million m3 of water under the climate induced low flow scenario the results suggest that climate water stress with associated reduced headwater flows will impact negatively on the basin s irrigated agriculture overall results also suggest a tradeoff between the upstream countries water withdrawal for irrigated agriculture and downstream ghana s hydroelectric power production under the scenario of climate induced low water availability with the treaty policy however upstream countries will receive offsetting benefits with access to discounted hydroelectricity prices in exchange for ensuring historical average flows to ghana depending on cropping patterns and power prices power is typically a higher marginal valued use of water per unit than irrigated agriculture 3 4 hydroelectric power 3 4 1 storage volumes of reservoirs table 4 summarizes storage volumes of hydropower reservoirs and associated power generation by riparian state sub river basin hydro reservoir treaty agreement and climate water availability scenario the results indicate that the newly formed samendeni reservoir with 1 05 km3 capacity behind the smd on the black volta river will optimally store more water in wet seasons for dry seasons use without the treaty arrangement for the low water supply scenario the optimization model moves water throughout the system to meet the pareto improvement criterion by which all riparians are at least as well off with the treaty as without it results showed some declines in economic values of agriculture offset by larger gains in hydropower results of this optimization showed that the samendeni reservoir would optimally store less with the treaty arrangement this occurs because of the constraint of releasing historical flow to ghana to supply high valued hydropower currently an undeveloped engine of economic growth throughout the basin the irrigation system of this reservoir is downstream so more releases means more hydropower production and water for irrigation the reservoir behind burkina faso s bagre dam on the nakambe river upstream of ghana s pmd will optimally store a large amount of water in wet seasons and dry seasons as well as supplying power and water for irrigation farming with the optimized management of water under a treaty agreement less water would be stored in the bagre reservoir as water will be released for hydropower and downstream irrigation more pronounced under the climate induced low flow scenario burkina faso s kompienga reservoir with 2 05 km3 storage capacity on the ouale headwater of the river oti is optimized to hold more storage volume and release for hydropower generation in times of low flow the reservoir operation will optimally store high volume and make available water releases for hydropower production as well as supply of water for domestic use in times of climate induced low supply when releases are most valued ghana s pwalugu reservoir formed behind the new pmd is optimized by our model to hold lower storage volume prior to wet seasons to allow flood flows to be captured pmd s reservoir will hold optimized averages of 2 109 m3 in the wet and 1 689 million m3 in the dry season with the treaty arrangement under the historically observed flow scenario however with climate water stress storage volume will optimally fall to 1 341 m3 in the wet season as well as 608 million m3 in the dry season water releases for hydroelectricity and downstream irrigation use in dry seasons would produce lower volume which also means that more flood flows would optimally be captured in wet seasons our results show that with the treaty arrangement the pmd optimally managed will capture spillage from bagre dam and localized floodwaters upstream in wet seasons reducing flood damages below the pwalugu gage the bui reservoir behind the dam on the black volta river upstream of lake volta under optimized management will hold large volumes in wet seasons and provide releases for hydroelectricity generation and downstream dry season irrigated agricultural production the reservoir s large storage capacity will augment flows to downstream lake volta with the treaty arrangement under the scenarios of both historically observed and climate induced low water supply and support ghana s hydroelectricity production and supply to the five upstream countries table 4 also shows that lake volta under optimized management will hold more storage and provide releases for hydroelectricity and downriver irrigation use with the treaty policy table 4 shows that ghana s reservoirs would optimally store more water and produce more hydropower with their capacities made possible with the treaty arrangement than without it 3 4 2 hydroelectric power generation table 4 also presents the results of power production from hydro dams in burkina faso and ghana by water availability scenario burkina faso s dams have considerably lower installed capacities than those in ghana burkina faso s total installed capacity including the capacity of the newly operational smd is 32 74 mw ghana would have a total installed capacity of 1 690 mw after the pmd s hybrid solar hydro project completion for which that project is described in more detail elsewhere vra 2020 from table 4 considering generation capacities in our model under the historically observed flow situation the akosombo dam optimally managed will produces an annual average of 4 504 gwh without the treaty policy and 4 927 gwh with the treaty policy in contrast with the climate induced low water availability the akosombo dam optimally managed will produce an annual average of 3 033 gwh without the treaty and 3 496 gwh with the treaty a yearly average of 487 gwh under the climate induced low water supply situation and 722 gwh in the historical observed flow pattern appears for the bui dam with the treaty in comparison the kpong dam is estimated to generate a yearly average of 939 and 674 gwh with the treaty policy in the historically observed and climate induced low flow contexts with the treaty the pmd optimally managed produces yearly averages of 133 gwh under the historically observed water availability condition and 94 gwh under the climate induced low water availability situation in light of these facts the volta basin is an ideal candidate for future optimization modelling work that identifies the optimized timing sizing and sequencing of future storage capacity developments table 4 also reveals that the bagre power plant is estimated to produce a yearly average of 82 gwh without the treaty and 80 gwh with the treaty under the historically observed flow scenario and 48 gwh irrespective of the treaty policy in the climate induced low flow context a yearly average of 27 gwh is forecasted to be produced by the kompienga dam with the treaty policy under the historically observed flow scenario and 16 gwh regardless of the treaty policy in the climate induced low water availability situation the smd optimally managed will supply an annual average of 19 gwh under the historically observed flow situation and 7 gwh in the context of climate induced low flow with the treaty our model predicts that the hydroelectricity generation of all the power plants in the basin will fall because of the lower river flow and reservoir storage volumes in the climate change context in that context there is a forecasted 30 reduction of volta system runoff however optimally managed generation delivery capacities at pwalugu bui akosombo and kpong power plants would increase with the treaty compared to without it the increased generation capacities of ghana s dam stem from the pareto required average historical flows to ghana from the five upstream countries with the treaty 3 4 3 hydroelectric power trade for a basin area such as the volta with a long history of weak electricity access hydroelectric power will optimally move to where it is economically most valued to improve access and ensure cost efficiency and energy security fortunately a transmission system to trade export and import power exists and continues to be developed in the volta basin a transmission line to export electricity from ghana to togo and benin has existed since 1972 with interconnection expansion expected completed in 2022 in 2019 a 225 kv transmission line between burkina faso and ghana was completed another 225 kv transmission line between ghana and mali is under construction with a planned commercial operation date in 2022 a 225 kv line has interconnected the national power grids of côte d ivoire and ghana since 1983 with a new 330 kv line parallel to the existing line currently under construction to satisfy the increasing demand for power exchange between the two countries a treaty allowing for power trading could make it possible for upstream countries with generation deficits to import more electricity cheaper than alternative sources from the downstream country ghana with surplus production in exchange for its historical inflows the trade can improve the overall efficiency in the basin s water use with the development of the transmission infrastructure in the region table 5 shows the potential hydroelectric power trade transactions optimized by the model by riparian state policy and climate water supply scenario only burkina faso and ghana both with 82 5 of basin area have hydro plants in the basin with ghana historically producing about 98 of hydroelectric power in the basin with the treaty ghana would be able to produce more electricity since it would secure its historical flows from all the five upstream countries with an opportunity to expand its irrigated farmland and consumptive water use ghana would have the opportunity to put all its hydroelectric power assets to use and produce more electricity and sell to the upstream countries at a discounted price to pay for protection of historical flows the value of power gained in consumption for upstream countries is larger than the cost of reduced water use by those countries that is for any country that receives less water under the optimized response to a treaty the value of electric power made available more than offsets the loss in physical water use showing an economically favorable substitution of capital for water table 5 shows the pattern of production exports imports and consumption that optimally emerge from the treaty in the basin table 5 reveals that all the five upstream countries would import some hydropower from ghana made attractive by lower power prices than they can secure domestically without power imports from ghana burkina faso with 42 of the basin s land area the major headwater supplier faces the highest current electricity prices in the basin it averages about 46 5 higher than would be seen if ghana exported power mali would optimally import an annual average of 555gwh and 420gwh under the historically observed and climate induced low flow scenarios likewise benin côte d ivoire and togo would import optimized yearly averages of 550 545 and 605 gwh under the historically observed flow scenario and 415 410 and 470 gwh in the context of climate induced low water availability it is important to point out that mali benin côte d ivoire and togo would be able to consume some electricity even though they generate no power in the basin because of their geographic location these countries have plans to build storage reservoirs on the rivers of the basin in the future which may be detrimental to ghana bekoe et al 2016 mccartney et al 2012 burkina faso which produces about 2 of electricity in the basin and has limited hydroelectric power production potential due to its geographic location in the basin would consume the electricity it produces plus larger quantities of imported electricity with a treaty our findings suggest the considerable gains from a treaty in promoting a cost efficient reliable power supply and improve electricity access in the basin ghana would effectively put all its generation assets to use while exporting excess electricity that its domestic market is not able to absorb currently and is less able to absorb with new hydropower generation lacking buyers with the treaty policy ghana s powerplants would produce at their highest capacities the upstream countries would be able to secure hydropower at less cost than alternative power sources improving the efficiency of hydroelectric power production in the basin 3 5 economics 3 5 1 riparian states water uses water availability and treaty scenarios table 6 presents the optimized economic benefits for all riparians water using sectors water availability and treaty policy scenarios the table indicates the discounted net economic benefits from domestic water supply irrigated farm income hydroelectric production and trade reservoir based recreation and flood control an in depth discussion of the results for domestic water supply irrigation hydroelectricity and flood damage reduction follows without discussing in detail the results for recreation to conserve space 3 5 2 economic value of domestic water supply table 6 displays discounted benefits of water supply urban residents for all basin countries it shows domestic water use withdrawals for each country they are constrained so that domestic water demands are always met irrespective of climate water availability and treaty policy scenarios our results show that a total discounted net benefit dnpv of 357 million result for burkina faso over the forecast period mali benin côte d ivoire and togo over the forecast period are estimated to each earn total discounted net benefits of 42 million 35 million 40 million and 96 million regardless of climate water availability and treaty policy scenarios 3 5 3 national income from irrigation irrigation has significant food security implications in all basin countries under the historically observed flow scenario burkina faso could potentially earn an optimized discounted total farm income of 465 million from dry season irrigation of cereals and vegetables with the treaty policy and 472 million without the treaty policy over the forecast period that country s farm income is 419 million with the treaty and 439 million without it while that country s farm income falls in the climate water stress context it falls even more with the treaty than without it this occurs because burkina faso containing about 48 of headwater flows has to reduce its agricultural water use in order to ensure historical average flows to ghana in exchange for higher valued hydroelectric power benefits of course the value of power gained to burkina faso is larger than its value of farm income lost each country is required to achieve a pareto improvement as a consequence of the treaty as no country would voluntarily enter into a treaty that did not maintain or improve their economic conditions for ghana when facing historical flows a forecasted total discounted net income of 456 million is secured with and without the treaty policy by contrast when climate stressed low flows occur a net income of 416 million is secured for ghana in the context of climate stressed low flows our optimization exercise shows that ghana s discounted national farm income does not fall since most of ghana s farmlands are downstream of the multipurpose dams our model predicts that inside ghana hydropower production at the akosombo and kpong power stations will decline slightly with irrigation development downstream of the new pmd and the bui reservoirs all upstream riparian nations experience a slight decline in their total farm income from the optimal management of the river system in the climate stressed low water supply condition the decline in farm income stems from our optimization framework that mathematically allocates water to highest valued uses at the margin agricultural water use is found to be a lower valued than power in this basin cai et al 2008 a competition which has been investigated for a number of years ortolano and cushing 2002 the findings from our optimization exercise provide evidence that the prospective treaty can be pareto improving in light of the storage capacity that can be developed in the basin our results show that the new and existing dams can be operated with the treaty to avoid adverse impacts on any of the riparian states while improving the performance of hydroelectric power production basinwide 3 5 4 economic value of hydropower production trade and use the economic value of hydropower comes from the consumer and producer surpluses from electricity export as well as benefits from domestic use under the historically observed flow situation burkina faso can secure an optimized total discounted net benefits of 2 615 billion with the treaty and 914 million without it by contrast for the climate stressed situation hydroelectricity benefits fall to 566 million without and 1 844 million with the treaty for the other four upstream states with the treaty under historical flows mali benin côte d ivoire and togo secure total discounted net benefits of 738 million 731 million 724 million 814 million respectively over the planning horizon hydropower benefits of the four countries fall to 396 million 391 million 402 million and 460 million respectively under climate stressed flows for downstream ghana under historical flows results show a total discounted net benefit of 34 billion with the treaty and 28 billion without it by contrast in the situation of climate induced low supplies optimized hydropower benefits fall to 23 6 billion with the treaty and 19 4 billion without it 3 5 5 economic value of flood control the economic benefits of flood control are included in the overall optimization for ghana s pmd it measures flood damages avoided davies 2018 kasei et al 2016 mechler et al 2010 gupta et al 2003 as a result of pmd s floodwater storage capacity results show that the reservoir to be formed behind the pmd produces average annual damage reduction by 78 in the downstream catchment areas below the pwalugu gauge baah kumi and ward 2020 our optimization exercise shows that with the multilateral water and power trade treaty in place the pmd improves the economic performance of flood management the pmd reduces flood damages considerably to 2 819 million and 178 million occurring only at the initial construction and filling stages of pmd s reservoir under historical water supplies and climate stresses supplies respectively 3 6 total economic benefits table 6 further shows total discounted net benefits summed over years by riparian state water availability and treaty policy scenarios our results reveal that each riparian nation has the potential to secure national economic gains from signing onto the treaty described in this paper all basin countries improve economically from the presence and efficient management of the two new and existing dams with the treaty compared to without it this occurs even though burkina faso is assumed to shoulder the 105 million total costs of the smd and ghana bearing all the 993 million costs of the pmd for burkina faso the smd s large storage capacity will augment the hydroelectric power productive capacity of kompienga and bagre dams while improving water based recreation in addition to providing water for irrigation and domestic water supply for ghana the pmd s reservoir will hold floodwaters during wet seasons and years releasing the water for hydropower and domestic water supply in dry periods effectively enhancing water availability in dry periods results from our analysis provide important insights concerning the additional upper basin storage development the smd if efficiently managed can potentially improve dry season irrigation farming downstream of the dam with the treaty the smd would also encourage fishing and other recreational activities and provide hydroelectric power to supply the agro industrial zone of burkina faso s samendeni valley integrated development program biney 2010 moreover the presence and efficient operation of ghana s pmd with its flood damage reduction potential in northern ghana offers the prospect of dry season irrigated farmland development and expansion in ghana and burkina faso respectively with the treaty our model results also show that without a water agreement and hydropower trading among the six basin countries increased irrigation water withdrawal by upstream countries would weaken the power generation delivery capacity performed by the lower basin dams our optimization model over the 20 year horizon finds that with the agreement no basin country needs to be worse off beyond hydropower countries can potentially benefit from access to domestic water use expanded crop irrigation fish production tourism and some protection from floods and droughts 4 discussion the forces of climate water stress forecasted population growth and increasing competition over transboundary water resources internationally have attracted research efforts addressing the benefits and costs of adapting to these forces through strategic water development and benefit sharing agreements the volta basin is unique in the sense that major hydropower dams are located in its wet downstream reaches while most water use occurs in its drier upstream catchment regions while its upstream countries mainly use water for agriculture downstream ghana mostly uses water for hydropower generation from dams that depend heavily on inflows from upriver catchment areas hydropower produces the lion s share of the benefits from the treaty described here historically that part of africa has been power limited for many times of the year which has constrained their development relative to that history the presence of additional low cost power potentially available under a proposed treaty likely will attract eager buyers especially those whose sectors are currently or could become power intensive that potential for larger quantities and more affordable power under the treaty described provides incentives for all riparian countries to hammer out a treaty our framework considers ghana to offer hydropower at reduced prices to burkina faso togo côte d ivoire benin and mali as an incentive to trade for protecting its historical transboundary supply patterns into its reservoir system a hydroelectric power price prediction demand function incorporated in our framework allows prices to fall with increased power production koch and vögele 2009 schoengold et al 2006 which in turn depend on river inflow and storage of hydropower dams more inflow into the dams other things equal produces higher storage head releases power production and reduced power prices as required by any neoclassical economic demand function one well known previous work focused onmultisector water allocation water and energy linkages in cooperative water sharing arrangements between two of the basin s countries ghana and burkina faso bhaduri and liebe 2013 the results of the present investigation demonstrate multisector water allocation allowing for water and energy trade relationship among all upstream riparian states and one downstream state brought on from recent upper basin large storage development initiatives findings from our investigation can motivate multilateral agreements as well as guide debates over the design of transboundary water management strategies in the ongoing development of a water charter for the region results from this work can also provide a decision making guide for cooperative water and related infrastructure management considering the basin s complex water use interdependence the analysis of this investigation is limited by the scarcity of research grade hydrologic data the work faced the challenge of tracking recent data on the basin s surface water flows motivating our reliance on historical data only 20 gauging stations with sufficient historical data for long periods were used in tracking stream flows the limitation of gauging stations with long term data may reduce the accuracy of our cross border and within country flow measurements another limitation of our model is the difficulty of a precise specification of flood damages our flood damage formulation approximates the extent of floodwaters overtopping the white volta riverbanks a mathematical function that captures losses from reduced flooding and associated costs from pmd s controlled flows was specified for its downstream gauge 12 pwalugu because of a lack of reliable information on the economic costs of flooding however tributaries joining the white volta watercourse downstream of the pwalugu gauge have been shown to contribute to flooding in the catchment but not directly used in our model other limitations of our model formulation stemming from the lack of research grade data are the exclusion of land use change sediment transport and groundwater flow impacts as well as water quality considerations yet another limitation is our finding that flows to the downstream state are economically desired from the basin s view as part of the potential growth in hydropower production this finding that ghana would continue to receive its existing flows as part of the proposed treaty has the potential to enshrine the existing power imbalances in the basin this finding does reflect one element of a pareto improvement outcome by which each country is at least as well off under the treaty as they are under the status quo water allocation scheme still a skeptic might state that ghana had no right to receive those high flows in the first place and that it should be receiving reduced future flows as part of a more socially just future water allocation to make up for past water injustice that skeptic may also state that optimizing the basin by assigning a high priority for hydropower production may not reflect the wishes for the upstream states even if economically the most efficient as well as producing a pareto improvement in addition our model does not comprehensively include all sources of the basin s water abstraction because of the difficulty in obtaining water diversion data for all demand sites for all basin countries we relied on information from several medium sized and large irrigated systems as well as areas of residential use in published reports and peer reviewed journal literature future work could profitably examine the economic attractiveness of alternative sources such as recycling and reuse new wellfield development water importation and increased desalination on coastal areas to mention only four many policy experiments such as analyzing the impact of the provision of irrigated agriculture subsidies changes in input pricing expansion of installed capacities of hydroelectric power and agricultural trade policies on system improvements must await future work water abstraction of micro and small irrigation schemes and other use sectors such as industry predicted to expand its use will be included in the model as data become available 4 1 stakeholder engagement and cooperation models can inform policy design when informed by views of stakeholders when the models track trade offs associated with conflicting interests mccartney et al 2019 pettinotti et al 2018 hurford and harou 2014 while stakeholders were not directly engaged to inform development of our model we formulated it to meet principles of stakeholder interests in the volta basin some of those interests were expressed in a 2018 world bank document draft water charter for the volta river basin world bank 2018 on page 17 of that document a statement of the broad principle motivated the document was described as the state parties to the water charter shall cooperate on the basis of the principles of international law within the authority to fulfil their legally binding obligations to achieve sustainable management of the basin s water resources and environment world bank 2018 the present volta basin model has the potential to support stakeholders in dialogue debate and decision making from the results of our modelling exercise shown in this paper effects of a treaty proposal and reservoir development plan can be assessed from several stakeholder views most notably alternative views regarding each of five competing uses of water in the basin results presented here have the potential to promote open dialogue and debate among views supporting each of the five water uses described earlier in the paper that dialogue could promote mutual understanding and consensus over hard questions dealing with water policy the tabled results show complex combinations of two policy scenarios as well as two climate water scenarios historical and climate stressed several overarching observations are worth making where new infrastructure is proposed debate by affected stakeholders can identify institutional technical or operational constraints needing attention to make for a more acceptable future to more people in more countries investigation of potential economic benefits from any proposed policy influenced by any climate scenario can promote better community relations between affected stakeholders and treaty designers based on national priorities of the riparian states and their donor partners the volta basin authority vba now has information to improve all riparians economic performance arising from benefits of a treaty these potential benefits can motivate increased cooperation and with cooperation can come growing financial and technical resources gains from a proposed treaty and new dam occurring from an optimized development and management of the volta watershed are shown these gains have the potential to contribute to more reliable secure and affordable water and power services 4 2 limitations of dam development building dams on rivers to produce hydropower can help mitigate the world s energy shortages as well as reduce the cost of adapting to global climate change however it has been known for years that damming also has the potential to produce large negative effects on the environment and on important key ecological assets fan et al 2015 poor design or operation of hydropower dams can cause transboundary water problems like flooding sedimentation river fragmentation and loss of important ecosystem function as well as cultural clash pecos 2007 moreover hydropower production is highly vulnerable to climate change as shown by our model and by other studies bieberet al 2018 bekoe et al 2016 so there remains a need to diversify the power sector of the basin to include other renewable energy geothermal power biomass energy wind energy and solar energy sources 5 conclusions ongoing stress from climate change variability and high population growth heightens water use interdependencies among riparian countries which can lead to conflict few studies have successfully integrated the volta basin s hydrologic and economic performance in analyzing multisector water allocation as well as water and energy issue linkage in cooperative water sharing arrangements for burkina faso and ghana however some studies assert that high population growth and climate change will rapidly increase consumptive water use of burkina faso as well as other four upstream countries mali benin côte d ivoire and togo results of our work indicate that all basin countries have the prospect to attain significant economic gains from hydroelectric power production and power trading with the water sharing treaty than without it under both historically observed flow and climate stressed scenarios however under the climate stressed scenario all upstream countries would have to cut their agricultural water consumption in exchange for discounted hydroelectricity prices nonetheless the total economic gains from added hydroelectric power production and trade outweigh total economic losses in farm income this of course is a limited version of social justice a more comprehensive version would assure that each significant block of people within each country is at least as well off with the treaty compared to without it an important and ambitious goal for future research in the final analysis our results show only potential gains real negotiation by real people informed by models such as the one developed for this paper will need to occur to turn the potential gains indicated by our work into realized economic gains each country declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

3624,when transboundary basins are developed in poor regions where freshwater resources are fully committed it becomes important to design economically sustainable action plans to address existing poverty especially in responding to mounting evidence of climate change and population growth increasing competition over shared water resources as well as climate water stress has attracted research efforts internationally addressing the benefits and costs of establishing water sharing treaties despite this ongoing interest few peer reviewed works have investigated water development and use patterns that could produce economic gains for all parties from establishing transboundary water sharing agreements this work develops an approach to address the gap by formulating and applying a basin scale hydro economic optimization model of west africa s volta river basin the work analyzes the effects of a prospective multilateral water allocation and hydropower trade agreement on the size sign and distribution of basin wide economic benefits the model includes two new large storage reservoirs five water use purposes and two climate water supply scenarios with and without a water sharing treaty from that it assesses the net economic benefit maximizing patterns of water use with and without the treaty results show a pareto improving outcome is achievable for all riparian countries from new storage capacity in the basin for which at least one country is better and none is worse off this improvement is achievable with a multilateral water sharing treaty implemented with power trading among the six basin countries results indicate that all basin countries have the potential to secure significant economic gains from additional hydropower production with the treaty under its implementation upstream countries would reduce agricultural water use in exchange for higher valued hydropower benefits under the climate stressed low flow scenario despite potential benefits that are shareable from negotiation practical implementation of such a treaty will require considerable diplomatic skill patience and effort keywords river basin optimization policy poverty climate 1 background 1 1 introduction increasing competition over transboundary water resources has reinforced the need for benefit sharing planning through economically sustainable water management benefit sharing which for purposes of this paper we describe as pareto improving habteyes et al 2015 dombrowsky 2009 muñoz piña et al 2008 are plans that if implemented make at least one country better off and no country worse off the volta river basin fig 1 is a transboundary basin shared by burkina faso ghana togo mali benin and côte d ivoire in which intense competition exists among those riparian states and water use sectors due to rising water demand and water supply variability amisigo et al 2015 amisigo 2005 van de giesen et al 2001 for this basin there is a considerable need to discover if there could be pareto improving water sharing arrangements with climate change predicted to exacerbate the variability of rainfall and river flows mccartney et al 2012 gao and margolies

rainfall in the basin is markedly seasonal and sees a considerable reduction from downstream to upstream the lower elevation sub humid part has more extended rainfall periods while the upper and middle semi arid parts experience limited water availability in the dry seasons due to a short torrential rainy season followed by long dry season and high evaporation mul et al 2018 kasei et al 2016

giesen et al 2002 van de giesen et al 2001 the five upstream basin states have used water primarily for irrigation to support food security while the largest downstream country ghana mainly uses water for hydropower production some studies have found that small upstream irrigation dams have low or mixed impact on water availability for downstream use fencl et al 2015 leemhuis et al 2009 van de giesen et al 2005 however dam development and irrigation expansion in the upstream states would negatively impact ghana s hydropower generation capacity bekoe et al 2016 rodgers et al 2007 the basin s

infrastructure and poorly managed existing resources and infrastructure exacerbate the water related challenges the basin s inhabitants face mul et al 2018 amisigo et al 2015 mul et al 2015 the basin s riparian countries have established ambitious plans for water resources development including the construction of multipurpose dams and reservoirs for hydroelectric power improving the timing and quantity of water for residential irrigation and some industrial use and flood control in the upstream semi arid areas irrigation development in the basin since the 1990s shifted towards the construction of a host of smaller schemes as a more effective approach to improve food production in the semi arid areas van de giesen et al 2005 however there is growing interest in expanding large irrigation areas supplied by existing large multiple use dams as well as building new multipurpose dams with significant irrigation components in the upstream more arid areas six large dams with hydropower plants are currently operational in the basin burkina faso s 16 mw bagre 14 mw kompienga and 2 74 mw samendeni power stations are supplied by 1 7 km3 2 05 km3 and 1 05 km3 storage capacity

transboundary water management among the six riparian countries has started in earnest only recently with the creation of the volta basin authority vba which began operation in 2009 meanwhile increased coordination has occurred on a bilateral basis between burkina faso and ghana although weakly coordinated diplomacy has characterized the basin historically the vba and its six riparian states hope to form an institutional cooperative framework known as the volta water charter to guide the basin s future water development and use for which a draft was published in 2018 world bank 2018 the ongoing search for equitable use and sustainable management of the basin s freshwater resources raises the need for workable implementations to meet that coordinating goal one of the ways to deal with ongoing challenges from climate water stress growing water demands for increasing population and environmental sustainability is to establish and implement multilateral agreements on water allocations un water 2008 sadoff and grey 2005 sadoff and grey 2002 the contribution made by this paper is to address this ongoing search by building testing developing applying and interpreting a hydroeconomic model that guides discovery of a more equitable and sustainable management of the basin s freshwater resources that contribution is described in more detail below despite making several incremental contributions to the water resources literature this study has limitations from a scarcity of research grade hydrologic data challenges of rigorously accounting for benefits of flood damages reduced and difficulties of accounting for existing power imbalances in the basin these limitations are discussed in more detailed in the discussion part of the paper below 1 2 previous work several studies show that uncoordinated water management in transboundary basins he et al 2014 such as the tigris euphrates salman et al 2014 amu darya jalilov et al 2018 jalilov et al 2013 and the nile habteyes et al 2015 satti et al 2015 gohar and ward 2010 whittington et al 2005 has contributed to tensions among riparians paisley and henshaw 2013 rahman 2013 similarly others indicate that coordinated water development can offer new opportunities for sharing of benefits from improved water management for riparian countries alam et al 2009 sadoff and grey 2002 the volta system is a semi closed basin with high outflow to sinks in high flow seasons and reduced flows to sinks in low flow seasons obeng asiedu 2004 in this basin it has been believed for many years that new water storage infrastructure development to reallocate water and its services among seasons years and locations could improve the total economic benefits produced by the river system satti et al 2015 keller et al 2000 however uncoordinated storage infrastructure development policies coupled with weak diplomatic arrangements for sharing water and related services among the basin s riparians could limit potential gains in economic performance amisigo 2005 numerous studies since the 1990 s have employed hydro economic analysis hea ward 2021 to gain insights into integrated economic and strategic

sharing treaty arrangements that could be mutually beneficial for all riparian states in light of recent upriver large storage development initiatives despite two well done works linking transboundary river flows to hydroelectricity exports bhaduri and liebe 2013 bhaduri et al 2011 despite their excellence these works limited their scope to two riparian states burkina faso and ghana and a small number of water uses several integrated policy analytic dimensions such as large upstream storage capacity development and increased consumptive water use by other four upstream riparians benin côte d ivoire mali and togo remain untouched to date some studies assert that population growth and climate change will emerge to increase consumptive water use of burkina faso as well as four other upstream countries higher upstream water use could have adverse consequences on power generation capacities of ghana with 98 of basin electricity production 71 produced by power plants at locations close to the basin s outlet mul et al 2018 bekoe et al 2016 bharati et al 2008 rodgers et al 2007 van de giesen et al 2001 van edig et al 2001 in light of the gaps described above this work builds applies and interprets an integrated hydro economic optimization model to discover a prospective mutually beneficial agreement consisting of structured water allocation and hydropower trading in the volta basin in light of recent additional large storage capacity expansion we refer to this water allocation and power trading arrangement as a treaty throughout the rest of the paper strictly speaking it is not a treaty as conventionally used in diplomatic circles the paper s original contribution comes from its formulation of a hydro economic optimization model to investigate the impacts of a prospective agreement in which the five upstream countries supply historical flow patterns to the farthest downstream country ghana in exchange for discounted electricity prices and high quantities of power supplied it takes into account two new upstream large storage capacities on potential system wide economic benefits that result from changes in the quantity of water flows location and timing the paper investigates the impacts of a prospective treaty that accounts for five water management purposes as well as two climate water supply scenarios 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area additional details occupying an area of about 409 000 km2 across varying portions of the six west african countries the volta basin extends from its headwaters in southeast mali southwest north and central burkina faso and northwest benin down to southeastern ghana over a distance of about 1 850 km before draining into the gulf of guinea figs 1 and 2 burkina faso contains most of the drainage area at 42 followed by ghana with 40 5 togo with 6 4 mali benin and côte d ivoire with 4 2 3 8 and 3 1 respectively kolavalli and williams 2016 percentages of land areas drained by the basin are 63 for burkina faso 70 for ghana 47 3 for togo 15 2 for benin 1 2 for mali and 3 9 for côte d ivoire barry et al 2005 five major tributaries contribute to headwater supplies to the volta basin system fig 2 the lower volta tributaries 17 mainly in ghana the oti river 37 the white volta nakambe and red volta nazinon rivers 23 and the black volta mouhoun river 23 goes 2005 the movement of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz greatly influences the basin s climate generating a uni modal rainy season in the upstream section and bi modal rainy seasons in the downstream portion basin flows highly depend on rainfall and display high levels of variability in space and time sylla et al 2016 andreini et al 2000 a south north rainfall gradient characterizes the basin with annual rainfall greater than 1 100 mm in the south between 900 and 1 100 mm in the middle and less than 500 mm in the north mul et al 2016 sylla et al 2016 rodgers et al 2007 about 9 of the basin s rainfall becomes runoff with the other 91 destined for evapotranspiration seepage and other loss sood et al 2013 rodgers et al 2007 potential average open water annual evaporation ranges between 1 350 to 1 500 mm 1 501 to 2 000 mm and 2 001 to 2 500 mm in the south middle and north respectively mul et al 2015 barry et al 2005 van edig et al 2002 the rainfall and evaporation patterns imply more water scarcity in the upstream reaches of the watershed than the south 2 2 data sources this study used observed long term average wet and dry seasonal flows into the basin at the headwaters from the grdc s global runoff database grdc 2019 representing the scenario of historically observed flow reflecting stochastic variation around observed long term average discharge an alternative scenario climate induced low flow represents climate change impacts resulting from a 30 reduction in basin wide mean flows based on rainfall runoff models of climate change predictions where 10 reduction in rainfall lead to about 30 decrease in mean system wide runoff roudier et al 2014 mahé et al 013 kasei 2010 domestic residential water use population water prices and other household data were secured from several sources onea

potatoes cabbage lettuce okra pepper onions and tomatoes in burkina faso and ghana and cereals mainly rice in all basin countries the investigation also used data on dams reservoirs and their hydroelectric power plant capacities data on the dam and reservoir features including reservoir storage capacity depth area dam height estimated dam reservoir project costs hydroelectricity exchanges

water supply irrigation farming hydroelectric power production recreation and river bank overflow flood damage control in future work we plan to incorporate commercial and industrial uses into our model both of which are comparatively small scale uses as of 2021 bekoe et al 2016 irrigation benefits come from national farm income which is mostly subsistence farming in this region by subsistence agriculture we mean these farmers grow food crops mostly to meet the nutrition needs of their families on small landholdings while the economic principles for valuing subsistence farming are the same as for commercially oriented agriculture food prices are more difficult to measure as are costs of production posel and rogan 2016 despite measurement difficulties farm income remains measured as crop prices multiplied by crop yields minus the production cost to find net returns per unit land those net returns are multiplied by farmland in production to find total farm income for each crop each country each climate scenario and each treaty plan domestic water use consumer surplus barreca et al 2016 armstrong et al 2009 gallai et al 2009 su 2007 brynjolfsson et al 2003 whitehead et al 2000 hausman and newey 1995 morey et al 1993 accounts for benefits from domestic water supply hydroelectricity economic benefits originate from the consumer and producer surpluses from production sale and use of power recreation benefit comes from the use of reservoirs such as boating fishing and other related tourism activities which depend on storage volume it is valued as its incremental benefit from the recreational value of lakes multiplied by reservoir storage volume raised to a power less than one reflecting the degree of responsiveness of recreational benefit to each reservoir s storage amount a flood control benefit function tracks flood damage from those that would have otherwise occurred without the new storage flood damages are calculated for any flood stage levels times the amount of flood damages associated with that flood stage higher flood stage levels cause higher flood damages typically a nonlinear relationship the flood stage by being partly controllable from upstream reservoir development and or management is unknown in advance our model solves for it as part of the overall optimization program in summary our investigation uses economic principles to address the water poverty nexus economic efficiency and sustainability llopis albert et al 2018 basharat and tariq 2014 as discussed next 2 3 1 water poverty nexus by establishing links between technical biological legal and policy sciences to address water poverty a more efficient and just solution for water development and supply can be informed fankhauser and tepic 2007 sullivan et al 2003 sullivan 2002 our investigation aims to discover methods to address poverty in the basin by safeguarding de fraiture et al 2010 namara et al 2010 hanjra et al 2009 khan et al 2009 an adequate quantity of water necessary to sustain economic welfare hutton 2013 for five water uses those five uses are domestic water supply irrigation farming hydroelectric power production recreation and riverbank overflow flood damage control our work implements a view of distributional justice rawls 1999 to address the water poverty nexus for water resources in the volta basin by employing several mathematical constraints safe access for domestic sector withdrawals are effectively constrained by a very low price elasticity of demand for which large price changes have small impacts on domestic water use briscoe 2011 briscoe 1997 our model is implemented to ensure that all water uses are met at a minimal level in the basin s upstream dry areas including areas with the new storage capacities as described in more detail in this paper s appendices a b and c our model implements simplified seasonal minimum environmental flow requirements that mimic the native flow pattern mul and gao 2016 to ensure the efficient management of new upstream dams and protect ecosystems dependent on freshwater and water dependent local culture despite the lack of reliable research grade data on minimum requirements the target flows implemented in our model enable us to account for the benefits of water use forgone by upstream users 2 3 2 economic efficiency our investigation assesses water allocation options for the five purposes described above its aim is to discover maximum economic benefits to all water users consistent with available hydrologic technical economic financial environmental and institutional constraints the model is mathematically constrained to assure that each riparian country in total receives at least as large an overall multi sector economic benefit with the treaty and dam as without them briscoe 2011 a mathematical framework is attached as appendix a the complete gams code is attached in appendix b permitting a complete replication of this paper s results for those with access to the gams software 2 3 3 sustainability achieving sustainability requires lasting outcomes our model implements water development and operations that balance water use for human purposes while respecting to the extent possible the natural functioning of water dependent ecosystems including maintenance of wildlife habitat wetlands and indigenous streamflow dependent culture water for domestic use is based on urban population growth at between 2 and 3 percent per year depending on the historical period of record the model accounts for lower bounds on the sustainable use of water resources in addition to sustained ecosystem resilience and stability in the operation of the new and existing dams with water treaty allocations that account for ecosystem performance in addition a sustainability goal is implemented in our model for the basin s reservoirs with constraints requiring the reservoirs to return to at least their starting level by the last season and last year of the 20 year time horizon requiring reservoirs to return to their initial period ward et al 2019 avoids depleting storage volumes in the last period effectively ensuring water availability for future generations 2 3 4 policy goals several goals guided the development of our model structure economic efficiency o policies will promote economically high productivity and limit low valued uses especially when water scarcity increases for instance water withdrawal at a particular time and location is more economically productive if the use value at that time and place is larger than the value of withdrawing the same river water at another place or time o new storage plans are assessed to see if the movement of water in space and time can generate increases in the economic value of water compared to the added cost of building the storage capacity to assess opportunities for pareto improvement our analysis sought to discover plans for which no riparian is worse off and at least one is better off with a treaty compared to the base policy without a treaty habteyes et al 2015 locally relevant plans the choice of our policy scenarios was also informed by locally formulated elements in the volta basin water charter developed by the basin s stakeholders which states that among all the different types of water use in the basin no particular use shall be given priority over the others however should competing uses of water prevent all the requirements from being met special attention shall be paid to the basic needs of human beings notwithstanding state parties may by mutual agreement set an order of priority among the different types of use of the basin s water resources state parties shall enter into bilateral and multilateral water sharing agreements provided that such agreements comply with the present water charter and that the volta basin authority vba is duly informed of their content world bank 2018 pp 19 20 guided by these policy goals the model tracks hydrological and economic outcomes in each of the riparian countries for each of two policy scenarios policy scenario 1 labelled 1 sto dev wo treaty this label reflects water use patterns that would occur under additional storage development and associated power production without a treaty it is implemented with a system optimization that permits additional storage capacity expansion and power production no trading of the added power production is permitted and no treaty constrains water sharing among the six countries policy scenario 2 labelled 2 sto dev wi treaty this label reflects water use patterns that would occur under additional storage development that would occur with a treaty it reflects a system optimization considering the additional storage capacity expansion with the agreement in place with the water sharing treaty implemented the upstream countries are required to deliver historical average flows to the downstream riparian ghana in exchange for hydropower if the added benefits economically justify the added costs under the treaty new power production and power trading imports and exports occurs but historical water delivery requirements must occur at the relevant international border stream gauges the classical gains from trade are reaped arkolakis et al 2012 bernard et al 2007 besley 1995 krugman 1981 in which the exporting country earns higher incomes than the income produced by using all the produced power for domestic production the importing country secures power at a cheaper cost displaced income than they can supply it domestically this water sharing arrangement has historical precedent as only one example these principles were used to implement the celebrated rio grande compact mix et al 2012 flanigan and haas 2008 ward et al 2007 hill 1974a under that agreement signed in 1938 three us states colorado new mexico and texas agreed to divide the waters under it the states agreed to divide then future flows based on historical flow and use patterns adjusted by natural runoff at selected locations in the basin that had occurred prior to that time that compact whose history is described elsewhere hill 1974b added certainty to future economic development in the region by allowing and encouraging future infrastructure developments in the basin like additional storage in a region where surface water supplies continue to be highly variable in fact additional storage has been built encouraged by the economic development occurring because of the greater predictability of flow rights and responsibilities for each of the three states ward 2013 the text of the rio grande compact is currently posted on a us bureau of reclamation webpage us bureau of reclamation 2021 a similarly principled agreement has the potential to promote organized future developments in the volta basin among other elements it would require a six country commission of some kind to enforce such a water sharing agreement in much the same way as the rio grande compact commission has operated in the us since the original 1938 signing of the compact this would assure all states are meeting their agreed treaty water delivery requirements 2 4 integrated basin scale framework this study defines the economic value of water as the total economic value loomis et al 2000 generated by water within the volta river system the sum of all benefits minus costs to the riparian countries the physical interdependencies of the basin s water use produce economically important positive and negative externalities thus we analyzed the whole volta basin as an interdependent integrated unit our dynamic model integrates the basin s hydrologic economic agronomic institutional and environmental dimensions for the investigation of policy choices with a time step consisting of two seasons per year for a twenty year period the optimization framework seeks and finds basin wide net economic benefits maximizing seasonal water allocation patterns over countries years and seasons in present value terms from the earlier described five uses we applied the gams optimization package and its modeling capabilities to the volta watershed while giving special consideration to regional and local conditions the model structure contains 62 water diversion points two crop types and 13 storage capacities with seven power plants the distribution of locations of basin water withdrawal is 18 in burkina faso two in côte d ivoire two in benin two in togo two in mali and 36 in ghana for which the major ones are shown in fig 2 there are 17 domestic residential water supply areas and two crop types vegetables and cereals grown in 45 farm areas supplied by 13 reservoirs multipurpose and single with over 90 million m3 of storage volume for which 20 gauging stations track stream flows the model is comprehensive in scope bazrkar et al 2013 more so than a smaller scale earlier work by the authors investigating opportunities for economic improvement in the same basin baah kumi and ward 2020 the model determines the values of endogenous unknown variables that maximize economic benefits including water allocations to domestic areas irrigated agriculture irrigated land in production storage levels in reservoirs flood damages avoided dam head turbine flows hydroelectricity generation quantity and price of electricity produced and traded 3 results 3 1 overview all volta basin countries carry the potential to secure significant aggregate economic welfare gains from hydroelectricity generation with a treaty compared to without it under both historically observed and climate stressed flow scenarios for each climate scenario and treaty arrangement we wrote the model code to maximize total economic welfare summed over sectors and years while respecting hydrologic constraints given by flows at the headwaters under the with treaty arrangement deliveries to the border gauge of each country are mathematically constrained to replicate historical delivery patterns so the model results come from maximizing total net economic benefits while respecting historical delivery patterns to each downstream country the basin wide hydropower benefits from added storage capacities harnessed by the two new dams with an agreement show considerable increase those power benefits with the agreement increase by 37 compared to the same without the agreement for historically observed flows it increases by a more modest 36 if the climate induced lower flows would occur a multilateral water and power trade agreement carries the potential to improve basin wide water allocation and use efficiency by increasing electricity access as well as promote a reliable cost efficient power supply with such an agreement ghana which sometimes has faced a national power surplus attended by partly unused power assets can put all its hydropower assets in the basin to beneficial use while securing historical flows from upstream countries selling that power to others at a higher price than its domestic marginal value in use in ghana these results illustrate the classical gains from trade from exporting surpluses compared to using it with less economic efficiency domestically which has been developed in the international trade literature for many years bekchanov et al 2015b garfinkel et al 2015 grafton and horne 2014 grafton et al 2012 rigby et al 2010 heaney et al 2006 calatrava and garrido 2005 hearne and easter 1997 the improvement in storage capacity in the basin from operation of burkina faso s smd on the mouhoun river as well as the presence and operation of ghana s pmd on the nakambe river with an agreement carries the potential to produce a pareto improving outcome habteyes et al 2015 mishra et al 2012 dombrowsky 2009 muñoz piña et al 2008 for which no country is worse off and at least one is better off elevated storage capacity in the basin through the smd and the pmd offers the opportunity for expanded irrigation farmland in burkina faso and ghana by improving access to irrigation water and reducing flood damages the value of irrigation for burkina faso and ghana increases with timely application of water to dry season irrigated farming resulting from the storage regulating capacities of the smd and the pmd 3 2 gauged flows table 2 presents optimized river discharges by riparian country sub catchment stream gauge water availability scenario treaty agreement and season because of space constraints 20 year average gauged stream flows are displayed for each gauge detailed predicted optimized flows for each season for the 20 years are obtainable on request the optimized river flows are shown for twenty gauges on the main river and important tributaries throughout the volta watershed fig 2 gauges of regional interest on the borders of burkina faso and ghana 3rd 4th 6th and 11th ghana and togo 9th as shown in fig 2 and table 2 showing how water flows from the five upstream countries into ghana the figure illustrates impact of the upstream countries water withdrawals and use on the downriver reaches all affecting water availability to ghana table 2 presents key findings on changes in water quantity location and timing due to the presence and the operation of the two new dams smd and the pmd in the basin s middle region the table shows system wide streamflow interdependencies among countries and water use sectors optimized operation of existing lower volta basin large dams akosombo and kpong will be affected by flow reductions due to the construction of the additional large upriver storage capacities and water withdrawals for extending the scope of areas under irrigation without the treaty however with a treaty higher optimized flows to the lower basin dams would occur table 2 also shows that optimized dry season flows are increased due to increased storage capacities but flows increase more with a treaty agreement that effectively allocates the resulting additional flows with increased economic efficiency gauged stream flows influenced by optimized operation of all dams see larger changes in dry seasons than wet seasons for instance due to the construction of burkina faso s smd optimized flows into ghana s bui reservoir about 559 miles 900 km downstream of smd measured at gauge 4 would fall in wet seasons and increase in dry seasons also the biggest lake in the basin ghana s lake volta located near the basin s outlet to the sea is optimized to be significantly impacted by the operation of the two new middle volta basin dams optimized gauged flows into lake volta measured at gauge 18 from the black volta and white volta rivers and other lower volta tributaries as well as the oti river significantly fall in the wet seasons and increase in the dry seasons however lower flows would be experienced at gauge 18 especially under the climate induced low flow scenario without the treaty agreement climate change will not only reduce upriver countries water availability but will also increase their consumptive water use since rain fed agricultural water use will be negatively impacted by reduced rainfall table 2 also reveals that both new as well as existing dams will heavily regulate system wide flows our model predicts that the new storage capacities will reallocate the volta basin waters between seasons so that benefits are optimized while ensuring that upper and middle basin water users receive at least as much as before that is they would receive as much domestic water supply irrigation water use hydropower production and recreation economic benefits with the treaty condition compared to without the treaty condition while respecting key hydrologic institutional and environmental constraints 3 3 irrigation table 3 presents optimized irrigated farmland and water use by riparian state sub catchment crop treaty agreement and water availability scenario we first describe irrigated farmland and water use of burkina faso a headwater country with 42 of basin s land area under the historically observed flow scenario that country is forecasted to produce 43 870 ha of cereal crops and 28 980 ha of vegetable crops per season using optimized seasonal averages of 361 14 million m3 and 180 35 million m3 of water from the river system with the treaty agreement optimized irrigated farmland and water use are reduced under the climate stressed flow scenario without the treaty with even more reduction in water use especially for cereal crops with the treaty irrigation water use and farmland of the other four upriver riparian states with 17 5 of the basin s land area are also described for benin s cereal crop production under the historically observed flow scenario an optimized average of 95 68 million m3 per season et would be used for 10 500 ha per season irrespective of the treaty agreement however with climate induced low flow irrigation water use and land in production would be reduced even more with the treaty agreement côte d ivoire is forecasted to optimally use an average of 168 19 million m3 per season for 18 360 ha of rice irrespective of the treaty agreement mali and togo are also estimated to use optimized seasonal averages of 101 25 and 111 60 million m3 to irrigate 11 300 and 12 400 ha of rice irrespective of the policy configuration however like benin the countries irrigation water use and farmlands are predicted to fall under climate water stress and even further with the treaty policy cereals would be the first to drop out of production in a water stress situation since cereals are a lower valued crop at the margin compared to vegetable crops irrigation land and water use for ghana the only downriver riparian is predicted to remain unchanged irrespective of the treaty agreement configuration especially under the climate induced low flow scenario under the historically observed flow scenario ghana is forecasted to use an optimized seasonal average of 379 71 and 123 42 million m3 of water to grow 44 660 and 22 350 ha of cereal and vegetable crops respectively however 36 080 and 21 390 ha of cereal and vegetable crops would be produced with optimized seasonal averages of 338 53 and 118 35 million m3 of water under the climate induced low flow scenario the results suggest that climate water stress with associated reduced headwater flows will impact negatively on the basin s irrigated agriculture overall results also suggest a tradeoff between the upstream countries water withdrawal for irrigated agriculture and downstream ghana s hydroelectric power production under the scenario of climate induced low water availability with the treaty policy however upstream countries will receive offsetting benefits with access to discounted hydroelectricity prices in exchange for ensuring historical average flows to ghana depending on cropping patterns and power prices power is typically a higher marginal valued use of water per unit than irrigated agriculture 3 4 hydroelectric power 3 4 1 storage volumes of reservoirs table 4 summarizes storage volumes of hydropower reservoirs and associated power generation by riparian state sub river basin hydro reservoir treaty agreement and climate water availability scenario the results indicate that the newly formed samendeni reservoir with 1 05 km3 capacity behind the smd on the black volta river will optimally store more water in wet seasons for dry seasons use without the treaty arrangement for the low water supply scenario the optimization model moves water throughout the system to meet the pareto improvement criterion by which all riparians are at least as well off with the treaty as without it results showed some declines in economic values of agriculture offset by larger gains in hydropower results of this optimization showed that the samendeni reservoir would optimally store less with the treaty arrangement this occurs because of the constraint of releasing historical flow to ghana to supply high valued hydropower currently an undeveloped engine of economic growth throughout the basin the irrigation system of this reservoir is downstream so more releases means more hydropower production and water for irrigation the reservoir behind burkina faso s bagre dam on the nakambe river upstream of ghana s pmd will optimally store a large amount of water in wet seasons and dry seasons as well as supplying power and water for irrigation farming with the optimized management of water under a treaty agreement less water would be stored in the bagre reservoir as water will be released for hydropower and downstream irrigation more pronounced under the climate induced low flow scenario burkina faso s kompienga reservoir with 2 05 km3 storage capacity on the ouale headwater of the river oti is optimized to hold more storage volume and release for hydropower generation in times of low flow the reservoir operation will optimally store high volume and make available water releases for hydropower production as well as supply of water for domestic use in times of climate induced low supply when releases are most valued ghana s pwalugu reservoir formed behind the new pmd is optimized by our model to hold lower storage volume prior to wet seasons to allow flood flows to be captured pmd s reservoir will hold optimized averages of 2 109 m3 in the wet and 1 689 million m3 in the dry season with the treaty arrangement under the historically observed flow scenario however with climate water stress storage volume will optimally fall to 1 341 m3 in the wet season as well as 608 million m3 in the dry season water releases for hydroelectricity and downstream irrigation use in dry seasons would produce lower volume which also means that more flood flows would optimally be captured in wet seasons our results show that with the treaty arrangement the pmd optimally managed will capture spillage from bagre dam and localized floodwaters upstream in wet seasons reducing flood damages below the pwalugu gage the bui reservoir behind the dam on the black volta river upstream of lake volta under optimized management will hold large volumes in wet seasons and provide releases for hydroelectricity generation and downstream dry season irrigated agricultural production the reservoir s large storage capacity will augment flows to downstream lake volta with the treaty arrangement under the scenarios of both historically observed and climate induced low water supply and support ghana s hydroelectricity production and supply to the five upstream countries table 4 also shows that lake volta under optimized management will hold more storage and provide releases for hydroelectricity and downriver irrigation use with the treaty policy table 4 shows that ghana s reservoirs would optimally store more water and produce more hydropower with their capacities made possible with the treaty arrangement than without it 3 4 2 hydroelectric power generation table 4 also presents the results of power production from hydro dams in burkina faso and ghana by water availability scenario burkina faso s dams have considerably lower installed capacities than those in ghana burkina faso s total installed capacity including the capacity of the newly operational smd is 32 74 mw ghana would have a total installed capacity of 1 690 mw after the pmd s hybrid solar hydro project completion for which that project is described in more detail elsewhere vra 2020 from table 4 considering generation capacities in our model under the historically observed flow situation the akosombo dam optimally managed will produces an annual average of 4 504 gwh without the treaty policy and 4 927 gwh with the treaty policy in contrast with the climate induced low water availability the akosombo dam optimally managed will produce an annual average of 3 033 gwh without the treaty and 3 496 gwh with the treaty a yearly average of 487 gwh under the climate induced low water supply situation and 722 gwh in the historical observed flow pattern appears for the bui dam with the treaty in comparison the kpong dam is estimated to generate a yearly average of 939 and 674 gwh with the treaty policy in the historically observed and climate induced low flow contexts with the treaty the pmd optimally managed produces yearly averages of 133 gwh under the historically observed water availability condition and 94 gwh under the climate induced low water availability situation in light of these facts the volta basin is an ideal candidate for future optimization modelling work that identifies the optimized timing sizing and sequencing of future storage capacity developments table 4 also reveals that the bagre power plant is estimated to produce a yearly average of 82 gwh without the treaty and 80 gwh with the treaty under the historically observed flow scenario and 48 gwh irrespective of the treaty policy in the climate induced low flow context a yearly average of 27 gwh is forecasted to be produced by the kompienga dam with the treaty policy under the historically observed flow scenario and 16 gwh regardless of the treaty policy in the climate induced low water availability situation the smd optimally managed will supply an annual average of 19 gwh under the historically observed flow situation and 7 gwh in the context of climate induced low flow with the treaty our model predicts that the hydroelectricity generation of all the power plants in the basin will fall because of the lower river flow and reservoir storage volumes in the climate change context in that context there is a forecasted 30 reduction of volta system runoff however optimally managed generation delivery capacities at pwalugu bui akosombo and kpong power plants would increase with the treaty compared to without it the increased generation capacities of ghana s dam stem from the pareto required average historical flows to ghana from the five upstream countries with the treaty 3 4 3 hydroelectric power trade for a basin area such as the volta with a long history of weak electricity access hydroelectric power will optimally move to where it is economically most valued to improve access and ensure cost efficiency and energy security fortunately a transmission system to trade export and import power exists and continues to be developed in the volta basin a transmission line to export electricity from ghana to togo and benin has existed since 1972 with interconnection expansion expected completed in 2022 in 2019 a 225 kv transmission line between burkina faso and ghana was completed another 225 kv transmission line between ghana and mali is under construction with a planned commercial operation date in 2022 a 225 kv line has interconnected the national power grids of côte d ivoire and ghana since 1983 with a new 330 kv line parallel to the existing line currently under construction to satisfy the increasing demand for power exchange between the two countries a treaty allowing for power trading could make it possible for upstream countries with generation deficits to import more electricity cheaper than alternative sources from the downstream country ghana with surplus production in exchange for its historical inflows the trade can improve the overall efficiency in the basin s water use with the development of the transmission infrastructure in the region table 5 shows the potential hydroelectric power trade transactions optimized by the model by riparian state policy and climate water supply scenario only burkina faso and ghana both with 82 5 of basin area have hydro plants in the basin with ghana historically producing about 98 of hydroelectric power in the basin with the treaty ghana would be able to produce more electricity since it would secure its historical flows from all the five upstream countries with an opportunity to expand its irrigated farmland and consumptive water use ghana would have the opportunity to put all its hydroelectric power assets to use and produce more electricity and sell to the upstream countries at a discounted price to pay for protection of historical flows the value of power gained in consumption for upstream countries is larger than the cost of reduced water use by those countries that is for any country that receives less water under the optimized response to a treaty the value of electric power made available more than offsets the loss in physical water use showing an economically favorable substitution of capital for water table 5 shows the pattern of production exports imports and consumption that optimally emerge from the treaty in the basin table 5 reveals that all the five upstream countries would import some hydropower from ghana made attractive by lower power prices than they can secure domestically without power imports from ghana burkina faso with 42 of the basin s land area the major headwater supplier faces the highest current electricity prices in the basin it averages about 46 5 higher than would be seen if ghana exported power mali would optimally import an annual average of 555gwh and 420gwh under the historically observed and climate induced low flow scenarios likewise benin côte d ivoire and togo would import optimized yearly averages of 550 545 and 605 gwh under the historically observed flow scenario and 415 410 and 470 gwh in the context of climate induced low water availability it is important to point out that mali benin côte d ivoire and togo would be able to consume some electricity even though they generate no power in the basin because of their geographic location these countries have plans to build storage reservoirs on the rivers of the basin in the future which may be detrimental to ghana bekoe et al 2016 mccartney et al 2012 burkina faso which produces about 2 of electricity in the basin and has limited hydroelectric power production potential due to its geographic location in the basin would consume the electricity it produces plus larger quantities of imported electricity with a treaty our findings suggest the considerable gains from a treaty in promoting a cost efficient reliable power supply and improve electricity access in the basin ghana would effectively put all its generation assets to use while exporting excess electricity that its domestic market is not able to absorb currently and is less able to absorb with new hydropower generation lacking buyers with the treaty policy ghana s powerplants would produce at their highest capacities the upstream countries would be able to secure hydropower at less cost than alternative power sources improving the efficiency of hydroelectric power production in the basin 3 5 economics 3 5 1 riparian states water uses water availability and treaty scenarios table 6 presents the optimized economic benefits for all riparians water using sectors water availability and treaty policy scenarios the table indicates the discounted net economic benefits from domestic water supply irrigated farm income hydroelectric production and trade reservoir based recreation and flood control an in depth discussion of the results for domestic water supply irrigation hydroelectricity and flood damage reduction follows without discussing in detail the results for recreation to conserve space 3 5 2 economic value of domestic water supply table 6 displays discounted benefits of water supply urban residents for all basin countries it shows domestic water use withdrawals for each country they are constrained so that domestic water demands are always met irrespective of climate water availability and treaty policy scenarios our results show that a total discounted net benefit dnpv of 357 million result for burkina faso over the forecast period mali benin côte d ivoire and togo over the forecast period are estimated to each earn total discounted net benefits of 42 million 35 million 40 million and 96 million regardless of climate water availability and treaty policy scenarios 3 5 3 national income from irrigation irrigation has significant food security implications in all basin countries under the historically observed flow scenario burkina faso could potentially earn an optimized discounted total farm income of 465 million from dry season irrigation of cereals and vegetables with the treaty policy and 472 million without the treaty policy over the forecast period that country s farm income is 419 million with the treaty and 439 million without it while that country s farm income falls in the climate water stress context it falls even more with the treaty than without it this occurs because burkina faso containing about 48 of headwater flows has to reduce its agricultural water use in order to ensure historical average flows to ghana in exchange for higher valued hydroelectric power benefits of course the value of power gained to burkina faso is larger than its value of farm income lost each country is required to achieve a pareto improvement as a consequence of the treaty as no country would voluntarily enter into a treaty that did not maintain or improve their economic conditions for ghana when facing historical flows a forecasted total discounted net income of 456 million is secured with and without the treaty policy by contrast when climate stressed low flows occur a net income of 416 million is secured for ghana in the context of climate stressed low flows our optimization exercise shows that ghana s discounted national farm income does not fall since most of ghana s farmlands are downstream of the multipurpose dams our model predicts that inside ghana hydropower production at the akosombo and kpong power stations will decline slightly with irrigation development downstream of the new pmd and the bui reservoirs all upstream riparian nations experience a slight decline in their total farm income from the optimal management of the river system in the climate stressed low water supply condition the decline in farm income stems from our optimization framework that mathematically allocates water to highest valued uses at the margin agricultural water use is found to be a lower valued than power in this basin cai et al 2008 a competition which has been investigated for a number of years ortolano and cushing 2002 the findings from our optimization exercise provide evidence that the prospective treaty can be pareto improving in light of the storage capacity that can be developed in the basin our results show that the new and existing dams can be operated with the treaty to avoid adverse impacts on any of the riparian states while improving the performance of hydroelectric power production basinwide 3 5 4 economic value of hydropower production trade and use the economic value of hydropower comes from the consumer and producer surpluses from electricity export as well as benefits from domestic use under the historically observed flow situation burkina faso can secure an optimized total discounted net benefits of 2 615 billion with the treaty and 914 million without it by contrast for the climate stressed situation hydroelectricity benefits fall to 566 million without and 1 844 million with the treaty for the other four upstream states with the treaty under historical flows mali benin côte d ivoire and togo secure total discounted net benefits of 738 million 731 million 724 million 814 million respectively over the planning horizon hydropower benefits of the four countries fall to 396 million 391 million 402 million and 460 million respectively under climate stressed flows for downstream ghana under historical flows results show a total discounted net benefit of 34 billion with the treaty and 28 billion without it by contrast in the situation of climate induced low supplies optimized hydropower benefits fall to 23 6 billion with the treaty and 19 4 billion without it 3 5 5 economic value of flood control the economic benefits of flood control are included in the overall optimization for ghana s pmd it measures flood damages avoided davies 2018 kasei et al 2016 mechler et al 2010 gupta et al 2003 as a result of pmd s floodwater storage capacity results show that the reservoir to be formed behind the pmd produces average annual damage reduction by 78 in the downstream catchment areas below the pwalugu gauge baah kumi and ward 2020 our optimization exercise shows that with the multilateral water and power trade treaty in place the pmd improves the economic performance of flood management the pmd reduces flood damages considerably to 2 819 million and 178 million occurring only at the initial construction and filling stages of pmd s reservoir under historical water supplies and climate stresses supplies respectively 3 6 total economic benefits table 6 further shows total discounted net benefits summed over years by riparian state water availability and treaty policy scenarios our results reveal that each riparian nation has the potential to secure national economic gains from signing onto the treaty described in this paper all basin countries improve economically from the presence and efficient management of the two new and existing dams with the treaty compared to without it this occurs even though burkina faso is assumed to shoulder the 105 million total costs of the smd and ghana bearing all the 993 million costs of the pmd for burkina faso the smd s large storage capacity will augment the hydroelectric power productive capacity of kompienga and bagre dams while improving water based recreation in addition to providing water for irrigation and domestic water supply for ghana the pmd s reservoir will hold floodwaters during wet seasons and years releasing the water for hydropower and domestic water supply in dry periods effectively enhancing water availability in dry periods results from our analysis provide important insights concerning the additional upper basin storage development the smd if efficiently managed can potentially improve dry season irrigation farming downstream of the dam with the treaty the smd would also encourage fishing and other recreational activities and provide hydroelectric power to supply the agro industrial zone of burkina faso s samendeni valley integrated development program biney 2010 moreover the presence and efficient operation of ghana s pmd with its flood damage reduction potential in northern ghana offers the prospect of dry season irrigated farmland development and expansion in ghana and burkina faso respectively with the treaty our model results also show that without a water agreement and hydropower trading among the six basin countries increased irrigation water withdrawal by upstream countries would weaken the power generation delivery capacity performed by the lower basin dams our optimization model over the 20 year horizon finds that with the agreement no basin country needs to be worse off beyond hydropower countries can potentially benefit from access to domestic water use expanded crop irrigation fish production tourism and some protection from floods and droughts 4 discussion the forces of climate water stress forecasted population growth and increasing competition over transboundary water resources internationally have attracted research efforts addressing the benefits and costs of adapting to these forces through strategic water development and benefit sharing agreements the volta basin is unique in the sense that major hydropower dams are located in its wet downstream reaches while most water use occurs in its drier upstream catchment regions while its upstream countries mainly use water for agriculture downstream ghana mostly uses water for hydropower generation from dams that depend heavily on inflows from upriver catchment areas hydropower produces the lion s share of the benefits from the treaty described here historically that part of africa has been power limited for many times of the year which has constrained their development relative to that history the presence of additional low cost power potentially available under a proposed treaty likely will attract eager buyers especially those whose sectors are currently or could become power intensive that potential for larger quantities and more affordable power under the treaty described provides incentives for all riparian countries to hammer out a treaty our framework considers ghana to offer hydropower at reduced prices to burkina faso togo côte d ivoire benin and mali as an incentive to trade for protecting its historical transboundary supply patterns into its reservoir system a hydroelectric power price prediction demand function incorporated in our framework allows prices to fall with increased power production koch and vögele 2009 schoengold et al 2006 which in turn depend on river inflow and storage of hydropower dams more inflow into the dams other things equal produces higher storage head releases power production and reduced power prices as required by any neoclassical economic demand function one well known previous work focused onmultisector water allocation water and energy linkages in cooperative water sharing arrangements between two of the basin s countries ghana and burkina faso bhaduri and liebe 2013 the results of the present investigation demonstrate multisector water allocation allowing for water and energy trade relationship among all upstream riparian states and one downstream state brought on from recent upper basin large storage development initiatives findings from our investigation can motivate multilateral agreements as well as guide debates over the design of transboundary water management strategies in the ongoing development of a water charter for the region results from this work can also provide a decision making guide for cooperative water and related infrastructure management considering the basin s complex water use interdependence the analysis of this investigation is limited by the scarcity of research grade hydrologic data the work faced the challenge of tracking recent data on the basin s surface water flows motivating our reliance on historical data only 20 gauging stations with sufficient historical data for long periods were used in tracking stream flows the limitation of gauging stations with long term data may reduce the accuracy of our cross border and within country flow measurements another limitation of our model is the difficulty of a precise specification of flood damages our flood damage formulation approximates the extent of floodwaters overtopping the white volta riverbanks a mathematical function that captures losses from reduced flooding and associated costs from pmd s controlled flows was specified for its downstream gauge 12 pwalugu because of a lack of reliable information on the economic costs of flooding however tributaries joining the white volta watercourse downstream of the pwalugu gauge have been shown to contribute to flooding in the catchment but not directly used in our model other limitations of our model formulation stemming from the lack of research grade data are the exclusion of land use change sediment transport and groundwater flow impacts as well as water quality considerations yet another limitation is our finding that flows to the downstream state are economically desired from the basin s view as part of the potential growth in hydropower production this finding that ghana would continue to receive its existing flows as part of the proposed treaty has the potential to enshrine the existing power imbalances in the basin this finding does reflect one element of a pareto improvement outcome by which each country is at least as well off under the treaty as they are under the status quo water allocation scheme still a skeptic might state that ghana had no right to receive those high flows in the first place and that it should be receiving reduced future flows as part of a more socially just future water allocation to make up for past water injustice that skeptic may also state that optimizing the basin by assigning a high priority for hydropower production may not reflect the wishes for the upstream states even if economically the most efficient as well as producing a pareto improvement in addition our model does not comprehensively include all sources of the basin s water abstraction because of the difficulty in obtaining water diversion data for all demand sites for all basin countries we relied on information from several medium sized and large irrigated systems as well as areas of residential use in published reports and peer reviewed journal literature future work could profitably examine the economic attractiveness of alternative sources such as recycling and reuse new wellfield development water importation and increased desalination on coastal areas to mention only four many policy experiments such as analyzing the impact of the provision of irrigated agriculture subsidies changes in input pricing expansion of installed capacities of hydroelectric power and agricultural trade policies on system improvements must await future work water abstraction of micro and small irrigation schemes and other use sectors such as industry predicted to expand its use will be included in the model as data become available 4 1 stakeholder engagement and cooperation models can inform policy design when informed by views of stakeholders when the models track trade offs associated with conflicting interests mccartney et al 2019 pettinotti et al 2018 hurford and harou 2014 while stakeholders were not directly engaged to inform development of our model we formulated it to meet principles of stakeholder interests in the volta basin some of those interests were expressed in a 2018 world bank document draft water charter for the volta river basin world bank 2018 on page 17 of that document a statement of the broad principle motivated the document was described as the state parties to the water charter shall cooperate on the basis of the principles of international law within the authority to fulfil their legally binding obligations to achieve sustainable management of the basin s water resources and environment world bank 2018 the present volta basin model has the potential to support stakeholders in dialogue debate and decision making from the results of our modelling exercise shown in this paper effects of a treaty proposal and reservoir development plan can be assessed from several stakeholder views most notably alternative views regarding each of five competing uses of water in the basin results presented here have the potential to promote open dialogue and debate among views supporting each of the five water uses described earlier in the paper that dialogue could promote mutual understanding and consensus over hard questions dealing with water policy the tabled results show complex combinations of two policy scenarios as well as two climate water scenarios historical and climate stressed several overarching observations are worth making where new infrastructure is proposed debate by affected stakeholders can identify institutional technical or operational constraints needing attention to make for a more acceptable future to more people in more countries investigation of potential economic benefits from any proposed policy influenced by any climate scenario can promote better community relations between affected stakeholders and treaty designers based on national priorities of the riparian states and their donor partners the volta basin authority vba now has information to improve all riparians economic performance arising from benefits of a treaty these potential benefits can motivate increased cooperation and with cooperation can come growing financial and technical resources gains from a proposed treaty and new dam occurring from an optimized development and management of the volta watershed are shown these gains have the potential to contribute to more reliable secure and affordable water and power services 4 2 limitations of dam development building dams on rivers to produce hydropower can help mitigate the world s energy shortages as well as reduce the cost of adapting to global climate change however it has been known for years that damming also has the potential to produce large negative effects on the environment and on important key ecological assets fan et al 2015 poor design or operation of hydropower dams can cause transboundary water problems like flooding sedimentation river fragmentation and loss of important ecosystem function as well as cultural clash pecos 2007 moreover hydropower production is highly vulnerable to climate change as shown by our model and by other studies bieberet al 2018 bekoe et al 2016 so there remains a need to diversify the power sector of the basin to include other renewable energy geothermal power biomass energy wind energy and solar energy sources 5 conclusions ongoing stress from climate change variability and high population growth heightens water use interdependencies among riparian countries which can lead to conflict few studies have successfully integrated the volta basin s hydrologic and economic performance in analyzing multisector water allocation as well as water and energy issue linkage in cooperative water sharing arrangements for burkina faso and ghana however some studies assert that high population growth and climate change will rapidly increase consumptive water use of burkina faso as well as other four upstream countries mali benin côte d ivoire and togo results of our work indicate that all basin countries have the prospect to attain significant economic gains from hydroelectric power production and power trading with the water sharing treaty than without it under both historically observed flow and climate stressed scenarios however under the climate stressed scenario all upstream countries would have to cut their agricultural water consumption in exchange for discounted hydroelectricity prices nonetheless the total economic gains from added hydroelectric power production and trade outweigh total economic losses in farm income this of course is a limited version of social justice a more comprehensive version would assure that each significant block of people within each country is at least as well off with the treaty compared to without it an important and ambitious goal for future research in the final analysis our results show only potential gains real negotiation by real people informed by models such as the one developed for this paper will need to occur to turn the potential gains indicated by our work into realized economic gains each country declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
