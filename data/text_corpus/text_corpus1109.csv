5545,with the aim of simulating non point source pollution of the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types to address the drawbacks of the soil and water assessment tool swat in estimating the accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth pattern in addition a dominant vegetation abundance remote sensing inversion model and leaf area index lai and extinction coefficient remote sensing inversion model were set up to obtain relevant parameters of the forest growth model moreover based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model this was done to explore the intercropping growth model as well as the remote sensing inversion method considering the multiple cropping and intercropping indexes we selected the meijiang river basin as the study area a sub basin of the poyang lake basin in china in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region to explore the validity of the modified swat based on field data the results show that the modified swat outperformed the original model in terms of simulated flow and nutrient load using variables such as vegetation coverage different forest components e g coniferous forest broadleaf forest and sparse shrubs and lai as for simulated flow the validity of the modified swat was increased by 7 8 and simulation of the average maximum minimum and total flow rates were closer to the measured values better reflecting the actual surface water storage in the simulation of nutrient load validity was increased by 6 4 total phosphorus and 6 1 total nitrogen better representing macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the forest vegetation landscape keywords modified swat multi plant growth mode non point source pollution poyang lake basin meijiang river basin 1 introduction the agroforestry system is an important ecosystem for the formation and development of non point source pollution which involves various processes of meteorology soil hydrology plant growth farming activities and management all of which are inseparable from the agroforestry ecosystem simulation on scales of time and space using distributed mechanized non point source models is an effective approach for quantitatively studying and evaluating the impact of the agroforestry system on non point source pollution currently several main models have been applied to study non point source pollution loads in the watershed such as hydrological simulation program fortran annualized agricultural non point source area nonpoint source watershed environmental response simulation spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes generalized watershed loading functions and soil and water assessment tool swat ouyang et al 2018 which have certain limitations in describing the plant growth mode among the many distributed non point source models swat is the most widely used mechanized model with promising prospects for application krysanova and arnold 2008 as a time continuous semi distributed and process oriented river basin model swat has been widely used in modeling hydrological features e g surface runoff infiltration lateral flow groundwater flow backflow snowmelt runoff soil temperature and humidity evapotranspiration sediment yield transport crop growth nutrient transport and water quality duan et al 2019 gassman et al 2007 mekonnen et al 2018 and biophysical processes e g biomass crop growth and yield gassman et al 2014 kauffman et al 2014 lai et al 2012 the model has been applied to basins covering an area ranging from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of square kilometers even up to national or continental spatial scales for example jayakrishnan et al 2005 used swat to macroscopically analyze the effects of water resource management measures such as water quality and quantity in the united states and on the north american continent the time scale of application varies from several hours or days to decades for a precipitation process muttiah and wurbs 2002 although the swat has been widely used worldwide the single plant growth pattern in this model is limited for expressing the state of forest vegetation featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types as well as different planting systems and farming practices therefore the model fails to consider the influences of vegetational landscapes cropping systems and farming practices on non point source pollution to solve the above problems international studies have been carried out to revise the model to varying degrees for example watson et al 2005 and macdonald et al 2005 replaced the swat plant growth model with the 3 pg mechanism model of forest growth through introducing and modifying the agricultural land management and numerical assessment criteria almanac plant model kiniry et al 2008 overcame the shortcomings of swat in simulating forest ecosystems with respect to water and biogeochemical cycles for purpose of reasonably simulating the seasonal dynamics of the biome strauch and volk 2013 proposed a logistic leaf area index lai decline function in swat modification alemayehu et al 2017 presented a modified swat version for the tropics swat t thus can improve the plant growth module of swat for simulating the seasonal growth cycles for trees and perennial vegetation in the tropics the upgraded version i e swat considering multiple plant community growth with competition offered more flexibility with regard to the delineation and interaction of spatial objects in a watershed bieger et al 2017 many related studies have been conducted in china during recent years based on hydrological characteristics of the irrigated areas of hilly regions in south china where rice is grown dai and cui 2009 improved the irrigation water movement and rice water circulation modules the water balance of rice fields and the production simulation method for swat adding the canal leakage simulation module and its recharge effect on groundwater as well as the irrigation module of small reservoirs xie and cui 2009 improved the swat for rice field evapotranspiration controlled irrigation and drainage plus real time irrigation from small reservoirs simulating water movement processes of irrigation modes such as intermittent irrigation and basin irrigation for basins with insufficient irrigation experimental data shi et al 2010 modified the automatic irrigation system of rice fields based on the swat and constructed a multi water source integrated irrigation module according to characteristics of the artificial natural hydrological cycle in plain irrigation areas and considering artificial disturbances such as irrigation drainage and river channels in those areas zhen et al 2011 improved the swat regarding methods of extracting ditches and river networks division of sub basins and hydrological response units hrus and calculation of crop water consumption ma et al 2019 proposed an enhanced swat modeling approach with remotely sensed lai replaced the lai simulated by built in environmental policy integrated climate epic module which was aiming to further increase the applicability of swat in vegetation dynamics of tropical or subtropical areas however only a few studies have considered the limitations of the original swat in estimating the accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth model to explore non point source pollution on the basis of currently available non point source pollution models it is of practical importance to study non point source pollution modeling and simulation methods based on the forest vegetation landscape in subtropical humid monsoon climate zones as well as characteristics of the planting system and farming mode in rice growing areas of south china obtaining relevant parameters such as vegetation mixing ratio multiple cropping and intercropping using remote sensing technology hence with the aim of simulating non point source pollution of the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types to address drawbacks of the swat in estimating accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth pattern in addition a dominant vegetation abundance remote sensing inversion model and lai and extinction coefficient ec remote sensing inversion model were established to obtain relevant parameters of the forest growth model moreover based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model we selected the meijiang river basin as the study area a sub basin of the poyang lake basin in china in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region to explore the validity of the modified swat based on field data 2 application limitations and modification of plant growth patterns of swat 2 1 original plant growth pattern of the swat derived from the simplified epic the swat plant growth model simulates the growth of all plants with a single plant growth pattern consisting of two parts the biomass accumulation and ideal leaf area development patterns the details of which are given below 1 the maximum daily biomass increase is estimated based on the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area neitsch et al 2004 1 δ b i o d r u e r e g h phosyn where δbio is the potential increase of total biomass per day rue is the radiation utilization rate of plants d is the average density in hru and reg is the comprehensive stress factor of temperature moisture and nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients the value of which ranges from 0 to 1 practical the actual vegetation growth considers constraints from water stress temperature and nutrients for example temperature stress is expressed by the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures required for plant crop growth and is described by the s shaped curve of the growth the three fundamental point temperature and other stress factors are stored in the swat plant growth database as the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area in a given time the variable h phosyn is determined using the equation 2 h phosyn 0 5 h day 1 exp k l l a i where h day is the total radiation in a given period 0 5h day is the photosynthetically active radiation kl is the ec default value of 0 65 and lai is estimated based on the ideal leaf area development model 2 ideal leaf area development model during the early stage of plant growth before leaf area reaches its maximum value the canopy height and leaf area development are controlled by the ideal leaf area development model curve 3 f r l a im x f r phu f r phu exp ℓ 1 ℓ 2 f r phu where frlaimx is the maximum lai ratio corresponding to the potential heat unit ratio frphu frphu is the potential heat unit ratio of the plant in a given period during the growing season and l 1 and l 2 are shape factors the calculation of frphu is via 4 f r phu i 1 d hu phu where hu is the cumulative heat unit on day i and phu is the total heat unit of the plant the shape factors are calculated by solving eq 3 based on two known points i e frlai 1 frphu 1 and frlai 2 frphu 2 and the equations are 5 ℓ 1 ln f r phu 1 f r lai 1 f r phu 1 ℓ 2 f r phu 1 6 ℓ 2 ln f r phu 1 f r lai 1 f r phu 1 ln f r phu 2 f r lai 2 f r phu 2 f r phu 2 f r phu 1 the canopy height on a specific day can be calculated via 7 h c h c m x fr laimx where hc is the given canopy height m on a specific day and hc mx is the maximum canopy height of the plant 2 2 problems in plant growth patterns in the swat 2 2 1 drawbacks of original plant growth pattern in swat the swat is primarily suitable for non point source simulation in areas with intensive agricultural activity gassman et al 2007 because of differences between agricultural system and forestry system many studies have been conducted with the aim of modifying swat however the 3 pg introduced by watson et al 2005 and macdonald et al 2005 must be supported by a large amount of forest growth data which makes the model more complex and limits its application originating from the epic almanac is a general model applicable to multiple crops the crop growth pattern is no longer single but the efficiency of intercropping is not considered during biomass accumulation kiniry et al 2008 although appropriate corrections were made in the latest version i e swat 2012 the ec and lai two important parameters in the biomass accumulation process remain in a simplified form that is the ecs of all plants were set to 0 65 by default whereas the lai was estimated based on average plant density and controlled by a uniform ideal leaf area development model it is difficult to describe vegetation landscape in forestry system featuring mixed vegetation types and planting methods in agricultural system featuring intercropping using such a single plant growth model the forestry and agricultural system are not only the important subsystems of the basin ecosystem but also the important interface for the n and p cycles such simplification somewhat limits application of the model to these subsystems 2 2 2 limitations of swat in simulating intercropping farming practices the swat is mainly used to estimate the non point source load of large basins and predict and evaluate the long term influences of different soils land use cover types and agricultural management on water sediment deposition and agricultural chemicals nonetheless owing to its single plant growth pattern swat is limited in expressing complex planting methods moreover regarding farming management although a variety of farming activities and management methods are considered such consideration is mainly based on extensive farming in north american and european countries watson et al 2005 thereby making the model inapplicable to cropping systems and farming practice methods in china such as intercropping however these farming practices have greatly changed the light energy utilization efficiency and absorption of n and p by crops and have affected the circulation of nutrients gao et al 2009 tsubo et al 2005 2 3 modification of the swat based on multi plant growth model 2 3 1 adjustment and modification of the forest growth model the original swat plant growth model is applicable to forest growth nevertheless the model has the following problems first owing to small seasonal changes in leaf area there will be an error if the leaf area of evergreen trees is estimated based on the ideal leaf area development model second the ec of the canopy of all forest vegetation is set to 0 65 third the average density represents the density of the forest in view of the above considerations swat as related to the growth model of forest vegetation was modified as follows 1 for deciduous trees the original plant growth model was still applied 2 for evergreen trees the ideal leaf area development model was replaced by the lai and remote sensing vegetation index statistical model 3 for the ec the unified ec 0 65 was replaced by establishing the remote sensing ec model of the dominant plant type in the study area the latter model was determined according to the statistical relationship between the measured ec and remote sensing vegetation index 4 the plant growth model of the mixed deciduous and evergreen broadleaf conifer forest was determined via the following equation 8 h p h o s y n i 1 n p i h phosyn i here pi is the proportion of the i type dominant tree species in the mixed forest represented by the dominant vegetation abundance in the basin which can be obtained using remote sensing h phosyn i is the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of the i type dominant tree species at a given time and n is the number of dominant tree species in the mixed forest 5 for the modification of forest density the density of swat plant growth is reflected by the maximum incremental equation of daily biomass i e eq 1 this is not a major problem for crop planting but it is too important to be ignored in the forest system among the original input variables of swat forest density is mainly reflected in the second level classification of forest land in land use cover types i e forest and shrub land therefore the forest vegetation coverage in the basin extracted via remote sensing by the advanced land imager ali on nasa s earth observing 1 satellite was introduced in eq 1 to replace the average density d 2 3 2 establishment of crop growth model under intercropping intercropping is a planting method to achieve intensive planting in time and space the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of intercropped high stalk crops in a given period was obtained according to an equation proposed by keating and carberry 1993 9 h phosyn h 0 5 h day 1 exp k l h l a i h 1 k l h l a i h 2 k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l 1 exp k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of the intercropped low stalk crops in a given period was calculated based on 10 h phosyn l 0 5 h day k l l l a i l k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l 1 exp k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l where lai h 1 lai h 2 and lai l are lais of the upper and lower layers of high stalk crops and the lai of low stalk crops respectively kl h and kl l are the ecs of high and low stalk crops respectively with the upper and lower layers divided by the canopy height of low stalk crops lai h 1 and lai h 2 can be calculated according to 11 la i h 1 h h h l h h l a i h la i h 2 h l h h l a i h where h h and h l are the canopy heights of high stalk and low stalk crops respectively which are obtained from a database of traits and growth habits of those crops hence the maximum daily accumulated biomass produced by intercropping is expressed by 12 δ b i o r u e i h h phosyn h i l h phosyn l where i h and i l are the intercropping indexes of high stalk and low stalk crops respectively the intercropping index refers to the proportion of a specific crop in an intercropping system the intercropping indexes of various crops were obtained using remote sensing technology based on the established intercropping index remote sensing model 2 4 correction and compilation of source code of the swat the swat is compiled using fortran with its execution framework consisting of a main program and large number of subroutines swat contains 307 program files three new variables were constructed for eqs 8 and 12 p dominant vegetation abundance i h intercropping index of high stalk crops and i l intercropping index of low stalk crops there was no need to add the lai and ec because these were included in the original swat because the lai of swat is a variable in the hru i e the lais of vegetation are uniform in the hru the values of p i h and i l in eqs 8 and 12 were taken at the hru level further readnewvar f was added which is a corresponding data reading subroutine once this subroutine was revised the variables required by the model included original variables namely lai and the k i e kl in eq 2 which has the same meaning as ec mentioned later as well as the newly added variables p i h and i l because swat has certain limitations in the simulation of intercropping interplant a logical variable used to determine whether there is intercropping in a specific hru was added to modify the farming management module of swat moreover interplantmgt the new intercropping module was added based on the original management module this module was equipped with a new function which is to allow the management of multiple crops the swat was modified and compiled in microsoft visual studio 2005 using the intel visual fortran compiler 11 1 067 3 study area and data preparation for the swat 3 1 study area meijiang river basin 26 17ʹ34ʹʹn 27 08ʹ54ʹʹn 115 44ʹ28ʹʹe 116 16ʹ06ʹʹe one of the sub basins of the poyang lake basin was selected as the study area with a catchment area of 3304 km2 fig 1 the basin is dominated by mid altitude and low mountains with elevations from 170 to 1440 m and average elevation 379 1 m the meijiang river originates from wangpizhang at the northern edge of xiaotian village in ningdu county jiangxi province in china and runs through the entire meijiang river basin climate in the basin is mild and humid featuring a clear monsoon and abundant rainfall annual average temperature is 17 3 c with an extreme maximum temperature of 37 9 c and extreme minimum temperature of 6 2 c annual rainfall is 1706 mm and annual average relative humidity is 80 soil in the meijiang basin is mostly deep and fertile red soil and yellow red soil developed from metamorphic rocks and granites comprising loam and sandy loam soil types zonal vegetation in the basin is subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest with a forest coverage rate of 70 natural forest accounts for 87 of total forest area vegetation in the basin mainly includes coniferous forest mixed evergreen deciduous and broadleaf forest evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest bamboo forest low forest shrubs and grasses because the study area is in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone there is mainly mixed forest there even in planted forests there is often more than one species of forest tree among the natural vegetation evergreen broadleaf and coniferous forests dominate the dominant species of coniferous forests are pinus massoniana and cunninghamia lanceolata which are mainly in hilly lowland there are 17 tree species in the evergreen broadleaf forest but the dominant species castanopsis fargesii and c sclerophylla are mainly in high mountains with altitudes above 600 700 m where there is little human activity zhang et al 2010 the low hills are dominated by cinnamomum camphora and schima superba which are mainly near residential areas the deciduous broadleaf forest has a vertical zonal distribution the low lying lowland is dominated by populus eucalyptus melia azedarach and sapium sebiferum whereas the mid altitude and high mountains mainly have liquidambar formosana hance and quercus aliena var acuteserrata the bamboo forest is dominated by phyllostachys pubescens mazel the total amount of which is not great and is mainly in lowland areas fruit orchards and tea plantations are sporadically distributed throughout the basin the river system in the basin is made up of six main rivers the meijiang main stream linchi tributary huangpi tributary huitong tributary zhukeng tributary and guhou tributary fig 1 the water volume of the five tributaries accounts for 92 3 of the total water volume of meijiang river according to demographic data of 2010 the ratio of the primary secondary and tertiary industries in the meijiang basin is 24 7 39 7 35 6 agriculture is mainly based on rice cultivation but crops such as navel orange and lotus seed are also planted there are six counties in the study area guangchang le an ningdu shicheng xingguo and yihuang ningdu county accounts for 96 4 of the study area 3 2 data input and processing the data involved in the swat simulation consist of the following two datasets 1 basic data required by the swat i e digital elevation model dem river network land use and cover soil type and its physical and chemical properties plant and plant growth fertilizer hydrological and water quality meteorological livestock husbandry and population emissions neitsch et al 2004 among these hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for modeling model parameter determination and verification 2 data required by the modified swat including forest vegetation and intercropping parameters such as vegetation coverage dominant vegetation abundance lai the ec of canopies of the dominant forest vegetation intercropping index and multiple cropping index 3 2 1 method for obtaining forest vegetation and intercropping parameters 3 2 1 1 estimation of dominant vegetation abundance based on remote sensing reflecting the proportion of unit area of a specific forest component in the basin dominant vegetation abundance is an important variable in the modified swat in our study based on a linear mixed model the spatial distribution of dominant vegetation abundance in the study area was obtained using remote sensing the linear mixed model assumed the spectra of mixed pixels to be a linear combination of the spectra of the various surface features within the instantaneous field of view adams et al 1986 hilll et al 1998 according to actual ground cover in the study area the ground cover of the area was divided into seven components broadleaf forest coniferous forest grassland and sparse shrubs bare land water body cultivated land and residential land forest vegetation comprised the following three components broadleaf forest coniferous forest and grassland and sparse shrubs chen et al 2012 proposed a method for extracting ground cover abundance based on remote sensing the extracted abundance was based on pixels in the remote sensing image and the ground cover abundance of seven surface features in one pixel had a cumulative value of 1 the vegetation abundance of broadleaf forest coniferous forest grassland and sparse shrubs is shown in fig 2 3 2 1 2 remote sensing inversion of lai and ec of canopies of dominant forest vegetation the lai and ec are important in the modified swat as parameters of the underlying surface of the epigeosphere which characterize the canopy structure and light energy utilization of the vegetation located in the mid subtropical humid climate zone southern china has abundant rainfall and its vegetation is mostly mixed and unevenly distributed evenly distributed vegetation covering a large area is rare therefore it is difficult to obtain the lai and ec of a single tree species or single vegetation type based on current remote sensing technology and the remote sensing data source the lai or ec inverted using remote sensing can only be those of the dominant vegetation types within a certain spatial range to better match measured data of lai and photosynthetically active radiation which were used to estimate the ec and to reflect mixed and unevenly distributed vegetation with the landsat etm as the remote sensing data source we used the gram schmidt image fusion method to merge etm data into multispectral data with a spatial resolution of 15 m based on measurement of the lai and photosynthetically active radiation of canopies of the dominant forest vegetation the basin lai was inverted per the empirical equation of the vegetation index method in addition an inversion model was established to calculate the ec of dominant forest vegetation canopies according to the beer lambert law following the method proposed by our study retrieving leaf area index and extinction coefficient of dominated vegetation canopy cover in meijiang watershed of china using image fusion and landsat etm data in chinese published in journal of remote sensing technology and application lai et al 2013 fig 3 shows the lai and ec of dominant vegetation canopies in the study area estimated on the basis of the inversion model 3 2 1 3 remote sensing information extraction of intercropping index and multiple cropping index farming methods in the agricultural system are reflected by the original swat in many ways with a concentration in the farming management module e g sowing fertilization insect control deep tillage and harvesting nonetheless intercropping is not adequately represented in the original swat thus we modified the maximum daily accumulated biomass equation of swat i e eq 12 i h and i l were obtained by establishing an intercropping index remote sensing model multiple cropping is reflected in swat relevant parameters and databases of multiple cropping can be set via the farming management module peng et al 2006 yan et al 2005a yan et al 2005b we also followed a relatively mature method for remote sensing inversion of the multiple cropping index which is based on an approach proposed by pan et al 2012 3 2 2 input of other data 3 2 2 1 dem and river network data extracted from a topographic map with scale 1 50 000 dem and gis data of the river network were mainly used for discretization of the swat 3 2 2 2 land use data data of land use cover types represent the main variable in swat they are also an important reference for estimating emissions from humans and caused by livestock husbandry and for establishing the dominant vegetation abundance model multiple cropping index and intercropping index model and lai and ec model to obtain land use cover types in the study area data obtained by the advanced land imager served as the remote sensing data source i e level 1gst data from the international scientific data service platform of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http datamirror csdb cn multispectral and panchromatic gram schmidt data were merged to generate a multispectral false color composite image with resolution 10 m the land use cover types in the study area were visually interpreted and results were reviewed and verified several times finally 10 land use cover types were identified rural residential land urban and transport construction land dry land unused land paddy fields low vegetation including grassland and shrubs open forest forest land rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds fig 4 3 2 2 3 soil data soil data mainly included soil type and its physical and chemical properties the data were derived from the cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county report completed in 2009 for ningdu county in jiangxi province and a soil census completed in 1986 province 1988 the scale of the soil type spatial distribution map is 1 50 000 fig 5 swat s soil database usersoil includes 17 physical properties among which sol clay layer sol silt layer sol sand layer sol rock layer and sol z layer were converted based on a report of the soil survey office ningdu county in jiangxi province province 1988 variables such as sol bd layer sol awc layer sol k layer sol cbn layer and usle k were converted and calculated according to wei et al 2007 seven chemical properties are stored in the swat soil input file chm 3 2 2 4 plant crop growth data the growth data of plants and crops mainly included agrometeorological parameters e g effective accumulated temperature minimum temperature maximum temperature and optimum temperature required for the growth and development of plants as well as parameters involving the variety and traits of plants such as maximum canopy height maximum potential lai ec root depth and harvest index some parameters were already included in the swat such as those for pine cedar rice and soybeans crop parameters exclusive to the study area were data involving the variety and traits of crops in ningdu county obtained from cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county province 1988 3 2 2 5 fertilizer and fertilization data extracted from fertilizer information in cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county fertilizer data included the name and n p and k contents of the applied fertilizer based on which the fertilizer database required by the swat was established sharing the same source data of agricultural fertilization in different parts of the study area covered fertilizer varieties amount of fertilizer applied per ha and the yield per ha of 21 062 households in 24 villages and towns 3 2 2 6 hydrological and water quality data hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for calibrating the parameters and validating the swat the data included the flow rate and nutrient concentration of the river to obtain measured hydrological and water quality data of the study area 87 sub basins were discretized and measurement points were established at nine sections fig 6 these points covered about 70 sub basins accounting for 80 5 of all sub basins in the study area flow rate and water quality were measured six times february 11 april 2 may 8 july 11 september 10 and november 21 in 2011 with sampling elements total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen 3 2 2 7 meteorological data data from nine meteorological stations across the study area were used including temperature maximum and minimum humidity wind speed and precipitation from 1957 to 2011 the above data were transformed into a swat meteorological user database according to the requirements pang et al 2007 moreover precipitation data measured at 33 precipitation stations in the basin from 2005 to 2011 were used as input parameters for model establishment parameter calibration and model validation 3 2 2 8 data of livestock husbandry and population emissions there was forestry agriculture livestock husbandry and a small number of other industries in the study area to make good use of the swat to simulate non point source pollution in the basin emissions from livestock husbandry and humans must be taken into consideration we conducted gis spatial analysis of those emissions to represent them spatially across small and medium sized basins further details are in yi et al 2012 and zeng et al 2013 4 model debugging and parameter calibration a 3000 hm2 convergence area was used as a threshold for spatial discretization to generate 87 sub basins and 700 hrus were obtained based on a division threshold of 20 10 20 land use cover soil slope the period 2005 2011 was used for model debugging 2005 2007 parameter calibration 2008 2010 and model validation 2011 for parameter calibration hydrological parameters were calibrated first next the nutrient load was calibrated during which the hydrological parameters were no longer calibrated and all models used were the original ones parameters calibrated by the original model were used as simulation parameters to modify the model all variables and parameters were the same as those of the original model except that the model was modified and input parameters were adjusted accordingly in addition simulated results of the modified model were analyzed for different research objectives 4 1 parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis of flow rate swat cup a calibration and uncertainty program was used to calibrate the parameters sensitivity of the variables was evaluated using the t test method generally if p 0 05 the parameter was considered to be sensitive the parametric sensitivity test of flow rate involved 13 parameters including cn2 alpha bf gw delay gwqmn gw revap esco and sol awc the names definitions and calibration results of these parameters are shown in table 1 the expanded name of the parameter indicates the name of its database fig 7 shows the calibration sensitivity of the 13 parameters as indicated by the p value ch k2 alpha bf and gw revap were relatively sensitive with ch k2 the most sensitive abbaspour 2011 4 2 parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis of nutrient load parameter calibration of the n nutrient load involved eight parameters including nperco cmn erorgn spcon biomix and shallst n among which nperco and cmn were sensitive to the emission of n nutrients fig 8 a ten parameters e g psp rsdco biomix phoskd and pperco were selected for use in parameter calibration of the p nutrient load psp and spexp were sensitive to the emission of p nutrients with psp the most sensitive fig 8 b table 2 shows the names definitions and calibration results of these parameters based on parameter calibration of n and p the aforementioned sensitive parameters were further adjusted using swat cup to obtain the optimal parameters for simulation then the simulated results were verified based on measured n and p loads and the validity of the simulation was also analyzed 5 model validation 5 1 validation and effectiveness analysis of the original model based on the calibrated parameters we simulated the situation in 2011 using the modified model we analyzed model effectiveness on the basis of water quality data sampled six times at each of the nine sampling points the flow rate measured at a hydrological station in ningdu county during the same period and the flow and nutrient load output at the same section and during the same period as the model the correlation coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns were used to measure the model validity ns was calculated by 13 ns 1 i 1 n ξ oi ξ mi 2 i 1 n ξ oi ξ o 2 where ξo ξo and ξm are the observed average observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of samples the value of ns varies from 1 to 1 with a value close to 1 indicating greater model validity we compared the flow rate of the original model measured flow rate and average basin rainfall we found that the simulated and measured flow rates had essentially the same trend but the simulated and measured peaks were substantially different that is the simulated maximum peak was small whereas the measured small and medium peaks were large fig 9 as indicated by comparison of the simulated flow rate and average basin rainfall the trend of the simulated flow rate was consistent with that of average basin rainfall in contrast the simulation of surface runoff regulation by the model was not as consistent with the actual situation there are many reservoirs of different scale across the study area because relevant data of the reservoirs were not obtained the effect of the reservoirs on regulation and storage of the river channels was not considered which might have caused the relatively poor simulation of base flow and the peak of low rainfall according to our analysis of the effectiveness of flow rate in the original model the r2 between simulated and measured values is 0 753 indicating very strong correlation in addition the ns is 0 686 implying strong model validity table 3 in simulating tp and tn nutrient loads the model showed the same trend for both temporal and spatial flows fig 10 table 4 shows an analysis of the effectiveness of the original model in simulating nutrients from the average maximum and minimum values of nutrient load simulated values were generally larger than measured ones furthermore based on values of r2 and ns the simulation of nutrient load was slightly worse than that of flow rate and the simulation of tn was poorer than that of tp 5 2 validation and effectiveness analysis of the modified swat based on multi plant growth mode by comparing the flow rate of the modified model the measured flow rate and average basin rainfall we found that the simulation of the modified model was basically the same as the original model in terms of flow rate fig 11 however for the peak flow rate fig 9 the modified model showed great improvement indicating that this model can better reflect the actual surface runoff situation the average maximum minimum and total flow rates of the modified model were closer to measured values table 5 the r2 increased by 14 6 from 0 753 for the original model to 0 863 for the modified model the ns rose by 7 8 from 0 686 to 0 740 implying that the modified model outperforms the original model in simulating flow rate for the simulation of nutrient load tp and tn concentrations measured at the nine sampling points on the six dates were compared with the simulated tp and tn concentrations fig 12 and fig 13 according to analysis of the effectiveness of the modified model in simulating nutrient load this model was more effective in simulating tp than tn with respective r2 and ns values of 0 82 and 0 66 and 0 71 and 0 69 table 6 r2 and ns for the modified model were 3 8 and 4 4 and 6 4 and 6 1 larger than those for the original model in the simulation of tp and tn respectively indicating that the modified model outperformed the original model in terms of simulated nutrient load according to the simulated results of flow rate and nutrients the modified swat outperformed the original model in simulating peak flow rate tn and tp this result shows that unlike the original swat which uses average forest vegetation density and a single plant growth pattern to estimate accumulated biomass the modified swat uses variable density and a multi plant growth mode to better represent actual forest growth therefore in simulating the influence of the forest vegetation landscape on non point source pollution variables such as vegetation coverage dominant vegetation abundance and lai can be effectively used to describe various states of forest vegetation landscape from different perspectives 6 conclusions with the aim of simulating non point source pollution in the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring a variable density and mixed vegetation types this was accomplished by altering limitations of the swat for estimating accumulated biomass based on average forest vegetation density and a single plant growth pattern in addition based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model using a study area in the meijiang river basin a sub basin of the poyang lake basin of china within a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region we explored the validity of the modified swat based on field data the following conclusions were reached 1 in simulation of the peak flow rate the modified model showed substantial improvement over the original model indicating that the modified model can better portray actual surface runoff the average maximum minimum and total flow rates of the modified model were closer to measured values the r2 increased by 14 6 from 0 753 for the original model to 0 863 for the modified mode and the ns grew by 7 8 from 0 686 to 0 740 these data suggest that the modified model outperforms the original model in simulating the flow rate 2 in simulation the nutrient load from the situated tp and tn the r2 and ns for the modified model were 3 8 and 4 4 and 6 4 and 6 1 larger than those for the original model indicating that the modified model outperformed the original model in terms of simulated nutrient load the modified model was more effective in simulating tp concentration than tn concentration with respective r2 and ns values of 0 82 and 0 66 and 0 71 and 0 69 from the simulation of tp and tn 3 using variables such as vegetation coverage different forest components e g coniferous forest broadleaf forest and sparse shrubs and lai the modified swat could more realistically and effectively reflect macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the forest vegetation landscape than the original swat hence the modified swat is more effective than the original model in simulating flow rate and nutrient load

5545,with the aim of simulating non point source pollution of the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types to address the drawbacks of the soil and water assessment tool swat in estimating the accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth pattern in addition a dominant vegetation abundance remote sensing inversion model and leaf area index lai and extinction coefficient remote sensing inversion model were set up to obtain relevant parameters of the forest growth model moreover based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model this was done to explore the intercropping growth model as well as the remote sensing inversion method considering the multiple cropping and intercropping indexes we selected the meijiang river basin as the study area a sub basin of the poyang lake basin in china in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region to explore the validity of the modified swat based on field data the results show that the modified swat outperformed the original model in terms of simulated flow and nutrient load using variables such as vegetation coverage different forest components e g coniferous forest broadleaf forest and sparse shrubs and lai as for simulated flow the validity of the modified swat was increased by 7 8 and simulation of the average maximum minimum and total flow rates were closer to the measured values better reflecting the actual surface water storage in the simulation of nutrient load validity was increased by 6 4 total phosphorus and 6 1 total nitrogen better representing macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the forest vegetation landscape keywords modified swat multi plant growth mode non point source pollution poyang lake basin meijiang river basin 1 introduction the agroforestry system is an important ecosystem for the formation and development of non point source pollution which involves various processes of meteorology soil hydrology plant growth farming activities and management all of which are inseparable from the agroforestry ecosystem simulation on scales of time and space using distributed mechanized non point source models is an effective approach for quantitatively studying and evaluating the impact of the agroforestry system on non point source pollution currently several main models have been applied to study non point source pollution loads in the watershed such as hydrological simulation program fortran annualized agricultural non point source area nonpoint source watershed environmental response simulation spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes generalized watershed loading functions and soil and water assessment tool swat ouyang et al 2018 which have certain limitations in describing the plant growth mode among the many distributed non point source models swat is the most widely used mechanized model with promising prospects for application krysanova and arnold 2008 as a time continuous semi distributed and process oriented river basin model swat has been widely used in modeling hydrological features e g surface runoff infiltration lateral flow groundwater flow backflow snowmelt runoff soil temperature and humidity evapotranspiration sediment yield transport crop growth nutrient transport and water quality duan et al 2019 gassman et al 2007 mekonnen et al 2018 and biophysical processes e g biomass crop growth and yield gassman et al 2014 kauffman et al 2014 lai et al 2012 the model has been applied to basins covering an area ranging from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of square kilometers even up to national or continental spatial scales for example jayakrishnan et al 2005 used swat to macroscopically analyze the effects of water resource management measures such as water quality and quantity in the united states and on the north american continent the time scale of application varies from several hours or days to decades for a precipitation process muttiah and wurbs 2002 although the swat has been widely used worldwide the single plant growth pattern in this model is limited for expressing the state of forest vegetation featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types as well as different planting systems and farming practices therefore the model fails to consider the influences of vegetational landscapes cropping systems and farming practices on non point source pollution to solve the above problems international studies have been carried out to revise the model to varying degrees for example watson et al 2005 and macdonald et al 2005 replaced the swat plant growth model with the 3 pg mechanism model of forest growth through introducing and modifying the agricultural land management and numerical assessment criteria almanac plant model kiniry et al 2008 overcame the shortcomings of swat in simulating forest ecosystems with respect to water and biogeochemical cycles for purpose of reasonably simulating the seasonal dynamics of the biome strauch and volk 2013 proposed a logistic leaf area index lai decline function in swat modification alemayehu et al 2017 presented a modified swat version for the tropics swat t thus can improve the plant growth module of swat for simulating the seasonal growth cycles for trees and perennial vegetation in the tropics the upgraded version i e swat considering multiple plant community growth with competition offered more flexibility with regard to the delineation and interaction of spatial objects in a watershed bieger et al 2017 many related studies have been conducted in china during recent years based on hydrological characteristics of the irrigated areas of hilly regions in south china where rice is grown dai and cui 2009 improved the irrigation water movement and rice water circulation modules the water balance of rice fields and the production simulation method for swat adding the canal leakage simulation module and its recharge effect on groundwater as well as the irrigation module of small reservoirs xie and cui 2009 improved the swat for rice field evapotranspiration controlled irrigation and drainage plus real time irrigation from small reservoirs simulating water movement processes of irrigation modes such as intermittent irrigation and basin irrigation for basins with insufficient irrigation experimental data shi et al 2010 modified the automatic irrigation system of rice fields based on the swat and constructed a multi water source integrated irrigation module according to characteristics of the artificial natural hydrological cycle in plain irrigation areas and considering artificial disturbances such as irrigation drainage and river channels in those areas zhen et al 2011 improved the swat regarding methods of extracting ditches and river networks division of sub basins and hydrological response units hrus and calculation of crop water consumption ma et al 2019 proposed an enhanced swat modeling approach with remotely sensed lai replaced the lai simulated by built in environmental policy integrated climate epic module which was aiming to further increase the applicability of swat in vegetation dynamics of tropical or subtropical areas however only a few studies have considered the limitations of the original swat in estimating the accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth model to explore non point source pollution on the basis of currently available non point source pollution models it is of practical importance to study non point source pollution modeling and simulation methods based on the forest vegetation landscape in subtropical humid monsoon climate zones as well as characteristics of the planting system and farming mode in rice growing areas of south china obtaining relevant parameters such as vegetation mixing ratio multiple cropping and intercropping using remote sensing technology hence with the aim of simulating non point source pollution of the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring variable density and mixed vegetation types to address drawbacks of the swat in estimating accumulated biomass based on the average forest vegetation density and single plant growth pattern in addition a dominant vegetation abundance remote sensing inversion model and lai and extinction coefficient ec remote sensing inversion model were established to obtain relevant parameters of the forest growth model moreover based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model we selected the meijiang river basin as the study area a sub basin of the poyang lake basin in china in a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region to explore the validity of the modified swat based on field data 2 application limitations and modification of plant growth patterns of swat 2 1 original plant growth pattern of the swat derived from the simplified epic the swat plant growth model simulates the growth of all plants with a single plant growth pattern consisting of two parts the biomass accumulation and ideal leaf area development patterns the details of which are given below 1 the maximum daily biomass increase is estimated based on the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area neitsch et al 2004 1 δ b i o d r u e r e g h phosyn where δbio is the potential increase of total biomass per day rue is the radiation utilization rate of plants d is the average density in hru and reg is the comprehensive stress factor of temperature moisture and nitrogen n and phosphorus p nutrients the value of which ranges from 0 to 1 practical the actual vegetation growth considers constraints from water stress temperature and nutrients for example temperature stress is expressed by the minimum optimum and maximum temperatures required for plant crop growth and is described by the s shaped curve of the growth the three fundamental point temperature and other stress factors are stored in the swat plant growth database as the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area in a given time the variable h phosyn is determined using the equation 2 h phosyn 0 5 h day 1 exp k l l a i where h day is the total radiation in a given period 0 5h day is the photosynthetically active radiation kl is the ec default value of 0 65 and lai is estimated based on the ideal leaf area development model 2 ideal leaf area development model during the early stage of plant growth before leaf area reaches its maximum value the canopy height and leaf area development are controlled by the ideal leaf area development model curve 3 f r l a im x f r phu f r phu exp ℓ 1 ℓ 2 f r phu where frlaimx is the maximum lai ratio corresponding to the potential heat unit ratio frphu frphu is the potential heat unit ratio of the plant in a given period during the growing season and l 1 and l 2 are shape factors the calculation of frphu is via 4 f r phu i 1 d hu phu where hu is the cumulative heat unit on day i and phu is the total heat unit of the plant the shape factors are calculated by solving eq 3 based on two known points i e frlai 1 frphu 1 and frlai 2 frphu 2 and the equations are 5 ℓ 1 ln f r phu 1 f r lai 1 f r phu 1 ℓ 2 f r phu 1 6 ℓ 2 ln f r phu 1 f r lai 1 f r phu 1 ln f r phu 2 f r lai 2 f r phu 2 f r phu 2 f r phu 1 the canopy height on a specific day can be calculated via 7 h c h c m x fr laimx where hc is the given canopy height m on a specific day and hc mx is the maximum canopy height of the plant 2 2 problems in plant growth patterns in the swat 2 2 1 drawbacks of original plant growth pattern in swat the swat is primarily suitable for non point source simulation in areas with intensive agricultural activity gassman et al 2007 because of differences between agricultural system and forestry system many studies have been conducted with the aim of modifying swat however the 3 pg introduced by watson et al 2005 and macdonald et al 2005 must be supported by a large amount of forest growth data which makes the model more complex and limits its application originating from the epic almanac is a general model applicable to multiple crops the crop growth pattern is no longer single but the efficiency of intercropping is not considered during biomass accumulation kiniry et al 2008 although appropriate corrections were made in the latest version i e swat 2012 the ec and lai two important parameters in the biomass accumulation process remain in a simplified form that is the ecs of all plants were set to 0 65 by default whereas the lai was estimated based on average plant density and controlled by a uniform ideal leaf area development model it is difficult to describe vegetation landscape in forestry system featuring mixed vegetation types and planting methods in agricultural system featuring intercropping using such a single plant growth model the forestry and agricultural system are not only the important subsystems of the basin ecosystem but also the important interface for the n and p cycles such simplification somewhat limits application of the model to these subsystems 2 2 2 limitations of swat in simulating intercropping farming practices the swat is mainly used to estimate the non point source load of large basins and predict and evaluate the long term influences of different soils land use cover types and agricultural management on water sediment deposition and agricultural chemicals nonetheless owing to its single plant growth pattern swat is limited in expressing complex planting methods moreover regarding farming management although a variety of farming activities and management methods are considered such consideration is mainly based on extensive farming in north american and european countries watson et al 2005 thereby making the model inapplicable to cropping systems and farming practice methods in china such as intercropping however these farming practices have greatly changed the light energy utilization efficiency and absorption of n and p by crops and have affected the circulation of nutrients gao et al 2009 tsubo et al 2005 2 3 modification of the swat based on multi plant growth model 2 3 1 adjustment and modification of the forest growth model the original swat plant growth model is applicable to forest growth nevertheless the model has the following problems first owing to small seasonal changes in leaf area there will be an error if the leaf area of evergreen trees is estimated based on the ideal leaf area development model second the ec of the canopy of all forest vegetation is set to 0 65 third the average density represents the density of the forest in view of the above considerations swat as related to the growth model of forest vegetation was modified as follows 1 for deciduous trees the original plant growth model was still applied 2 for evergreen trees the ideal leaf area development model was replaced by the lai and remote sensing vegetation index statistical model 3 for the ec the unified ec 0 65 was replaced by establishing the remote sensing ec model of the dominant plant type in the study area the latter model was determined according to the statistical relationship between the measured ec and remote sensing vegetation index 4 the plant growth model of the mixed deciduous and evergreen broadleaf conifer forest was determined via the following equation 8 h p h o s y n i 1 n p i h phosyn i here pi is the proportion of the i type dominant tree species in the mixed forest represented by the dominant vegetation abundance in the basin which can be obtained using remote sensing h phosyn i is the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of the i type dominant tree species at a given time and n is the number of dominant tree species in the mixed forest 5 for the modification of forest density the density of swat plant growth is reflected by the maximum incremental equation of daily biomass i e eq 1 this is not a major problem for crop planting but it is too important to be ignored in the forest system among the original input variables of swat forest density is mainly reflected in the second level classification of forest land in land use cover types i e forest and shrub land therefore the forest vegetation coverage in the basin extracted via remote sensing by the advanced land imager ali on nasa s earth observing 1 satellite was introduced in eq 1 to replace the average density d 2 3 2 establishment of crop growth model under intercropping intercropping is a planting method to achieve intensive planting in time and space the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of intercropped high stalk crops in a given period was obtained according to an equation proposed by keating and carberry 1993 9 h phosyn h 0 5 h day 1 exp k l h l a i h 1 k l h l a i h 2 k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l 1 exp k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l the photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the leaf area of the intercropped low stalk crops in a given period was calculated based on 10 h phosyn l 0 5 h day k l l l a i l k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l 1 exp k l h l a i h 2 k l l l a i l where lai h 1 lai h 2 and lai l are lais of the upper and lower layers of high stalk crops and the lai of low stalk crops respectively kl h and kl l are the ecs of high and low stalk crops respectively with the upper and lower layers divided by the canopy height of low stalk crops lai h 1 and lai h 2 can be calculated according to 11 la i h 1 h h h l h h l a i h la i h 2 h l h h l a i h where h h and h l are the canopy heights of high stalk and low stalk crops respectively which are obtained from a database of traits and growth habits of those crops hence the maximum daily accumulated biomass produced by intercropping is expressed by 12 δ b i o r u e i h h phosyn h i l h phosyn l where i h and i l are the intercropping indexes of high stalk and low stalk crops respectively the intercropping index refers to the proportion of a specific crop in an intercropping system the intercropping indexes of various crops were obtained using remote sensing technology based on the established intercropping index remote sensing model 2 4 correction and compilation of source code of the swat the swat is compiled using fortran with its execution framework consisting of a main program and large number of subroutines swat contains 307 program files three new variables were constructed for eqs 8 and 12 p dominant vegetation abundance i h intercropping index of high stalk crops and i l intercropping index of low stalk crops there was no need to add the lai and ec because these were included in the original swat because the lai of swat is a variable in the hru i e the lais of vegetation are uniform in the hru the values of p i h and i l in eqs 8 and 12 were taken at the hru level further readnewvar f was added which is a corresponding data reading subroutine once this subroutine was revised the variables required by the model included original variables namely lai and the k i e kl in eq 2 which has the same meaning as ec mentioned later as well as the newly added variables p i h and i l because swat has certain limitations in the simulation of intercropping interplant a logical variable used to determine whether there is intercropping in a specific hru was added to modify the farming management module of swat moreover interplantmgt the new intercropping module was added based on the original management module this module was equipped with a new function which is to allow the management of multiple crops the swat was modified and compiled in microsoft visual studio 2005 using the intel visual fortran compiler 11 1 067 3 study area and data preparation for the swat 3 1 study area meijiang river basin 26 17ʹ34ʹʹn 27 08ʹ54ʹʹn 115 44ʹ28ʹʹe 116 16ʹ06ʹʹe one of the sub basins of the poyang lake basin was selected as the study area with a catchment area of 3304 km2 fig 1 the basin is dominated by mid altitude and low mountains with elevations from 170 to 1440 m and average elevation 379 1 m the meijiang river originates from wangpizhang at the northern edge of xiaotian village in ningdu county jiangxi province in china and runs through the entire meijiang river basin climate in the basin is mild and humid featuring a clear monsoon and abundant rainfall annual average temperature is 17 3 c with an extreme maximum temperature of 37 9 c and extreme minimum temperature of 6 2 c annual rainfall is 1706 mm and annual average relative humidity is 80 soil in the meijiang basin is mostly deep and fertile red soil and yellow red soil developed from metamorphic rocks and granites comprising loam and sandy loam soil types zonal vegetation in the basin is subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest with a forest coverage rate of 70 natural forest accounts for 87 of total forest area vegetation in the basin mainly includes coniferous forest mixed evergreen deciduous and broadleaf forest evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest bamboo forest low forest shrubs and grasses because the study area is in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone there is mainly mixed forest there even in planted forests there is often more than one species of forest tree among the natural vegetation evergreen broadleaf and coniferous forests dominate the dominant species of coniferous forests are pinus massoniana and cunninghamia lanceolata which are mainly in hilly lowland there are 17 tree species in the evergreen broadleaf forest but the dominant species castanopsis fargesii and c sclerophylla are mainly in high mountains with altitudes above 600 700 m where there is little human activity zhang et al 2010 the low hills are dominated by cinnamomum camphora and schima superba which are mainly near residential areas the deciduous broadleaf forest has a vertical zonal distribution the low lying lowland is dominated by populus eucalyptus melia azedarach and sapium sebiferum whereas the mid altitude and high mountains mainly have liquidambar formosana hance and quercus aliena var acuteserrata the bamboo forest is dominated by phyllostachys pubescens mazel the total amount of which is not great and is mainly in lowland areas fruit orchards and tea plantations are sporadically distributed throughout the basin the river system in the basin is made up of six main rivers the meijiang main stream linchi tributary huangpi tributary huitong tributary zhukeng tributary and guhou tributary fig 1 the water volume of the five tributaries accounts for 92 3 of the total water volume of meijiang river according to demographic data of 2010 the ratio of the primary secondary and tertiary industries in the meijiang basin is 24 7 39 7 35 6 agriculture is mainly based on rice cultivation but crops such as navel orange and lotus seed are also planted there are six counties in the study area guangchang le an ningdu shicheng xingguo and yihuang ningdu county accounts for 96 4 of the study area 3 2 data input and processing the data involved in the swat simulation consist of the following two datasets 1 basic data required by the swat i e digital elevation model dem river network land use and cover soil type and its physical and chemical properties plant and plant growth fertilizer hydrological and water quality meteorological livestock husbandry and population emissions neitsch et al 2004 among these hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for modeling model parameter determination and verification 2 data required by the modified swat including forest vegetation and intercropping parameters such as vegetation coverage dominant vegetation abundance lai the ec of canopies of the dominant forest vegetation intercropping index and multiple cropping index 3 2 1 method for obtaining forest vegetation and intercropping parameters 3 2 1 1 estimation of dominant vegetation abundance based on remote sensing reflecting the proportion of unit area of a specific forest component in the basin dominant vegetation abundance is an important variable in the modified swat in our study based on a linear mixed model the spatial distribution of dominant vegetation abundance in the study area was obtained using remote sensing the linear mixed model assumed the spectra of mixed pixels to be a linear combination of the spectra of the various surface features within the instantaneous field of view adams et al 1986 hilll et al 1998 according to actual ground cover in the study area the ground cover of the area was divided into seven components broadleaf forest coniferous forest grassland and sparse shrubs bare land water body cultivated land and residential land forest vegetation comprised the following three components broadleaf forest coniferous forest and grassland and sparse shrubs chen et al 2012 proposed a method for extracting ground cover abundance based on remote sensing the extracted abundance was based on pixels in the remote sensing image and the ground cover abundance of seven surface features in one pixel had a cumulative value of 1 the vegetation abundance of broadleaf forest coniferous forest grassland and sparse shrubs is shown in fig 2 3 2 1 2 remote sensing inversion of lai and ec of canopies of dominant forest vegetation the lai and ec are important in the modified swat as parameters of the underlying surface of the epigeosphere which characterize the canopy structure and light energy utilization of the vegetation located in the mid subtropical humid climate zone southern china has abundant rainfall and its vegetation is mostly mixed and unevenly distributed evenly distributed vegetation covering a large area is rare therefore it is difficult to obtain the lai and ec of a single tree species or single vegetation type based on current remote sensing technology and the remote sensing data source the lai or ec inverted using remote sensing can only be those of the dominant vegetation types within a certain spatial range to better match measured data of lai and photosynthetically active radiation which were used to estimate the ec and to reflect mixed and unevenly distributed vegetation with the landsat etm as the remote sensing data source we used the gram schmidt image fusion method to merge etm data into multispectral data with a spatial resolution of 15 m based on measurement of the lai and photosynthetically active radiation of canopies of the dominant forest vegetation the basin lai was inverted per the empirical equation of the vegetation index method in addition an inversion model was established to calculate the ec of dominant forest vegetation canopies according to the beer lambert law following the method proposed by our study retrieving leaf area index and extinction coefficient of dominated vegetation canopy cover in meijiang watershed of china using image fusion and landsat etm data in chinese published in journal of remote sensing technology and application lai et al 2013 fig 3 shows the lai and ec of dominant vegetation canopies in the study area estimated on the basis of the inversion model 3 2 1 3 remote sensing information extraction of intercropping index and multiple cropping index farming methods in the agricultural system are reflected by the original swat in many ways with a concentration in the farming management module e g sowing fertilization insect control deep tillage and harvesting nonetheless intercropping is not adequately represented in the original swat thus we modified the maximum daily accumulated biomass equation of swat i e eq 12 i h and i l were obtained by establishing an intercropping index remote sensing model multiple cropping is reflected in swat relevant parameters and databases of multiple cropping can be set via the farming management module peng et al 2006 yan et al 2005a yan et al 2005b we also followed a relatively mature method for remote sensing inversion of the multiple cropping index which is based on an approach proposed by pan et al 2012 3 2 2 input of other data 3 2 2 1 dem and river network data extracted from a topographic map with scale 1 50 000 dem and gis data of the river network were mainly used for discretization of the swat 3 2 2 2 land use data data of land use cover types represent the main variable in swat they are also an important reference for estimating emissions from humans and caused by livestock husbandry and for establishing the dominant vegetation abundance model multiple cropping index and intercropping index model and lai and ec model to obtain land use cover types in the study area data obtained by the advanced land imager served as the remote sensing data source i e level 1gst data from the international scientific data service platform of the computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http datamirror csdb cn multispectral and panchromatic gram schmidt data were merged to generate a multispectral false color composite image with resolution 10 m the land use cover types in the study area were visually interpreted and results were reviewed and verified several times finally 10 land use cover types were identified rural residential land urban and transport construction land dry land unused land paddy fields low vegetation including grassland and shrubs open forest forest land rivers lakes reservoirs and ponds fig 4 3 2 2 3 soil data soil data mainly included soil type and its physical and chemical properties the data were derived from the cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county report completed in 2009 for ningdu county in jiangxi province and a soil census completed in 1986 province 1988 the scale of the soil type spatial distribution map is 1 50 000 fig 5 swat s soil database usersoil includes 17 physical properties among which sol clay layer sol silt layer sol sand layer sol rock layer and sol z layer were converted based on a report of the soil survey office ningdu county in jiangxi province province 1988 variables such as sol bd layer sol awc layer sol k layer sol cbn layer and usle k were converted and calculated according to wei et al 2007 seven chemical properties are stored in the swat soil input file chm 3 2 2 4 plant crop growth data the growth data of plants and crops mainly included agrometeorological parameters e g effective accumulated temperature minimum temperature maximum temperature and optimum temperature required for the growth and development of plants as well as parameters involving the variety and traits of plants such as maximum canopy height maximum potential lai ec root depth and harvest index some parameters were already included in the swat such as those for pine cedar rice and soybeans crop parameters exclusive to the study area were data involving the variety and traits of crops in ningdu county obtained from cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county province 1988 3 2 2 5 fertilizer and fertilization data extracted from fertilizer information in cultivated land fertility evaluation of ningdu county fertilizer data included the name and n p and k contents of the applied fertilizer based on which the fertilizer database required by the swat was established sharing the same source data of agricultural fertilization in different parts of the study area covered fertilizer varieties amount of fertilizer applied per ha and the yield per ha of 21 062 households in 24 villages and towns 3 2 2 6 hydrological and water quality data hydrological and water quality data were mainly used for calibrating the parameters and validating the swat the data included the flow rate and nutrient concentration of the river to obtain measured hydrological and water quality data of the study area 87 sub basins were discretized and measurement points were established at nine sections fig 6 these points covered about 70 sub basins accounting for 80 5 of all sub basins in the study area flow rate and water quality were measured six times february 11 april 2 may 8 july 11 september 10 and november 21 in 2011 with sampling elements total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen 3 2 2 7 meteorological data data from nine meteorological stations across the study area were used including temperature maximum and minimum humidity wind speed and precipitation from 1957 to 2011 the above data were transformed into a swat meteorological user database according to the requirements pang et al 2007 moreover precipitation data measured at 33 precipitation stations in the basin from 2005 to 2011 were used as input parameters for model establishment parameter calibration and model validation 3 2 2 8 data of livestock husbandry and population emissions there was forestry agriculture livestock husbandry and a small number of other industries in the study area to make good use of the swat to simulate non point source pollution in the basin emissions from livestock husbandry and humans must be taken into consideration we conducted gis spatial analysis of those emissions to represent them spatially across small and medium sized basins further details are in yi et al 2012 and zeng et al 2013 4 model debugging and parameter calibration a 3000 hm2 convergence area was used as a threshold for spatial discretization to generate 87 sub basins and 700 hrus were obtained based on a division threshold of 20 10 20 land use cover soil slope the period 2005 2011 was used for model debugging 2005 2007 parameter calibration 2008 2010 and model validation 2011 for parameter calibration hydrological parameters were calibrated first next the nutrient load was calibrated during which the hydrological parameters were no longer calibrated and all models used were the original ones parameters calibrated by the original model were used as simulation parameters to modify the model all variables and parameters were the same as those of the original model except that the model was modified and input parameters were adjusted accordingly in addition simulated results of the modified model were analyzed for different research objectives 4 1 parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis of flow rate swat cup a calibration and uncertainty program was used to calibrate the parameters sensitivity of the variables was evaluated using the t test method generally if p 0 05 the parameter was considered to be

biomix phoskd and pperco were selected for use in parameter calibration of the p nutrient load psp and spexp were sensitive to the emission of p nutrients with psp the most sensitive fig 8 b table 2 shows the names definitions and calibration results of these parameters based on parameter calibration of n and p the aforementioned sensitive parameters were further adjusted using swat cup to obtain the optimal parameters for simulation then the simulated results were verified based on measured n and p loads and the validity of the simulation was also analyzed 5 model validation 5 1 validation and effectiveness analysis of the original model based on the calibrated parameters we simulated the situation in 2011 using the modified model we analyzed model effectiveness on the basis of water quality data sampled six times at each of the nine sampling points the flow rate measured at a hydrological station in ningdu county during the same period and the flow and nutrient load output at the same section and during the same period as the model the correlation coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns were used to measure the model validity ns was calculated by 13 ns 1 i 1 n ξ oi ξ mi 2 i 1 n ξ oi ξ o 2 where ξo ξo and ξm are the observed average observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of samples the value of ns varies from 1 to 1 with a value close to 1 indicating greater model validity we compared the flow rate of the original model measured flow rate and average basin rainfall we found that the simulated and measured flow rates had essentially the same trend but the simulated and measured peaks were substantially different that is the simulated maximum peak was small whereas the measured small and medium peaks were large fig 9 as indicated by comparison of the simulated flow rate and average basin rainfall the trend of the simulated flow rate was consistent with that of average basin rainfall in contrast the simulation of surface runoff regulation by the model was not as consistent with the actual situation there are many reservoirs of different scale across the study area because relevant data of the reservoirs were not obtained the effect of the reservoirs on regulation and storage of the river channels was not considered which might have caused the relatively poor simulation of base flow and the peak of low rainfall according to our analysis of the effectiveness of flow rate in the original model the r2 between simulated and measured values is 0 753 indicating very strong correlation in addition the ns is 0 686 implying strong model validity table 3 in simulating tp and tn nutrient loads the model showed the same trend for both temporal and spatial flows fig 10 table 4 shows an analysis of the effectiveness of the original model in simulating nutrients from the average maximum and minimum values of nutrient load simulated values were generally larger than measured ones furthermore based on values of r2 and ns the simulation of nutrient load was slightly worse than that of flow rate and the simulation of tn was poorer than that of tp 5 2 validation and effectiveness analysis of the modified swat based on multi plant growth mode by comparing the flow rate of the modified model the measured flow rate and average basin rainfall we found that the simulation of the modified model was basically the same as the original model in terms of flow rate fig 11 however for the peak flow rate fig 9 the modified model showed great improvement indicating that this model can better reflect the actual surface runoff situation the average maximum minimum and total flow rates of the modified model were closer to measured values table 5 the r2 increased by 14 6 from 0 753 for the original model to 0 863 for the modified model the ns rose by 7 8 from 0 686 to 0 740 implying that the modified model outperforms the original model in simulating flow rate for the simulation of nutrient load tp and tn concentrations measured at the nine sampling points on the six dates were compared with the simulated tp and tn concentrations fig 12 and fig 13 according to analysis of the effectiveness of the modified model in simulating nutrient load this model was more effective in simulating tp than tn with respective r2 and ns values of 0 82 and 0 66 and 0 71 and 0 69 table 6 r2 and ns for the modified model were 3 8 and 4 4 and 6 4 and 6 1 larger than those for the original model in the simulation of tp and tn respectively indicating that the modified model outperformed the original model in terms of simulated nutrient load according to the simulated results of flow rate and nutrients the modified swat outperformed the original model in simulating peak flow rate tn and tp this result shows that unlike the original swat which uses average forest vegetation density and a single plant growth pattern to estimate accumulated biomass the modified swat uses variable density and a multi plant growth mode to better represent actual forest growth therefore in simulating the influence of the forest vegetation landscape on non point source pollution variables such as vegetation coverage dominant vegetation abundance and lai can be effectively used to describe various states of forest vegetation landscape from different perspectives 6 conclusions with the aim of simulating non point source pollution in the agroforestry system we established a forest growth model featuring a variable density and mixed vegetation types this was accomplished by altering limitations of the swat for estimating accumulated biomass based on average forest vegetation density and a single plant growth pattern in addition based on radiant energy under intercropping we used the keating equation with the intercropping index as the variable to modify the original swat single biomass accumulation model using a study area in the meijiang river basin a sub basin of the poyang lake basin of china within a subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and red soil region we explored the validity of the modified swat based on field data the following conclusions were reached 1 in simulation of the peak flow rate the modified model showed substantial improvement over the original model indicating that the modified model can better portray actual surface runoff the average maximum minimum and total flow rates of the modified model were closer to measured values the r2 increased by 14 6 from 0 753 for the original model to 0 863 for the modified mode and the ns grew by 7 8 from 0 686 to 0 740 these data suggest that the modified model outperforms the original model in simulating the flow rate 2 in simulation the nutrient load from the situated tp and tn the r2 and ns for the modified model were 3 8 and 4 4 and 6 4 and 6 1 larger than those for the original model indicating that the modified model outperformed the original model in terms of simulated nutrient load the modified model was more effective in simulating tp concentration than tn concentration with respective r2 and ns values of 0 82 and 0 66 and 0 71 and 0 69 from the simulation of tp and tn 3 using variables such as vegetation coverage different forest components e g coniferous forest broadleaf forest and sparse shrubs and lai the modified swat could more realistically and effectively reflect macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the forest vegetation landscape than the original swat hence the modified swat is more effective than the original model in simulating flow rate and nutrient load

5546,as atmospheric moisture capacity is highly sensitive to rising temperatures precipitation extremes are widely projected to intensify with a warming climate and thus altering the flooding generation regime previous works seldomly focused on bivariate flood quantiles under climate change at a national scale and fewer flooding projections quantified the estimation uncertainty sourced from sample size limitation this study systematically investigates the changes in bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume with incorporation of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over china with climate trajectories projected by a set of multi model ensemble under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 after correcting the systematical biases of eight cmip5 gcm outputs four state of the art hydrological models are driven and validated for each catchment and the best simulation model is selected to project future streamflow scenarios the copula function is employed to construct the joint distribution of flood peak and volume and then the most likely realizations of bivariate quantiles are derived under different joint return periods jrps with the uncertainty envelope quantified with the area of 90 confidence ellipse by a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach our results project an overall ascending trend of temperature and precipitation over china and the bivariate flood quantiles and corresponding estimation uncertainty of most catchments in the future period 2056 2100 are much larger than the baseline 1961 2005 despite accompanied by substantial climate model uncertainty and spatial variability in magnitude many basins would be subjected to a dramatic increase of flood magnitude by over 50 while only few basins are projected to experience a decreasing flood risk suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to a warming climate over china keywords climate change bivariate analysis copula function uncertainty estimation china 1 introduction global anthropogenic warming mainly due to greenhouse gas emission has altered the energy exchange channel and hydrological cycle between atmosphere and earth which has exacerbated the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and resulted in more frequent and persistent hydrometeorological hazards such as flooding yin et al 2018a according to the clausius clapeyron c c relationship the holding vapor capacity of atmosphere is increasing at rates with about 7 per degree warming koutsoyiannis 2012 thus leading to a substantial intensification of extreme precipitations in most areas of the globe allan and soden 2008 the potential for extreme precipitation to intensify with climate change has recently received increasing attention because of the devastating impacts of storm generated flooding on the environment economy and society alfieri et al 2017 hence it is of great importance to assess the flood characteristics under a changing climate to enable appropriate adaptation strategies for managing and minimizing the future flooding risks the global climate models gcms based on mathematical representations of atmosphere ice cap ocean and energy and water cycle are considered to be the most versatile and integrated tool available for generating climate trajectories and representing climate variability swansburg et al 2004 over the past decade numerous studies have employed the gcm simulations in evaluating climate change impact on flood dynamics while most of these are within a univariate hydrological frequency analysis framework e g prudhomme et al 2002 das et al 2011 huziy et al 2013 tofiq and guven 2015 liang et al 2019 these univariate works can only provide limited assessment of the flood occurrence likelihood as floods are multifaceted natural hazards characterized by peak discharge volume and duration e g shiau 2003 requena et al 2016 therefore it is critical to incorporate the joint modeling of multiple flood characteristics into climate change impact assessments until now only limited studies focused on flood s multiplex nature under a changing climate among which the copula based approaches have been widely employed due to their good feasibility of marginal distributions for example jeong et al 2014 explored the variations of spring flood frequency under the changing environment for 21 northeast canadian basins by fitting the copula function as well as the univariate distributions yin et al 2018b investigated the impacts of climate change on flood magnitudes within a bivariate framework and derived the adaptive bivariate flood quantiles by non stationary copula approaches for the ganjiang river basin in china in the assessments of climate change impacts on hydrology various sources of uncertainty have been identified and discussed a deep understanding and quantification of such uncertainty is important for scientifically evaluating future flood hazard risk and guiding water resources planning and management generally the uncertainty is classified in five sources i e greenhouse gas emission scenario ghges gcm structure natural climate variability downscaling method and hydrological structure and parameter shen et al 2018 a series of works have involved in quantifying the uncertainty of climate change impacts on flood characteristics arising from above sources and the uncertainty envelope from different sources in the hydrological climate change impacts is also compared by numerous studies for instance wilby and harris 2006 evaluated and compared five uncertainty sources in the low flow projection for the river thames in united kingdom by integrating four gcms two statistical downscaling methods two ghgess two hydrological model structures and two sets of hydrological model parameters prudhomme and davies 2009 employed three gcms two ghgess one statistical downscaling approach and one dynamical downscaling model to investigate the uncertainty of climate change impacts on the streamflow pattern of four british catchments previous studies consistently show that the choice of a gcm usually accounts for the largest contributor to the uncertainty in hydrological projections zhuan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 therefore the use of a multi model ensemble is necessary for evaluating climate change impacts on flood characteristics particularly for bivariate quantile projection but beyond that the uncertainty of bivariate quantile estimation also plays a prominent role in hydrological frequency analysis salvadori et al 2011 recognized the importance of accounting for quantile estimation uncertainty because it is relevant to the reliability of the inference results and corresponding practical application serinaldi 2013 stated that the assessment of uncertainty has been always overlooked in bivariate framework and proposed three algorithms for uncertainty estimation of joint quantiles zhang et al 2015 evaluated the uncertainty of estimating the bivariate quantiles of drought duration and severity based on bayesian method in china s east river basin and found that the increasing sample size can reduce the uncertainty of joint distribution these previous works serinaldi 2013 zhang et al 2015 dung et al 2015 yin et al 2018b revealed that the major uncertainty source in bivariate quantile estimation is sampling uncertainty due to data size limitation whereas uncertainty estimation methods selection and parameter estimation methods are of minor importance a quantification of such sampling uncertainty would contribute to a more reliable climate change projection as well as better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning flood generation and characterization however the sampling uncertainty is usually overlooked in climate change impact assessments china as the most populous country is threatened by catastrophic flood hazards and has suffered from huge environmental damages and economic losses especially over the recent decades in a changing environment for instance extreme precipitation occurred in the yangtze river during 1998 have caused severe flooding and affected the 8 million population wang and plate 2012 flooding as the most costly and dangerous natural disasters in china has caused annual economic loss of 139 billion yuan and 984 deaths per year since 1990 he et al 2018 due to these substantial damages and losses since 2000 china has been increasing the fiscal investment in flood prevention and mitigation under climate warming and this investment will continue rising according to the government s current sustainable policy li et al 2019 the accurate quantification of changes in bivariate flood quantiles under future climates is highly important for guiding future investment allocations and management however the potential changes in bivariate flood quantile under climate warming has not been thoroughly examined over china and fewer work incorporates the estimation uncertainty into the multi model ensemble projections and assessments the objective of the paper is to systematically investigate the projected changes of bivariate flood quantiles and estimation uncertainty over 151 catchments in china the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces observation data and coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate scenarios section 3 is devoted to statistical downscaling method hydrological modelling bivariate flood frequency analysis and uncertainty quantification method in section 4 the change of meteorological variables as well as bivariate flood quantiles is analyzed we perform detailed discussion in section 5 and conclude our conclusions in section 6 2 data description 2 1 observational meterological data and streamflow records a high resolution 0 5 0 5 gridded meteorological dataset over china covering the period of 1961 2016 is used in this study this dataset contains daily precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily average temperature which is archived in china meteorological data sharing service system http www cma gov cn this gridded dataset was generated from 2472 in situ observation gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data sampling the data quality has been controlled by national meteorological information centre wu et al 2018 which is considered as the latest gridded meteorological data with a highest spatial resolution in china we used the daily streamflow series of 151 catchments over china and these catchments span over all the nine major river basins in china the streamflow data are collected from the nine water resources commission affiliated to chinese ministry of water resources such as yangtze river water resources commission yellow river conservancy commission pearl river water resources commission etc the streamflow dataset covers different time period and we only used the series during 1961 2016 it is noted that the northwest river basin was not considered in this study due to paucity of streamflow data the northwest china is far away from surrounding oceans and high mountains like tianshan mountain block atmospheric moisture transportation and thus inhibiting convection development there shi et al 2007 these factors both contribute to shaping a dry climate pattern in northwest china and hence flooding hazards usually receive less social concern than droughts over there 2 2 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 scenarios to yield an extensive evaluation of climate model uncertainty a set of eight projections of the atmospheric climate variables generated from the latest version of cmip5 were adopted in this study namely access1 3 bcc csm1 1 m canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 miroc5 and noresm1 m which is archived in the program for climate model diagnosis and inter comparison https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 table 1 presents the general information of these selected eight gcms which includes five earth system models and three atmospheric ocean models cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 and miroc5 these gcms are developed and maintained by climate institutions from seven different countries which are currently popular employed over china due to their good performance in reproducing climate features in china e g shen et al 2018 gu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the used daily cmip5 cgm outputs cover the period of 1961 2100 under the highest emission scenario representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 which contains daily precipitation and temperatures all the gcm outputs were interpolated into a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 to be compliant with the observation based gridded meteorological data for bias correction the bilinear interpolation method was employed in this study which has ease of implementation and usually show a good performance in smoothly transforming coarse gcm simulations into spatially fine outputs by utilizing information from four nearest neighboring grids zhou et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 the time period of 1961 2005 is taken as historical reference period and the future period is selected as 2056 2100 3 methodology the flowchart of our climate change impact assessments is displayed in fig 1 on which there are four modules the climate projection module generates the future climate scenarios by eight cmip5 gcms and the daily precipitation and temperature series are statistically bias corrected by the daily bias correction dbc method the hydrological module simulates and projects future streamflow using four hydrological models driven by the corrected gcm meteorological series the bivariate analysis module incorporates the copula function and most likely realization method for deriving the flood bivariate quantiles during historical and future periods under different joint return periods jrps the uncertainty analysis module quantifies the flood quantile estimation uncertainty with the area of 90 confidence ellipses by a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs as the gcm outputs are usually too coarse to represent the climate variability at a catchment scale necessitates the utilization of the downscaling technique in this study an empirical statistical downscaling approach i e daily bias correction dbc method proposed by chen et al 2013 is applied to cope with the systematical biases of gcms outputs the dbc method is a hybrid approach with incorporation of the local intensity scaling loci and daily translation dt techniques and its good performance has been widely verified in climate projection studies e g shen et al 2018 zhuan et al 2019 the loci method schmidli et al 2006 is first used to correct the precipitation frequency for a particular month e g december in the historical period a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm to ensure that the threshold exceedance equals the observed wet day occurrence in the same month the threshold is then applied in the future period to correct the frequency of gcm precipitation outputs in the corresponding month the dt method mpelasoka and chiew 2009 is then employed to correct the distributions of precipitation intensity and temperatures this dbc method fully takes advantage of the loci method to correct precipitation occurrence instead of applying the same factor to each daily precipitation e g the loci method for a specific month it modulates the change as a function of the daily precipitation intensity or temperature based on quantile errors in the distribution of precipitation or temperature for the observation series to implement the dt technique a distribution mapping technique is used to establish a relationship between the observed precipitation p obs p e r c or temperature t obs p e r c at different percentiles and the gcm simulated scenarios p gcm r e f p e r c t gcm r e f p e r c for a particular month during the reference period the ratios of precipitation differences of temperature between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period are calculated for each percentile the adjusted daily precipitation p adj f u t d for the future period can be obtained as product of the percentile ratio and gcm raw outputs while the adjusted daily temperature t adj f u t d for the future period can be derived by adding the percentile difference chen et al 2013 1 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs p e r c p gcm r e f p e r c 2 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs p e r c t gcm r e f p e r c where the subscript perc refers to a percentile for a particular month and the subscript d refers to a specific day in the future period 3 2 hydrological modelling given that our studied 151 catchments spanned over different climate zones and underlying surface conditions over china one particular hydrological model may unreliably capture the hydro climatic transferability so we used four different hydrological models as candicates in streamflow simulations i e hmet model gr4j model hbv model and xinanjiang xaj model these four models have different number of parameters model structures and underlying mechanisms in simulating the physical rainfall runoff processes 3 2 1 model description the hmets model is a 21 parameter lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model developed at école de technologie supérieure the hmets contains two connected reservoirs for representing unsaturated i e vadose and saturated i e phreatic zones and captures fundamental hydrological processes such as snow accumulation melting and refreezing evapotranspiration infiltration as well as flow routing to the watershed outlet troin et al 2016 the gr4j model modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a daily continuous rainfall runoff model developed for streamflow simulation at the catchment scale which is the modified version of the gr3j model primarily proposed and successively improved by edijatno et al 1999 and perrin et al 2003 the gr4j uses precipitation and potential evapotranspiration estimates as inputs while streamflow is only required for parameter optimization and model evaluation in our study we estimated the potential evapotranspiration with a temperature based method proposed by oudin et al 2005 and then used the estimation as the gr4j model inputs the conceptual hbv model was originally developed in the 1970s by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute there are three main modules in the hbv model i e degree day snow routine soil moisture routine and runoff routing in the snow routine module the snow accumulation and snowmelt process is characterized by a degree day method bergström and forsman 1973 in which two parameters are used to estimate this interacting process i e degree day factor dd and threshold temperature for snow rain tt the measured precipitation is taken as snowfall when the temperature is colder than threshold temperature while precipitation appears in rainfall when the air temperartue is warmer than the threshold value rango and martinec 1995 the soil moisture routing module estimates the soil moisture storage by accounting for rainfall and evapotranspiration with two constants i e permanent wilting point pwp and field capacity fc the runoff routine module transforms excess water from the soil moisture routine to discharge which characterize the concentration process by upper and lower reservoirs with five parameters jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the xinanjiang xaj model is a conceptual watershed model developed by zhao 1992 and the model is physically based on the theory that runoff generation occurs on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not generated until the soil water deficit is replenished the xaj model has been widely and successfully employed for streamflow simulation and flood forecasting over china particularly in the humid and semi humid climate regions zhang et al 2012 3 2 2 model calibration and performance evaluation index we calibrated the four hydrological models using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method developed at the university of arizona duan et al 1992 the sce ua method integrates the strengths of several effective global optimization concepts and employs both deterministic search strategies and random elements to enable simultaneously benefiting from topological response surface information collected during the search rahnamay et al 2019 this algorithm combines the concepts of complex shuffling with the downhill simplex method dsm which is in a simple structure and only few parameters need to be tuned by users due to its ease of implementation and high computation efficiency the sce ua algorithm has been widely employed in various scientific fields particularly in water resources management and hydrology naeini et al 2018 more details about this optimization method can be found in duan et al 1993 the kling gupta efficiency kge is selected as the evaluation index and the objective function is that maximising the kge value during calibration gupta et al 2009 3 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r indicates the person s linear correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated streamflow α is the ratio of standard deviations of observed and simulated streamflow while β is the ratio of mean value of observation and simulations the value of kge ranges from to 1 with kge 1 indicating a perfect fit between the observed and simulated series as shown by gupta et al 2009 kge consists of three main components correlation g 1 variability g 2 and bias g 3 the relative contribution of these three components to the kge value could be calculated as follows 4 g i g i j 1 3 g j where g 1 r 1 2 g 2 α 1 2 and g 3 β 1 2 3 3 joint return period and most likely realization method this study focuses on flood peak q and volume w to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence under climate change via the copula function which is a versatile mathematical tool for characterizing intercorrelated hydrological variables the marginal distributions of q and w are fitted with the pearson type iii p iii distribution recommended by ministry of water resources of china and the parameters are estimated by l moments method hosking 1990 within the copula based framework different definitions of joint return periods jrps have been proposed such as or and kendall dynamic structure based return periods and so on shiau 2003 salvadori et al 2016 among these the or case tor is usually adopted in flood occurrence assessment e g yin et al 2018c 5 t or μ 1 f q w μ 1 c f q q f w w where μ is the mean inter arrival time between two consecutive events in the case of annual maxima μ 1 year and f q w p q q w w is depicted by a copula function c f q q f w w f q q and f w w denote the marginal distribution functions of q and w respectively under the bivariate framework the choice of an appropriate t or leads to infinite combinations of bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume as shown in fig 2 the events along the t or level curve is generally not equivalent in terms of engineering practice chebana and ouarda 2011 and hence the likelihood of each event must be taken into consideration when selecting appropriate joint quantiles yin et al 2018c salvadori et al 2011 proposed the novel concept of most likely design realization to choose the point with the highest likelihood along the p level curve in this study the most likely realization method salvadori et al 2011 yin et al 2018b is used to choose the flood scenario with the highest likelihood along the t or level isoline for a given tor the most likely combination mlc point among all possible events can be derived by the following formula 6 q w arg max f q w c f q q f w w f q q f w w c f q q f w w 1 μ t or where f q w represents the joint probability density function of flood peak and volume c f q q f w w d c f q q f w w d f q q d f w w indicates the density function of copula f q q and f w w are probability density functions of q and w respectively due to the complexity for deriving analytical solutions in eq 5 the harmonic mean newton s method yin et al 2018b is applied to estimate the most likely realizations 3 4 bivariate uncertainty envelopes by c pbu method to evaluate the estimation uncertainty of the most likely scenarios for bivariate flood quantiles sourced from limited sample size the copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu method proposed by yin et al 2018c and the bivariate confidence ellipses are integrated to characterize this uncertainty envelope as follows 1 predefine a large number b set as 3000 in this study of bootstrapping samplings with the same sample size of original data and fit the marginal distributions and copula function for q and w data series 2 obtain z q w from the fitted bivariate dependence model by monte carlo simulation method 3 estimate parameters of marginal distributions of q and w by l moment method 4 estimate parameters of the copula function of z by the kendall correlation coefficient method and obtain b pairs of fj q w j 1 b 5 estimate design flood quantile qjt wjt under one jrp tor by selecting the mlc events for each pair of fj q w by eq 5 6 use these pairs to derive the bivariate confidence envelops associated to this jrp tor where the bivariate uncertainty envelop is the smallest envelop of the sample space containing a given probability friendly et al 2013 7 the area of the estimated 90 confidence ellipse is used as the measurement index of the sampling uncertainty under the bivariate framework the area is estimated with s π a b where a and b indicate the major semi axis and minor semi axis respectively 4 results 4 1 bias correction performance verification the performance of the dbc method was validated with respect to reproducing 37 observed statistics of mean standard deviation std and different quantiles as presented in table s1 these 37 metrics could both represent the mean and extreme meteorological conditions which is widely adopted in climate impact assessments chen et al 2019 fig 3 presents the portrait diagram of precipitation and temperature biases for the eight cmip5 models with and without bias corrections by the dbc method over the historical period 1961 2005 in the figure the numbers on the y axis correspond to eight gcms whereas the numbers on the x axis correspond to the evaluation metric identified in table s1 from the fig 3 we find that the raw gcms were considerably biased in simulating precipitation and temperature showing large systematical biases in climate model system the biases in raw temperature series were usually above 2 c absolute value and the biases in raw precipitation series were mostly above 20 relative value in terms of the 37 statistics after correction the relative errors of precipitation are reduced to less than 5 and the temperature bias are usually within 0 5 c we also present the spatial distributions of climate biases in july as an example to validate the dbc s performance in capturing mean and standard deviation characteristics of precipitation and temperature and fig s1 confirms the good performance of dbc over china particularly the dbc method performed better in capturing mean and extreme metrics than for standard deviation and the daily temperature shows smaller biases than precipitation in terms of these evaluation metrics all the above results show a good bias correction performance of the dbc method proving its suitability and reliability for generating future climate scenarios over china 4 2 projected changes of precipitation and temperature over china to detect the long term variation of meteorological variables over china the quantile regression method is employed to estimate the trend of annual mean and extreme meteorological variables covering the period of 1961 2100 under each gcm where the extremes are identified with the annual 99th percentile events as expected we find an overall ascending trend of temperature at the national scale in fig 4 accompanied by considerable uncertainty sourced from different gcms figs s2 s3 our results under rcp 8 5 projected that both mean and extreme temperatures would significantly rise at a rate of 0 3 0 6 c per decade providing strong evidence to support a hotter china projection in the future this projection is consistent with numerous previous studies that the warming rate over china is much higher than global mean rate e g ying 2012 chen and gao 2019 for example chen and gao 2019 projected that by the end of 21st century most regions of china would experience a 3 0 7 0 c additional warming level with reference of 1986 2005 period under rcp 8 5 we also find that western china would experience a more severe climate warming condition in terms of extreme temperatures implying a potential increasing risk of heat waves there despite considerable model uncertainty we could still observe that the yangtze river basin and pearl river basin have relatively low warming rates mainly ranging between 0 3 and 0 4 c per decade among the eight models the canesm2 and csiro mk3 6 0 gcms projected more dramatical warming trends while the cnrm cm5 gcm projected a relatively optimistic future that the temperatures in most areas over china would rise at a rate lower than 0 4 c per decade figs s2 s3 fig 4 also presents the long term trend results of annual precipitation amount and 99th percentile daily precipitation intensity over china showing a dominated ascending change over most landmasses despite accompanied by large gcm uncertainty and spatial variability unlike the changing pattern of temperature that no area exhibits a descending change several gcms projected descending precipitations over limited regions such as west northern china by bcc csm1 1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 gcms despite large gcm uncertainty we project that yangtze river basin has the most severe precipitation increasing rate than other major river basins over china for example the canesm2 gcm projects that the precipitation extremes would increase by 3 mm day per decade in the yangtze river basin figs s4 s5 more importantly the increasing trend is usually not progressive over northern china implying that this present dry region would not become wetter in the future which is consistent with a recent dryness projection gu et al 2019 4 3 hydrological simulations under climate change to consider the different climatic zones and underlying surface conditions for different catchments we employed four different hydrological models as candidates in streamflow simulations for the 151 catchments over china and then selected the best one with the largest kge value to project future climate scenarios firstly the gridded daily observation precipitation and temperature data are aggregated over the 151 catchments to obtain the basin average series using the thiessen polygon method as the recording periods of daily streamflow series vary in basins we selected the 20 year observation period with highest data quality for model calibration and validation a cross validation method proposed by arsenault et al 2017 was used for model validating in which the calibration period was the odd years whereas the validation was calculated based on the even years fig 5 a shows that among the four hydrological models the xaj model performs best over majority of chinese catchments and the gr4j model and hmet model exhibit best simulation capacity in several basins while the hbv model only shows best simulation performance in two basins indeed the xaj model has been widely verified a good applicability in humid and semi humid regions which is currently among one of the most commonly employed hydrological model over china the kge values of the best simulation hydrological model during calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 5b c respectively the selected hydrological model usually exhibits a good simulation performance with the kge values during calibration and validation periods larger than 0 8 over nine out of ten basins despite we observe a relatively low kge value in a few basins during validation period the kge values of all measured basins are still larger than 0 6 these results indicate that the selected hydrological model enables to simulate streamflow for all the 151 basins over china the outputs of eight cmip5 climate models under rcp8 5 scenario after bias correction were aggregated over the 151 catchments to obtain basin average series during 1961 2100 and then used as the inputs to drive the calibrated hydrological model for projecting future daily flow discharge series 4 4 projected changes of bivariate flood quantiles with the simulated streamflow scenarios of eight gcms we extracted the annual maximum peak discharges and flood volumes and then estimated the bivariate flood quantiles during historical period 1961 2005 and future period 2056 2100 by using the most likely realization method the 7 day flood volume is usually considered as an important indicator of flooding characteristics yin et al 2018b c and it has been widely adopted in natural hazard risk assessment and water resources management over china e g li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 so this study only focused on 7 day flood volume for sake of saving space under four different return periods i e t 100 50 20 and 10 year the relative changes of bivariate flood quantiles from the reference to the future period were also calculated figs 6 and 7 present the multi model ensemble mean design flood peaks and volumes during two periods presenting large spatial variability across china for example the design flood peaks under 100 year return period range from less than 5000 m3 s to over 40000 m3 s in historical period spatially the yangtze river basin during historical and future periods has the largest flood magnitudes in terms of peak discharge and volumes while the songhua river basin and liaohe river basin usually show smallest flood magnitudes the relative changes of flood quantiles are also shown in figs 6 and 7 from which we find that both flood peaks and volumes are projected to intensify with a warming climate in the future period although these are accompanied by large spatial variability in magnitude for the 50 year flood quantiles which is usually considered as an important indicator for flood occurrence characteristics over china we find a significant increasing tendency over yangtze river basin pearl river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin implying a potential threat to the existing infrastructures under future climate warming there specifically numerous catchments in those regions would experience a dramatical increase of flood quantile by over 50 while only a few basins are projected to have a decreasing flood risk to fully consider the flood projection sourced from gcms the relative change results of 50 year design flood peaks and volumes for all the selected eight gcms are also presented in figs s6 s7 as shown we find that despite the gcms show considerable variability in magnitudes the eight gcms all project a general ascending change of flood quantiles implying increasing flood risks under all the gcm scenarios only a very few basins would experience slight decreasing flood peaks and volumes while the flood condition in nine out of ten measured chinese basins is more severe with a relative change rates almost exceeding 25 a very few catchments may show opposite changing tendency under different gcms for example the csiro mk3 6 0 gcm projects that several catchments in the yellow river basin would have decreasing flood magnitudes in the future periods while the remaining gcms all project a potential large increasing flood risk the distribution of relative change results of all the 151 catchments over china for the eight gcms is also explicitly presented by the violin plots in fig 8 in which the hollow circle denotes the median value the box represents interquartile range and the whiskers shows 95 uncertainty intervals the shape of the violin portraits the probability distribution of relative change results with the kernel density estimation method from fig 8 we find that the changes of both flood peak and volume are not sensitive to return periods but the violin shapes differ from gcms that exhibiting large uncertainty sourced from different models under the eight climate models the relative change of flood quantiles for different return periods ranges from 50 to 250 and only a few catchments show a decreasing change moreover most relative change rates are concentrated between 25 and 100 implying that the flood quantiles at most catchments would double in magnitude overall despite the large gcm uncertainty and spatial variability the flood quantiles measured in different return periods are projected to rapidly increase under the warming climate 4 5 uncertainty analysis of bivariate flood estimation in order to illustrate the bivariate flood estimation uncertainty for each gcm we simulate bivariate series for 3 000 times and then estimate the corresponding most likely realizations under four different return periods with the c pbu method the areas of 90 confidence ellipse are calculated to quantify this uncertainty and the spatial distribution of uncertainty results during historical and future periods under 50 year are presented in figs s8 s9 we observe that the uncertainty envelope is apparently lager over those catchments with relative heavier flood quantiles to closely evaluate the changes in estimation uncertainty from historical period to future period fig 9 demonstrates the relative change results of the uncertainty envelope indicated by areas of 90 confidence ellipse under the 50 year return period for all the eight gcms most catchments over china show a considerable increase in bivariate flood quantile estimation uncertainty in a warmer climate condition and the area of 90 confidence ellipse even increase by over 50 percent in the majority of catchments over yangtze river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin despite that the estimation uncertainty increases with ascending return period the relative changes do not change much with increasing return periods figs s10 s12 the upper min river basin is selected as an example to illustrate the uncertainty envelope change under eight gcms figs 10 and s13 we find that despite different gcms yield considerable variations of most likely realizations and confidence ellipse in the upper min river basin both the bivariate flood quantiles and uncertainty are projected to become larger under future warming condition these results indicate that climate change not only has important impacts on flood quantile but also the estimation uncertainty 5 discussion because the atmospheric moisture capacity is highly sensitive to temperature numerous observations and climate models both project an intensification of precipitation extremes under climate warming the clausius clapeyron c c relationship has been widely accepted as a fundamental law to characterize the response of precipitation intensity to a warming climate and it usually projects that the daily precipitation extremes would increase at a higher rate than monthly precipitation or annual precipitation yin et al 2018a china has been widely projected to suffer from more frequent and persistent heat waves russo et al 2014 and our multi model ensemble also projected a progressive warming rate of both mean and extreme temperatures under rcp 8 5 suggesting that policy makers should consider these potential increasing risk of heat waves in policy formulation the precipitation is also projected to intensify at a considerable high rate over most regions in china despite this change is not as dramatic as that of temperature china is among one of the most flood prone countries our study projects that the bivariate flood quantiles over most measured catchments would intensify with climate warming and numerous catchments would experience a flood magnitude increase by a percent of over 50 this finding holds true for four selected return periods implying a robust projection of increasing flooding risk over china in a warmer climate although this study provides a systematic investigation about flood quantile evolution with climate warming over china the underlying physical mechanisms are still uncertain unlike precipitation that are primarily governed by atmospheric thermodynamics the streamflow extremes are also highly impacted by underlying surface condition changes such as irrigation deforestation and grazing and land desertification specifically the agricultural intensification increases soil moisture and evapotranspiration which could contribute to heavier precipitation and thus resulting in flood intensification fowler and helvey 1974 numerous studies have proved that the deforestation could increase surface runoff as opposed to reducing base flow krishnaswamy et al 2012 and carbon dioxide emission is another important factor that affects streamflow response via plant physiology betts et al 2007 this study only quantificationally evaluated the change but failed to detect and attribute these changes to climate warming and human activity future work could aim at detecting and attributing natural variability and land use land cover change to flood quantile evolution over china the issue of uncertainty is usually popular and has received great attention in hydrological community because statistical quantifications particularly climate change impact assessments without uncertainty consideration usually yield biased conclusions the uncertainty of flood projections under climate change are usually considered sourcing from gcms rcps statistical downscaling methods and hydrological models previous studies have conducted extensive works to compare these uncertainties and most of these have reported that the gcm uncertainty accounts for a key role in hydrological projections shen et al 2018 however in both univariate and bivariate hydrological frequency analysis framework the flood quantile estimation uncertainty mainly due to sample limitation is also important yin et al 2018a therefore this study primarily takes the gcm uncertainty into consideration and also evaluate the changes in flood quantile estimation uncertainty under climate change to provide a more comprehensive projections about china s future climate and flooding pattern we also present results of all the eight gcms figs s2 s13 our projections confirm that different gcms could yield opposing projection even at the same catchment implying the substantial uncertainty needs to be paid great attentions considering that the uncertainty induced by rcp scenarios may play an important role in climate change impacts we also derive the trends of annual mean and extreme meteorological variables covering the period of 1961 2100 under each gcm and then present the multi model ensemble mean trends in fig s14 as shown a widespread increasing change in both temperature and precipitation are still dominated over china despite the changing rates are lower than those at rcp 8 5 these implies that the uncertainty caused by rcp scenario does not change future climate warming and precipitation intensifications as the observation based gridded meteorological data is in a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 this study analyzed the results at the same resolution to comply with observations to fully consider the potential uncertainty caused by spatial resolutions we also bilinearly interpolated the trends of annual precipitation and temperature into 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 2 0 grids respectively the associated spatial variations are not significant and the overall increasing results are robust across different spatial resolutions fig s15 despite the large uncertainties induced by multiple sources these did not change our main conclusion that china would suffer from a substantial increasing flood hazards in terms of flood quantiles under future warming here it is challenging to detect and systematically partition different uncertainty components future works could focus on investigating the integrated uncertainty on flood evolution and impact assessments 6 conclusions this study investigated the change of bivariate flood quantiles for 151 catchments over china with climate projected by a set of multi model ensemble under the highest representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 after correcting biases of daily outputs of eight cmip5 gcms four hydrological models were driven and validated for each catchment and the best simulation model was selected to project hydrological scenarios the copula function and most likely realization method are employed for deriving the flood bivariate quantiles between the future and historical periods and the uncertainty envelope is quantified by the areas of 90 confidence envelops with a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 an overall positive trend of temperature and precipitation is projected at the national scale accompanied by substantial gcm uncertainty and spatial variability over most regions in china annual mean temperature would increase at a rate of 0 3 0 6 c per decade and the yangtze river basin has the most severe precipitation increasing rate than other major river basins over china 2 the eight gcms all project a general increasing change of bivariate flood quantiles under different return periods although these are accompanied by large spatial variability in magnitude numerous basins would experience a dramatical increase of both flood peaks and volumes by over 50 while only a few basins are projected to have a decreasing flood risk suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to warming climates 3 most catchments over china show a considerable increase in bivariate flood quantile estimation uncertainty in a warmer climate condition and the area of 90 confidence ellipses even increase by over 50 percent in many catchments over yangtze river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin although the estimation uncertainty increases with ascending return period the relative changes from historical to future period do not change much with increasing return periods credit authorship contribution statement jiabo yin conceptualization data curation writing original draft shenglian guo

5546,as atmospheric moisture capacity is highly sensitive to rising temperatures precipitation extremes are widely projected to intensify with a warming climate and thus altering the flooding generation regime previous works seldomly focused on bivariate flood quantiles under climate change at a national scale and fewer flooding projections quantified the estimation uncertainty sourced from sample size limitation this study systematically investigates the changes in bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume with incorporation of sampling uncertainty for 151 catchments over china with climate trajectories projected by a set of multi model ensemble under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 after correcting the systematical biases of eight cmip5 gcm outputs four state of the art hydrological models are driven and validated for each catchment and the best simulation model is selected to project future streamflow scenarios the copula function is employed to construct the joint distribution of flood peak and volume and then the most likely realizations of bivariate quantiles are derived under different joint return periods jrps with the uncertainty envelope quantified with the area of 90 confidence ellipse by a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach our results project an overall ascending trend of temperature and precipitation over china and the bivariate flood quantiles and corresponding estimation uncertainty of most catchments in the future period 2056 2100 are much larger than the baseline 1961 2005 despite accompanied by substantial climate model uncertainty and spatial variability in magnitude many basins would be subjected to a dramatic increase of flood magnitude by over 50 while only few basins are projected to experience a decreasing flood risk suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to a warming climate over china keywords climate change bivariate analysis copula function uncertainty estimation china 1 introduction global anthropogenic warming mainly due to greenhouse gas emission has altered the energy exchange channel and hydrological cycle between atmosphere and earth which has exacerbated the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and resulted in more frequent and persistent hydrometeorological hazards such as flooding yin et al 2018a according to the clausius clapeyron c c relationship the holding vapor capacity of atmosphere is increasing at rates with about 7 per degree warming koutsoyiannis 2012 thus leading to a substantial intensification of extreme precipitations in most areas of the globe allan and soden 2008 the potential for extreme precipitation to intensify with climate change has recently received increasing attention because of the devastating impacts of storm generated flooding on the environment economy and society alfieri et al 2017 hence it is of great importance to assess the flood characteristics under a changing climate to enable appropriate adaptation strategies for managing and minimizing the future flooding risks the global climate models gcms based on mathematical representations of atmosphere ice cap ocean and energy and water cycle are considered to be the most versatile and integrated tool available for generating climate trajectories and representing climate variability swansburg et al 2004 over the past decade numerous studies have employed the gcm simulations in evaluating climate change impact on flood dynamics while most of these are within a univariate hydrological frequency analysis framework e g prudhomme et al 2002 das et al 2011 huziy et al 2013 tofiq and guven 2015 liang et al 2019 these univariate works can only provide limited assessment of the flood occurrence likelihood as floods are multifaceted natural hazards characterized by peak discharge volume and duration e g shiau 2003 requena et al 2016 therefore it is critical to incorporate the joint modeling of multiple flood characteristics into climate change impact assessments until now only limited studies focused on flood s multiplex nature under a changing climate among which the copula based approaches have been widely employed due to their good feasibility of marginal distributions for example jeong et al 2014 explored the variations of spring flood frequency under the changing environment for 21 northeast canadian basins by fitting the copula function as well as the univariate distributions yin et al 2018b investigated the impacts of climate change on flood magnitudes within a bivariate framework and derived the adaptive bivariate flood quantiles by non stationary copula approaches for the ganjiang river basin in china in the assessments of climate change impacts on hydrology various sources of uncertainty have been identified and discussed a deep understanding and quantification of such uncertainty is important for scientifically evaluating future flood hazard risk and guiding water resources planning and management generally the uncertainty is classified in five sources i e greenhouse gas emission scenario ghges gcm structure natural climate variability downscaling method and hydrological structure and parameter shen et al 2018 a series of works have involved in quantifying the uncertainty of climate change impacts on flood characteristics arising from above sources and the uncertainty envelope from different sources in the hydrological climate change impacts is also compared by numerous studies for instance wilby and harris 2006 evaluated and compared five uncertainty sources in the low flow projection for the river thames in united kingdom by integrating four gcms two statistical downscaling methods two ghgess two hydrological model structures and two sets of hydrological model parameters prudhomme and davies 2009 employed three gcms two ghgess one statistical downscaling approach and one dynamical downscaling model to investigate the uncertainty of climate change impacts on the streamflow pattern of four british catchments previous studies consistently show that the choice of a gcm usually accounts for the largest contributor to the uncertainty in hydrological projections zhuan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 therefore the use of a multi model ensemble is necessary for evaluating climate change impacts on flood characteristics particularly for bivariate quantile projection but beyond that the uncertainty of bivariate quantile estimation also plays a prominent role in hydrological frequency analysis salvadori et al 2011 recognized the importance of accounting for quantile estimation uncertainty because it is relevant to the reliability of the inference results and corresponding practical application serinaldi 2013 stated that the assessment of uncertainty has been always overlooked in bivariate framework and proposed three algorithms for uncertainty estimation of joint quantiles zhang et al 2015 evaluated the uncertainty of estimating the bivariate quantiles of drought duration and severity based on bayesian method in china s east river basin and found that the increasing sample size can reduce the uncertainty of joint distribution these previous works serinaldi 2013 zhang et al 2015 dung et al 2015 yin et al 2018b revealed that the major uncertainty source in bivariate quantile estimation is sampling uncertainty due to data size limitation whereas uncertainty estimation methods selection and parameter estimation methods are of minor importance a quantification of such sampling uncertainty would contribute to a more reliable climate change projection as well as better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning flood generation and characterization however the sampling uncertainty is usually overlooked in climate change impact assessments china as the most populous country is threatened by catastrophic flood hazards and has suffered from huge environmental damages and economic losses especially over the recent decades in a changing environment for instance extreme precipitation occurred in the yangtze river during 1998 have caused severe flooding and affected the 8 million population wang and plate 2012 flooding as the most costly and dangerous natural disasters in china has caused annual economic loss of 139 billion yuan and 984 deaths per year since 1990 he et al 2018 due to these substantial damages and losses since 2000 china has been increasing the fiscal investment in flood prevention and mitigation under climate warming and this investment will continue rising according to the government s current sustainable policy li et al 2019 the accurate quantification of changes in bivariate flood quantiles under future climates is highly important for guiding future investment allocations and management however the potential changes in bivariate flood quantile under climate warming has not been thoroughly examined over china and fewer work incorporates the estimation uncertainty into the multi model ensemble projections and assessments the objective of the paper is to systematically investigate the projected changes of bivariate flood quantiles and estimation uncertainty over 151 catchments in china the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces observation data and coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate scenarios section 3 is devoted to statistical downscaling method hydrological modelling bivariate flood frequency analysis and uncertainty quantification method in section 4 the change of meteorological variables as well as bivariate flood quantiles is analyzed we perform detailed discussion in section 5 and conclude our conclusions in section 6 2 data description 2 1 observational meterological data and streamflow records a high resolution 0 5 0 5 gridded meteorological dataset over china covering the period of 1961 2016 is used in this study this dataset contains daily precipitation daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature and daily average temperature which is archived in china meteorological data sharing service system http www cma gov cn this gridded dataset was generated from 2472 in situ observation gauge stations across china by thin plate spline interpolation method and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data sampling the data quality has been controlled by national meteorological information centre wu et al 2018 which is considered as the latest gridded meteorological data with a highest spatial resolution in china we used the daily streamflow series of 151 catchments over china and these catchments span over all the nine major river basins in china the streamflow data are collected from the nine water resources commission affiliated to chinese ministry of water resources such as yangtze river water resources commission yellow river conservancy commission pearl river water resources commission etc the streamflow dataset covers different time period and we only used the series during 1961 2016 it is noted that the northwest river basin was not considered in this study due to paucity of streamflow data the northwest china is far away from surrounding oceans and high mountains like tianshan mountain block atmospheric moisture transportation and thus inhibiting convection development there shi et al 2007 these factors both contribute to shaping a dry climate pattern in northwest china and hence flooding hazards usually receive less social concern than droughts over there 2 2 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 scenarios to yield an extensive evaluation of climate model uncertainty a set of eight projections of the atmospheric climate variables generated from the latest version of cmip5 were adopted in this study namely access1 3 bcc csm1 1 m canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 miroc5 and noresm1 m which is archived in the program for climate model diagnosis and inter comparison https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 table 1 presents the general information of these selected eight gcms which includes five earth system models and three atmospheric ocean models cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 and miroc5 these gcms are developed and maintained by climate institutions from seven different countries which are currently popular employed over china due to their good performance in reproducing climate features in china e g shen et al 2018 gu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the used daily cmip5 cgm outputs cover the period of 1961 2100 under the highest emission scenario representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 which contains daily precipitation and temperatures all the gcm outputs were interpolated into a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 to be compliant with the observation based gridded meteorological data for bias correction the bilinear interpolation method was employed in this study which has ease of implementation and usually show a good performance in smoothly transforming coarse gcm simulations into spatially fine outputs by utilizing information from four nearest neighboring grids zhou et al 2019 ahmed et al 2019 the time period of 1961 2005 is taken as historical reference period and the future period is selected as 2056 2100 3 methodology the flowchart of our climate change impact assessments is displayed in fig 1 on which there are four modules the climate projection module generates the future climate scenarios by eight cmip5 gcms and the daily precipitation and temperature series are statistically bias corrected by the daily bias correction dbc method the hydrological module simulates and projects future streamflow using four hydrological models driven by the corrected gcm meteorological series the bivariate analysis module incorporates the copula function and most likely realization method for deriving the flood bivariate quantiles during historical and future periods under different joint return periods jrps the uncertainty analysis module quantifies the flood quantile estimation uncertainty with the area of 90 confidence ellipses by a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs as the gcm outputs are usually too coarse to represent the climate variability at a catchment scale necessitates the utilization of the downscaling technique in this study an empirical statistical downscaling approach i e daily bias correction dbc method proposed by chen et al 2013 is applied to cope with the systematical biases of gcms outputs the dbc method is a hybrid approach with incorporation of the local intensity scaling loci and daily translation dt techniques and its good performance has been widely verified in climate projection studies e g shen et al 2018 zhuan et al 2019 the loci method schmidli et al 2006 is first used to correct the precipitation frequency for a particular month e g december in the historical period a wet day threshold is determined from the gcm to ensure that the threshold exceedance equals the observed wet day occurrence in the same month the threshold is then applied in the future period to correct the frequency of gcm precipitation outputs in the corresponding month the dt method mpelasoka and chiew 2009 is then employed to correct the distributions of precipitation intensity and temperatures this dbc method fully takes advantage of the loci method to correct precipitation occurrence instead of applying the same factor to each daily precipitation e g the loci method for a specific month it modulates the change as a function of the daily precipitation intensity or temperature based on quantile errors in the distribution of precipitation or temperature for the observation series to implement the dt technique a distribution mapping technique is used to establish a relationship between the observed precipitation p obs p e r c or temperature t obs p e r c at different percentiles and the gcm simulated scenarios p gcm r e f p e r c t gcm r e f p e r c for a particular month during the reference period the ratios of precipitation differences of temperature between observed and gcm simulated data at the reference period are calculated for each percentile the adjusted daily precipitation p adj f u t d for the future period can be obtained as product of the percentile ratio and gcm raw outputs while the adjusted daily temperature t adj f u t d for the future period can be derived by adding the percentile difference chen et al 2013 1 p adj f u t d p gcm f u t d p obs p e r c p gcm r e f p e r c 2 t adj f u t d t gcm f u t d t obs p e r c t gcm r e f p e r c where the subscript perc refers to a percentile for a particular month and the subscript d refers to a specific day in the future period 3 2 hydrological modelling given that our studied 151 catchments spanned over different climate zones and underlying surface conditions over china one particular hydrological model may unreliably capture the hydro climatic transferability so we used four different hydrological models as candicates in streamflow simulations i e hmet model gr4j model hbv model and xinanjiang xaj model these four models have different number of parameters model structures and underlying mechanisms in simulating the physical rainfall runoff processes 3 2 1 model description the hmets model is a 21 parameter lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model developed at école de technologie supérieure the hmets contains two connected reservoirs for representing unsaturated i e vadose and saturated i e phreatic zones and captures fundamental hydrological processes such as snow accumulation melting and refreezing evapotranspiration infiltration as well as flow routing to the watershed outlet troin et al 2016 the gr4j model modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a daily continuous rainfall runoff model developed for streamflow simulation at the catchment scale which is the modified version of the gr3j model primarily proposed and successively improved by edijatno et al 1999 and perrin et al 2003 the gr4j uses precipitation and potential evapotranspiration estimates as inputs while streamflow is only required for parameter optimization and model evaluation in our study we estimated the potential evapotranspiration with a temperature based method proposed by oudin et al 2005 and then used the estimation as the gr4j model inputs the conceptual hbv model was originally developed in the 1970s by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute there are three main modules in the hbv model i e degree day snow routine soil moisture routine and runoff routing in the snow routine module the snow accumulation and snowmelt process is characterized by a degree day method bergström and forsman 1973 in which two parameters are used to estimate this interacting process i e degree day factor dd and threshold temperature for snow rain tt the measured precipitation is taken as snowfall when the temperature is colder than threshold temperature while precipitation appears in rainfall when the air temperartue is warmer than the threshold value rango and martinec 1995 the soil moisture routing module estimates the soil moisture storage by accounting for rainfall and evapotranspiration with two constants i e permanent wilting point pwp and field capacity fc the runoff routine module transforms excess water from the soil moisture routine to discharge which characterize the concentration process by upper and lower reservoirs with five parameters jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the xinanjiang xaj model is a conceptual watershed model developed by zhao 1992 and the model is physically based on the theory that runoff generation occurs on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not generated until the soil water deficit is replenished the xaj model has been widely and successfully employed for streamflow simulation and flood forecasting over china particularly in the humid and semi humid climate regions zhang et al 2012 3 2 2 model calibration and performance evaluation index we calibrated the four hydrological models using the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method developed at the university of arizona duan et al 1992 the sce ua method integrates the strengths of several effective global optimization concepts and employs both deterministic search strategies and random elements to enable simultaneously benefiting from topological response surface information collected during the search rahnamay et al 2019 this algorithm combines the concepts of complex shuffling with the downhill simplex method dsm which is in a simple structure and only few parameters need to be tuned by users due to its ease of implementation and high computation efficiency the sce ua algorithm has been widely employed in various scientific fields particularly in water resources management and hydrology naeini et al 2018 more details about this optimization method can be found in duan et al 1993 the kling gupta efficiency kge is selected as the evaluation index and the objective function is that maximising the kge value during calibration gupta et al 2009 3 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r indicates the person s linear correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated streamflow α is the ratio of standard deviations of observed and simulated streamflow while β is the ratio of mean value of observation and simulations the value of kge ranges from to 1 with kge 1 indicating a perfect fit between the observed and simulated series as shown by gupta et al 2009 kge consists of three main components correlation g 1 variability g 2 and bias g 3 the relative contribution of these three components to the kge value could be calculated as follows 4 g i g i j 1 3 g j where g 1 r 1 2 g 2 α 1 2 and g 3 β 1 2 3 3 joint return period and most likely realization method this study focuses on flood peak q and volume w to investigate the joint probability of flood occurrence under climate change via the copula function which is a versatile mathematical tool for characterizing intercorrelated hydrological variables the marginal distributions of q and w are fitted with the pearson type iii p iii distribution recommended by ministry of water resources of china and the parameters are estimated by l moments method hosking 1990 within the copula based framework different definitions of joint return periods jrps have been proposed such as or and kendall dynamic structure based return periods and so on shiau 2003 salvadori et al 2016 among these the or case tor is usually adopted in flood occurrence assessment e g yin et al 2018c 5 t or μ 1 f q w μ 1 c f q q f w w where μ is the mean inter arrival time between two consecutive events in the case of annual maxima μ 1 year and f q w p q q w w is depicted by a copula function c f q q f w w f q q and f w w denote the marginal distribution functions of q and w respectively under the bivariate framework the choice of an appropriate t or leads to infinite combinations of bivariate quantiles of flood peak and volume as shown in fig 2 the events along the t or level curve is generally not equivalent in terms of engineering practice chebana and ouarda 2011 and hence the likelihood of each event must be taken into consideration when selecting appropriate joint quantiles yin et al 2018c salvadori et al 2011 proposed the novel concept of most likely design realization to choose the point with the highest likelihood along the p level curve in this study the most likely realization method salvadori et al 2011 yin et al 2018b is used to choose the flood scenario with the highest likelihood along the t or level isoline for a given tor the most likely combination mlc point among all possible events can be derived by the following formula 6 q w arg max f q w c f q q f w w f q q f w w c f q q f w w 1 μ t or where f q w represents the joint probability density function of flood peak and volume c f q q f w w d c f q q f w w d f q q d f w w indicates the density function of copula f q q and f w w are probability density functions of q and w respectively due to the complexity for deriving analytical solutions in eq 5 the harmonic mean newton s method yin et al 2018b is applied to estimate the most likely realizations 3 4 bivariate uncertainty envelopes by c pbu method to evaluate the estimation uncertainty of the most likely scenarios for bivariate flood quantiles sourced from limited sample size the copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu method proposed by yin et al 2018c and the bivariate confidence ellipses are integrated to characterize this uncertainty envelope as follows 1 predefine a large number b set as 3000 in this study of bootstrapping samplings with the same sample size of original data and fit the marginal distributions and copula function for q and w data series 2 obtain z q w from the fitted bivariate dependence model by monte carlo simulation method 3 estimate

estimate design flood quantile qjt wjt under one jrp tor by selecting the mlc events for each pair of fj q w by eq 5 6 use these pairs to derive the bivariate confidence envelops associated to this jrp tor where the bivariate uncertainty envelop is the smallest envelop of the sample space containing a given probability friendly et al 2013 7 the area of the estimated 90 confidence ellipse is used as the measurement index of the sampling uncertainty under the bivariate framework the area is estimated with s π a b where a and b indicate the major semi axis and minor semi axis respectively 4 results 4 1 bias correction performance verification the performance of the dbc method was validated with respect to reproducing 37 observed statistics of mean standard deviation std and different quantiles as presented in table s1 these 37 metrics could both represent the mean and extreme meteorological conditions which is widely adopted in climate impact assessments chen et al 2019 fig 3 presents the portrait diagram of precipitation and temperature biases for the eight cmip5 models with and without bias corrections by the dbc method over the historical period 1961 2005 in the figure the numbers on the y axis correspond to eight gcms whereas the numbers on the x axis correspond to the evaluation metric identified in table s1 from the fig 3 we find that the raw gcms were considerably biased in simulating precipitation and temperature showing large systematical biases in climate model system the biases in raw temperature series were usually above 2 c absolute value and the biases in raw precipitation series were mostly above 20 relative value in terms of the 37 statistics after correction the relative errors of precipitation are reduced to less than 5 and the temperature bias are usually within 0 5 c we also present the spatial distributions of climate biases in july as an example to validate the dbc s performance in capturing mean and standard deviation characteristics of precipitation and temperature and fig s1 confirms the good performance of dbc over china particularly the dbc method performed better in capturing mean and extreme metrics than for standard deviation and the daily temperature shows smaller biases than precipitation in terms of these evaluation metrics all the above results show a good bias correction performance of the dbc method proving its suitability and reliability for generating future climate scenarios over china 4 2 projected changes of precipitation and temperature over china to detect the long term variation of meteorological variables over china the quantile regression method is employed to estimate the trend of annual mean and extreme meteorological variables covering the period of 1961 2100 under each gcm where the extremes are identified with the annual 99th percentile events as expected we find an overall ascending trend of temperature at the national scale in fig 4 accompanied by considerable uncertainty sourced from different gcms figs s2 s3 our results under rcp 8 5 projected that both mean and extreme temperatures would significantly rise at a rate of 0 3 0 6 c per decade providing strong evidence to support a hotter china projection in the future this projection is consistent with numerous previous studies that the warming rate over china is much higher than global mean rate e g ying 2012 chen and gao 2019 for example chen and gao 2019 projected that by the end of 21st century most regions of china would experience a 3 0 7 0 c additional warming level with reference of 1986 2005 period under rcp 8 5 we also find that western china would experience a more severe climate warming condition in terms of extreme temperatures implying a potential increasing risk of heat waves there despite considerable model uncertainty we could still observe that the yangtze river basin and pearl river basin have relatively low warming rates mainly ranging between 0 3 and 0 4 c per decade among the eight models the canesm2 and csiro mk3 6 0 gcms projected more dramatical warming trends while the cnrm cm5 gcm projected a relatively optimistic future that the temperatures in most areas over china would rise at a rate lower than 0 4 c per decade figs s2 s3 fig 4 also presents the long term trend results of annual precipitation amount and 99th percentile daily precipitation intensity over china showing a dominated ascending change over most landmasses despite accompanied by large gcm uncertainty and spatial variability unlike the changing pattern of temperature that no area exhibits a descending change several gcms projected descending precipitations over limited regions such as west northern china by bcc csm1 1 m and csiro mk3 6 0 gcms despite large gcm uncertainty we project that yangtze river basin has the most severe precipitation increasing rate than other major river basins over china for example the canesm2 gcm projects that the precipitation extremes would increase by 3 mm day per decade in the yangtze river basin figs s4 s5 more importantly the increasing trend is usually not progressive over northern china implying that this present dry region would not become wetter in the future which is consistent with a recent dryness projection gu et al 2019 4 3 hydrological simulations under climate change to consider the different climatic zones and underlying surface conditions for different catchments we employed four different hydrological models as candidates in streamflow simulations for the 151 catchments over china and then selected the best one with the largest kge value to project future climate scenarios firstly the gridded daily observation precipitation and temperature data are aggregated over the 151 catchments to obtain the basin average series using the thiessen polygon method as the recording periods of daily streamflow series vary in basins we selected the 20 year observation period with highest data quality for model calibration and validation a cross validation method proposed by arsenault et al 2017 was used for model validating in which the calibration period was the odd years whereas the validation was calculated based on the even years fig 5 a shows that among the four hydrological models the xaj model performs best over majority of chinese catchments and the gr4j model and hmet model exhibit best simulation capacity in several basins while the hbv model only shows best simulation performance in two basins indeed the xaj model has been widely verified a good applicability in humid and semi humid regions which is currently among one of the most commonly employed hydrological model over china the kge values of the best simulation hydrological model during calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 5b c respectively the selected hydrological model usually exhibits a good simulation performance with the kge values during calibration and validation periods larger than 0 8 over nine out of ten basins despite we observe a relatively low kge value in a few basins during validation period the kge values of all measured basins are still larger than 0 6 these results indicate that the selected hydrological model enables to simulate streamflow for all the 151 basins over china the outputs of eight cmip5 climate models under rcp8 5 scenario after bias correction were aggregated over the 151 catchments to obtain basin average series during 1961 2100 and then used as the inputs to drive the calibrated hydrological model for projecting future daily flow discharge series 4 4 projected changes of bivariate flood quantiles with the simulated streamflow scenarios of eight gcms we extracted the annual maximum peak discharges and flood volumes and then estimated the bivariate flood quantiles during historical period 1961 2005 and future period 2056 2100 by using the most likely realization method the 7 day flood volume is usually considered as an important indicator of flooding characteristics yin et al 2018b c and it has been widely adopted in natural hazard risk assessment and water resources management over china e g li et al 2016 liu et al 2018 so this study only focused on 7 day flood volume for sake of saving space under four different return periods i e t 100 50 20 and 10 year the relative changes of bivariate flood quantiles from the reference to the future period were also calculated figs 6 and 7 present the multi model ensemble mean design flood peaks and volumes during two periods presenting large spatial variability across china for example the design flood peaks under 100 year return period range from less than 5000 m3 s to over 40000 m3 s in historical period spatially the yangtze river basin during historical and future periods has the largest flood magnitudes in terms of peak discharge and volumes while the songhua river basin and liaohe river basin usually show smallest flood magnitudes the relative changes of flood quantiles are also shown in figs 6 and 7 from which we find that both flood peaks and volumes are projected to intensify with a warming climate in the future period although these are accompanied by large spatial variability in magnitude for the 50 year flood quantiles which is usually considered as an important indicator for flood occurrence characteristics over china we find a significant increasing tendency over yangtze river basin pearl river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin implying a potential threat to the existing infrastructures under future climate warming there specifically numerous catchments in those regions would experience a dramatical increase of flood quantile by over 50 while only a few basins are projected to have a decreasing flood risk to fully consider the flood projection sourced from gcms the relative change results of 50 year design flood peaks and volumes for all the selected eight gcms are also presented in figs s6 s7 as shown we find that despite the gcms show considerable variability in magnitudes the eight gcms all project a general ascending change of flood quantiles implying increasing flood risks under all the gcm scenarios only a very few basins would experience slight decreasing flood peaks and volumes while the flood condition in nine out of ten measured chinese basins is more severe with a relative change rates almost exceeding 25 a very few catchments may show opposite changing tendency under different gcms for example the csiro mk3 6 0 gcm projects that several catchments in the yellow river basin would have decreasing flood magnitudes in the future periods while the remaining gcms all project a potential large increasing flood risk the distribution of relative change results of all the 151 catchments over china for the eight gcms is also explicitly presented by the violin plots in fig 8 in which the hollow circle denotes the median value the box represents interquartile range and the whiskers shows 95 uncertainty intervals the shape of the violin portraits the probability distribution of relative change results with the kernel density estimation method from fig 8 we find that the changes of both flood peak and volume are not sensitive to return periods but the violin shapes differ from gcms that exhibiting large uncertainty sourced from different models under the eight climate models the relative change of flood quantiles for different return periods ranges from 50 to 250 and only a few catchments show a decreasing change moreover most relative change rates are concentrated between 25 and 100 implying that the flood quantiles at most catchments would double in magnitude overall despite the large gcm uncertainty and spatial variability the flood quantiles measured in different return periods are projected to rapidly increase under the warming climate 4 5 uncertainty analysis of bivariate flood estimation in order to illustrate the bivariate flood estimation uncertainty for each gcm we simulate bivariate series for 3 000 times and then estimate the corresponding most likely realizations under four different return periods with the c pbu method the areas of 90 confidence ellipse are calculated to quantify this uncertainty and the spatial distribution of uncertainty results during historical and future periods under 50 year are presented in figs s8 s9 we observe that the uncertainty envelope is apparently lager over those catchments with relative heavier flood quantiles to closely evaluate the changes in estimation uncertainty from historical period to future period fig 9 demonstrates the relative change results of the uncertainty envelope indicated by areas of 90 confidence ellipse under the 50 year return period for all the eight gcms most catchments over china show a considerable increase in bivariate flood quantile estimation uncertainty in a warmer climate condition and the area of 90 confidence ellipse even increase by over 50 percent in the majority of catchments over yangtze river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin despite that the estimation uncertainty increases with ascending return period the relative changes do not change much with increasing return periods figs s10 s12 the upper min river basin is selected as an example to illustrate the uncertainty envelope change under eight gcms figs 10 and s13 we find that despite different gcms yield considerable variations of most likely realizations and confidence ellipse in the upper min river basin both the bivariate flood quantiles and uncertainty are projected to become larger under future warming condition these results indicate that climate change not only has important impacts on flood quantile but also the estimation uncertainty 5 discussion because the atmospheric moisture capacity is highly sensitive to temperature numerous observations and climate models both project an intensification of precipitation extremes under climate warming the clausius clapeyron c c relationship has been widely accepted as a fundamental law to characterize the response of precipitation intensity to a warming climate and it usually projects that the daily precipitation extremes would increase at a higher rate than monthly precipitation or annual precipitation yin et al 2018a china has been widely projected to suffer from more frequent and persistent heat waves russo et al 2014 and our multi model ensemble also projected a progressive warming rate of both mean and extreme temperatures under rcp 8 5 suggesting that policy makers should consider these potential increasing risk of heat waves in policy formulation the precipitation is also projected to intensify at a considerable high rate over most regions in china despite this change is not as dramatic as that of temperature china is among one of the most flood prone countries our study projects that the bivariate flood quantiles over most measured catchments would intensify with climate warming and numerous catchments would experience a flood magnitude increase by a percent of over 50 this finding holds true for four selected return periods implying a robust projection of increasing flooding risk over china in a warmer climate although this study provides a systematic investigation about flood quantile evolution with climate warming over china the underlying physical mechanisms are still uncertain unlike precipitation that are primarily governed by atmospheric thermodynamics the streamflow extremes are also highly impacted by underlying surface condition changes such as irrigation deforestation and grazing and land desertification specifically the agricultural intensification increases soil moisture and evapotranspiration which could contribute to heavier precipitation and thus resulting in flood intensification fowler and helvey 1974 numerous studies have proved that the deforestation could increase surface runoff as opposed to reducing base flow krishnaswamy et al 2012 and carbon dioxide emission is another important factor that affects streamflow response via plant physiology betts et al 2007 this study only quantificationally evaluated the change but failed to detect and attribute these changes to climate warming and human activity future work could aim at detecting and attributing natural variability and land use land cover change to flood quantile evolution over china the issue of uncertainty is usually popular and has received great attention in hydrological community because statistical quantifications particularly climate change impact assessments without uncertainty consideration usually yield biased conclusions the uncertainty of flood projections under climate change are usually considered sourcing from gcms rcps statistical downscaling methods and hydrological models previous studies have conducted extensive works to compare these uncertainties and most of these have reported that the gcm uncertainty accounts for a key role in hydrological projections shen et al 2018 however in both univariate and bivariate hydrological frequency analysis framework the flood quantile estimation uncertainty mainly due to sample limitation is also important yin et al 2018a therefore this study primarily takes the gcm uncertainty into consideration and also evaluate the changes in flood quantile estimation uncertainty under climate change to provide a more comprehensive projections about china s future climate and flooding pattern we also present results of all the eight gcms figs s2 s13 our projections confirm that different gcms could yield opposing projection even at the same catchment implying the substantial uncertainty needs to be paid great attentions considering that the uncertainty induced by rcp scenarios may play an important role in climate change impacts we also derive the trends of annual mean and extreme meteorological variables covering the period of 1961 2100 under each gcm and then present the multi model ensemble mean trends in fig s14 as shown a widespread increasing change in both temperature and precipitation are still dominated over china despite the changing rates are lower than those at rcp 8 5 these implies that the uncertainty caused by rcp scenario does not change future climate warming and precipitation intensifications as the observation based gridded meteorological data is in a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 this study analyzed the results at the same resolution to comply with observations to fully consider the potential uncertainty caused by spatial resolutions we also bilinearly interpolated the trends of annual precipitation and temperature into 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 2 0 grids respectively the associated spatial variations are not significant and the overall increasing results are robust across different spatial resolutions fig s15 despite the large uncertainties induced by multiple sources these did not change our main conclusion that china would suffer from a substantial increasing flood hazards in terms of flood quantiles under future warming here it is challenging to detect and systematically partition different uncertainty components future works could focus on investigating the integrated uncertainty on flood evolution and impact assessments 6 conclusions this study investigated the change of bivariate flood quantiles for 151 catchments over china with climate projected by a set of multi model ensemble under the highest representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 after correcting biases of daily outputs of eight cmip5 gcms four hydrological models were driven and validated for each catchment and the best simulation model was selected to project hydrological scenarios the copula function and most likely realization method are employed for deriving the flood bivariate quantiles between the future and historical periods and the uncertainty envelope is quantified by the areas of 90 confidence envelops with a copula based parametric bootstrapping uncertainty c pbu approach the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 an overall positive trend of temperature and precipitation is projected at the national scale accompanied by substantial gcm uncertainty and spatial variability over most regions in china annual mean temperature would increase at a rate of 0 3 0 6 c per decade and the yangtze river basin has the most severe precipitation increasing rate than other major river basins over china 2 the eight gcms all project a general increasing change of bivariate flood quantiles under different return periods although these are accompanied by large spatial variability in magnitude numerous basins would experience a dramatical increase of both flood peaks and volumes by over 50 while only a few basins are projected to have a decreasing flood risk suggesting an urgent need to increase societal resilience to warming climates 3 most catchments over china show a considerable increase in bivariate flood quantile estimation uncertainty in a warmer climate condition and the area of 90 confidence ellipses even increase by over 50 percent in many catchments over yangtze river basin songhua river basin and liao river basin although the estimation uncertainty increases with ascending return period the relative changes from historical to future period do not change much with increasing return periods credit authorship contribution statement jiabo yin conceptualization data curation writing original draft shenglian guo

5547,riparian buffers are an important conservation practice to mitigate water quality degradation in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw although forested and grassed riparian buffers have been implemented in this region through government programs the impacts of riparian buffers on water quality have been rarely examined the objective of this study was to assess the long term effects of riparian buffers to improve water quality in the coastal plain of the cbw a watershed model soil and water assessment tool swat was employed for this study considering impacts of model uncertainty i e equifinality on the effectiveness of riparian buffers we adopted all parameter sets that produced acceptable simulation results multiple riparian buffer implementation scenarios were developed to generate the baseline condition on total organic nitrogen ton loads without riparian buffers and examine variation of ton loads with areal coverage of riparian buffers through the calibration processes a total of 235 acceptable parameter sets were identified and used to simulate ton loads the simulation results indicated that riparian buffers significantly reduce ton loads without riparian buffers annual ton loads from the 220 km2 study watershed were 18 to 34 metric tons but declined to 8 to 21 metric tons with riparian buffers the effectiveness of riparian buffers on reducing annual ton loads increased from 17 to 45 with an increase in the extent of riparian buffer implementation the effectiveness of riparian buffers tended to be higher during early spring than other seasons as high soil water conditions promote occurrence of surface water flow and thus ton loads riparian buffers were more efficient on croplands than other land use types due to high soil nutrient levels caused by fertilizer applications the effectiveness of riparian buffers differed considerably by parameter set thus efforts to consider model uncertainty are important to provide better insight into the impacts of conservation practices this study supports ongoing riparian buffer programs for the mid atlantic coastal plain by demonstrating the effectiveness of riparian buffers and informing implementation guidelines keywords riparian buffers water quality watershed model model uncertainty 1 introduction the chesapeake bay cb is an important natural asset as the most productive estuary in the united states us cec 2000 as well as a ramsar wetland site of international importance gardner and davidson 2011 the chesapeake bay watershed cbw with an area of 166 000 km2 includes the portions of seven jurisdictions delaware maryland new york pennsylvania west virginia virginia and the district of columbia overall environmental conditions in the bay have been degraded mainly by non point source nps pollutants mccarty et al 2008 excessive nps pollutant loads to the bay cause several environmental problems such as eutrophication and hypoxic zones jeopardizing living organisms in the bay nrc 2011 furthermore the high density of surface waters further exacerbates the vulnerability of this region to human activities kemp et al 2005 among various nps sources agricultural lands are known to be key nitrogen n sources collaborative efforts to curb nutrient loads have been made in this region the chesapeake bay agreement between the cbw jurisdictions was initiated in 1983 and has been reconfirmed multiple times over recent decades to emphasize the protection of the bay cbp 2014 the cb total maximum daily load was established to forcefully restrict permitted amounts of nutrient loads to the bay usepa 2010 to meet these protection regulations agricultural conservation practices have been recommended throughout the cbw mccarty et al 2008 simultaneously the question of whether these conservation practices are effective at mitigating water quality degradation has arisen in order to efficiently achieve management goals santhi et al 2006 duriancik et al 2008 a watershed modeling approach has been widely used since it can evaluate the effectiveness of conservation practices with fewer limitations on spatial and temporal conditions her et al 2017 jeon et al 2018 qi et al 2018 field monitoring is costly thus modeling approaches have received substantial attention to examine conservation practice effectiveness shirmohammadi et al 2006 winter cover crops wetland restoration and riparian buffers are popular conservation practices on the coastal plain of the cbw where agricultural land use is common mccarty et al 2008 ator and denver 2012 winter cover crops have been widely adopted because of their soil nutrient uptake efficiency hively et al 2009 wetlands are effective at trapping and removing nutrients denver et al 2014 and riparian buffers are also efficient at reducing nutrient loads lowrance et al 1997 a modeling approach has successfully demonstrated that winter cover crops are an effective management tool to reduce

buffers on mitigating water quality degradation soil and water assessment tool swat model has been commonly used to assess the effectiveness of filter strip several studies simulated swat to explore

annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps momm et al 2014 agricultural policy environmental extender apex and the riparian ecosystem management model remm models williams et al 2013 although riparian buffers are widely explored using hydrologic models there are few attempts focusing on model predictive uncertainty on riparian buffer function taylor et al 2016 pointed out that parameter uncertainty significantly affected the effectiveness of conservation practices including riparian buffers and thus model uncertainty should be considered simultaneously the environmental impacts of conservation practices on water quantity and quality are commonly assessed by comparing the simulated outputs with and without conservation practices hashemi et al 2016 jeon et al 2018 qi et al 2018 in practice a single parameter set that produces the best model performance is identified through calibration this parameter set is then applied in a simulation setting that considers implementation of conservation practice arnold et al 2012 this common modeling approach presents the uncertainty problem of equifinality i e different parameter sets reproduce acceptable model outputs beven 2006 the non uniqueness of hydrologic modeling parameter sets limit production of reliable and credible results for water resource management plans ficklin and barnhart 2014 a robust modeling approach should consider uncertainty to provide better insight on changes in the fate and transport of water and nutrients by implementing conservation practices the objective of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing total organic n ton loads within the coastal plain of the cbw although nitrate no3 is the major n species in this watershed this study focused on ton since riparian buffers are effective at mitigating nutrients transported by surface flow e g ton rather those transported by groundwater e g no3 to take into account model parameter uncertainty all acceptable parameter sets identified during the calibration processes were used for quantifying the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads with the assumption that riparian buffers are absent in the baseline condition the model was calibrated against both observed streamflow and ton loads three buffer implementation scenarios involving status quo loss and gain in buffer areas were prepared see section 2 5 the calibrated models regarding multiple acceptable parameter sets were applied into the three buffer implementation scenarios and then ton loads under the baseline and implementation scenarios were compared specifically we 1 compared multiple riparian buffer implementation scenarios with the baseline condition to demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads in this region 2 investigated how the effectiveness of riparian buffers varied by implementation coverage climatic and land use conditions and 3 explored the impacts of model parameter uncertainty on the effectiveness of riparian buffers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw which is located in

atlantic coastal plain 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based watershed model designed to evaluate the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic changes in agricultural watersheds neitsch et al 2011 in swat a watershed is divided into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus based on the unique combinations of soil land use and slope all variables are simulated at individual hru levels and simulated outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed levels neitsch et al 2011 water balance calculated in each hru comprises precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and groundwater recharge the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method is used in swat to partition surface water into surface runoff and infiltration infiltrated water is removed by evapotranspiration discharged to streams via subsurface flow or percolated into shallow groundwater the fate of water in shallow groundwater varies contribution to streams via groundwater flow movement to the unsaturated zone upward movement and movement to deep groundwater downward movement n cycle is fully represented in swat with two n pools mineral and organic n the addition of n is simulated by fertilizer and manure applications crop residue fixation and deposition the transport of n is driven by water cycling on is often attached to soils and transported to streams by surface runoff the concentration of on is calculated as a function of n in organic pools and soil physical characteristics the version of swat used in this study was swat 2012 rev 635 please refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details swat provides two methods for representing riparian buffer impacts on pollutant reduction the first method is to modify the width of the edge of the filter strip the model assumes that pollutants in surface runoff are attenuated by the installation of filter strips as surface runoff flows through the strips the reduction efficiency is directly proportional to the width of the filter strip the second method referred to as vfs is to set up the vegetation filter strip vfs in the management operations file ops this method locates vfs to trap surface runoff from upslope pollutant sources and filter it this strip reduces the speed of overland flow leading to deposition of pollutants this vfs method only affects pollutant reduction further details about the two methods are available in neitsch et al 2011 this study used only vfs method as this method improves the capacity of swat to simulate the impacts of buffers by reflecting flow concentration neitsch et al 2011 in addition the vfs method is more appropriate compared to filterw regarding swat s semi distributed structure white and arnold 2009 to use vfs three parameters filter ratio the ratio of field area to filter strip area filter con the fraction of the hru which drains to the most concentrated 10 of the filters strip area and filter ch fraction of the flow within the most concentrated 10 of the filter strip should be defined in this study filter ratio filter con and filter ch were set as 40 0 5 and 0 respectively according to the vfs guideline addressed in waidler et al 2011 2 3 input data input data for swat are shown in table 1 daily precipitation and temperature records from 2004 to 2014 were obtained from the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc climate monitoring stations chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed that are not monitored were reproduced using swat s built in weather generator because of the lack of observations neitsch et al 2011 raw digital elevation model dem data from the maryland department of natural resources md dnr were processed in the usda ars hydrology and remote sensing laboratory beltsville to produce a high resolution dem which was used as input to swat

continuous water quality data from grab samples jha et al 2007 2 4 model calibration and validation this study calibrated and validated swat at a monthly time step for 11 years from 2004 to 2014 under the baseline condition i e absence of buffers 2 year warm up 2004 2005 5 year calibration 2006 2010 and 4 year validation 2011 2014 since ton data are only available for a short period from 2006 to 2011 the data were not split into calibration and validation periods and only a 6 year calibration 2006 2011 was performed based on previous swat studies a model parameter set relevant to streamflow and ton was chosen details about the parameter set used in this study are available in table s2 3000 different parameter sets were generated using the latin hypercube sampling method that divides the parameter range into sub ranges and then selects each parameter value within each sub range while allowing for one value for each parameter set van griensven and meixner 2003 three statistical performance measures suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were considered to evaluate model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias equations for these three measures are provided in the supplementary material eq s1 3 an acceptable parameter set was identified when a simulation using the parameter set met acceptable model performance measures suggested by moriasi et al 2007 for both streamflow and ton loads table s3 we further conducted uncertainty analysis using the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu p and r factors singh et al 2014 the 95 ppu was calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of all acceptable simulations gained from calibration procedure the p factor indicates the ratio of observations data that belongs to 95ppu band and the p factor ranges from 0 to 100 as the p factor increases the uncertainty is lowered the r factor ranging from 0 to infinity indicates the average width of the 95ppu bands by the standard deviation of observational data singh et al 2014 2 5 assessing environmental impacts of riparian buffers the usda programs e g crp and crep have promoted the development of riparian buffers along streams mccarty et al 2008 as a result of these efforts riparian buffers have been implemented on the coastal plain of the cbw in order to quantify the environmental impacts of riparian buffers established by the federal programs the first implementation scenario sc 1 was to set up riparian buffers on hrus where riparian buffers were implemented via these programs a privacy protected geospatial dataset on forested conservation practice cp 22 and grassed cp 21 riparian buffers was provided by the usda farm service agency fsa as part of a riparian buffer assessment project usda fsa 2015a b the hrus n 206 superimposed with the riparian buffer map were selected from the hrus indicating croplands forest and pastures n 480 according to the conservation practice guideline waidler et al 2011 note the total number of hrus used was 592 the baseline and first implementation scenarios were first compared to quantify the water quality benefit from riparian buffer implementation programs fig 2 then two additional implementation scenarios with loss or gain of buffers so called loss and gain scenarios were developed the loss scenario sc 2 was set to show the effectiveness of riparian buffers when buffer programs were not maintained the riparian buffers were randomly removed in half of the hrus where buffers were installed by government programs the gain scenario sc 3 was prepared to show the effectiveness of riparian buffers when buffers were implemented on the all croplands forest and pasture within the watershed sc 2 and 3 can show the value and necessity of ongoing programs for implementing riparian buffers the three riparian buffer implementation scenarios are summarized in table 2 although ton loads were calibrated from 2006 to 2011 9 year ton loads 2006 2014 were used to quantify the effectiveness of riparian buffers the ton reduction efficiency of buffer implementation scenarios sc 1 3 was computed as baseline buffer scenario baseline 100 the reduction efficiency was first compared at the annual and monthly time steps using ton loads that were exported from the watershed via the outlet then the reduction efficiency for the 9 year annual average ton that moves from lands to nearby streams was computed for individual hrus to investigate spatial variations in the effectiveness of riparian buffers 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation a total of 235 parameter sets exhibited acceptable performance measures for monthly streamflow and ton loads the ensemble mean of 235 acceptable simulations was plotted with corresponding observations in fig 3 the upper and lower limits of the 95 ppu band were reproduced by 97 5 and 2 5 percentile of 235 simulations respectively the 95 ppu of streamflow quantified most uncertainties as the band included the substantial portion of observational data with the p factor values of 82 to 83 table 3 the simulation results of ton loads showed a smaller p factor 60 indicating greater uncertainty than streamflow in contrast the r factor of ton loads was smaller than r factor for streamflow which indicated a narrower 95 ppu band the ensemble mean of 235 simulations well depicted observational streamflow and ton loads with very good and good performance rates respectively as summarized in table 3 several observed peak ton loads beyond the 95 ppu exist when observed streamflow was large since ton is delivered by water transport fluctuations in ton loads were consistent with streamflow swat tended to underestimate streamflow during heavy rain events in this region likely due to inherent model limitations e g disregarding precipitation duration and intensity kim and lee 2008 and localized precipitation yeo et al 2014 thus ton loads were also underestimated as a result of underestimated streamflow in addition monthly ton loads reproduced from grab samples might contain uncertainty contributing to underestimation of ton loads due to these two factors simulations likely did not capture observed peak ton loads an extreme ton peak was observed in aug 2011 with the greatest daily precipitation 237 5 mm over the period from 2006 to 2011 the transport of ton generally depends on surface runoff therefore a heavy rainfall event would induce substantial surface runoff and consequently high ton loads 3 2 riparian buffer impacts on reducing ton at the watershed scale the 9 year average annual ton loads and reduction efficiencies under the baseline and buffer implementation scenarios were presented in fig 4 ton loads for individual riparian buffer implementation scenarios were simulated using the 235 acceptable parameter sets the results showed that riparian buffers exerted a profound impact on reducing ton loads the amount of ton loads under the baseline conditions were 18 to 34 metric tons mt 25 th and 75th percentiles respectively median value 26 mt while ton loads under sc 1 were 11 to 24 mt median value 17 mt fig 4a these results indicate that riparian buffers installed by federal programs are effective at mitigating ton loads with a reduction of 7 10 mt median value 9 mt in the tcw the corresponding reduction efficiency in sc 1 ranged from 20 to 44 median value 32 fig 4b when riparian buffers were partially eliminated and were implemented on all croplands forest and pasture as indicated by sc 2 and 3 ton loads were 14 to 28 mt median value 21 mt and 8 to 21 mt median value 14 mt respectively the reduction efficiencies of sc 2 and 3 were 10 to 24 median value 17 and 29 to 63 median value 45 respectively relative to sc 1 sc 2 showed decreased efficiency by 20 and sc 3 showed increased efficiencies by 19 this result can support the conclusion that riparian buffers should be properly managed and further implemented in this region to mitigate water quality degradation in addition the range of reduction efficiency of riparian buffers derived from 235 simulations was fairly wide the gap in reduction efficiency between 25 th and 75th percentiles values was 24 sc 1 14 sc 2 and 34 sc 3 the gap further increased to 50 sc 1 28 sc 2 and 68 sc 3 when the efficiency was compared between more extreme lower 2 5 th and higher 97 5 th percentiles values table s4 in addition sc 2 and 3 showed decreased efficiency by 25 and increased efficiency by 21 compared to sc 1 respectively with an increased range 2 5 97 5th percentile values of riparian efficiency results table s4 this is suggestive of the parameter uncertainty in estimating the effectiveness of conservation practices if only a single parameter set is employed reducing errors caused by equifinality better captures physical processes and the impacts of conservation practices on water quantity and quality daggupati et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 thus our results provide a broader perspective on water quality benefits of riparian buffers in this region by taking model uncertainty into account it is instructive to compare our results with previous studies that implemented vfs approach in swat leh et al 2018 reported that buffer reduction efficiency for total n ranged from 1 2 to 4 9 their croplands only accounted for a small portion of the watershed 6 relative to our study site 56 and thus buffer impacts simulated in their study were less substantial than our study in contrast a study by teshager et al 2017 tested vfs on a watershed with 78 croplands and reported an approximately 50 reduction efficiency of riparian buffers for annual nitrate loads a greater efficiency than our study due to that study s greater proportion of croplands regardless of cropland proportions in a watershed riparian buffers are effective at reducing pollutants in particular riparian buffers exhibited increased reduction efficiency on the area with a greater proportion of croplands which indicates that riparian buffers are crucial for areas impaired by excessive agricultural nutrients our study site is listed on an impaired water body due to excessive pollutant loads and agriculture is the single largest pollutant source on the coastal plain of the cbw mccarty et al 2008 riparian buffers would be an effective tool for mitigating water quality degradation in this region when the median values of reduction efficiency for 9 year monthly average ton loads were compared ton loads were reduced by 20 to 37 under sc 1 relative to the baseline fig 5 reduction efficiency was slightly higher for early spring january to march the overall water budget is high during those months due to low et lee et al 2020 which leads to high soil water content and in turn a greater possibility of surface runoff to occur thus the reduction efficiency of riparian buffers was high during those months when ton loads were large the reduction efficiencies for sc 2 and 3 ranged from 13 to 20 and from 37 to 54 respectively similar seasonal patterns to sc 1 were observed with sc 2 exhibiting a 9 to 17 decrease in reduction efficiency and sc 3 exhibiting a 10 to 17 increase in reduction efficiency the monthly analysis provides information about temporal differences in delivery mechanisms of nutrients and thus emphasizes the importance of improving the ability of riparian buffers to mitigate ton loads during the early spring season via harvest of biomass on riparian buffers harvest of biomass e g grasses and trees is an efficient way to restore buffer storage capacity spinelli et al 2006 major summer crops are normally harvested around october in this region lee et al 2016 after harvesting summer crops harvest of biomass in riparian buffers could be employed for enhanced nutrient reduction effectiveness when riparian buffers were implemented on all croplands forest and pasture sc 3 seasonal differences in riparian buffers efficiencies were apparent compared to sc 1 this implied that impacts of riparian buffers on reducing ton loads during early spring seasons would be considerably more effective with increases in riparian buffer areas 3 3 spatial variability of riparian buffer impacts the 9 year annual average ton transported from land to nearby streams was calculated for individual hrus we computed the reduction efficiency of three riparian buffer implementation scenarios using 235 simulations and the median 25th and 75 th percentile values of reduction efficiencies were mapped fig 6 all hrus were categorized according to different levels of reduction efficiency the median values of reduction efficiencies were 0 to 25 sc 1 fig 6a 0 to 14 sc 2 fig 6b and 0 to 27 sc 3 fig 6c the numbers of hrus with the reduction efficiency greater than 20 were 8 sc 1 0 sc 2 and 34 sc 3 the number of hrus with the reduction efficiency less than 5 were 287 sc 1 476 sc 2 and 149 sc 3 depending on the coverage area of buffer implementation a number of hrus with high or low reduction efficiency differed considerably these comparisons illustrated that increased areas with riparian buffers can efficiently aid the achievement of water quality management goals it is instructive to compare the 25th and 75th percentile values for reduction efficiency among the three buffer scenarios the 25th percentile values for reduction efficiencies showed no hrus with the reduction efficiency greater than 20 for three implementation scenarios in contrast sc 1 3 included 34 1 and 150 hrus exceeding 20 reduction efficiency when examining the 75th percentile values this result re confirms the high variability in the reduction efficiency of riparian buffers depending on selection of model parameters stressing that consideration of multiple acceptable parameter sets is essential to quantify the impacts of conservation practices using process based hydrologic models because of model uncertainty i e equifinality several hrus highlighted with dotted circles in fig 6g h i showed notable differences in reduction efficiencies among the three buffer implementation scenarios those hrus were frequently observed on croplands where fertilizer applications increase soil nutrient levels agrochemicals applied to obtain targeted crop yield are generally not fully taken up by crops in this region and residual agrochemicals may leach into groundwater or be transported by surface runoff hively et al 2009 therefore riparian buffers were more effective at nutrient runoff from croplands than from other land uses this spatialized result emphasizes prioritization of riparian buffer installation for croplands with high potential of ton loads 4 conclusions the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads in the coastal plain of the cbw was demonstrated using swat a model simulation with a single parameter set often contains substantial model uncertainty and therefore 235 parameter sets indicating acceptable simulation results were employed in this study results demonstrated that riparian buffers were effective at reducing ton loads with overall reduction efficiency of approximately 45 the reduction efficiency increased with the increasing extent of riparian buffer implementation the reduction efficiency varied both seasonally and spatially for this region reduction efficiency tended to be high during early spring seasons due to an increased possibility of ton loads resulting from high soil water content that promotes the occurrence of surface flow the reduction efficiency was more notable in croplands than other land use types due to high soil nutrient levels from fertilizer applications the effectiveness of riparian buffers differed by up to 30 depending on the selection of acceptable parameter sets which implied great parameter uncertainty in simulations model uncertainty should be quantified through the use of multiple acceptable parameter sets or inclusion of additional calibration data i e soft data when assessing conservation practices the results of this study also point to effective riparian buffer implementation practices for the study site these recommendations include 1 increasing riparian buffer implementation to efficiently achieve water quality management goals 2 harvest of biomass on riparian buffers after summer crop harvesting late fall or early winter seasons to increase nutrient reduction effectiveness of riparian buffers and 3 prioritizing riparian buffers for croplands to target key nutrient sources this

5547,riparian buffers are an important conservation practice to mitigate water quality degradation in the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw although forested and grassed riparian buffers have been implemented in this region through government programs the impacts of riparian buffers on water quality have been rarely examined the objective of this study was to assess the long term effects of riparian buffers to improve water quality in the coastal plain of the cbw a watershed model soil and water assessment tool swat was employed for this study considering impacts of model uncertainty i e equifinality on the effectiveness of riparian buffers we adopted all parameter sets that produced acceptable simulation results multiple riparian buffer implementation scenarios were developed to generate the baseline condition on total organic nitrogen ton loads without riparian buffers and examine variation of ton loads with areal coverage of riparian buffers through the calibration processes a total of 235 acceptable parameter sets were identified and used to simulate ton loads the simulation results indicated that riparian buffers significantly reduce ton loads without riparian buffers annual ton loads from the 220 km2 study watershed were 18 to 34 metric tons but declined to 8 to 21 metric tons with riparian buffers the effectiveness of riparian buffers on reducing annual ton loads increased from 17 to 45 with an increase in the extent of riparian buffer implementation the effectiveness of riparian buffers tended to be higher during early spring than other seasons as high soil water conditions promote occurrence of surface water flow and thus ton loads riparian buffers were more efficient on croplands than other land use types due to high soil nutrient levels caused by fertilizer applications the effectiveness of riparian buffers differed considerably by parameter set thus efforts to consider model uncertainty are important to provide better insight into the impacts of conservation practices this study supports ongoing riparian buffer programs for the mid atlantic coastal plain by demonstrating the effectiveness of riparian buffers and informing implementation guidelines keywords riparian buffers water quality watershed model model uncertainty 1 introduction the chesapeake bay cb is an important natural asset as the most productive estuary in the united states us cec 2000 as well as a ramsar wetland site of international importance gardner and davidson 2011 the chesapeake bay watershed cbw with an area of 166 000 km2 includes the portions of seven jurisdictions delaware maryland new york pennsylvania west virginia virginia and the district of columbia overall environmental conditions in the bay have been degraded mainly by non point source nps pollutants mccarty et al 2008 excessive nps pollutant loads to the bay cause several environmental problems such as eutrophication and hypoxic zones jeopardizing living organisms in the bay nrc 2011 furthermore the high density of surface waters further exacerbates the vulnerability of this region to human activities kemp et al 2005 among various nps sources agricultural lands are known to be key nitrogen n sources collaborative efforts to curb nutrient loads have been made in this region the chesapeake bay agreement between the cbw jurisdictions was initiated in 1983 and has been reconfirmed multiple times over recent decades to emphasize the protection of the bay cbp 2014 the cb total maximum daily load was established to forcefully restrict permitted amounts of nutrient loads to the bay usepa 2010 to meet these protection regulations agricultural conservation practices have been recommended throughout the cbw mccarty et al 2008 simultaneously the question of whether these conservation practices are effective at mitigating water quality degradation has arisen in order to efficiently achieve management goals santhi et al 2006 duriancik et al 2008 a watershed modeling approach has been widely used since it can evaluate the effectiveness of conservation practices with fewer limitations on spatial and temporal conditions her et al 2017 jeon et al 2018 qi et al 2018 field monitoring is costly thus modeling approaches have received substantial attention to examine conservation practice effectiveness shirmohammadi et al 2006 winter cover crops wetland restoration and riparian buffers are popular conservation practices on the coastal plain of the cbw where agricultural land use is common mccarty et al 2008 ator and denver 2012 winter cover crops have been widely adopted because of their soil nutrient uptake efficiency hively et al 2009 wetlands are effective at trapping and removing nutrients denver et al 2014 and riparian buffers are also efficient at reducing nutrient loads lowrance et al 1997 a modeling approach has successfully demonstrated that winter cover crops are an effective management tool to reduce nutrient leaching by 90 at the watershed scale yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2016 and their nutrient reduction functions become increasingly important under regional warming due to climate change lee et al 2017a the impacts of wetlands on controlling water quality and quantity have been widely examined at multiple scales using a modeling approach lee et al 2018a 2019 sharifi et al 2019 yeo et al 2019 recent efforts continue to improve modeling approaches to accurately represent wetland impacts evenson et al 2018 qi et al 2019 the necessity of riparian buffers has been emphasized but efforts to quantify their utility have been rarely examined in this region lowrance et al 1997 wallace et al 2018 hydrologic models are widely adopted as a primary tool for substantiating the role of riparian buffers on mitigating water quality degradation soil and water assessment tool swat model has been commonly used to assess the effectiveness of filter strip several studies simulated swat to explore filter strip impacts on pollutant sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus reduction in georgia cho et al 2010 mississippi leh et al 2018 and oklahoma moriasi et al 2011 within the united states and china shi et al 2017 in addition to swat other hydrologic models have been also used for simulating riparian buffer impacts including hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf liu and tong 2011 annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps momm et al 2014 agricultural policy environmental extender apex and the riparian ecosystem management model remm models williams et al 2013 although riparian buffers are widely explored using hydrologic models there are few attempts focusing on model predictive uncertainty on riparian buffer function taylor et al 2016 pointed out that parameter uncertainty significantly affected the effectiveness of conservation practices including riparian buffers and thus model uncertainty should be considered simultaneously the environmental impacts of conservation practices on water quantity and quality are commonly assessed by comparing the simulated outputs with and without conservation practices hashemi et al 2016 jeon et al 2018 qi et al 2018 in practice a single parameter set that produces the best model performance is identified through calibration this parameter set is then applied in a simulation setting that considers implementation of conservation practice arnold et al 2012 this common modeling approach presents the uncertainty problem of equifinality i e different parameter sets reproduce acceptable model outputs beven 2006 the non uniqueness of hydrologic modeling parameter sets limit production of reliable and credible results for water resource management plans ficklin and barnhart 2014 a robust modeling approach should consider uncertainty to provide better insight on changes in the fate and transport of water and nutrients by implementing conservation practices the objective of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing total organic n ton loads within the coastal plain of the cbw although nitrate no3 is the major n species in this watershed this study focused on ton since riparian buffers are effective at mitigating nutrients transported by surface flow e g ton rather those transported by groundwater e g no3 to take into account model parameter uncertainty all acceptable parameter sets identified during the calibration processes were used for quantifying the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads with the assumption that riparian buffers are absent in the baseline condition the model was calibrated against both observed streamflow and ton loads three buffer implementation scenarios involving status quo loss and gain in buffer areas were prepared see section 2 5 the calibrated models regarding multiple acceptable parameter sets were applied into the three buffer implementation scenarios and then ton loads under the baseline and implementation scenarios were compared specifically we 1 compared multiple riparian buffer implementation scenarios with the baseline condition to demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads in this region 2 investigated how the effectiveness of riparian buffers varied by implementation coverage climatic and land use conditions and 3 explored the impacts of model parameter uncertainty on the effectiveness of riparian buffers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw which is located in the upper region of the choptank river watershed within the coastal plain of the cbw the tcw has a drainage area of approximately 220 km2 and drains to the usgs 01491500 gage station fig 1 a near ruthsburg maryland the choptank river watershed has been identified as an impaired water by the us environmental protection agency usepa due to excessive exports of nutrients sediments and bacteria mccarty et al 2008 croplands account for 54 of the tcw with the remainder of the tcw covered by forest 32 8 pasture 8 4 urban land 4 2 and water bodies 0 6 fig 1b in the tcw soils are evenly occupied by both well hydrologic soil group a and b 56 and poorly hydrologic soil group c and d 44 drained soils fig 1c riparian buffers are a crucial element for improving water quality in the cbw lowrance et al 1997 furthermore various usda programs e g the conservation reserve program crp and the conservation reserve enhancement program crep have been supportive for implementing forested and grassed buffers along streams relative to these restoration efforts few studies have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of riparian buffers for mitigating water quality degradation in the mid atlantic coastal plain 2 2 soil and water assessment tool swat is a process based watershed model designed to evaluate the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic changes in agricultural watersheds neitsch et al 2011 in swat a watershed is divided into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus based on the unique combinations of soil land use and slope all variables are simulated at individual hru levels and simulated outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed levels neitsch et al 2011 water balance calculated in each hru comprises precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and groundwater recharge the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method is used in swat to partition surface water into surface runoff and infiltration infiltrated water is removed by evapotranspiration discharged to streams via subsurface flow or percolated into shallow groundwater the fate of water in shallow groundwater varies contribution to streams via groundwater flow movement to the unsaturated zone upward movement and movement to deep groundwater downward movement n cycle is fully represented in swat with two n pools mineral and organic n the addition of n is simulated by fertilizer and manure applications crop residue fixation and deposition the transport of n is driven by water cycling on is often attached to soils and transported to streams by surface runoff the concentration of on is calculated as a function of n in organic pools and soil physical characteristics the version of swat used in this study was swat 2012 rev 635 please refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details swat provides two methods for representing riparian buffer impacts on pollutant reduction the first method is to modify the width of the edge of the filter strip the model assumes that pollutants in surface runoff are attenuated by the installation of filter strips as surface runoff flows through the strips the reduction efficiency is directly proportional to the width of the filter strip the second method referred to as vfs is to set up the vegetation filter strip vfs in the management operations file ops this method locates vfs to trap surface runoff from upslope pollutant sources and filter it this strip reduces the speed of overland flow leading to deposition of pollutants this vfs method only affects pollutant reduction further details about the two methods are available in neitsch et al 2011 this study used only vfs method as this method improves the capacity of swat to simulate the impacts of buffers by reflecting flow concentration neitsch et al 2011 in addition the vfs method is more appropriate compared to filterw regarding swat s semi distributed structure white and arnold 2009 to use vfs three parameters filter ratio the ratio of field area to filter strip area filter con the fraction of the hru which drains to the most concentrated 10 of the filters strip area and filter ch fraction of the flow within the most concentrated 10 of the filter strip should be defined in this study filter ratio filter con and filter ch were set as 40 0 5 and 0 respectively according to the vfs guideline addressed in waidler et al 2011 2 3 input data input data for swat are shown in table 1 daily precipitation and temperature records from 2004 to 2014 were obtained from the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa national climate data center ncdc climate monitoring stations chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed that are not monitored were reproduced using swat s built in weather generator because of the lack of observations neitsch et al 2011 raw digital elevation model dem data from the maryland department of natural resources md dnr were processed in the usda ars hydrology and remote sensing laboratory beltsville to produce a high resolution dem which was used as input to swat soil data were provided by soil survey geographical database ssurgo this study adopted the land use map created by lee et al 2016 that contains detailed agricultural practices in this region table s1 monthly streamflow was monitored at the watershed outlet usgs 01491500 ton grab samples collected at the watershed outlet were available from the chesapeake bay program cbp tuk 0181 http data chesapeakebay net waterquality the ton data were converted to monthly continuous data using the usgs load estimator loadest program runkel et al 2004 this program has been employed to reproduce continuous water quality data from grab samples jha et al 2007 2 4 model calibration and validation this study calibrated and validated swat at a monthly time step for 11 years from 2004 to 2014 under the baseline condition i e absence of buffers 2 year warm up 2004 2005 5 year calibration 2006 2010 and 4 year validation 2011 2014 since ton data are only available for a short period from 2006 to 2011 the data were not split into calibration and validation periods and only a 6 year calibration 2006 2011 was performed based on previous swat studies a model parameter set relevant to streamflow and ton was chosen details about the parameter set used in this study are available in table s2 3000 different parameter sets were generated using the latin hypercube sampling method that divides the parameter range into sub ranges and then selects each parameter value within each sub range while allowing for one value for each parameter set van griensven and meixner 2003 three statistical performance measures suggested by moriasi et al 2007 were considered to evaluate model performance nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias equations for these three measures are provided in the supplementary material eq s1 3 an acceptable parameter set was identified when a simulation using the parameter set met acceptable model performance measures suggested by moriasi et al 2007 for both streamflow and ton loads table s3 we further conducted uncertainty analysis using the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu p and r factors singh et al 2014 the 95 ppu was calculated at the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles of all acceptable simulations gained from calibration procedure the p factor indicates the ratio of observations data that belongs to 95ppu band and the p factor ranges from 0 to 100 as the p factor increases the uncertainty is lowered the r factor ranging from 0 to infinity indicates the average width of the 95ppu bands by the standard deviation of observational data singh et al 2014 2 5 assessing environmental impacts of riparian buffers the usda programs e g crp and crep have promoted the development of riparian buffers along streams mccarty et al 2008 as a result of these efforts riparian buffers have been implemented on the coastal plain of the cbw in order to quantify the environmental impacts of riparian buffers established by the federal programs the first implementation scenario sc 1 was to set up riparian buffers on hrus where riparian buffers were implemented via these programs a privacy protected geospatial dataset on forested conservation practice cp 22 and grassed cp 21 riparian buffers was provided by the usda farm service agency fsa as part of a riparian buffer assessment project usda fsa 2015a b the hrus n 206 superimposed with the riparian buffer map were selected from the hrus indicating croplands forest and pastures n 480 according to the conservation practice guideline waidler et al 2011 note the total number of hrus used was 592 the baseline and first implementation scenarios were first compared to quantify the water quality benefit from riparian buffer implementation programs fig 2 then two additional implementation scenarios with loss or gain of buffers so called loss and gain scenarios were developed the loss scenario sc 2 was set to show the effectiveness of riparian buffers when buffer programs were not maintained the riparian buffers were randomly removed in half of the hrus where buffers were installed by government programs the gain scenario sc 3 was prepared to show the effectiveness of riparian buffers when buffers were implemented on the all croplands forest and pasture within the watershed sc 2 and 3 can show the value and necessity of ongoing programs for implementing riparian buffers the three riparian buffer implementation scenarios are summarized in table 2 although ton loads were calibrated from 2006 to 2011 9 year ton loads 2006 2014 were used to quantify the effectiveness of riparian buffers the ton reduction efficiency of buffer implementation scenarios sc 1 3 was computed as baseline buffer scenario baseline 100 the reduction efficiency was first compared at the annual and monthly time steps using ton loads that were exported from the watershed via the outlet then the reduction efficiency for the 9 year annual average ton that moves from lands to nearby streams was computed for individual hrus to investigate spatial variations in the effectiveness of riparian buffers 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation a total of 235 parameter sets exhibited acceptable performance measures for monthly streamflow and ton loads the ensemble mean of 235 acceptable simulations was plotted with corresponding observations in fig 3 the upper and lower limits of the 95 ppu band were reproduced by 97 5 and 2 5 percentile of 235 simulations respectively the 95 ppu of streamflow quantified most uncertainties as the band included the substantial portion of observational data with the p factor values of 82 to 83 table 3 the simulation results of ton loads showed a smaller p factor 60 indicating greater uncertainty than streamflow in contrast the r factor of ton loads was smaller than r factor for streamflow which indicated a narrower 95 ppu band the ensemble mean of 235 simulations well depicted observational streamflow and ton loads with very good and good performance rates respectively as summarized in table 3 several observed peak ton loads beyond the 95 ppu exist when observed streamflow was large since ton is delivered by water transport fluctuations in ton loads were consistent with streamflow swat tended to underestimate streamflow during heavy rain events in this region likely due to inherent model limitations e g disregarding precipitation duration and intensity kim and lee 2008 and localized precipitation yeo et al 2014 thus ton loads were also underestimated as a result of underestimated streamflow in addition monthly ton loads reproduced from grab samples might contain uncertainty contributing to underestimation of ton loads due to these two factors simulations likely did not capture observed peak ton loads an extreme ton peak was observed in aug 2011 with the greatest daily precipitation 237 5 mm over the period from 2006 to 2011 the transport of ton generally depends on surface runoff therefore a heavy rainfall event would induce substantial surface runoff and consequently high ton loads 3 2 riparian buffer impacts on reducing ton at the watershed scale the 9 year average annual ton loads and reduction efficiencies under the baseline and buffer implementation scenarios were presented in fig 4 ton loads for individual riparian buffer implementation scenarios were simulated using the 235 acceptable parameter sets the results showed that riparian buffers exerted a profound impact on reducing ton loads the amount of ton loads under the baseline conditions were 18 to 34 metric tons mt 25 th and 75th percentiles respectively median value 26 mt while ton loads under sc 1 were 11 to 24 mt median value 17 mt fig 4a these results indicate that riparian buffers installed by federal programs are effective at mitigating ton loads with a reduction of 7 10 mt median value 9 mt in the tcw the corresponding reduction efficiency in sc 1 ranged from 20 to 44 median value 32 fig 4b when riparian buffers were partially eliminated and were implemented on all croplands forest and pasture as indicated by sc 2 and 3 ton loads were 14 to 28 mt median value 21 mt and 8 to 21 mt median value 14 mt respectively the reduction efficiencies of sc 2 and 3 were 10 to 24 median value 17 and 29 to 63 median value 45 respectively relative to sc 1 sc 2 showed decreased efficiency by 20 and sc 3 showed increased efficiencies by 19 this result can support the conclusion that riparian buffers should be properly managed and further implemented in this region to mitigate water quality degradation in addition the range of reduction efficiency of riparian buffers derived from 235 simulations was fairly wide the gap in reduction efficiency between 25 th and 75th percentiles values was 24 sc 1 14 sc 2 and 34 sc 3 the gap further increased to 50 sc 1 28 sc 2 and 68 sc 3 when the efficiency was compared between more extreme lower 2 5 th and higher 97 5 th percentiles values table s4 in addition sc 2 and 3 showed decreased efficiency by 25 and increased efficiency by 21 compared to sc 1 respectively with an increased range 2 5 97 5th percentile values of riparian efficiency results table s4 this is suggestive of the parameter uncertainty in estimating the effectiveness of conservation practices if only a single parameter set is employed reducing errors caused by equifinality better captures physical processes and the impacts of conservation practices on water quantity and quality daggupati et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2017 thus our results provide a broader perspective on water quality benefits of riparian buffers in this region by taking model uncertainty into account it is instructive to compare our results with previous studies that implemented vfs approach in swat leh et al 2018 reported that buffer reduction efficiency for total n ranged from 1 2 to 4 9 their croplands only accounted for a small portion of the watershed 6 relative to our study site 56 and thus buffer impacts simulated in their study were less substantial than our study in contrast a study by teshager et al 2017 tested vfs on a watershed with 78 croplands and reported an approximately 50 reduction efficiency of riparian buffers for annual nitrate loads a greater efficiency than our study due to that study s greater proportion of croplands regardless of cropland proportions in a watershed riparian buffers are effective at reducing pollutants in particular riparian buffers exhibited increased reduction efficiency on the area with a greater proportion of croplands which indicates that riparian buffers are crucial for areas impaired by excessive agricultural nutrients our study site is listed on an impaired water body due to excessive pollutant loads and agriculture is the single largest pollutant source on the coastal plain of the cbw mccarty et al 2008 riparian buffers would be an effective tool for mitigating water quality degradation in this region when the median values of reduction efficiency for 9 year monthly average ton loads were compared ton loads were reduced by 20 to 37 under sc 1 relative to the baseline fig 5 reduction efficiency was slightly higher for early spring january to march the overall water budget is high during those months due to low et lee et al 2020 which leads to high soil water content and in turn a greater possibility of surface runoff to occur thus the reduction efficiency of riparian buffers was high during those months when ton loads were large the reduction efficiencies for sc 2 and 3 ranged from 13 to 20 and from 37 to 54 respectively similar seasonal patterns to sc 1 were observed with sc 2 exhibiting a 9 to 17 decrease in reduction efficiency and sc 3 exhibiting a 10 to 17 increase in reduction efficiency the monthly analysis provides information about temporal differences in delivery mechanisms of nutrients and thus emphasizes the importance of improving the ability of riparian buffers to mitigate ton loads during the early spring season via harvest of biomass on riparian buffers harvest of biomass e g grasses and trees is an efficient way to restore buffer storage capacity spinelli et al 2006 major summer crops are normally harvested around october in this region lee et al 2016 after harvesting summer crops harvest of biomass in riparian buffers could be employed for enhanced nutrient reduction effectiveness when riparian buffers were implemented on all croplands forest and pasture sc 3 seasonal differences in riparian buffers efficiencies were apparent compared to sc 1 this implied that impacts of riparian buffers on reducing ton loads during early spring seasons would be considerably more effective with increases in riparian buffer areas 3 3 spatial variability of riparian buffer impacts the 9 year annual average ton transported from land to nearby streams was calculated for individual hrus we computed the reduction efficiency of three riparian buffer implementation scenarios using 235 simulations and the median 25th and 75 th percentile values of reduction efficiencies were mapped fig 6 all hrus were categorized according to different levels of reduction efficiency the median values of reduction efficiencies were 0 to 25 sc 1 fig 6a 0 to 14 sc 2 fig 6b and 0 to 27 sc 3 fig 6c the numbers of hrus with the reduction efficiency greater than 20 were 8 sc 1 0 sc 2 and 34 sc 3 the number of hrus with the reduction efficiency less than 5 were 287 sc 1 476 sc 2 and 149 sc 3 depending on the coverage area of buffer implementation a number of hrus with high or low reduction efficiency differed considerably these comparisons illustrated that increased areas with riparian buffers can efficiently aid the achievement of water quality management goals it is instructive to compare the 25th and 75th percentile values for reduction efficiency among the three buffer scenarios the 25th percentile values for reduction efficiencies showed no hrus with the reduction efficiency greater than 20 for three implementation scenarios in contrast sc 1 3 included 34 1 and 150 hrus exceeding 20 reduction efficiency when examining the 75th percentile values this result re confirms the high variability in the reduction efficiency of riparian buffers depending on selection of model parameters stressing that consideration of multiple acceptable parameter sets is essential to quantify the impacts of conservation practices using process based hydrologic models because of model uncertainty i e equifinality several hrus highlighted with dotted circles in fig 6g h i showed notable differences in reduction efficiencies among the three buffer implementation scenarios those hrus were frequently observed on croplands where fertilizer applications increase soil nutrient levels agrochemicals applied to obtain targeted crop yield are generally not fully taken up by crops in this region and residual agrochemicals may leach into groundwater or be transported by surface runoff hively et al 2009 therefore riparian buffers were more effective at nutrient runoff from croplands than from other land uses this spatialized result emphasizes prioritization of riparian buffer installation for croplands with high potential of ton loads 4 conclusions the effectiveness of riparian buffers for reducing ton loads in the coastal plain of the cbw was demonstrated using swat a model simulation with a single parameter set often contains substantial model uncertainty and therefore 235 parameter sets indicating acceptable simulation results were employed in this study results demonstrated that riparian buffers were effective at reducing ton loads with overall reduction efficiency of approximately 45 the reduction efficiency increased with the increasing extent of riparian buffer implementation the reduction efficiency varied both seasonally and spatially for this region reduction efficiency tended to be high during early spring seasons due to an increased possibility of ton loads resulting from high soil water content that promotes the occurrence of surface flow the reduction efficiency was more notable in croplands than other land use types due to high soil nutrient levels from fertilizer applications the effectiveness of riparian buffers differed by up to 30 depending on the selection of acceptable parameter sets which implied great parameter uncertainty in simulations model uncertainty should be quantified through the use of multiple acceptable parameter sets or inclusion of additional calibration data i e soft data when assessing conservation practices the results of this study also point to effective riparian buffer implementation practices for the study site these recommendations include 1 increasing riparian buffer implementation to efficiently achieve water quality management goals 2 harvest of biomass on riparian buffers after summer crop harvesting late fall or early winter seasons to increase nutrient reduction effectiveness of riparian buffers and 3 prioritizing riparian buffers for croplands to target key nutrient sources this study provides evidence for environmental benefits associated with riparian buffer programs and the value of their employment on land areas with high ton loading potential declaration of competing

5548,understanding groundwater discharge into poyang lake is important for maintaining the lake s ecological status and water resource management this study applied radium isotopes to estimate groundwater discharge into poyang lake in light of the characteristics of radium isotopes in groundwater and lake water it was found that the activities of radium isotopes in most of groundwater samples were higher than those in lake water and river water samples in the poyang lake area the investigations along a flow profile in poyang lake indicated radium activities in lake water were affected by groundwater input and the groundwater with high activities of radium isotopes predominantly discharged into this lake assuming that the radium activities in poyang lake were mainly dominated by the sources and sinks this study employed the 226ra and 228ra mass balance models to estimate groundwater discharge flux into the lake which was 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d meanwhile in order to avoid the estimated result s errors from the radium activities of groundwater endmember this study proposed a simple but maybe useful method based on the observed correlation between 226ra and 228ra activities in groundwater in the poyang lake area coupling this regression equation with ra isotope mass balance models the groundwater discharge flux could be estimated without using a specific value of radium activity of groundwater endmember the study also found that potentially polluted groundwater from the mountainous areas may have discharged into the lake and posed a threat to its water quality thus future studies may need to focus more on the groundwater discharge from mountainous areas for the protection and management of poyang lake keywords poyang lake radium isotopes lake water groundwater discharge 1 introduction poyang lake located on the lower reaches of the yangtze river is known as the kidney of the yangtze river and plays an important role in water supply and flood control zhang et al 2016a as the largest freshwater lake in china and an important bird sanctuary in the world lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 poyang lake also drew attention to the interaction between groundwater and lake water hu et al 2013 lan et al 2015 li et al 2019 liao et al 2018a this lake is a seasonal lake where lake water may discharge to groundwater in the wet season and groundwater discharge to poyang lake in the dry season lan et al 2015 this close connection between groundwater and lake water provides an access to study groundwater discharge previous studies focused less on groundwater discharge into the lake and demonstrated that river water and rainwater were the dominant input for the water volume and water quality of poyang lake hu et al 2010 liu et al 2016 shao et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however recent research found that some chemical components in poyang lake water were affected by groundwater liao et al 2018a the knowledge of groundwater discharge in this area was limited yet thus the present study employed the practical radium isotopes mass balance model to estimate groundwater discharge into poyang lake the naturally occurring radium which has four isotopes 223ra half life 11 4 days 224ra half life 3 6 days 226ra half life 1600 years and 228ra half life 5 8 years are commonly found in the environment radium isotopes have been widely applied to estimate groundwater discharge depending upon different half life cho et al 2018 kwon et al 2014 moore 1996 2007 2011 tan et al 2018 yi et al 2019 however these radium methods mass balance model and end member model used to quantify groundwater discharge often produced results with a great uncertainty due to the varied radium end member in groundwater plenty of researches applied the average activities of radium isotopes in groundwater as the radium end member for estimation of groundwater discharge but the activities of radium isotopes can be found 2 3 orders of magnitude variations in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 liu et al 2014 increasing amount of researchers emphasized that understanding of radium isotopes characteristics in groundwater is an important first step in the estimation of groundwater discharge using radium methods cerdà domènech et al 2017 cho kim 2016 michael et al 2011 nevertheless the radium isotopes characteristics in groundwater depending on the hydrodynamics of aquifers are often complicated and plenty of field works are often required to determine the radium activities of groundwater endmember what s more for the wetland such as those in poyang lake area it is difficult to arrive there to collect groundwater samples the objectives of this study were to investigate the characteristics of radium isotopes in groundwater and lake water in the poyang lake area and to estimate groundwater discharge into the lake during the dry season this study also attempted to explore the ways to improve the estimation of groundwater discharge flux focusing on the uncertainty resulting from radium activities of groundwater endmember 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions poyang lake 28 24 to 29 46 n 115 49 to 116 46 e connected to the middle reach of the yangtze river is located in the northern border of jiangxi province in southeastern china fig 1 this area is confined to a subtropical wet climate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 1 400 2 400 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 16 19 c liao et al 2018a shvartsev et al 2016 this lake receives water from five main tributary rivers ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river ye et al 2013 ganjiang river lies in the south of poyang lake is the largest river which accounts for 55 of the total discharge into poyang lake shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 all the rivers headwaters are located in the surrounding high mountains in boundaries of the west south and east of the jiangxi province shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 form the east south and west to poyang lake the relief of study area is mountains hills hillocks and plains sun et al 2014 most of strata were exposed in the poyang lake area except for the lower devonian middle jurassic and neogene which were missing liao et al 2018b four aquifers surrounding poyang lake are quaternary unconsolidated aquifer bedrock fissured aquifer karst fissure aquifer and clastic pore fissure aquifers quaternary unconsolidated aquifer and bedrock fissured are the main aquifer in the area and the rest of the two aquifers occurred to a limited extent in the north of poyang lake liao et al 2018a in dry season the lake water level was much lower compared to the wet season as well as the lake area the lowest recorded lake level was 4 06 m above sea level asl at the hukou hydrological station and its corresponding lake area was only 146 km2 during the dry season the highest lake level was 20 75 m asl at the same station and the lake area was about 4500 km2 in the wet season during the study period the poyang lake area was 924 km2 liao et al 2018a rainfall decreased from wet season while evapotranspiration was still strong during the dry season ye et al 2013 in general at dry season groundwater flows following the topography to feed the lake and rivers liao et al 2018a 2 2 field work and analytical methods the field campaign was carried out in the poyang lake area in november 2016 during the dry season a total of 48 samples were collected including 33 samples of lake water 10 groundwater samples and 5 river samples fig 1 lake water samples and river water samples were collected from 0 5 m below the water surface groundwater samples from four aquifers were collected by pumping wells of which depth ranged from 7 to 30 m most groundwater sampling points were in close proximity to the lake fig 1 a portable multi parameter water quality tester eppendorf was used to measure the physicochemical parameters e g temperature ph eh of samples in the field 500 ml water was collected for each sample and then sent to environmental chemistry laboratory in china university of geosciences beijing for major ions and trace ions analysis 25 l groundwater and 50 l surface water river water and lake water were passed through columns containing a 20 g mno2 fiber to extract radium from water moore 2008 to obtain an optimal efficiency these fibers used to test radium isotopes were dried using an air pump to obtain the water fiber ratio of approximately 0 75 moore 2008 224ra 223ra and 228ra was measured with radium delayed coincidence counter radecc via counting four times the first measurement time obtaining primary content of 224ra was carried out within 3 days after sampling 223ra was measured in laboratory within 1 week to 12 days when the 224ra was insignificant because of decay loss the third measurement time was within 3 weeks to 5 weeks to correct for 224ra supported by 228th liu et al 2015 luo et al 2017 moore arnold 1996 and 228ra was measured at the fourth measurement time within 10 months to 1 year the measurement errors of 223ra 224ra 228ra were 5 5 12 7 12 7 respectively samples were sealed in tubes more than 3 weeks to allow 226ra in equilibrium with 222rn which is the daughter isotopes of 226ra then rad7 was used to measure the 226ra activity by 222rn content with error of 12 9 kim et al 2001 luo et al 2017 3 results 3 1 basic chemical components features the salinity varied insignificantly among lake water groundwater and river water table 1 the concentrations of major components in groundwater spanned wide ranges while they were stable in river water and lake water except so4 and cl in lake water fig 2 the no3 concentration is much higher in part of groundwater samples indicating that part of groundwater in poyang lake area may be polluted by anthropogenic activities liao et al 2018b note that the silicon si concentration in groundwater is generally higher than that in lake water fig 2 3 2 radium isotopes in groundwater in the poyang lake area most of the groundwater samples contained higher radium isotopes activities than surface water samples lake water and river water the mean values of 224ra 228ra 223ra and 226ra in groundwater were 63 82 dpm 100l 103 22 dpm 100l 3 96 dpm 100l and 18 27 dpm 100l respectively table 1 224ra and 228ra were major components in groundwater and their activities were higher than 223ra and 226ra activities radium isotopes in groundwater from bedrock fissured aquifer and clastic pore fissure aquifer were noticeably higher than that from karst fissure aquifer and quaternary unconsolidated aquifer fig 3 in the poyang lake area the 224ra and 226ra in groundwater were closely related with 228ra respectively the 226ra and 228ra were in accord with a linear equation of 226ra 228ra 0 10 8 01 with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 excluding maximum value g4 r2 0 77 fig 4 3 3 radium isotopes in lake water the high radium isotopes activities were occurred in the narrow outlet north of poyang lake and the inlet of rahe river especially in the vicinity of l6 4 where radium isotopes activities were significantly high at the east of poyang lake radium isotopes were found in low activity fig 5 radium isotopes activities in water were affected by ph eh and salinity carvalho et al 2014 cho kim 2016 lazar et al 2008 table 1 showed the physicochemical parameters ph eh and salinity in the lake water fluctuated slightly ph varied from 6 76 to 7 69 eh varied from 139 mv to 246 mv salinity varied from 0 05 ppt to 0 15 ppt the present study assumed that the variations of radium isotopes in lake water were dominated by the sources and sinks and the influence of ph was negligible fig 6 shows 223ra varied along a flow profile from l5 1 to l6 1 yangtze river fig 1 which fluctuated sharply in south of poyang lake and gradually increased from l10 to l6 4 if there was no external recharge to this lake theoretically the activity of short lived isotope 223ra in lake water should decline along the flow profile because of decay however it showed an increased trend implying that radium isotopes activities were affected by external water recharge river water groundwater sediment diffusion and anthropogenic activities 223ra from sediment diffusion was small which is not enough to increase the activity of 223ra in the water with large flow hsieh et al 2013 as to the input of anthropogenic activities radium from fishery activities and boating in poyang lake is negligible which was usually produced by nuclear energy application mining coal combustion formation of radioactive waste dumps and production application of phosphate fertilizer mitrovic et al 2016 moreover radium activity in river water was low which was not enough to elevate radium activity in lake water thus these suggested that radium activity in poyang lake was affected by groundwater recharge most of which had a higher radium activity than lake water the groundwater discharging into poyang lake traced by 223ra could also be identified by silicon whose concentration in groundwater is generally higher than that in lake water fig s1 similar to that of 223ra the concentration of silicon in lake water increased steadily in the area from l10 to l6 5 which was in close proximity to the clastic pore fissure aquifer and bedrock fissured aquifer in which groundwater had high silicon concentration liao et al 2018b 4 discussion 4 1 estimating groundwater discharge the radium isotopes mass balance model based on the sources and sinks of radium isotopes in poyang lake was employed to estimate groundwater discharge to this lake for poyang lake the radium sources include river water input j riv rain water input j rai groundwater discharge j gro and sediment input j sed which caused by bioturbation bio irrigation diffusion and sediment physical mixing luo et al 2017 moore et al 2011 while the sinks consist of lake water outflow j out decay loss j dec and particulate adsorption j ads thus then the radium isotopes mass balance model was constructed as follows 1 j riv j sed j rai j gro j out j dec j ads c lak δ s where c lak dpm 100l is the radium isotopes in lake water and δ s m3 d is the change in lake water volume during the study period which was calculated from li et al 2015 this radium isotopes mass balance model was only applied to the long lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra the details of analysis of each item for 226ra and 228ra are in supporting information s1 table 2 presents all the sinks and sources of 226ra and 228ra in lake water the dominant radium isotopes loss was lake water outflow due to a substantial volume of lake water discharging into the yangtze river through a narrow outlet liao et al 2018a table s1 small amount of rainfall occurred in this area during dry period so that the rain water input of radium isotopes was two to four orders less than river input which was insignificant the particulate adsorption loss of 26ra and 228ra were 7 44 108 dpm d and 2 57 109 dpm d estimated by the minimum particulate adsorption rate 0 005 d 1 from lazar et al 2008 according to the mass balance models of 226ra and 228ra the radium isotopes flux through groundwater input respectively were 5 50 109 dpm d and 2 80 1010 dpm d which were close to those through five rivers water input table 2 obviously the groundwater input is a great important source of radium for poyang lake with the obtained groundwater input flux of 226ra and 228ra the following equations can be employed to estimate groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake f gro 2 j gro i r a c gro i r a f gro where c gro i r a are the activities of radium isotopes in groundwater i r a represents 228ra or 226ra previous studies often adopted the average activities of radium in groundwater as c gro i r a luo et al 2017 tan et al 2018 however the significant deviation of radium activities in groundwater such as that of 228ra in groundwater of the present study would lead to large errors of groundwater discharge estimation cerdà domènech et al 2017 michael et al 2011 to fix this issue previous studies emphasized that it should obtain enough groundwater samples based on hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic understanding of aquifers cerdà domènech et al 2017 michael et al 2011 which often requires a lot of investigation work here a method which was based on statistic relationship was present to indirectly avoid the errors of groundwater discharge estimation from the radium activities of groundwater endmember it is known that in the poyang lake area there is a good linear regression equation between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater fig 4 as follows 3 c gro 226 r a 0 10 c gro 228 r a 8 01 thus eq 2 can be solved as 4 f gro j gro 226 r a 0 10 j gro 228 r a 8 01 based on 226ra and 228ra mass balance models and eq 4 the groundwater discharge flux could be estimated without using a specific value of radium activity of groundwater endmember the estimated groundwater discharge flux was 3 37 107 m3 d which was closed to that from previous study estimated by radon and oxygen isotopes mass balance models in this area liao et al 2018a substituting this estimating result of groundwater discharge flux 3 37 107 m3 d into to eq 2 then the 226ra and 228ra activities in groundwater can be calculated which were 16 dpm 100l and 83 dpm 100l respectively the medians for 226ra and 228ra in groundwater were 11 dpm 100l and 27 dpm 100l respectively it also verifies the groundwater with high radium activities were the dominant groundwater discharge into poyang lake meanwhile the average value of 226ra activity in groundwater around poyang lake area which varied non significantly was used to calculated groundwater discharge by 226ra mass balance model the result was 2 79 107 m3 d which is slightly less than the estimated value 3 37 107 m3 d it should be noted that the proposed method in the present study is applicable for the areas where there exist correlations between the activities of different radium isotopes in groundwater such correlations which may be site specific have been observed in some previous studies table 4 suggesting that the method could be an alternative one for groundwater discharge estimation 4 2 uncertainties analysis the most significant source of uncertainties of the method may be a result of two aspects 1 whether 226ra and 228ra in groundwater were in a linear relationship 2 the deviation of slope and intercept of the linear regression equation king et al 1982 analyzed the radium in piedmont and coastal plain groundwater from public water wells throughout south carolina and demonstrated that the relationship between 226ra and 228ra in total groundwater samples numbers 182 were log10 228ra 0 79 log10 226ra 0 00 r 0 83 likewise the logarithmic relationship between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater around poyang lake area can be expressed as log10 228ra 0 34 log10 226ra 0 59 r2 0 43 p 0 01 fig 7 with this logarithmic relationship groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake was recalculated to be 3 04 107 m3 d which is approximately 10 less than that estimated by a linear relationship table 3 the relationship between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater from other studies also showed a great fit linear regression equation table 4 thus the simple method adopted in the present study appears feasible for estimation of groundwater discharge into poyang lake table 3 showed standard errors for the slope and intercept of the linear regression equation with a standard error of slope ranged from 0 09 to 0 11 and constant intercept the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 3 02 3 72 107 m3 d similarly with the constant slope and a standard error of intercept ranged from 6 07 to 9 95 the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 2 71 4 45 107 m3 d however the most situation is the slope and intercept varied simultaneously then the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d with an uncertainty of 11 1 18 3 and the inferred 226ra and 228ra activities endmembers in groundwater of 14 18 dpm 100l and 70 93 dpm 100l respectively 4 3 groundwater discharge into poyang lake for the groundwater in the poyang lake area previous researches have focused more on ganjiang river and fuhe river plain area on the quaternary unconsolidated sediments where are located in cities with industries lan et al 2015 soldatova et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b both the variation of 223ra in lake profile and estimated 226ra and 228ra activities endmembers in groundwater indicated the poyang lake was predominantly recharged by groundwater with high radium isotopes activities in the poyang lake area the high radium isotopes activities occurred in clastic pore fissure aquifers and bedrock fissured aquifer containing granite sandstone and shale which may have high u and th concentrations dinh et al 2011 these two aquifers occurred in the north and east of poyang lake in the mountainous area not the plain area moreover the groundwater flow in mountainous area is faster than in plain area zhan et al 2016 note that the high activities radium isotopes in lake water were in the north and southeast of poyang lake where were in close proximity to clastic pore fissure aquifers and bedrock fissured aquifer thus the groundwater in the mountainous area where household water draining was general unconstrained may be the principal component discharging into poyang lake this conclusion could also be inferred from the variation of silicon concentration in lake water section 3 2 liao et al 2018a found that some chemical components in lake water were affected by groundwater discharge and the present study also showed increasing no3 concentration in the groundwater discharge area from l9 to l8 fig s1 it indicated the potentially polluted groundwater from the mountainous area may discharge into this lake and affect the quality of lake water therefore the future studies may need to focus more on the mountainous area in the north and east of poyang lake to determine the explicit locations of groundwater discharge 5 conclusions this study has estimated groundwater discharge into poyang lake based on the characteristics of radium isotopes in groundwater and lake water most of groundwater samples in the poyang lake area had higher radium isotopes activities than lake water and river water samples and the activity of 224ra and 226ra were closely related to that of 228ra in groundwater respectively the characteristics of radium activities in lake water were determined by radium isotopes sources and sinks in the lake the radium sources in poyang lake included river water input rain water input groundwater input and sediment input while the sinks consisted of lake water outflow decay loss and particulate adsorption the 223ra variation along a flow profile reflected groundwater discharging into poyang lake based on 226ra and 228ra mass balance models and the linear regression equation of 226ra and 228ra the groundwater discharge into poyang lake was estimated to be 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d this study used the relationship between 228ra and 226ra to indirectly avoid the errors of estimated results from radium activities of groundwater endmember this method appears to be more convenient than those used in previous studies which need to acquire the radium activities of groundwater endmember both the variation of 223ra along the lake profile and inferred radium activities in groundwater indicated the groundwater with high radium isotopes activities predominantly discharged into poyang lake the high radium isotopes activities of groundwater which may occur in mountainous areas where groundwater is vulnerable to pollution may discharge into the lake and affect the quality of lake water thus the future studies may need to focus more on the groundwater discharge from mountainous areas in the north and east of poyang lake for the protection and management of poyang lake credit authorship contribution statement fu

activities in groundwater in the poyang lake area coupling this regression equation with ra isotope mass balance models the groundwater discharge flux could be estimated without using a specific value of radium activity of groundwater endmember the study also found that potentially polluted groundwater from the mountainous areas may have discharged into the lake and posed a threat to its water quality thus future studies may need to focus more on the groundwater discharge from mountainous areas for the protection and management of poyang lake keywords poyang lake radium isotopes lake water groundwater discharge 1 introduction poyang lake located on the lower reaches of the yangtze river is known as the kidney of the yangtze river and plays an important role in water supply and flood control zhang et al 2016a as the largest freshwater lake in china and an important bird sanctuary in the world lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 poyang lake also drew attention to the interaction between groundwater and lake water hu et al 2013 lan et al 2015 li et al 2019 liao et al 2018a this lake is a seasonal lake where lake water may discharge to groundwater in the wet season and groundwater discharge to poyang lake in the dry season lan et al 2015 this close connection between groundwater and lake water provides an access to study groundwater discharge previous studies focused less on groundwater discharge into the lake and demonstrated that river water and rainwater were the dominant input for the water volume and water quality of poyang lake hu et al 2010 liu et al 2016 shao et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however recent research found that some chemical components in poyang lake water were affected by groundwater liao et al 2018a the knowledge of groundwater discharge in this area was limited yet thus the present study employed the practical radium isotopes mass balance model to estimate groundwater discharge into poyang lake the naturally occurring radium which has four isotopes 223ra half life 11 4 days 224ra half life 3 6 days 226ra half life 1600 years and 228ra half life 5 8 years are commonly found in the environment radium isotopes have been widely applied to estimate groundwater discharge depending upon different half life cho et al 2018 kwon et al 2014 moore 1996 2007 2011 tan et al 2018 yi et al 2019 however these radium methods mass balance model and end member model used to quantify groundwater discharge often produced results with a great uncertainty due to the varied radium end member in groundwater plenty of researches applied the average activities of radium isotopes in groundwater as the radium end member for estimation of groundwater discharge but the activities of radium isotopes can be found 2 3 orders of magnitude variations in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 liu et al 2014 increasing amount of researchers emphasized that understanding of radium isotopes characteristics in groundwater is an important first step in the estimation of groundwater discharge using radium methods cerdà domènech et al 2017 cho kim 2016 michael et al 2011 nevertheless the radium isotopes characteristics in groundwater depending on the hydrodynamics of aquifers are often complicated and plenty of field works are often required to determine the radium activities of groundwater endmember what s more for the wetland such as those in poyang lake area it is difficult to arrive there to collect groundwater samples the objectives of this study were to investigate the characteristics of radium isotopes in groundwater and lake water in the poyang lake area and to estimate groundwater discharge into the lake during the dry season this study also attempted to explore the ways to improve the estimation of groundwater discharge flux focusing on the uncertainty resulting from radium activities of groundwater endmember 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions poyang lake 28 24 to 29 46 n 115 49 to 116 46 e connected to the middle reach of the yangtze river is located in the northern border of jiangxi province in southeastern china fig 1 this area is confined to a subtropical wet climate zone with a mean annual precipitation of 1 400 2 400 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 16 19 c liao et al 2018a shvartsev et al 2016 this lake receives water from five main tributary rivers ganjiang river fuhe river xinjiang river raohe river and xiushui river ye et al 2013 ganjiang river lies in the south of poyang lake is the largest river which accounts for 55 of the total discharge into poyang lake shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 all the rivers headwaters are located in the surrounding high mountains in boundaries of the west south and east of the jiangxi province shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 form the east south and west to poyang lake the relief of study area is mountains hills hillocks and plains sun et al 2014 most of strata were exposed in the poyang lake area except for the lower devonian middle jurassic and neogene which were missing liao et al 2018b four aquifers surrounding poyang lake are quaternary unconsolidated aquifer bedrock fissured aquifer karst fissure aquifer and clastic pore fissure aquifers quaternary unconsolidated aquifer and bedrock fissured are the main aquifer in the area and the rest of the two aquifers occurred to a limited extent in the north of poyang lake liao et al 2018a in dry season the lake water level was much lower compared to the wet season as well as the lake area the lowest recorded lake level was 4 06 m above sea level asl at the hukou hydrological station and its corresponding lake area was only 146 km2 during the dry season the highest lake level was 20 75 m asl at the same station and the lake area was about 4500 km2 in the wet season during the study period the poyang lake area was 924 km2 liao et al 2018a rainfall decreased from wet season while evapotranspiration was still strong during the dry season ye et al 2013 in general at dry season groundwater flows following the topography to feed the lake and rivers liao et al 2018a 2 2 field work and analytical methods the field campaign was carried out in the poyang lake area in november 2016 during the dry season a total of 48 samples were collected including 33 samples of lake water 10 groundwater samples and 5 river samples fig 1 lake water samples and river water samples were collected from 0 5 m below the water surface groundwater samples from four aquifers were collected by pumping wells of which depth ranged from 7 to 30 m most groundwater sampling points were in close proximity to the lake fig 1 a portable multi parameter water quality tester eppendorf was used to measure the physicochemical parameters e g temperature ph eh of samples in the field 500 ml water was collected for each sample and then sent to environmental chemistry laboratory in china university of geosciences beijing for major ions and trace ions analysis 25 l groundwater and 50 l surface water river water and lake water were passed through columns containing a 20 g mno2 fiber to extract radium from water moore 2008 to obtain an optimal efficiency these fibers used to test radium isotopes were dried using an air pump to obtain the water fiber ratio of approximately 0 75 moore 2008 224ra 223ra and 228ra was measured with radium delayed coincidence counter radecc via counting four times the first measurement time obtaining primary content of 224ra was carried out within 3 days after sampling 223ra was measured in laboratory within 1 week to 12 days when the 224ra was insignificant because of decay loss the third measurement time was within 3 weeks to 5 weeks to correct for 224ra supported by 228th liu et al 2015 luo et al 2017 moore arnold 1996 and 228ra was measured at the fourth measurement time within 10 months to 1 year the measurement errors of 223ra 224ra 228ra were 5 5 12 7 12 7 respectively samples were sealed in tubes more than 3 weeks to allow 226ra in equilibrium with 222rn which is the daughter isotopes of 226ra then rad7 was used to measure the 226ra activity by 222rn content with error of 12 9 kim et al 2001 luo et al 2017 3 results 3 1 basic chemical components features the salinity varied insignificantly among lake water groundwater and river water table 1 the concentrations of major components in groundwater spanned wide ranges while they were stable in river water and lake water except so4 and cl in lake water fig 2 the no3 concentration is much higher in part of groundwater samples indicating that part of groundwater in poyang lake area may be polluted by anthropogenic activities liao et al 2018b note that the silicon si concentration in groundwater is generally higher than that in lake water fig 2 3 2 radium isotopes in groundwater in the poyang lake area most of the groundwater samples contained higher radium isotopes activities than surface water samples lake water and river water the mean values of 224ra 228ra 223ra and 226ra in groundwater were 63 82 dpm 100l 103 22 dpm 100l 3 96 dpm 100l and 18 27 dpm 100l respectively table 1 224ra and 228ra were major components in groundwater and their activities were higher than 223ra and 226ra activities radium isotopes in groundwater from bedrock fissured aquifer and clastic pore fissure aquifer were noticeably higher than that from karst fissure aquifer and quaternary unconsolidated aquifer fig 3 in the poyang lake area the 224ra and 226ra in groundwater were closely related with 228ra respectively the 226ra and 228ra were in accord with a linear equation of 226ra 228ra 0 10 8 01 with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 excluding maximum value g4 r2 0 77 fig 4 3 3 radium isotopes in lake water the high radium isotopes activities were occurred in the narrow outlet north of poyang lake and the inlet of rahe river especially in the vicinity of l6 4 where radium isotopes activities were significantly high at the east of poyang lake radium isotopes were found in low activity fig 5 radium isotopes activities in water were affected by ph eh and salinity carvalho et al 2014 cho kim 2016 lazar et al 2008 table 1 showed the physicochemical parameters ph eh and salinity in the lake water fluctuated slightly ph varied from 6 76 to 7 69 eh varied from 139 mv to 246 mv salinity varied from 0 05 ppt to 0 15 ppt the present study assumed that the variations of radium isotopes in lake water were dominated by the sources and sinks and the influence of ph was negligible fig 6 shows 223ra varied along a flow profile from l5 1 to l6 1 yangtze river fig 1 which fluctuated sharply in south of poyang lake and gradually increased from l10 to l6 4 if there was no external recharge to this lake theoretically the activity of short lived isotope 223ra in lake water should decline along the flow profile because of decay however it showed an increased trend implying that radium isotopes activities were affected by external water recharge river water groundwater sediment diffusion and anthropogenic activities 223ra from sediment diffusion was small which is not enough to increase the activity of 223ra in the water with large flow hsieh et al 2013 as to the input of anthropogenic activities radium from fishery activities and boating in poyang lake is negligible which was usually produced by nuclear energy application mining coal combustion formation of radioactive waste dumps and production application of phosphate fertilizer mitrovic et al 2016 moreover radium activity in river water was low which was not enough to elevate radium activity in lake water thus these suggested that radium activity in poyang lake was affected by groundwater recharge most of which had a higher radium activity than lake water the groundwater discharging into poyang lake traced by 223ra could also be identified by silicon whose concentration in groundwater is generally higher than that in lake water fig s1 similar to that of 223ra the concentration of silicon in lake water increased steadily in the area from l10 to l6 5 which was in close proximity to the clastic pore fissure aquifer and bedrock fissured aquifer in which groundwater had high silicon concentration liao et al 2018b 4 discussion 4 1 estimating groundwater discharge the radium isotopes mass balance model based on the sources and sinks of radium isotopes in poyang lake was employed to estimate groundwater discharge to this lake for poyang lake the radium sources include river water input j riv rain water input j rai groundwater discharge j gro and sediment input j sed which caused by bioturbation bio irrigation diffusion and sediment physical mixing luo et al 2017 moore et al 2011 while the sinks consist of lake water outflow j out decay loss j dec and particulate adsorption j ads thus then the radium isotopes mass balance model was constructed as follows 1 j riv j sed j rai j gro j out j dec j ads c lak δ s where c lak dpm 100l is the radium isotopes in lake water and δ s m3 d is the change in lake water volume during the study period which was calculated from li et al 2015 this radium isotopes mass balance model was only applied to the long lived isotopes 226ra and 228ra the details of analysis of each item for 226ra and 228ra are in supporting information s1 table 2 presents all the sinks and sources of 226ra and 228ra in lake water the dominant radium isotopes loss was lake water outflow due to a substantial volume of lake water discharging into the yangtze river through a narrow outlet liao et al 2018a table s1 small amount of rainfall occurred in this area during dry period so that the rain water input of radium isotopes was two to four orders less than river input which was insignificant the particulate adsorption loss of 26ra and 228ra were 7 44 108 dpm d and 2 57 109 dpm d estimated by the minimum particulate adsorption rate 0 005 d 1 from lazar et al 2008 according to the mass balance models of 226ra and 228ra the radium isotopes flux through groundwater input respectively were 5 50 109 dpm d and 2 80 1010 dpm d which were close to those through five rivers water input table 2 obviously the groundwater input is a great important source of radium for poyang lake with the obtained groundwater input flux of 226ra and 228ra the following equations can be employed to estimate groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake f gro 2 j gro i r a c gro i r a f gro where c gro i r a are the activities of radium isotopes in groundwater i r a represents 228ra or 226ra previous studies often adopted the average activities of radium in groundwater as c gro i r a luo et al 2017 tan et al 2018 however the significant deviation of radium activities in groundwater such as that of 228ra in groundwater of the present study would lead to large errors of groundwater discharge estimation cerdà domènech et al 2017 michael et al 2011 to fix this issue previous studies emphasized that it should obtain enough groundwater samples based on hydrogeologic and hydrodynamic understanding of aquifers cerdà domènech et al 2017 michael et al 2011 which often requires a lot of investigation work here a method which was based on statistic relationship was present to indirectly avoid the errors of groundwater discharge estimation from the radium activities of groundwater endmember it is known that in the poyang lake area there is a good linear regression equation between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater fig 4 as follows 3 c gro 226 r a 0 10 c gro 228 r a 8 01 thus eq 2 can be solved as 4 f gro j gro 226 r a 0 10 j gro 228 r a 8 01 based on 226ra and 228ra mass balance models and eq 4 the groundwater discharge flux could be estimated without using a specific value of radium activity of groundwater endmember the estimated groundwater discharge flux was 3 37 107 m3 d which was closed to that from previous study estimated by radon and oxygen isotopes mass balance models in this area liao et al 2018a substituting this estimating result of groundwater discharge flux 3 37 107 m3 d into to eq 2 then the 226ra and 228ra activities in groundwater can be calculated which were 16 dpm 100l and 83 dpm 100l respectively the medians for 226ra and 228ra in groundwater were 11 dpm 100l and 27 dpm 100l respectively it also verifies the groundwater with high radium activities were the dominant groundwater discharge into poyang lake meanwhile the average value of 226ra activity in groundwater around poyang lake area which varied non significantly was used to calculated groundwater discharge by 226ra mass balance model the result was 2 79 107 m3 d which is slightly less than the estimated value 3 37 107 m3 d it should be noted that the proposed method in the present study is applicable for the areas where there exist correlations between the activities of different radium isotopes in groundwater such correlations which may be site specific have been observed in some previous studies table 4 suggesting that the method could be an alternative one for groundwater discharge estimation 4 2 uncertainties analysis the most significant source of uncertainties of the method may be a result of two aspects 1 whether 226ra and 228ra in groundwater were in a linear relationship 2 the deviation of slope and intercept of the linear regression equation king et al 1982 analyzed the radium in piedmont and coastal plain groundwater from public water wells throughout south carolina and demonstrated that the relationship between 226ra and 228ra in total groundwater samples numbers 182 were log10 228ra 0 79 log10 226ra 0 00 r 0 83 likewise the logarithmic relationship between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater around poyang lake area can be expressed as log10 228ra 0 34 log10 226ra 0 59 r2 0 43 p 0 01 fig 7 with this logarithmic relationship groundwater discharge flux into poyang lake was recalculated to be 3 04 107 m3 d which is approximately 10 less than that estimated by a linear relationship table 3 the relationship between 226ra and 228ra in groundwater from other studies also showed a great fit linear regression equation table 4 thus the simple method adopted in the present study appears feasible for estimation of groundwater discharge into poyang lake table 3 showed standard errors for the slope and intercept of the linear regression equation with a standard error of slope ranged from 0 09 to 0 11 and constant intercept the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 3 02 3 72 107 m3 d similarly with the constant slope and a standard error of intercept ranged from 6 07 to 9 95 the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 2 71 4 45 107 m3 d however the most situation is the slope and intercept varied simultaneously then the corresponding groundwater discharge flux was 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d with an uncertainty of 11 1 18 3 and the inferred 226ra and 228ra activities endmembers in groundwater of 14 18 dpm 100l and 70 93 dpm 100l respectively 4 3 groundwater discharge into poyang lake for the groundwater in the poyang lake area previous researches have focused more on ganjiang river and fuhe river plain area on the quaternary unconsolidated sediments where are located in cities with industries lan et al 2015 soldatova et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b both the variation of 223ra in lake profile and estimated 226ra and 228ra activities endmembers in groundwater indicated the poyang lake was predominantly recharged by groundwater with high radium isotopes activities in the poyang lake area the high radium isotopes activities occurred in clastic pore fissure aquifers and bedrock fissured aquifer containing granite sandstone and shale which may have high u and th concentrations dinh et al 2011 these two aquifers occurred in the north and east of poyang lake in the mountainous area not the plain area moreover the groundwater flow in mountainous area is faster than in plain area zhan et al 2016 note that the high activities radium isotopes in lake water were in the north and southeast of poyang lake where were in close proximity to clastic pore fissure aquifers and bedrock fissured aquifer thus the groundwater in the mountainous area where household water draining was general unconstrained may be the principal component discharging into poyang lake this conclusion could also be inferred from the variation of silicon concentration in lake water section 3 2 liao et al 2018a found that some chemical components in lake water were affected by groundwater discharge and the present study also showed increasing no3 concentration in the groundwater discharge area from l9 to l8 fig s1 it indicated the potentially polluted groundwater from the mountainous area may discharge into this lake and affect the quality of lake water therefore the future studies may need to focus more on the mountainous area in the north and east of poyang lake to determine the explicit locations of groundwater discharge 5 conclusions this study has estimated groundwater discharge into poyang lake based on the characteristics of radium isotopes in groundwater and lake water most of groundwater samples in the poyang lake area had higher radium isotopes activities than lake water and river water samples and the activity of 224ra and 226ra were closely related to that of 228ra in groundwater respectively the characteristics of radium activities in lake water were determined by radium isotopes sources and sinks in the lake the radium sources in poyang lake included river water input rain water input groundwater input and sediment input while the sinks consisted of lake water outflow decay loss and particulate adsorption the 223ra variation along a flow profile reflected groundwater discharging into poyang lake based on 226ra and 228ra mass balance models and the linear regression equation of 226ra and 228ra the groundwater discharge into poyang lake was estimated to be 2 99 3 99 107 m3 d this study used the relationship between 228ra and 226ra to indirectly avoid the errors of estimated results from radium activities of groundwater endmember this method appears to be more convenient than those used in previous studies which need to acquire the radium activities of groundwater endmember both the variation of 223ra along the lake profile and inferred radium activities in groundwater indicated the groundwater with high radium isotopes activities predominantly discharged into poyang lake the high radium isotopes activities of groundwater which may occur in mountainous areas where groundwater is vulnerable to pollution may discharge into the lake and affect the quality of lake water thus the future studies may need to focus more on the groundwater discharge from mountainous areas in the north and east of poyang lake for the protection and management of poyang lake credit authorship contribution statement fu

5549,soil water content swc is determined through water exchanges between surface soil and the atmosphere and changes in swc will influence both energy conversions and water cycles being affected by different climate forcing factors forcings swc is spatially and temporally variable occurring at various intensities and scales we compared scale specific controls on swc in a sub humid and a semiarid climate zone based on a multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd method in conjunction with a multivariate dataset including swc collected separately seven times within five soil layers to a depth of 500 cm and eight measured climate forcing factors i e precipitation temperature normalized differential vegetation index ndvi elevation clay silt sand and soil organic carbon soc we also identified the percent variance of intrinsic mode functions imfs and residuals relative to the original data two to three imfs of swc were further obtained in the two climate zones imfs explained the percent variance of swc 79 3 ndvi 77 3 clay content 76 6 and soc 93 9 to the original data in the sub humid climate zone while residuals from all environmental variables except for soc yielded most of the total variance 55 5 93 2 in the semiarid climate zone correlations between the two climate zones exhibited different imf characteristics scales and different climatic conditions forcings of the two climate zones also played different roles in controlling swc precipitation and temperature controlled large scale swc in both climate zones namely ndvi had an inverse effect on swc between the two climate zones soc had a moderate and large scale effect on swc in the sub humid climate zone and clay content had a comparatively critical effect on swc in the semiarid climate zone scale specific controls of soil properties on swc were depth dependent in the sub humid climate zone while similar characteristics were obtained among the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone the specific scale dependence of swc and relevant forcings were similar regardless of soil water condition dry or wet our results offer insight into relationships between swc and the main forcings of two different regional climate zones and their scale dependent controls keywords deep soil scale dependence climate zone soil water content multivariate empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction soil water content swc is determined through the interaction of eco hydrological processes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere and changes in swc will influence energy conversions and water cycles penna et al 2013 viglizzo et al 2004 wang et al 2018 soil heterogeneity and extrinsic environmental forcing factors henceforth referred to as forcings simultaneously control spatial swc patterns over a range of scales biswas and si 2011 gómez plaza et al 2000 hu et al 2012 hu and si 2013 wang et al 2019 moreover correlations between the spatial distribution of impactful forcings and swc have been shown to differ at different scales which generally means that spatial patterns are correlated to sampling length biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 fu et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 processes that are prominent at one scale may not have a significant impact at other scales cubera and moreno 2007 zeleke and si 2006 therefore the scale of swc variation and associated environmental forcings are crucial in the design and the assessment of hydrological modeling for recognizing the necessary ecosystem management measures and for establishing the surface soil water observation networks biswas et al 2013 bryan 2000 cantón et al 2001 zhu et al 2014 over the past several decades numerous studies have focused on the investigation of spatial variation in soil moisture and dominant controlling forcings at different scales biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 grinsted et al 2004 li et al 2015 penna et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 it has been reported that local environmental forcings such as soil sequences seyfried 1998 soil properties li et al 2015 geomorphic characteristics brocca et al 2007 liu et al 2012 and vegetation structures determine swc at small scales 100 m while meteorological conditions such as precipitation and evaporation control swc at large scales 0 1 1000 km seneviratne et al 2010 in addition other studies provided evidence that show that local environmental forcings could have a greater influence on atmospheric processes in controlling regional swc patterns for example champa and mohanty 2010 found that the fundamental spatial structure of swc accounting for greater than 70 of the overall spatial variance in swc was more strongly correlated to clay and sand content than to precipitation at a regional scale therefore a combination of local properties and different environmental conditions will dictate swc regimes newer statistical methods have been used to explore the spatial patterns of soil physical properties and their associated controlling environmental forcings for example cheng and zeleke 2005 used wavelet coherency methods to identify scale specific environmental forcings that influence hydraulic properties of saturated soil in a hummocky landscape using the empirical orthogonal function eof wang et al 2017 investigated the impact of soil texture on regional swc variation in three regions of the united states of america dong and ochsner 2018 used the cosmic ray neutron rover system to show that soil traits exert a stronger effect than precipitation on mesoscale soil water patterns applying multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd methods hu and si 2013 revealed the scale specific controls on soil water storage and swc in two different study areas and they found that organic carbon was a primary predictor of soil water storage in the saint denis national wildlife area nwa of canada while soil particle composition was the primary factor affecting swc in the laoyemanqu watershed of the chinese loess plateau using such methods helps to extract new information or intrinsic characteristics based on different processes performed on the original data therefore these methods may help when investigating swc dynamics in areas under distinct climatic conditions the memd method which is an extension of univariate emd biswas et al 2013 rehman and mandic 2009 ur rehman and mandic 2011 operates directly within the spatial domain and is based on the variability of the original data combined with hilbert spectral analysis hsa processes that control the overall variability separate similar scales into different intrinsic mode functions imfs through the memd method multivariate data can be allocated into common scales similar oscillatory modes in an n variate imf affirm each common scale for all variants such mode alignment properties help to make use of similar scales from different data sources these obtained common scales demonstrate the true scale of potential processes analysis followed the precept that swc at one scale is mainly controlled by associated environmental forcings from the same scale hu and si 2013 she et al 2013 as a result of the information that memd is able to obtain this method is becoming more commonly used to describe scale specific spatial dependences between environmental forcings and soil water in non stationary and nonlinear systems lee et al 2016 she et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however most previous research has been conducted along relatively small transects and confined to surface soil layers accordingly more research is needed to evaluate the scale specific dependence of soil water in deep soil profiles at large scales although previous research has reported on the relationships between swc and relevant variables using memd at a regional scale zhao et al 2018 scale specific controls on swc within different climate zones have not been previously described we hypothesized that soil profile characteristics and soil water dynamics of different climate zones comprised of various land use types and climatic conditions are more complex thus giving rise to various scale dependent swc patterns moreover no attempt has been made to examine the dynamics of scale specific controls on swc from dry to wet soil conditions using the memd method scale dependent controls on swc under different climate zones are essential in understanding swc patterns and water cycling over large scales accordingly this study aimed to 1 examine the dynamics of scale specific swc controls in different soil profiles to a depth of 500 cm under dry to wet soil conditions using the memd method 2 identify scale dependent controls of swc and associated forcings between two different climate zones and 3 compare the different scale specific controls of forcings the intent of this study is to provide specific insight into the relationship between swc and the main forcings based on the memd method within different climate zones along a transect while the information procured from this study can also be used to help predict and develop swc models at large scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on a regional transect in the chinese loess plateau fig 1 the transect extended into two climate zones 1 sub humid and 2 semiarid based on chinese climate classifications the climate of both zones is considered a typical continental monsoon type however in this study we used meteorological data collected from neighboring weather stations at each site to reclassify these two climate zones which is more representative of the local conditions in the study area to accurately represent near term meteorological conditions we collected weather data from 2005 to 2018 from five neighboring weather stations fig 2 data showed that the mean annual temperature ranged from 10 5 to 12 2 c for the sub humid zone and ranged from 8 4 to 9 9 c for the semiarid zone annual rainfall varied from 494 to 722 mm and from 261 to 511 mm in the sub humid and the semiarid zones respectively fig 2 and table 1 both precipitation and temperature of the two climate zones differed significantly p 0 01 mean annual pan evapotranspiration ranged from 1400 sub humid to 2000 mm semiarid from 2005 to 2018 annual rainfall occurred mostly from june to september 53 91 in both climate zones the soil in the sub humid climate zone contained more clay and the soil in the semiarid climate zone was generally coarser with a greater amount of sand elevation generally increased from the sub humid to the semiarid climate zones table 1 the primary land use types were cropland orchards and forest in the sub humid climate zone and shrubland and natural grassland in the semiarid climate zone detailed information on vegetation species in the two zones can be found in a previous study by zhao et al 2018 2 2 experimental design sampling locations were separated by a distance of 10 km along the transect which extended through and included both climate zones sampling sites were located in flat areas cultivated with apple trees and crops in the sub humid climate zone considering the potential role of micro topography we typically selected sampling points on up slope positions in forested land in the sub humid climate zone and in shrubland and grassland in the semiarid climate zone a gps receiver 5 m precision was used to document the coordinates of each sampling site the dominant vegetation at each location was determined to represent swc characteristics of the relevant vegetation zone overall 20 sampling points were selected in the sub humid climate zone and 22 sampling points were selected in the semiarid climate zone the sampling period of the two climate zones coincided thus memd could be used to compare both sites we installed an aluminum tube at each sampling point to record volumetric swc θ every 10 cm within a 0 100 cm soil profile and every 20 cm within a 100 500 cm soil profile we obtained the volumetric swc θ from each layer by means of the transformation of gravimetric swc with the soil bulk density at each soil layer in a set number of 1 m deep pits calibration curves were conducted for each layer k along with their slow neutron count rates crk versus θk the calibration curve at each depth was obtained from wang et al 2015 1 θ 62 233cr 0 9459 r 2 0 9239 p 0 00 1 we collected swc data in august and november 2015 in march 2016 in april and june 2017 and in april and october 2018 which comprised of seven different measurements in total the sampling time spanned the whole year which included both wet and dry periods the mean swc data derived from each measurement within the five soil layers were reconfigured from small to large values to represent the swc status under dry i and wet conditions vii for both climate zones soil particle composition was identified after filtering through a 1 mm sieve using laser diffraction analysis hu et al 2010 soil organic carbon soc was measured using the walkley black method wang et al 2016 2 3 statistical analysis methods eight relevant forcings assumed to influence swc were used for each swc data series i e precipitation temperature normalized differential vegetation index ndvi elevation clay silt sand content and soc to create a multivariate dataset considering the time lag of the impact of precipitation and temperature on swc we analyzed multi year average precipitation temperature apt and monthly precipitation temperature mpt during the sampling period with swc using the memd method for both climate zones to represent historical and recent climate conditions respectively we used backward variance inflation factor analysis to remove most multi collinearity among the different variables before conducting the memd only precipitation and temperature exhibited collinearity under mpt in the sub humid climate zone and under apt in the semiarid climate zone thus temperature was removed from the multiple dataset when collinearity was found statistical analyses including the calculation of means the ordering of the seven swc data series and pearson correlation analysis were conducted using microsoft excel version 2010 and spss version 16 0 the purpose of the memd method is to decompose the observed spatial series of the data into different imfs according to the hypothesis that at any given position different simple oscillatory modes or frequencies representing different scales of underlying variable processes may superimpose one another the memd algorithm was developed by rehman and mandic 2009 and was carried out in this study using matlab version 2009 the algorithm makes projections using multiple input data sources with various directions in an n dimensional space thereby making it possible to produce multiple n dimensional envelopes and aligning common scales that appear within multivariate data it was assumed that the n dimensions v s v 1 s v 2 s v n s denoted the n spatial datasets to be used as a function of space s and x θ k x 1 k x 2 k x n k represents the direction vector along the direction defined by angles θ k θ 1 k θ 2 k θ n 1 k in a direction set x k 1 2 k k is the total number of directions after which the common scale imfs of the n depth datasets can be obtained by the memd method rehman and mandic 2009 detailed procedures to preform memd analysis can also be found in published literature hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 she et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the hilbert huang transform hht algorithm was used to calculate the specific scales of swc and the eight relevant forcings from the instantaneous frequencies of the imfs the ensemble spatial scale of each imf was calculated by dividing the sampling interval by the mean frequency the percent variance of imfs or residuals to measured dataset variance was regarded as the variance contribution of each imf or residual rilling et al 2007 the scale of all variables of a given imf for all seven measurements in all five soil layers was averaged to the scale of the given imf given that our study was conducted in two climate zones i e a sub humid zone and a semiarid zone memd was conducted in the five soil layers of these two climate zones i e 0 100 cm 100 200 cm 200 300 cm 300 400 cm and 400 500 cm and from dry to wet soil conditions of each layer it should be noted that the swc soil particle composition and soc of all sampling points in all five layers in the vertical profile were the means of the variables at every 100 cm soil depth as the two swc equations show below 2 sw c 1 m 1 10 h 10 100 sw c h 3 sw c 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m 1 5 h 20 100 sw c h where h is the soil layer increment 10 cm for 0 100 cm and 20 cm for 200 500 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic statistics of forcings and swc dynamics table 1 shows that at the sampling scales elevations varied from 510 to 1340 m in the sub humid climate zone and from 1148 to 1567 m in the semiarid climate zone with a gradually increasing trend from the sub humid to semiarid climate zones fig 3 coefficients of variation cv of precipitation temperature and elevation were 13 5 and 27 in the sub humid climate zone respectively and 22 6 and 9 in the semiarid climate zone respectively this means that except for temperature precipitation and elevation exhibited relatively large variation in the two climate zones even though the variation remained weak overall the mean ndvi value in the sub humid climate zone 0 63 was higher than in the semiarid climate zone 0 39 mean values of clay silt and sand content in the sub humid climate zone ranged from 17 3 18 9 75 4 76 1 and 5 3 7 4 in the vertical soil profile respectively and ranged from 11 2 14 2 64 7 68 5 and 17 4 24 1 in the semiarid climate zone respectively the mean cv of soil particle composition for the two climate zones in the vertical soil profiles followed the sequence of silt clay sand table 1 the mean soc was 2 6 5 6 g kg and 1 7 3 3 g kg in the sub humid and semiarid climate zones respectively the comparatively higher soc observed in the sub humid climate zone may be attributed to the thriving vegetation of this zone the cvs of soil particle composition and soc in the semiarid climate zone were larger compared to the sub humid climate zone which indicated that soil properties in the semiarid climate zone were relatively more variable table 2 shows swc dynamics in the two climate zones and the five soil layers for each of the seven sampling periods from smallest to largest the mean swc values of the seven time series for the 0 100 100 200 200 300 300 400 and 400 500 cm soil layers in the sub humid climate zone ranged from 17 6 to 25 4 17 0 19 0 15 9 18 1 17 3 19 0 and 18 4 19 6 respectively while the mean swc values of the corresponding soil layers in the semiarid climate zone were 8 5 16 9 9 6 14 0 10 4 12 6 12 2 14 and 13 3 14 9 respectively the mean swc of the seven data series in the sub humid climate zone decreased from 0 100 cm to 100 200 cm before increasing with increasing soil depth while the mean swc of the semiarid climate zone remained stable namely between 0 and 300 cm before increasing from 400 to 500 cm the maximum mean swc of the five soil layers was observed at 0 100 cm in the sub humid climate zone 19 7 however for the semiarid climate zone the highest swc 14 1 was observed at 400 500 cm this may be attributed to the comparatively higher precipitation and lower evaporation in the sub humid climate zone which resulted in relatively higher surface swc in this zone soil in the semiarid climate zone was coarser with a greater amount of sand accordingly soil water in this zone can easily infiltrate into the deep soil layer table 1 which contributed to the high swc in the 400 500 cm layer the cv decreased with increasing soil depth in both climate zones indicating higher variability in surface swc which is more prone to be influenced by aboveground forcings this is consistent with a previous finding reported by zhao et al 2017 3 2 specific scales of the two climate zones obtained by memd given that the imf patterns were similar in the different soil layers all seven times that swc was measured we only provided one imf result in this study march 2016 in the 0 100 cm soil layer of the sub humid and semiarid climate zones the imfs with lower values corresponded to higher frequency oscillations at smaller scales whereas imfs with higher numerical values corresponded to lower frequency oscillations rehman and mandic 2009 which were caused by finite cycle counts contained within the multivariate data series at large scales the spatial multivariate data series were separated into three imfs using the memd method under both apt and mpt conditions in the sub humid climate zone fig 4 and fig s1 the scales of all variables that corresponded to a specific imf were averaged to the scale of that specific imf i e the mean scale the mean scales of all variables were 32 34 59 62 and 99 113 km in imf1 imf2 and imf3 within the vertical soil profiles under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone respectively table 3 the cv of the scales of the nine variables under the apt condition in the five soil layers ranged from 10 12 13 19 and 14 27 for imf1 imf2 and imf3 in the sub humid climate zone respectively hu and si 2013 obtained similar results showing that the cv of scales for all variables gradually increased as the scale expanded which could be partly attributed to the heisenberg uncertainty principle lewis and mayer 1929 due to the limited number of cycles contained in imfs at larger scales the spectral and wavelet methods both exhibit similar problems stegel 2000 moreover weak or moderate variation cv 30 in scales of all variables from all seven measurements indicated that the calculated scales among the different variables for a given imf were generally assumed to be similar fig 4 and table 3 hu et al 2014 she et al 2013 the mean scales of all variables under the mpt condition exhibited similar characteristics with the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone table s1 three imfs were obtained for the nine variables under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone while different numbers of imfs two three two three and three for the 0 100 cm 100 200 cm 200 300 cm 300 400 cm and 400 500 cm soil layers respectively were obtained for swc and the eight forcings under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone fig 5 and fig s1 the mean scales of the nine variables in the vertical soil profile were 30 33 km for imf1 46 50 km for imf2 and 85 89 km for imf3 under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone differing from the apt condition the mean scales of all variables under the mpt condition were large namely 32 35 km for imf1 65 73 km for imf2 and 121 168 km for imf3 table s1 this could be attributable to a coactive association between temperature and dramatic changes in precipitation and temperature under the mpt condition relative to the stable meteorological environment under the apt condition previous studies have verified the role that monthly precipitation plays in controlling significant soil moisture anomalies wu et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 imf3 had the greatest scale value difference between the apt and mpt conditions which could also be explained by the heisenberg uncertainty principle lewis and mayer 1929 and the limited number of cycles at larger scales hu and si 2013 the considerable scale differences between the apt and mpt conditions in the semiarid climate zone suggested that temperature had a significant effect on the scale value in the semiarid climate zone while this forcing had no discernable effect in the sub humid climate zone the average scales of imf2 and imf3 were distinct between the two climate zones under both the apt and mpt condition indicating that processes that determine swc were under different scales in the two climate zones investigated in the sub humid climate zone we found no significant difference in imf scales for swc and the eight variables between dry i and wet vii conditions except for imf3 scales of soil particle composition under the apt condition fig 5 the imf3 scale for clay content yielded the highest value in the 200 300 cm soil layer the imf3 scale for silt content increased from i to vii and the imf3 scale for sand content decreased from i to vii among the five soil layers clay silt sand and soc exhibited significant variation while precipitation ndvi and elevation exhibited similar variation this implied that soil properties that act as local forcings that in turn impact swc and meteorological conditions were in fact significantly large scale factors that control swc which is in accordance with their spatial patterns fig 3 similarly under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone the imf3 scale for ndvi and soil properties exhibited significant variation between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions moreover ndvi exhibited significant variation in the 0 100 and 100 200 cm soil layers while soil properties exhibited significant variation in the 300 500 cm soil layer which may suggest that vegetation was mainly affected by swc in the shallow soil profile while soil properties influenced swc in the deep soil profile distinct soil property scale characteristics observed in the 300 500 cm layer between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions under both apt and mpt conditions suggested that the processes that control soil properties were depth dependent in the sub humid zone and changed under different soil water conditions in the semiarid climate zone no imf scale variant exhibited a significant difference between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions in the five soil layers under the apt condition fig 5 however for the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone imf2 and imf3 scales exhibited significant variation under dry i and wet vii soil water conditions while exhibiting no apparent trend although significant large scale imf3 variation was found smaller scale imf1 and imf2 variation between the seven swc measurements were very similar implying that processes that control swc that occurred at these scales were similar regardless of time which was consistent with results from she et al 2013 the different scale variation patterns observed in the deep soil layer 300 500 cm between the sub humid and semiarid climate zones implied the existence of different processes in the deep soil layer of both climate zones the length of the transect in both the sub humid and semiarid climate zones was approximately 200 and 250 km respectively the largest mean scales of the nine variables in the five soil layers obtained by imf were 113 and 89 km under the apt condition while they were 122 and 168 km under the mpt condition in the sub humid and semiarid climate zones respectively table 3 which comprised of 36 57 and 61 67 of the transect length of the climate zones respectively however a previous study conducted by zhao et al 2018 demonstrated that the largest mean scale of all variables except in the 0 100 cm soil layer was 135 km along the whole transect 500 km this could have resulted from using memd on the whole transect which may potentially weaken the apparent effects of the influencing factors as determined by the memd method however using memd analysis separately in each climate zone enhanced the influence of the associated factors the largest memd scales determined by hu and si 2013 and she et al 2014 were approximately 67 72 of the their sampling transect lengths results from our study were similar supporting the fact that the memd method was suitable for analysis across both climate zones when compared to smaller transect experiments hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 we found that greater distances will yield less overall imfs this could be attributed to the large sampling intervals that eliminated the possibility of frequency oscillations among different variables given that the scale was equal to the sampling intervals multiply the frequency so the sampling intervals were used to determine the value of scale smaller scales corresponded to higher frequency oscillations indicating that the data completely decomposed hu and si 2013 also pointed out that datasets taken along a sampling transect at regular intervals are necessary for the memd method however more research is needed to explore impacts related to sampling over long distances on memd outputs 3 3 percent variance variation of the two climate zones percent variance data that were explained by imfs and their associated residuals on swc and forcings are shown in table 4 and table s2 under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone imf1 and imf2 explained 79 3 77 3 76 6 and 93 9 of total variance in swc ndvi clay content and soc respectively which showed that localized processes controlled swc ndvi clay content and soc in the sub humid climate zone in addition silt content variance 119 9 was separated by imf1 and residuals showing that silt content regulated processes at small and regional scales residuals of precipitation temperature elevation and sand explained most variance indicating that these four variables forcings had a large scale impact on swc a certain amount of variation was observed in residuals of certain variables which implied that the memd method is not suitable for use at larger scales for variables that are longer than the transect length there was no significant difference in percent variance statistics under mpt and apt conditions table s2 in the sub humid climate zone under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone however imf1 and residuals revealed a large portion of the total variance in swc clay content and soc which could potentially indicate that frequency oscillations for these three variants occurred at different scales residuals of the other variables explained a large portion of the total variance 55 5 93 2 which meant that the other variables which were generally large scale features that influence hydrological processes e g evaporation soil water redistribution runoff generation etc occurred at a long transect scale table 4 under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone the percent variance of swc elevation clay content and soc exhibited homogeneous distribution among the imfs and residuals imf3 and residuals explained 86 2 and 81 7 of total variance in precipitation and temperature respectively most percent variance in ndvi and silt content was only explained by residuals table s2 percent variance characteristics matched the scale patterns of the two climate zones which indicated that the corresponding hydrological processes significantly differed among the different scales of the two climate zones fig 6 and fig s2 show distributions of variance to the original data for each imf and their associated residuals in multivariate datasets for dry i and wet vii soil conditions under the apt and mpt conditions under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone the percent variance of imf1 imf2 and imf3 for swc increased in the 0 100 cm soil layer from i to vii fig 6 the percent variance of imf2 for ndvi increased in the 0 400 cm soil layer from i to vii while it decreased in the 500 cm soil layer the percent of variance of imfs and residuals of soil properties changed in the different soil layers under dry i and wet vii soil conditions for the other variables imfs and their associated residuals did not exhibit any discernable change in percent variance between i and vii under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone the percent variance of imfs and associated residuals for precipitation in the 300 500 cm soil layer exhibited slight fluctuations the percent variance of other variables exhibited similar characteristics to those under the apt condition the different distribution patterns of percent variance for soil properties among the different soil layers in the sub humid zone indicated that the percent variance of soil properties were depth dependent the percent variance of imfs and associated residuals under the apt condition of the nine variables showed similar patterns between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions for the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone however under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone the percent variance of imfs and residuals exhibited significant variation fig s2 the percent variance of imf3 for temperature increased in the 200 500 cm soil layer while the total percent variance of precipitation clay content soc and temperature increased from dry i to wet vii soil water conditions indicating that these factors explained more variance than the original data under wet soil water conditions in the deep soil layers although the percent variance of certain variables exhibited fluctuations between i and vii statistical results from all seven measurements exhibited similar trends under apt and mpt conditions in both climate zones which was also reported by she et al 2013 after segregating the imfs residuals exhibited a range of relative contributions to the overall variance of all variables in the two climate zones this could be attributed to differences in unidentified variations on a very large scale she et al 2017 in contrast to previous studies residuals in our study contained most of the total variance along the whole transect that comprised both the sub humid and semiarid climate zones residuals of ndvi clay content and soc in the sub humid climate zone explained only a small portion of the total variance this suggested that the three variables had mostly decomposed into imfs when the memd method was used on the whole transect compared to the two climate zones individually forcing values weakened zhao et al 2018 therefore our findings further confirmed the results obtained from hu and si 2013 who found that residuals only explained a small portion of total variance they suggested this could have resulted from a relatively small sampling length moreover they pointed out that a longer sampling transect would likely provide a more accurate scale and a deeper understanding of pedogenetic processes at larger scales conversely our study segregated transects by climate zones which resulted in different memd results 3 4 scale specific controls on swc in the two climate zones mean pearson correlation coefficients between swc and the eight forcings for each time series within each imf and associated residual as well as all five soil layers in both climate zones are shown in figs 7 and 8 and in figs s3 s4 a greater number of forcings showed significant correlations to swc as scales increased and the residual of each data series was always significantly correlated to swc p 0 05 in the five soil layers except for certain periods in the sub humid climate zone she et al 2013 found similar results in their study on a small watershed scale soil properties showed that correlations changed with swc among the different soil layers in the sub humid climate zone which is similar with the characteristics of scale patterns and the distribution of percent variance mentioned above however the correlation pattern was stable in each soil layer and under different soil water conditions dry or wet in the semiarid climate zone correlation between the two climate zones showed different imf scale characteristics and apt mpt conditions ndvi was positively correlated to swc in imfs and residuals under both apt and mpt conditions in the semiarid climate zone while ndvi exhibited a negative effect on swc in imf3 and residuals under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone this could be attributed to the water reserving capacity of sparse vegetation in the semiarid climate zone to an increase in soil water compared to the large water consumption by the thriving vegetation in the sub humid climate zone which also indicated that vegetation on a large scale had a negative effect in the sub humid climate zone generally precipitation and temperature were significantly correlated to swc in imf3 and residuals in the two climate zones which indicated that these two forcings had a significant effect on shaping swc at a large scale clay and sand content were always inversely correlated to swc with clay content having a significant positive correlation to all scales in the semiarid climate zone under both apt and mpt conditions on the other hand soil particle composition did not obviously correlate to swc in the sub humid climate zone which meant that soil properties had a stabilizing effect on swc at all scales in the semiarid climate zone moreover soc had a positive influence on swc in the two climate zones which was attributed to the fact that high soc content supports a favorable soil structure allowing more rainfall to infiltrate into and then be retained in soil however soc was only significant for residuals in the semiarid climate zone and in imf2 and imf3 in the sub humid climate zone under the mpt condition which indicated that soc controlled processes under different scales in the two climate zones investigated the correlation between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions was similar in the two climate zones with certain exceptions measured forcings had different effects on controlling swc in the two climate zones ndvi exhibited different and significant correlations under various scales in the two climate zones clay content exhibited stronger effects on swc in the semiarid climate zone than in the sub humid climate zone moreover soc was an important forcing of swc in the sub humid climate zone at moderate and large scales while it was correlated to swc only at a large scale in the semiarid climate zone results from our correlation analysis differed from results on percent variance which was also the case for other studies namely a significant correlation was found under a low percent variance she et al 2017 2014 by comparing results from the two climate zones it can be inferred that hydraulic processes i e the movement of water in soil and the cycling of water between the atmosphere vegetation and soil systems differed between the two climate zones this could be attributed to the interaction among climatic conditions i e precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation topography soil properties vegetation cover aboveground biomass and root distribution in the two climates zones at specific scales by comparing two datasets that derived from different climates one taken from an area in the canadian prairies and the other from a watershed in the chinese loess plateau hu and si 2013 found that there were different contributors in the prediction of soil water storage or swc concluding that the topography soil vegetation and climate of these two areas differed dramatically previous studies have widely applied the memd method to explore variation and controlling forcings on swc and associated hydraulic traits on slopes and at a watershed scale liu et al 2018 she et al 2014 in our study we compared scale specific controls of forcings on swc i e in different soil layers and under different soil regimes between two different climate zones using the memd method providing new insight into the dynamic traits of various decomposed swc scales and their relevant determining forcings information related to the application of the memd method in different climates to investigate independent swc scales and controlling forcings is important in understanding principle procedures that influence soil water movement modeling and the evaluation of regional soil water hydraulic processes 4 conclusions in this study we explored scale specific controls on swc applying eight associated forcings using the memd method in two climate zones two or three imfs for swc and measured forcings were determined in the two climate zones scales of all the variables for the seven measurements of a given imf were generally assumed to be similar imfs of swc ndvi clay content and soc constituted most of the total variance in the sub humid climate zone while the percent variance of all variables to the original data was explained by residuals in the semiarid climate zone moreover measured forcings in the two climate zones played different roles in determining swc ndvi was positively correlated to swc in imfs and residuals in the semiarid climate zone while having a negative effect on swc in imf3 and residuals under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone in addition soc had a significant impact on swc at moderate and large scales in the sub humid climate zone while only having a significant impact in the semiarid climate zone at a large scale clay content had a greater effect on swc in the semiarid climate zone compared to the sub humid climate zone precipitation and temperature controlled swc at large scales in both climate zones scale specific correlations between soil properties and swc changed in the five soil layers in the sub humid climate zone while similar characteristics were observed among the different soil layers in the semiarid climate zone specific scale controls of associated forcings on swc were similar regardless of the soil water condition dry or wet these memd results could help to reveal the inherent correlations between swc and related forcings at different climate scales and thus advance our understanding of dynamic differences in soil water under various water regimes and soil layers credit

5549,soil water content swc is determined through water exchanges between surface soil and the atmosphere and changes in swc will influence both energy conversions and water cycles being affected by different climate forcing factors forcings swc is spatially and temporally variable occurring at various intensities and scales we compared scale specific controls on swc in a sub humid and a semiarid climate zone based on a multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd method in conjunction with a multivariate dataset including swc collected separately seven times within five soil layers to a depth of 500 cm and eight measured climate forcing factors i e precipitation temperature normalized differential vegetation index ndvi elevation clay silt sand and soil organic carbon soc we also identified the percent variance of intrinsic mode functions imfs and residuals relative to the original data two to three imfs of swc were further obtained in the two climate zones imfs explained the percent variance of swc 79 3 ndvi 77 3 clay content 76 6 and soc 93 9 to the original data in the sub humid climate zone while residuals from all environmental variables except for soc yielded most of the total variance 55 5 93 2 in the semiarid climate zone correlations between the two climate zones exhibited different imf characteristics scales and different climatic conditions forcings of the two climate zones also played different roles in controlling swc precipitation and temperature controlled large scale swc in both climate zones namely ndvi had an inverse effect on swc between the two climate zones soc had a moderate and large scale effect on swc in the sub humid climate zone and clay content had a comparatively critical effect on swc in the semiarid climate zone scale specific controls of soil properties on swc were depth dependent in the sub humid climate zone while similar characteristics were obtained among the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone the specific scale dependence of swc and relevant forcings were similar regardless of soil water condition dry or wet our results offer insight into relationships between swc and the main forcings of two different regional climate zones and their scale dependent controls keywords deep soil scale dependence climate zone soil water content multivariate empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction soil water content swc is determined through the interaction of eco hydrological processes between the earth s surface and the atmosphere and changes in swc will influence energy conversions and water cycles penna et al 2013 viglizzo et al 2004 wang et al 2018 soil heterogeneity and extrinsic environmental forcing factors henceforth referred to as forcings simultaneously control spatial swc patterns over a range of scales biswas and si 2011 gómez plaza et al 2000 hu et al 2012 hu and si 2013 wang et al 2019 moreover correlations between the spatial distribution of impactful forcings and swc have been shown to differ at different scales which generally means that spatial patterns are correlated to sampling length biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 fu et al 2000 seneviratne et al 2010 processes that are prominent at one scale may not have a significant impact at other scales cubera and moreno 2007 zeleke and si 2006 therefore the scale of swc variation and associated environmental forcings are crucial in the design and the assessment of hydrological modeling for recognizing the necessary ecosystem management measures and for establishing the surface soil water observation networks biswas et al 2013 bryan 2000 cantón et al 2001 zhu et al 2014 over the past several decades numerous studies have focused on the investigation of spatial variation in soil moisture and dominant controlling forcings at different scales biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 grinsted et al 2004 li et al 2015 penna et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 it has been reported that local environmental forcings such as soil sequences seyfried 1998 soil properties li et al 2015 geomorphic characteristics brocca et al 2007 liu et al 2012 and vegetation structures determine swc at small scales 100 m while meteorological conditions such as precipitation and evaporation control swc at large scales 0 1 1000 km seneviratne et al 2010 in addition other studies provided evidence that show that local environmental forcings could have a greater influence on atmospheric processes in controlling regional swc patterns for example champa and mohanty 2010 found that the fundamental spatial structure of swc accounting for greater than 70 of the overall spatial variance in swc was more strongly correlated to clay and sand content than to precipitation at a regional scale therefore a combination of local properties and different environmental conditions will dictate swc regimes newer statistical methods have been used to explore the spatial patterns of soil physical properties and their associated controlling environmental forcings for example cheng and zeleke 2005 used wavelet coherency methods to identify scale specific environmental forcings that influence hydraulic properties of saturated soil in a hummocky landscape using the empirical orthogonal function eof wang et al 2017 investigated the impact of soil texture on regional swc variation in three regions of the united states of america dong and ochsner 2018 used the cosmic ray neutron rover system to show that soil traits exert a stronger effect than precipitation on mesoscale soil water patterns applying multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd methods hu and si 2013 revealed the scale specific controls on soil water storage and swc in two different study areas and they found that organic carbon was a primary predictor of soil water storage in the saint denis national wildlife area nwa of canada while soil particle composition was the primary factor affecting swc in the laoyemanqu watershed of the chinese loess plateau using such methods helps to extract new information or intrinsic characteristics based on different processes performed on the original data therefore these methods may help when investigating swc dynamics in areas under distinct climatic conditions the memd method which is an extension of univariate emd biswas et al 2013 rehman and mandic 2009 ur rehman and mandic 2011 operates directly within the spatial domain and is based on the variability of the original data combined with hilbert spectral analysis hsa processes that control the overall variability separate similar scales into different intrinsic mode functions imfs through the memd method multivariate data can be allocated into common scales similar oscillatory modes in an n variate imf affirm each common scale for all variants such mode alignment properties help to make use of similar scales from different data sources these obtained common scales demonstrate the true scale of potential processes analysis followed the precept that swc at one scale is mainly controlled by associated environmental forcings from the same scale hu and si 2013 she et al 2013 as a result of the information that memd is able to obtain this method is becoming more commonly used to describe scale specific spatial dependences between environmental forcings and soil water in non stationary and nonlinear systems lee et al 2016 she et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 however most previous research has been conducted along relatively small transects and confined to surface soil layers accordingly more research is needed to evaluate the scale specific dependence of soil water in deep soil profiles at large scales although previous research has reported on the relationships between swc and relevant variables using memd at a regional scale zhao et al 2018 scale specific controls on swc within different climate zones have not been previously described we hypothesized that soil profile characteristics and soil water dynamics of different climate zones comprised of various land use types and climatic conditions are more complex thus giving rise to various scale dependent swc patterns moreover no attempt has been made to examine the dynamics of scale specific controls on swc from dry to wet soil conditions using the memd method scale dependent controls on swc under different climate zones are essential in understanding swc patterns and water cycling over large scales accordingly this study aimed to 1 examine the dynamics of scale specific swc controls in different soil profiles to a depth of 500 cm under dry to wet soil conditions using the memd method 2 identify scale dependent controls of swc and associated forcings between two different climate zones and 3 compare the different scale specific controls of forcings the intent of this study is to provide specific insight into the relationship between swc and the main forcings based on the memd method within different climate zones along a transect while the information procured from this study can also be used to help predict and develop swc models at large scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on a regional transect in the chinese loess plateau fig 1 the transect extended into two climate zones 1 sub humid and 2 semiarid based on chinese climate classifications the climate of both zones is considered a typical continental monsoon type however in this study we used meteorological data collected from neighboring weather stations at each site to reclassify these two climate zones which is more representative of the local conditions in the study area to accurately represent near term meteorological conditions we collected weather data from 2005 to 2018 from five neighboring weather stations fig 2 data showed that the mean annual temperature ranged from 10 5 to 12 2 c for the sub humid zone and ranged from 8 4 to 9 9 c for the semiarid zone annual rainfall varied from 494 to 722 mm and from 261 to 511 mm in the sub humid and the semiarid zones respectively fig 2 and table 1 both precipitation and temperature of the two climate zones differed significantly p 0 01 mean annual pan evapotranspiration ranged from 1400 sub humid to 2000 mm semiarid from 2005 to 2018 annual rainfall occurred mostly from june to september 53 91 in both climate zones the soil in the sub humid climate zone contained more clay and the soil in the semiarid climate zone was generally coarser with a greater amount of sand elevation generally increased from the sub humid to the semiarid climate zones table 1 the primary land use types were cropland orchards and forest in the sub humid climate zone and shrubland and natural grassland in the semiarid climate zone detailed information on vegetation species in the two zones can be found in a previous study by zhao et al 2018 2 2 experimental design sampling locations were separated by a distance of 10 km along the transect which extended through and included both climate zones sampling sites were located in flat areas cultivated with apple trees and crops in the sub humid climate zone considering the potential role of micro topography we typically selected sampling points on up slope positions in forested land in the sub humid climate zone and in shrubland and grassland in the semiarid climate zone a gps receiver 5 m precision was used to document the coordinates of each sampling site the dominant vegetation at each location was determined to represent swc characteristics of the relevant vegetation zone overall 20 sampling points were selected in the sub humid climate zone and 22 sampling points were selected in the semiarid climate zone the sampling period of the two climate zones coincided thus memd could be used to compare both sites we installed an aluminum tube at each sampling point to record volumetric swc θ every 10 cm within a 0 100 cm soil profile and every 20 cm within a 100 500 cm soil profile we obtained the volumetric swc θ from each layer by means of the transformation of gravimetric swc with the soil bulk density at each soil layer in a set number of 1 m deep pits calibration curves were conducted for each layer k along with their slow neutron count rates crk versus θk the calibration curve at each depth was obtained from wang et al 2015 1 θ 62 233cr 0 9459 r 2 0 9239 p 0 00 1 we collected swc data in august and november 2015 in march 2016 in april and june 2017 and in april and october 2018 which comprised of seven different measurements in total the sampling time spanned the whole year which included both wet and dry periods the mean swc data derived from each measurement within the five soil layers were reconfigured from small to large values to represent the swc status under dry i and wet conditions vii for both climate zones soil particle composition was identified after filtering through a 1 mm sieve using laser diffraction analysis hu et al 2010 soil organic carbon soc was measured using the walkley black method wang et al 2016 2 3 statistical analysis methods eight relevant forcings assumed to influence swc were used for each swc data series i e precipitation temperature normalized differential vegetation index ndvi elevation clay silt sand content and soc to create a multivariate dataset considering the time lag of the impact of precipitation and temperature on swc we analyzed multi year average precipitation temperature apt and monthly precipitation temperature mpt during the sampling period with swc using the memd method for both climate zones to represent historical and recent climate conditions respectively we used backward variance inflation factor analysis to remove most multi collinearity among the different variables before conducting the memd only precipitation and temperature exhibited collinearity under mpt in the sub humid climate zone and under apt in the semiarid climate zone thus temperature was removed from the multiple dataset when collinearity was found statistical analyses including the calculation of means the ordering of the seven swc data series and pearson correlation analysis were conducted using microsoft excel version 2010 and spss version 16 0 the purpose of the memd method is to decompose the observed spatial series of the data into different imfs according to the hypothesis that at any given position different simple oscillatory modes or frequencies representing different scales of underlying variable processes may superimpose one another the memd algorithm was developed by rehman and mandic 2009 and was carried out in this study using matlab version 2009 the algorithm makes projections using multiple input data sources with various directions in an n dimensional space thereby making it possible to produce multiple n dimensional envelopes and aligning common scales that appear within multivariate data it was assumed that the n dimensions v s v 1 s v 2 s v n s denoted the n spatial datasets to be used as a function of space s and x θ k x 1 k x 2 k x n k represents the direction vector along the direction defined by angles θ k θ 1 k θ 2 k θ n 1 k in a direction set x k 1 2 k k is the total number of directions after which the common scale imfs of the n depth datasets can be obtained by the memd method rehman and mandic 2009 detailed procedures to preform memd analysis can also be found in published literature hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 she et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the hilbert huang transform hht algorithm was used to calculate the specific scales of swc and the eight relevant forcings from the instantaneous frequencies of the imfs the ensemble spatial scale of each imf was calculated by dividing the sampling interval by the mean frequency the percent variance of imfs or residuals to measured dataset variance was regarded as the variance contribution of each imf or residual rilling et al 2007 the scale of all variables of a given imf for all seven measurements in all five soil layers was averaged to the scale of the given imf given that our study was conducted in two climate zones i e a sub humid zone and a semiarid zone memd was conducted in the five soil layers of these two climate zones i e 0 100 cm 100 200 cm 200 300 cm 300 400 cm and 400 500 cm and from dry to wet soil conditions of each layer it should be noted that the swc soil particle composition and soc of all sampling points in all five layers in the vertical profile were the means of the variables at every 100 cm soil depth as the two swc equations show below 2 sw c 1 m 1 10 h 10 100 sw c h 3 sw c 2 m 3 m 4 m 5 m 1 5 h 20 100 sw c h where h is the soil layer increment 10 cm for 0 100 cm and 20 cm for 200 500 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 basic statistics of forcings and swc dynamics table 1 shows that at the sampling scales elevations varied from 510 to 1340 m in the sub humid climate zone and from 1148 to 1567 m in the semiarid climate zone with a gradually increasing trend from the sub humid to semiarid climate zones fig 3 coefficients of variation cv of precipitation temperature and elevation were 13 5 and 27 in the sub humid climate zone respectively and 22 6 and 9 in the semiarid climate zone respectively this means that except for temperature precipitation and elevation exhibited relatively large variation in the two climate zones even though the variation remained weak overall the mean ndvi value in the sub humid climate zone 0 63 was higher than in the semiarid climate zone 0 39 mean values of clay silt and sand content in the sub humid climate zone ranged from 17 3 18 9 75 4 76 1 and 5 3 7 4 in the vertical soil profile respectively and ranged from 11 2 14 2 64 7 68 5 and 17 4 24 1 in the semiarid climate zone respectively the mean cv of soil particle composition for the two climate zones in the vertical soil profiles followed the sequence of silt clay sand table 1 the mean soc was 2 6 5 6 g kg and 1 7 3 3 g kg in the sub humid and semiarid climate zones respectively the comparatively higher soc observed in the sub humid climate zone may be attributed to the thriving vegetation of this zone the cvs of soil particle composition and soc in the semiarid climate zone were larger compared to the sub humid climate zone which indicated that soil properties in the semiarid climate zone were relatively more variable table 2 shows swc dynamics in the two climate zones and the five soil layers for each of the seven sampling periods from smallest to largest the mean swc values of the seven time series for the 0 100 100 200 200 300 300 400 and 400 500 cm soil layers in the sub humid climate zone ranged from 17 6 to 25 4 17 0 19 0 15 9 18 1 17 3 19 0 and 18 4 19 6 respectively while the mean swc values of the corresponding soil layers in the semiarid climate zone were 8 5 16 9 9 6 14 0 10 4 12 6 12 2 14 and 13 3 14 9 respectively the mean swc of the seven data series in the sub humid climate zone decreased from 0 100 cm to 100 200 cm before increasing with increasing soil depth while the mean swc of the semiarid climate zone remained stable namely between 0 and 300 cm before increasing from 400 to 500 cm the maximum mean swc of the five soil layers was observed at 0 100 cm in the sub humid climate zone 19 7 however for the semiarid climate zone the highest swc 14 1 was observed at 400 500 cm this may be attributed to the comparatively higher precipitation and lower evaporation in the sub humid climate zone which resulted in relatively higher surface swc in this zone soil in the semiarid climate zone was coarser with a greater amount of sand accordingly soil water in this zone can easily infiltrate into the deep soil layer table 1 which contributed to the high swc in the 400 500 cm layer the cv decreased with increasing soil depth in both climate zones indicating higher variability in surface swc which is more prone to be influenced by aboveground forcings this is consistent with a previous finding reported by zhao et al 2017 3 2 specific scales of the two climate zones obtained by memd given that the imf patterns were similar in the different soil layers all seven times that swc was measured we only provided one imf result in this study march 2016 in the 0 100 cm soil layer of the sub humid and semiarid climate zones the imfs with lower values corresponded to higher frequency oscillations at smaller scales whereas imfs with higher numerical values corresponded to lower frequency oscillations rehman and mandic 2009 which were caused by finite cycle counts contained within the multivariate data series at large scales the spatial multivariate data series were separated into three imfs using the memd method under both apt and mpt conditions in the sub humid climate zone fig 4 and fig s1 the scales of all variables that corresponded to a specific imf were averaged to the scale of that specific imf i e the mean scale the mean scales of all variables were 32 34 59 62 and 99 113 km in imf1 imf2 and imf3 within the vertical soil profiles under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone respectively table 3 the cv of the scales of the nine variables under the apt condition in the five soil layers ranged from 10 12 13 19 and 14 27 for imf1 imf2 and imf3 in the sub humid climate zone respectively hu and si 2013 obtained similar results showing that the cv of scales for all variables gradually increased as the scale expanded which could be partly attributed to the heisenberg uncertainty principle lewis and mayer 1929 due to the limited number of cycles contained in imfs at larger scales the spectral and wavelet methods both exhibit similar problems stegel 2000 moreover weak or moderate variation cv 30 in scales of all variables from all seven measurements indicated that the calculated scales among the different variables for a given imf were generally assumed to be similar fig 4 and table 3 hu et al 2014 she et al 2013 the mean scales of all variables under the mpt condition exhibited similar characteristics with the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone table s1 three imfs were obtained for the nine variables under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone while different numbers of imfs two three two three and three for the 0 100 cm 100 200 cm 200 300 cm 300 400 cm and 400 500 cm soil layers respectively were obtained for swc and the eight forcings under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone fig 5 and fig s1 the mean scales of the nine variables in the vertical soil profile were 30 33 km for imf1 46 50 km for imf2 and 85 89 km for imf3 under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone differing from the apt condition the mean scales of all variables under the mpt condition were large namely 32 35 km for imf1 65 73 km for imf2 and 121 168 km for imf3 table s1 this could be attributable to a coactive association between temperature and dramatic changes in precipitation and temperature under the mpt condition relative to the stable meteorological environment under the apt condition previous studies have verified the role that monthly precipitation plays in controlling significant soil moisture anomalies wu et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 imf3 had the greatest scale value difference between the apt and mpt conditions which could also be explained by the heisenberg uncertainty principle lewis and mayer 1929 and the limited number of cycles at larger scales hu and si 2013 the considerable scale differences between the apt and mpt conditions in the semiarid climate zone suggested that temperature had a significant effect on the scale value in the semiarid climate zone while this forcing had no discernable effect in the sub humid climate zone the average scales of imf2 and imf3 were distinct between the two climate zones under both the apt and mpt condition indicating that processes that determine swc were under different scales in the two climate zones investigated in the sub humid climate zone we found no significant difference in imf scales for swc and the eight variables between dry i and wet vii conditions except for imf3 scales of soil particle composition under the apt condition fig 5 the imf3 scale for clay content yielded the highest value in the 200 300 cm soil layer the imf3 scale for silt content increased from i to vii and the imf3 scale for sand content decreased from i to vii among the five soil layers clay silt sand and soc exhibited significant variation while precipitation ndvi and elevation exhibited similar variation this implied that soil properties that act as local forcings that in turn impact swc and meteorological conditions were in fact significantly large scale factors that control swc which is in accordance with their spatial patterns fig 3 similarly under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone the imf3 scale for ndvi and soil properties exhibited significant variation between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions moreover ndvi exhibited significant variation in the 0 100 and 100 200 cm soil layers while soil properties exhibited significant variation in the 300 500 cm soil layer which may suggest that vegetation was mainly affected by swc in the shallow soil profile while soil properties influenced swc in the deep soil profile distinct soil property scale characteristics observed in the 300 500 cm layer between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions under both apt and mpt conditions suggested that the processes that control soil properties were depth dependent in the sub humid zone and changed under different soil water conditions in the semiarid climate zone no imf scale variant exhibited a significant difference between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions in the five soil layers under the apt condition fig 5 however for the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone imf2 and imf3 scales exhibited significant variation under dry i and wet vii soil water conditions while exhibiting no apparent trend although significant large scale imf3 variation was found smaller scale imf1 and imf2 variation between the seven swc measurements were very similar implying that processes that control swc that occurred at these scales were similar regardless of time which was consistent with results from she et al 2013 the different scale variation patterns observed in the deep soil layer 300 500 cm between the sub humid and semiarid climate zones implied the existence of different processes in the deep soil layer of both climate zones the length of the transect in both the sub humid and semiarid climate zones was approximately 200 and 250 km respectively the largest mean scales of the nine variables in the five soil layers obtained by imf were 113 and 89 km under the apt condition while they were 122 and 168 km under the mpt condition in the sub humid and semiarid climate zones respectively table 3 which comprised of 36 57 and 61 67 of the transect length of the climate zones respectively however a previous study conducted by zhao et al 2018 demonstrated that the largest mean scale of all variables except in the 0 100 cm soil layer was 135 km along the whole transect 500 km this could have resulted from using memd on the whole transect which may potentially weaken the apparent effects of the influencing factors as determined by the memd method however using memd analysis separately in each climate zone enhanced the influence of the associated factors the largest memd scales determined by hu and si 2013 and she et al 2014 were approximately 67 72 of the their sampling transect lengths results from our study were similar supporting the fact that the memd method was suitable for analysis across both climate zones when compared to smaller transect experiments hu et al 2014 hu and si 2013 she et al 2014 we found that greater distances will yield less overall imfs this could be attributed to the large sampling intervals that eliminated the possibility of frequency oscillations among different variables given that the scale was equal to the sampling intervals multiply the frequency so the sampling intervals were used to determine the value of scale smaller scales corresponded to higher frequency oscillations indicating that the data completely decomposed hu and si 2013 also pointed out that datasets taken along a sampling transect at regular intervals are necessary for the memd method however more research is needed to explore impacts related to sampling over long distances on memd outputs 3 3 percent variance variation of the two climate zones percent variance data that were explained by imfs and their associated residuals on swc and forcings are shown in table 4 and table s2 under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone imf1 and imf2 explained 79 3 77 3 76 6 and 93 9 of total variance in swc ndvi clay content and soc respectively which showed that localized processes controlled swc ndvi clay content and soc in the sub humid climate zone in addition silt content variance 119 9 was separated by imf1 and residuals showing that silt content regulated processes at small and regional scales residuals of precipitation temperature elevation and sand explained most variance indicating that these four variables forcings had a large scale impact on swc a certain amount of variation was observed in residuals of certain variables which implied that the memd method is not suitable for use at larger scales for variables that are longer than the transect length there was no significant difference in percent variance statistics under mpt and apt conditions table s2 in the sub humid climate zone under the apt condition in the semiarid climate zone however imf1 and residuals revealed a large portion of the total variance in swc clay content and soc which could potentially indicate that frequency oscillations for these three variants occurred at different scales residuals of the other variables explained a large portion of the total variance 55 5 93 2 which meant that the other variables which were generally large scale features that influence hydrological processes e g evaporation soil water redistribution runoff generation etc occurred at a long transect scale table 4 under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone the percent variance of swc elevation clay content and soc exhibited homogeneous distribution among the imfs and residuals imf3 and residuals explained 86 2 and 81 7 of total variance in precipitation and temperature respectively most percent variance in ndvi and silt content was only explained by residuals table s2 percent variance characteristics matched the scale patterns of the two climate zones which indicated that the corresponding hydrological processes significantly differed among the different scales of the two climate zones fig 6 and fig s2 show distributions of variance to the original data for each imf and their associated residuals in multivariate datasets for dry i and wet vii soil conditions under the apt and mpt conditions under the apt condition in the sub humid climate zone the percent variance of imf1 imf2 and imf3 for swc increased in the 0 100 cm soil layer from i to vii fig 6 the percent variance of imf2 for ndvi increased in the 0 400 cm soil layer from i to vii while it decreased in the 500 cm soil layer the percent of variance of imfs and residuals of soil properties changed in the different soil layers under dry i and wet vii soil conditions for the other variables imfs and their associated residuals did not exhibit any discernable change in percent variance between i and vii under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone the percent variance of imfs and associated residuals for precipitation in the 300 500 cm soil layer exhibited slight fluctuations the percent variance of other variables exhibited similar characteristics to those under the apt condition the different distribution patterns of percent variance for soil properties among the different soil layers in the sub humid zone indicated that the percent variance of soil properties were depth dependent the percent variance of imfs and associated residuals under the apt condition of the nine variables showed similar patterns between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions for the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone however under the mpt condition in the semiarid climate zone the percent variance of imfs and residuals exhibited significant variation fig s2 the percent variance of imf3 for temperature increased in the 200 500 cm soil layer while the total percent variance of precipitation clay content soc and temperature increased from dry i to wet vii soil water conditions indicating that these factors explained more variance than the original data under wet soil water conditions in the deep soil layers although the percent variance of certain variables exhibited fluctuations between i and vii statistical results from all seven measurements exhibited similar trends under apt and mpt conditions in both climate zones which was also reported by she et al 2013 after segregating the imfs residuals exhibited a range of relative contributions to the overall variance of all variables in the two climate zones this could be attributed to differences in unidentified variations on a very large scale she et al 2017 in contrast to previous studies residuals in our study contained most of the total variance along the whole transect that comprised both the sub humid and semiarid climate zones residuals of ndvi clay content and soc in the sub humid climate zone explained only a small portion of the total variance this suggested that the three variables had mostly decomposed into imfs when the memd method was used on the whole transect compared to the two climate zones individually forcing values weakened zhao et al 2018 therefore our findings further confirmed the results obtained from hu and si 2013 who found that residuals only explained a small portion of total variance they suggested this could have resulted from a relatively small sampling length moreover they pointed out that a longer sampling transect would likely provide a more accurate scale and a deeper understanding of pedogenetic processes at larger scales conversely our study segregated transects by climate zones which resulted in different memd results 3 4 scale specific controls on swc in the two climate zones mean pearson correlation coefficients between swc and the eight forcings for each time series within each imf and associated residual as well as all five soil layers in both climate zones are shown in figs 7 and 8 and in figs s3 s4 a greater number of forcings showed significant correlations to swc as scales increased and the residual of each data series was always significantly correlated to swc p 0 05 in the five soil layers except for certain periods in the sub humid climate zone she et al 2013 found similar results in their study on a small watershed scale soil properties showed that correlations changed with swc among the different soil layers in the sub humid climate zone which is similar with the characteristics of scale patterns and the distribution of percent variance mentioned above however the correlation pattern was stable in each soil layer and under different soil water conditions dry or wet in the semiarid climate zone correlation between the two climate zones showed different imf scale characteristics and apt mpt conditions ndvi was positively correlated to swc in imfs and residuals under both apt and mpt conditions in the semiarid climate zone while ndvi exhibited a negative effect on swc in imf3 and residuals under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone this could be attributed to the water reserving capacity of sparse vegetation in the semiarid climate zone to an increase in soil water compared to the large water consumption by the thriving vegetation in the sub humid climate zone which also indicated that vegetation on a large scale had a negative effect in the sub humid climate zone generally precipitation and temperature were significantly correlated to swc in imf3 and residuals in the two climate zones which indicated that these two forcings had a significant effect on shaping swc at a large scale clay and sand content were always inversely correlated to swc with clay content having a significant positive correlation to all scales in the semiarid climate zone under both apt and mpt conditions on the other hand soil particle composition did not obviously correlate to swc in the sub humid climate zone which meant that soil properties had a stabilizing effect on swc at all scales in the semiarid climate zone moreover soc had a positive influence on swc in the two climate zones which was attributed to the fact that high soc content supports a favorable soil structure allowing more rainfall to infiltrate into and then be retained in soil however soc was only significant for residuals in the semiarid climate zone and in imf2 and imf3 in the sub humid climate zone under the mpt condition which indicated that soc controlled processes under different scales in the two climate zones investigated the correlation between dry i and wet vii soil water conditions was similar in the two climate zones with certain exceptions measured forcings had different effects on controlling swc in the two climate zones ndvi exhibited different and significant correlations under various scales in the two climate zones clay content exhibited stronger effects on swc in the semiarid climate zone than in the sub humid climate zone moreover soc was an important forcing of swc in the sub humid climate zone at moderate and large scales while it was correlated to swc only at a large scale in the semiarid climate zone results from our correlation analysis differed from results on percent variance which was also the case for other studies namely a significant correlation was found under a low percent variance she et al 2017 2014 by comparing results from the two climate zones it can be inferred that hydraulic processes i e the movement of water in soil and the cycling of water between the atmosphere vegetation and soil systems differed between the two climate zones this could be attributed to the interaction among climatic conditions i e precipitation temperature evapotranspiration and solar radiation topography soil properties vegetation cover aboveground biomass and root distribution in the two climates zones at specific scales by comparing two datasets that derived from different climates one taken from an area in the canadian prairies and the other from a watershed in the chinese loess plateau hu and si 2013 found that there were different contributors in the prediction of soil water storage or swc concluding that the topography soil vegetation and climate of these two areas differed dramatically previous studies have widely applied the memd method to explore variation and controlling forcings on swc and associated hydraulic traits on slopes and at a watershed scale liu et al 2018 she et al 2014 in our study we compared scale specific controls of forcings on swc i e in different soil layers and under different soil regimes between two different climate zones using the memd method providing new insight into the dynamic traits of various decomposed swc scales and their relevant determining forcings information related to the application of the memd method in different climates to investigate independent swc scales and controlling forcings is important in understanding principle procedures that influence soil water movement modeling and the evaluation of regional soil water hydraulic processes 4 conclusions in this study we explored scale specific controls on swc applying eight associated forcings using the memd method in two climate zones two or three imfs for swc and measured forcings were determined in the two climate zones scales of all the variables for the seven measurements of a given imf were generally assumed to be similar imfs of swc ndvi clay content and soc constituted most of the total variance in the sub humid climate zone while the percent variance of all variables to the original data was explained by residuals in the semiarid climate zone moreover measured forcings in the two climate zones played different roles in determining swc ndvi was positively correlated to swc in imfs and residuals in the semiarid climate zone while having a negative effect on swc in imf3 and residuals under the mpt condition in the sub humid climate zone in addition soc had a significant impact on swc at moderate and large scales in the sub humid climate zone while only having a significant impact in the semiarid climate zone at a large scale clay content had a greater effect on swc in the semiarid climate zone compared to the sub humid climate zone precipitation and temperature controlled swc at large scales in both climate zones scale specific correlations between soil properties and swc changed in the five soil layers in the sub humid climate zone while similar characteristics were observed among the different soil layers in the semiarid climate zone specific scale controls of associated forcings on swc were similar regardless of the soil water condition dry or wet these memd results could help to reveal the inherent correlations between swc and related forcings at different climate scales and thus advance our understanding of dynamic differences in soil water under various water regimes and soil layers credit
