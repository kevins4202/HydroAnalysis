16835,utilization of anaerobically stabilized sewage sludge on arable lands serve as a renewable alternative to chemical fertilizers as it enables recycling of valuable nutrients to food chain however probable presence of heavy metals in sewage sludge restricts the use of stabilized sludge on lands in this study a novel approach based on ph controlled fermentation and anaerobic metal bioleaching was developed to reduce ecotoxicity potential of fermented sludge prior to its land application sewage sludge was subjected to ph controlled fermentation process at acidic neutral and alkaline ph levels with the aim of increasing metal solubilization and decreasing bioavailable metal fractions through anaerobic bioleaching alkaline reactor performed the best among all reactors and resulted in 3 fold higher hydrolysis 34 and 6 fold higher acidification 19 efficiencies along with 43 fold in average higher metal solubilization than that of neutral ph reactor as a result of alkaline fermentation 32 57 of the metals remained as bioavailable and 34 59 of the metals were encapsulated as non bioavailable within solid fraction of fermented sludge biosolid whereas 8 12 of total metal was solubilized into fermentation liquor our results reveal that anaerobic bioleaching through alkaline fermentation enables biosolid production with less metal content and low bioavailability facilitating its utilization for agricultural purposes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alkaline fermentation dissolved organic matter metal solubilization volatile fatty acids waste activated sludge 1 introduction stabilized sewage sludge application on agricultural lands instead of chemical fertilizers is important in terms of sustainability annual worldwide generation of sewage sludge was estimated to approximate 45 million tons dry solids in 2017 chang et al 2020 and more than 45 of total sludge generated in the us and eu countries is recycled to agricultural lands hudcova et al 2019 westerhoff et al 2015 utilization of anaerobically stabilized sludge in agriculture can provide organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other macro micro nutrients required for crop production numerous studies emphasized that stabilized sewage sludge amended soils had improved physical chemical and biological properties yielding enhanced crop productivity hamdi et al 2019 however there are still concerns related to food security and environmental pollution due to presence of heavy metals in sewage sludge as it contains total of 0 5 2 dry weight heavy metals such as cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn pathak et al 2009 some of these metals cu ni zn are essential in trace quantities for optimal crop production nevertheless these metals could be potentially toxic for human health and ecosystem above certain concentrations yoshida et al 2018 life cycle assessment studies showed that presence of certain metals i e cu and zn in sewage sludge contributed to non carcinogenic human toxicity and ecotoxicity after land application whereas carcinogenic human toxicity was dominated by hg and pb yoshida et al 2018 moreover it has been reported that land application of sewage sludge resulted in freshwater and terrestrial ecotoxicity and degree of toxicity was a function of heavy metal concentration tarpani et al 2020 heavy metal toxicity of sewage sludge has been also studied on several crops such as spinach tomato corn cereals and legumes waqas et al 2015 grotto et al 2015 it was stated that continuous application of sewage sludge resulted in heavy metal accumulation in crops even when metal content of the sludge complied with the regulations singh and agrawal 2007 it is important to emphasize that bioavailability of metals is also important in terms of assessing possible adverse effects on plants and living organisms xu and feng 2016 bioavailability is a relevant parameter used to define proportion of total metal content that can be adsorbed by biological organisms adamo et al 2018 once sewage sludge is introduced into soil heavy metals in sewage sludge can be either directly or indirectly bioavailable for soil based plants depending on their chemical distribution in sewage sludge xu and feng 2016 in general heavy metals are chemically distributed as exchangeable carbonate bound fe mn oxides bound organic sulfide bound and residual within sewage sludge van hullebusch et al 2005 exchangeable and carbonate bound fractions are directly bioavailable and have been reported to increase with acidic ph and decreased contents of humic substances alkalinity and ammonia in sewage sludge dong et al 2013 whereas fe mn oxides bound and organic sulfide bound fractions are considered as indirectly bioavailable and tend to be directly bioavailable when applied to the soils with low ph low humidified organic matter and high dissolved organic matter bolan et al 2014 in addition soils that are well aerated and or irrigated with saline water are reported to cause these metals to be directly bioavailable adamo et al 2018 bolan et al 2014 therefore bioavailability of heavy metals along with their concentrations should be reduced in stabilized sewage sludge prior to its agricultural utilization in a biological environment heavy metals are immobilized within sludge floc through biosorption bioaccumulation bioprecipitation and bioreduction leading to metal accumulation either inside the floc or at its surface nancharaiah et al 2016 on the other hand bioleaching is the only metal microbe interaction that can mobilize heavy metals bioleaching can be basically defined as solubilization of heavy metals from sewage sludge either through microbial metabolism or by their metabolic products meulepas et al 2015 to date researchers have reported that bioleaching can be accomplished via bacteria or fungi krebs et al 1997 through direct or indirect mechanisms gu et al 2017 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions meulepas et al 2015 recently fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process has been recommended to remove heavy metals from sewage sludge meulepas et al 2015 anaerobic bioleaching processes do not require aeration and in addition external chemical requirement is limited therefore anaerobic bioleaching processes can be considered as cost effective when compared to aerobic bioleaching processes meulepas et al 2015 the mechanism of fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process relies on three consecutive processes hydrolysis acidogenesis and complexolysis as shown in fig 1 meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 sewage sludge is a complex mixture of macromolecular organic matters moms including polysaccharides protein and lipids yuan et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions moms are initially hydrolysed into dissolved organic matters doms by consortia of microorganisms excreting hydrolytic enzymes i e cellulase amylase protease and lipase luo et al 2019 subsequently doms are mainly fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas by acid forming bacteria luo et al 2019 once the sewage sludge is hydrolyzed heavy metals bound to sludge matrix are presumed to be simultaneously solubilized and then complexed with either doms or vfas forming soluble organo metallic complexes within the bulk solution fig 1 solubilized metals that are not complexed with doms or vfas tend to re complex with other residues within fermented sludge hindering the solubilisation process molaey et al 2021 therefore it can be concluded that doms and vfas would act as soluble organic ligands enabling metal bioleaching from sewage sludge fig 1 as the mechanism implies hydrolysis and vfa production are prerequisites for an effective metal removal from sewage sludge through fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 however due to complex structure of sewage sludge hydrolysis has been reported as the rate limiting step causing limited vfa production luo et al 2019 in addition methane production from acetate or h2 co2 prevents accumulation of vfas in the bulk liquid therefore preventing methane production in anaerobic digesters to allow the accumulation of vfas is another challenge for a successful metal bioleaching process yuan et al 2019 recently ph controlled acidic or alkaline anaerobic fermentation processes has gained much interest as methanogenic activity can be limited or ceased as a result of operating fermenters outside of optimal ph ranges 6 6 7 5 for methanogens yuan et al 2019 suppression of methanogenic activity or enhancement of hydrolytic processes is known to result in vfa accumulation chen et al 2007 tan et al 2012 accordingly ph controlled fermentation process is presumed to supply sufficient amounts of ligands i e dom vfa for solubilized heavy metals during fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 the main aim of this study was to mobilize insoluble heavy metals in sewage sludge to fermentation liquor with the purpose of decreasing both heavy metal concentration and bioavailability in biosolid which then can be utilized for agricultural purposes there is currently a knowledge gap in the literature in terms of the effects of ph controlled fermentation process on bioleaching and bioavailability of heavy metals in sewage sludge therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 maximize hydrolysis efficiency and vfa production 2 assess bioleaching potential of heavy metals and 3 reduce bioavailability of metals in biosolid through ph controlled fermentation of sewage sludge at acidic neutral or alkaline ph levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of sewage sludge and inoculum sewage sludge used in ph controlled fermentation experiments was obtained from a mechanical decanter centrifuges sludge thickening unit of ataköy advanced biological wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in istanbul turkey primary clarifiers were out of operation in the wwtp throughout this study therefore the sewage sludge contained both inorganic matter and biomass wasted during the biological treatment processes the main characteristics of sewage sludge raw sludge were

and 36 1 1 7 g kg ds of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn raw sludge taken from the treatment plant was divided into two different containers and the first container was fed to the system during the first 68 days of the operation and the second container was fed after the 68th day of the operation raw sludge containers were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c throughout the study the inoculum used to start up anaerobic fermentation reactors was taken from a laboratory scale anaerobic digester which had been operated as seed reactor at 36 c for 280 days 2 2 investigation of fermentation and bioleaching via continuous fermentation experiment anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge was carried out using three 1 3 l 0 8 l liquid 0 5 l headspace identical reactors during start up inoculum was added to the reactors with a substrate to inoculum ratio of 3 1 on the basis of vs content of the sludge the reactors were all started up with same operational conditions after 11th day of identical operation ph control was applied to two of the reactors whereas ph of the last reactor was not controlled hereafter called control reactor the ph of the first reactor hereafter called acidic reactor was kept below 5 5 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl and the ph of the second reactor hereafter called alkaline reactor was kept above 9 0 by the addition of naoh ionization constant pka of individual vfas control protonated and ionized fractions of vfas in the bulk solution and thus determines complexation ability of vfas with solubilized heavy metals gould and genetelli 1978 the pka values of the most common vfas i e acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids range from 4 76 to 5 09 depending on the pka values and temperature 35 c more than 99 99 of these vfas exist in their ionized forms at a ph value above 9 0 whereas their protonated forms range from 85 acetic acid to 93 caproic acid below ph 5 0 therefore selected ph values in this study enabled investigation of bioleaching performance as a function of vfa form protonated or ionized in the bulk solution without inhibiting the fermentative consortia all reactors were operated with semi continuous feeding regime for 109 days at organic loading rate olr of 8 4 g vs l d and solids retention time srt of 4 days to suppress methanogenic activity the biogas produced during fermentation process was collected in aluminum multi layer foil bags and its volume was measured with water displacement method using a weight type gasometer as described elsewhere walker et al 2009 all reactors were placed in a temperature

ltd massachusetts usa in order to investigate surface morphology of fermented sludge samples taken from the reactors on 88th day of the operation 2 4 bacterial community analysis fermentative sludge samples were collected on the 88th day of the operation in order to investigate microbial community structure in all reactors samples were sent to bgi co ltd shenzhen china for microbiome analysis the bacterial composition of the samples was investigated using a metagenomic approach based on next generation dna sequencing details of the analysis were provided in the supplementary information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of fermentation reactors simultaneous hydrolysis and vfa production through anaerobic fermentation is essential to enable heavy metal bioleaching from sewage sludge and also to prevent recomplexation of solubilized heavy metals with organic and or inorganic residues in fermented sludge therefore fermentation performances of the reactors were initially evaluated in detail and then metal bioleaching was discussed considering the fermentation performance three anaerobic fermentation reactors were setup and operated for 109 days in semi continuous feeding mode fermentation performance was evaluated at mesophilic temperature 35 1 c at an olr of 8 4 g vs l d and srt of 4 days the olr applied was approximately 4 times higher than that of a typical anaerobic digester metcalf and eddy 2003 therefore the ph was at slightly acidic 6 1 0 1 levels in the first 11 days of operation in all reactors fig 2 a an insignificant methane production was observed in all reactors within the first 11 days methane yield and its percentage in biogas were less than 7 2 l ch4 kg vs 0 018 g codmethane g vs and 24 0 respectively fig 2b total vfa tvfa production also followed a similar path for all reactors and tvfa concentration was in the range of 3717 6507 mg cod l in the first 11 days fig 2c on day 11 ph control was initiated and acidic reactor s ph was kept below 5 5 whereas ph of the alkaline reactor was kept above 9 0 through the addition of necessary chemicals between days 11 and 68 ph of the control reactor slightly increased while acidic and alkaline reactors were operated at desired ph values except one period days 20 33 in alkaline reactor and days 39 68 in acidic reactor of the study where either acidic or alkaline reactor had extreme ph value due to problems related to manual ph control fig 2a during these periods external ph regulation was stopped and the reactor was allowed to compensate the low ph by itself after starting ph control on day 11 methanogenic activity stopped in acidic and alkaline reactors and methane production was not detected in both reactors until 68th day of the operation fig 2b it is known that optimum ph for methanogens is around neutral 6 6 7 5 values therefore cessation of methane production in acidic or alkaline ph levels was predictable on the other hand neutral ph in control reactor allowed methanogens to grow optimally and to produce methane with the yield of 35 3 l ch4 kg vs 0 088 g codmethane g vs and highest percentage 50 3 in biogas between days 11 and 68 fig 2b observing low methane yield in control reactor compared to that of conventional methanogenic sludge digesters was presumably the result of short srt 4 days in the reactor metcalf and eddy 2003 due to increasing methanogenic activity and limited hydrolysis of sewage sludge tvfa concentration in control reactor gradually decreased between days 11 and 68 fig 2b and 2c in acidic reactor tvfa concentration was about 4000 mg cod l until day 38 fig 2c however concurrent to decrease of ph in acidic fermentation reactor decrease of tvfa concentration was also observed fig 2a and 2c considering that ph of 3 also hinders the metabolism of fermenters babel et al 2004 low vfa production was predictable fig 2b and 2c on the other hand increase in tvfa concentration was observed in alkaline reactor between days 11 and 68 fig 2c on the 68th day of the reactor operation second raw sludge container which was stored at 4 c was fed to reactors the ph values of all reactors were almost stable between days 68 and 109 and also no considerable change was observed in terms of the methanogenic activity of the reactors fig 2a and 2b however tvfa concentrations significantly increased in all reactors following the feeding with raw sludge stored in the second container fig 2c although the previously used and current sludge were taken from the same treatment plant at the same time and had similar total cod concentrations observation of higher tvfa concentrations upon feeding with raw sludge in the second container could be presumably due to disintegration of sewage sludge during 68 days of storage at 4 c in addition upon feeding with the stored sludge ph levels raised from 3 to 5 5 in acidic reactor which is within the optimum operational ph range for fermentative bacteria causing enhanced vfa production which then resulted in increase of tvfa concentration in acidic reactor fig 2c all reactors were steady for approximately 40 days after 68th day of the operation fig 2a 2c total vfa concentration was the highest in alkaline reactor which was followed by acidic reactor then the lowest tvfa production was observed in control reactor at steady state tvfa production was 2 6 times higher in acidic 5126 247 mg cod l and 5 2 times higher in alkaline 10 374 302 mg cod l reactors compared to that of control reactor 1994 94 mg cod l fig 2c therefore it can be concluded that both acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in enhanced vfa production which can be explained by evaluating hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies together hydrolysis efficiency for a fermentation process comprises total solubilized organic matters which remain in the fermentation liquor as vfas scodvfa or non vfa compounds scodnon vfa and converted into methane codmethane whereas acidification efficiency represents only scodvfa in this study hydrolysis efficiencies obtained in control acidic and alkaline reactors were 12 14 and 34 respectively fig 2d although almost the same hydrolysis efficiencies were obtained in control and acidic reactors scodvfa in acidic reactor was approximately 3 0 times higher than control reactor fig 2d similarly in the study of yuan et al 2015 where the effect of ph 4 10 and uncontrolled on vfa accumulation was investigated in a sludge fermentation system the lowest vfa accumulation observed at uncontrolled ph was attributed to the highest methane production as well as the lowest hydrolysis efficiency moreover feng et al 2009 reported that activities of key enzymes i e phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase that are responsible for butyric acid production increased with decrease of ph below 5 0 therefore the reason of relatively higher vfa concentration in acidic reactor can be attributed to either enhanced vfa production at acidic ph or suppression of methanogenic activity due to low ph levels on the other hand the highest acidification efficiency scodvfa was about 18 6 and the lowest methane production codmethane was about 0 03 were obtained through alkaline fermentation fig 2c and 2d the lowest methane production could be presumed to be a result of decreased methanogenic archaea population due to high ph zheng et al 2013 whereas one of the reasons for the highest acidification in alkaline reactor could be enhanced protein and carbohydrate degradation in hydrolysis step sludge matrix was decomposed into either easily biodegradable or refractory doms at different characteristics ma et al 2019 especially concentration of biodegradable doms such as low molecular weight proteins was reported to increase at elevated ph levels ma et al 2019 both proteins and carbohydrates are the main constituents of bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps yuan et al 2015 feng et al 2009 degradation of protein or carbohydrate within eps could be enhanced through alkaline fermentation as their stabilities were weakened as a result of high dissociation of acidic groups in eps and repulsions between the negatively charged eps yuan et al 2015 moreover cation exchange in eps structure with na might also loosen its structure during alkaline fermentation assisted with naoh addition jin et al 2016 sem images of fermented sludge samples obtained from the reactors showed that integrity of sludge matrix was not deteriorated in either control or acidic reactors while a sticky framework appeared under alkaline ph which was probably evidence of eps denaturation fig si 1 accordingly intensive protein and carbohydrate degradation from eps structure was presumed to be main contributor for enhanced acidification in alkaline reactor yuan et al 2015 ma et al 2019 another reason for higher vfa production at alkaline ph levels could be attributed to higher activities of key enzymes i e phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase at high ph resulting in acetic acid production during sludge fermentation feng et al 2009 as a result obtaining enhanced vfa accumulation at elevated ph values could be correlated with improved protein and carbohydrate degradation enhanced vfa production and suppressed methanogenic activity consequently alkaline fermentation seemed to be the most effective fermentation practice for sewage sludge total vfa concentration is not the only consideration in metal bioleaching as ligand property of individual vfas can be different vfa distribution also becomes crucial during fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process compared to control tvfa yield was enhanced in both acidic and alkaline conditions due to suppression of methanogenic activity or higher hydrolysis efficiency of sewage sludge fig 3 among all fermentation processes alkaline fermentation resulted in the highest yield of tvfa fig 3 acetic acid production in alkaline reactor was very high compared to other vfas and or other reactors corresponding to about 42 of tvfa in the reactor fig 3 vfas with low carbon number was reported to have greater role on mobilization of certain heavy metals wang et al 2019 acetic acid was found to have greater ability to mobilize certain metals such as cd pb and zn than propionic acid schwab et al 2008 moreover leaching efficiency of zn was reported to be highest in the presence of acetic acid which was followed by propionic butyric and valeric acids in descending order wang et al 2019 therefore increasing acetic acid production compared to other vfas through ph controlled fermentation process becomes a key consideration for heavy metal removal from sewage sludge consequently alkaline fermentation may assist heavy metal bioleaching from sewage sludge via enhanced production of acetic acid in agreement with the findings of this study the results reported in the literature showed that alkaline ph enhanced performance of sludge fermentation table 1 hydrolysis efficiencies 47 68 reported in the literature for alkaline fermentation at mesophilic temperatures were higher than the efficiency 34 obtained in this study table 1 this difference could be attributed to different characteristics of sewage sludge i e high vs ts ratio or different operational conditions such as longer fermentation time 9 20 days and stronger alkaline condition ph 11 table 1 on the other hand sewage sludge required shorter hydrolysis time in the current study with a higher hydrolysis efficiency compared to the value reported by jin et al 2016 even though the sewage sludge used in our study had relatively low vs ts ratio the main reason for observing higher hydrolysis efficiency in this study could be attributed to higher operational temperature provided throughout the fermentation experiment our results were also in agreement with the literature reports on acidification efficiency at different ph values table 1 similar to the results of this study higher vfa yields 218 236 mg cod g vs were reported through alkaline fermentation in the literature compared to those 50 159 mg cod g vs obtained through fermentation without ph control table 1 interestingly in our study vfa yield at ph 10 310 mg cod g vs was approximately 31 higher than the vfa yield 236 mg cod g vs reported by ma et al 2016 for the same ph although 20 lower hydrolysis efficiency was observed in our study table 1 lower vfa yield reported by ma et al 2016 could be related to batch operation of the fermenter where ammonia might have accumulated at high levels due to effective sludge hydrolysis and might be inhibitory to acidogenic population in the form of free ammonia at alkaline ph ye et al 2020 3 2 microbial community structure in fermentation reactors the representative bacterial sequences of samples taken from three reactors were classified at phylum level and the relative abundance was shown in fig si 2 moreover absolute abundance at phylum level was also provided in table si 1 bacterial community in the reactors was mainly consisted of seven bacteria phyla named as chloroflexi proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria tm7 sacchariabacteria and acidobacteria fig si 2 chloroflexi which has been reported to be responsible from carbohydrate degradation in anaerobic digesters zhao et al 2019 was one of the main phyla in control 50 3 acidic 20 1 and alkaline 46 7 reactors fig si 2 compared to control reactor decreased abundance of chloroflexi in acidic reactor was replaced by increased abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig si 2 both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes has been described as key microorganisms for hydrolysis and vfa production from various substrates under anaerobic conditions however proteobacteria has also been demonstrated as vfa consumer zhao et al 2019 among all reactors the least abundance of proteobacteria was observed in alkaline reactor that might be one of the possible reasons to obtain the highest vfa accumulation figs 3 and si 2 moreover alkaline conditions apparently enhanced relative abundance of firmicutes 26 9 compared to that of control 4 5 and acidic 8 3 reactors fig si 2 firmicutes could produce endospores to survive under extreme conditions and enhanced abundance of firmicutes during alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge has also been reported by other studies yuan et al 2015 as previously reported many lower level sequences related with the phylum firmicutes could produce vfas through anaerobic fermentation ma et al 2017 in this study the leading classes of clostridia and bacilli phylum firmicutes which have been described as acetate and butyrate fermenters in the literature ma et al 2017 accounted for 4 5 in control 8 2 in acidic and 26 7 in alkaline reactors therefore the highest vfa yield obtained in alkaline reactor can be attributed to the highest relative abundance of clostridia and bacilli the results of bacterial community analysis revealed that microbial structure were affected from operational ph dominating certain groups of microbes and resulting different fermentation performances 3 3 solubilization and transformation of heavy metals through ph controlled fermentation process the raw sludge used in ph controlled fermentation experiment contained 471 670 341 and 1367 mg kg dry solid of cr cu ni and zn respectively table 2 other common metals such as pb hg and cd were below detection limits in raw sludge therefore were not considered in the study fractionation analysis of raw sludge reported in a preceding publication showed that cr cu and zn were mainly existed in either indirectly bioavailable forg or non bioavailable fres fraction whereas ni was distributed among all bioavailable fractions fexch fcarb and forg molaey et al 2021 sum of exchangeable carbonate bound and organic sulfide bound fractions yield bioavailable fractions and accordingly bioavailability of metals in raw sludge could be ordered as ni 90 6 cu 75 0 zn 61 0 cr 47 0 table 2 during ph controlled fermentation experiment heavy metals could not be solubilized from sewage sludge in control reactor whereas heavy metals were extracted and released into fermentation liquor at certain levels during acidic and alkaline fermentation table 2 and fig 4 insoluble cr cu ni and zn were solubilized into acidic fermentation liquor at concentrations of 15 7 59 and 15 mg kg ds whereas soluble concentrations of cr cu ni and zn were 43 55 41 and 107 mg kg ds in alkaline fermentation liquor respectively table 2 heavy metal extraction from sewage sludge during anaerobic fermentation can be controlled by mechanisms relying on bioleaching i e eps destruction organic acid production complexation with ligands physico chemical leaching i e temperature ph oxidant availability or their combination meulepas et al 2015 dewil et al 2006 among the studied metals ni had the highest soluble fraction during ph controlled fermentation processes and it was the only metal that could be solubilized at 17 3 and 12 0 under acidic and alkaline conditions respectively fig 4 ni was different from other studied metals due to having exchangeable fraction in raw sludge the metals in exchangeable fraction are likely to be affected by changes in water ionic composition as they are adsorbed onto sludge surface through relatively weak electrostatic forces nkinahamira et al 2019 accordingly ni could be extracted from exchangeable fraction and released into fermentation liquor as a result of change in ionic composition by externally added acid or alkaline chemicals at steady state soluble portion of ni in alkaline reactor was 12 0 which was almost equal to its exchangeable fraction 11 7 in raw sludge while soluble fraction of ni in acidic reactor 17 3 exceeded its exchangeable fraction in raw sludge fig 4 a strong correlation has been reported for ph vfa concentration and carbonate bound fraction of ni indicating that higher vfa concentration along with lower ph can increase ni solubilization zhang et al 2016 as the ph was below 5 0 and vfa concentration exceeded 5126 247 mg cod l during steady state operation of acidic reactor synergistic effect of low ph and high vfa might have enabled ni solubilization from carbonate bound fraction figs 2a and 2c 4 other studied metals having limited exchangeable fractions 0 1 such as cr cu and zn could be solubilized only at percentages of 3 2 1 0 and 1 1 respectively through acidic fermentation fig 4 on the contrary alkaline fermentation with high hydrolysis efficiency could solubilize cr cu and zn at relatively higher concentrations 43 55 and 107 mg kg ds respectively and percentages 9 2 8 2 and 7 8 respectively table 2 and fig 4 in order to solubilize cr cu and zn which were predominantly associated with forg biological degradation of moms along with presence of soluble ligand is required meulepas et al 2015 therefore it can be stated that higher initial ph levels enhanced hydrolysis of moms and resulted in higher metal leaching efficiencies at the end of fermentation process heavy metals in sewage sludge were either released into fermentation liquor as soluble fraction fsolb or transported from bioavailable fractions fexch fcarb and forg to non bioavailable fraction fres of biosolid soluble fraction of heavy metals could be separated from the fermentate during dewatering applications however heavy metals that remain in bioavailable fractions would contribute to ecotoxicity upon application of biosolids to lands dong et al 2013 bioavailability of the studied metals ranged between 47 0 90 6 in raw sludge whereas it accounted for 45 9 67 3 in control 43 2 67 2 in acidic and 32 3 57 3 in alkaline biosolids table 2 the lowest bioavailability was obtained for alkaline biosolid due to the highest solubilization of heavy metals from forg through alkaline bioleaching especially directly bioavailable fraction sum of fexch and fcarb of ni and zn decreased from 42 to 34 and from 18 to 6 respectively when raw sludge was fermented at alkaline ph even though directly bioavailable fraction of zn was reduced considerably 12 major portion of reduced percentage was transported to indirectly bioavailable fraction forg rather than being in soluble form fsolb accordingly bioavailability of zn could only be reduced from 61 0 to 57 3 while bioavailability of cr cu and ni were reduced from 47 0 to 32 3 75 0 to 40 3 and 90 6 to 54 4 respectively through alkaline fermentation table 2 metal bioavailability can be reduced under aerobic conditions through various biological processes such as aerobic composting zheng et al 2007 vermicomposting wang et al 2013 and aerobic bioleaching xu and feng 2016 within a range of 3 64 table 3 however stabilization of organic wastes i e sewage sludge manure through conventional anaerobic digestion poses a challenge of concentrating heavy metals in biosolids leading either no change or limited reduction around 12 20 dong et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 in bioavailability of certain metals table 3 in our study bioavailability of all studied metals was reduced about 4 36 compared to raw sludge through anaerobic bioleaching of sewage sludge at alkaline ph table 2 and table 3 among bio based processes alkaline bioleaching seemed to be more practical as bioavailability reduction could be obtained within a shorter time without the need for aeration and or excess chemical addition and losing the energy potential of sewage sludge by mineralization of its organic content this study aims to enable utilization of biosolid on agricultural lands by solubilizing heavy metals and thus reducing total metal concentration and bioavailability in biosolid therefore re complexation of extracted metals with organic inorganic residues should be avoided through formation of soluble metal ligand complexes in the fermentation liquor in the literature various organic i e doms vfas and inorganic i e oh compounds were reported to act as ligands meulepas et al 2015 dewil et al 2006 especially at elevated ph levels if soluble organic ligands are not adequate in the environment hydroxyl ions may act as ligand to form insoluble metal hydroxides dewil et al 2006 however the metals targeted in this study have strong tendency to form complexes with organic compounds therefore organic type ligands might dominate formation of soluble metal ligand complexes within alkaline reactor presence of soluble organic ligands could be demonstrated by scod concentration which is comprised of vfas and other doms regarding non vfa compounds at higher ph values negative charges of doms increase due to enhanced ionization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in doms wong et al 2007 correspondingly doms serve as effective binding sites for cationic heavy metals under alkaline conditions which may allow increased metal dom complexation during fermentation wong et al 2007 on the other hand anionic forms of vfas at alkaline ph might overcome other negatively charged organic ligands and dominate formation of soluble metal vfa complexes in fermentation liquor in our study acetate was the major vfa produced in alkaline reactor at ph values above 9 0 at 35 c 99 99 of the acetic acid exists in its ionized form acetate in the bulk solution while acetate percentage was below 15 at ph values below 5 0 at 35 c therefore bioleaching of all studied metals might be assisted by enhanced acetate production under alkaline condition figs 3 and 4 at the end of ph controlled fermentation experiment alkaline fermentation produced an alkaline biosolid with a lower metal concentration compared to that of raw sludge table 2 during alkaline fermentation cr cu ni and zn were solubilized from raw sludge and released into fermentation liquor at concentrations of 43 55 41 and 107 mg kg dry solid respectively table 2 remaining concentrations of cr cu ni and zn in alkaline biosolid were 428 615 300 and 1260 mg kg dry solid respectively table 2 the us environmental protection agency usepa regulates heavy metal concentration in biosolids for agricultural lands and has limited concentrations of cr cu ni and zn to 3000 4300 420 and 7500 mg kg dry solid respectively usepa 1993 the limit concentrations of heavy metals in biosolids regulated by the eu are 1000 1750 300 400 and 2500 4000 mg kg dry solid for cu ni and zn respectively whereas there is no limitation for cr in eu regulation european council directive 1986 in turkey maximum allowable concentrations of cr cu ni and zn are 1000 1000 300 and 2500 mg kg dry solid respectively turkish ministry of environment and urbanisation 2010 total concentrations of heavy metals remained in alkaline biosolid complied with all these regulations even though there is no limitation regarding metal bioavailability in biosolids utility of alkaline biosolid on agricultural lands should be evaluated by considering heavy metal concentration along with its bioavailability as alkaline biosolid had lower metal concentration and bioavailability this study would suggest its possible utilization as organic fertilizer for agricultural purposes although characteristics and metal content of sewage sludge might show local or seasonal variations this study provides valuable information on bioleaching and transformation potentials of studied metals during ph controlled fermentation of sewage sludge 3 4 environmental implications heavy metal toxicity in the environment depends on its total concentration as well as its bioavailability adamo et al 2018 bolan et al 2014 this study offers a bio based process to reduce toxicity potential of heavy metals in stabilized sewage sludge prior to its agricultural use our results show that anaerobic bioleaching through alkaline fermentation allows leaching of heavy metals from sewage sludge by the use of microorganisms and thus producing an alkaline biosolid with lower heavy metal concentration traditional anaerobic digestion allowed heavy metals to be slightly bioleached or concentrated in sewage sludge dong et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 accordingly utilization of alkaline biosolid instead of conventional anaerobic digestate can extend soil amendment period without achieving maximum allowable heavy metal concentration in the soil our study also evidences that alkaline fermentation reduces metal bioavailability since bioavailable metals remained in biosolid are likely to be released to water resources adamo et al 2018 a possible ecological threat can be prevented by utilizing alkaline biosolid in agricultural lands on the other hand biosolids obtained through conventional biological processes have acidic or neutral ph which would reduce soil alkalinity and thus probably lead to leaching of directly bioavailable metals bolan et al 2014 however alkaline biosolid obtained in our study can alleviate soil alkalinity and prevent subsequent metal leaching moreover amendment of soils particularly the acidic ones with alkaline biosolid would decrease agricultural lime utilization to neutralize soil ph even though long term pilot scale studies are required to assess practical implications of proposed process alkaline biosolid would decrease potential metal toxicity and preserve food security while decreasing requirement of chemical fertilizers 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel approach based on ph controlled fermentation and anaerobic metal bioleaching for the purpose of decreasing potential toxicity of heavy metals in sewage sludge prior to its land application the key conclusions are 1 alkaline fermentation maximized hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies and minimized vfa consumption through methane production 2 during alkaline fermentation 7 8 12 1 of insoluble heavy metals in sewage sludge were solubilized into fermentation liquor through anaerobic bioleaching 3 compared to raw sludge bioavailable fractions of cr cu ni and zn were decreased from 47 0 to 32 3 75 0 to 40 3 90 6 to 54 4 and 61 0 to 34 9 respectively through alkaline fermentation 4 alkaline fermentation of raw sludge lead to increase of non bioavailable fractions of heavy metals from 9 4 to 53 0 to 33 5 58 5 5 even though alkaline fermentation reduced potential toxicity of heavy metals in the biosolid future investigations are still required on site conditions to determine long term behavior of heavy metals applied with biosolid to different soils declaration of competing interest

16835,utilization of anaerobically stabilized sewage sludge on arable lands serve as a renewable alternative to chemical fertilizers as it enables recycling of valuable nutrients to food chain however probable presence of heavy metals in sewage sludge restricts the use of stabilized sludge on lands in this study a novel approach based on ph controlled fermentation and anaerobic metal bioleaching was developed to reduce ecotoxicity potential of fermented sludge prior to its land application sewage sludge was subjected to ph controlled fermentation process at acidic neutral and alkaline ph levels with the aim of increasing metal solubilization and decreasing bioavailable metal fractions through anaerobic bioleaching alkaline reactor performed the best among all reactors and resulted in 3 fold higher hydrolysis 34 and 6 fold higher acidification 19 efficiencies along with 43 fold in average higher metal solubilization than that of neutral ph reactor as a result of alkaline fermentation 32 57 of the metals remained as bioavailable and 34 59 of the metals were encapsulated as non bioavailable within solid fraction of fermented sludge biosolid whereas 8 12 of total metal was solubilized into fermentation liquor our results reveal that anaerobic bioleaching through alkaline fermentation enables biosolid production with less metal content and low bioavailability facilitating its utilization for agricultural purposes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords alkaline fermentation dissolved organic matter metal solubilization volatile fatty acids waste activated sludge 1 introduction stabilized sewage sludge application on agricultural lands instead of chemical fertilizers is important in terms of sustainability annual worldwide generation of sewage sludge was estimated to approximate 45 million tons dry solids in 2017 chang et al 2020 and more than 45 of total sludge generated in the us and eu countries is recycled to agricultural lands hudcova et al 2019 westerhoff et al 2015 utilization of anaerobically stabilized sludge in agriculture can provide organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and other macro micro nutrients required for crop production numerous studies emphasized that stabilized sewage sludge amended soils had improved physical chemical and biological properties yielding enhanced crop productivity hamdi et al 2019 however there are still concerns related to food security and environmental pollution due to presence of heavy metals in sewage sludge as it contains total of 0 5 2 dry weight heavy metals such as cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn pathak et al 2009 some of these metals cu ni zn are essential in trace quantities for optimal crop production nevertheless these metals could be potentially toxic for human health and ecosystem above certain concentrations yoshida et al 2018 life cycle assessment studies showed that presence of certain metals i e cu and zn in sewage sludge contributed to non carcinogenic human toxicity and ecotoxicity after land application whereas carcinogenic human toxicity was dominated by hg and pb yoshida et al 2018 moreover it has been reported that land application of sewage sludge resulted in freshwater and terrestrial ecotoxicity and degree of toxicity was a function of heavy metal concentration tarpani et al 2020 heavy metal toxicity of sewage sludge has been also studied on several crops such as spinach tomato corn cereals and legumes waqas et al 2015 grotto et al 2015 it was stated that continuous application of sewage sludge resulted in heavy metal accumulation in crops even when metal content of the sludge complied with the regulations singh and agrawal 2007 it is important to emphasize that bioavailability of metals is also important in terms of assessing possible adverse effects on plants and living organisms xu and feng 2016 bioavailability is a relevant parameter used to define proportion of total metal content that can be adsorbed by biological organisms adamo et al 2018 once sewage sludge is introduced into soil heavy metals in sewage sludge can be either directly or indirectly bioavailable for soil based plants depending on their chemical distribution in sewage sludge xu and feng 2016 in general heavy metals are chemically distributed as exchangeable carbonate bound fe mn oxides bound organic sulfide bound and residual within sewage sludge van hullebusch et al 2005 exchangeable and carbonate bound fractions are directly bioavailable and have been reported to increase with acidic ph and decreased contents of humic substances alkalinity and ammonia in sewage sludge dong et al 2013 whereas fe mn oxides bound and organic sulfide bound fractions are considered as indirectly bioavailable and tend to be directly bioavailable when applied to the soils with low ph low humidified organic matter and high dissolved organic matter bolan et al 2014 in addition soils that are well aerated and or irrigated with saline water are reported to cause these metals to be directly bioavailable adamo et al 2018 bolan et al 2014 therefore bioavailability of heavy metals along with their concentrations should be reduced in stabilized sewage sludge prior to its agricultural utilization in a biological environment heavy metals are immobilized within sludge floc through biosorption bioaccumulation bioprecipitation and bioreduction leading to metal accumulation either inside the floc or at its surface nancharaiah et al 2016 on the other hand bioleaching is the only metal microbe interaction that can mobilize heavy metals bioleaching can be basically defined as solubilization of heavy metals from sewage sludge either through microbial metabolism or by their metabolic products meulepas et al 2015 to date researchers have reported that bioleaching can be accomplished via bacteria or fungi krebs et al 1997 through direct or indirect mechanisms gu et al 2017 under aerobic or anaerobic conditions meulepas et al 2015 recently fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process has been recommended to remove heavy metals from sewage sludge meulepas et al 2015 anaerobic bioleaching processes do not require aeration and in addition external chemical requirement is limited therefore anaerobic bioleaching processes can be considered as cost effective when compared to aerobic bioleaching processes meulepas et al 2015 the mechanism of fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process relies on three consecutive processes hydrolysis acidogenesis and complexolysis as shown in fig 1 meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 sewage sludge is a complex mixture of macromolecular organic matters moms including polysaccharides protein and lipids yuan et al 2019 under anaerobic conditions moms are initially hydrolysed into dissolved organic matters doms by consortia of microorganisms excreting hydrolytic enzymes i e cellulase amylase protease and lipase luo et al 2019 subsequently doms are mainly fermented to volatile fatty acids vfas by acid forming bacteria luo et al 2019 once the sewage sludge is hydrolyzed heavy metals bound to sludge matrix are presumed to be simultaneously solubilized and then complexed with either doms or vfas forming soluble organo metallic complexes within the bulk solution fig 1 solubilized metals that are not complexed with doms or vfas tend to re complex with other residues within fermented sludge hindering the solubilisation process molaey et al 2021 therefore it can be concluded that doms and vfas would act as soluble organic ligands enabling metal bioleaching from sewage sludge fig 1 as the mechanism implies hydrolysis and vfa production are prerequisites for an effective metal removal from sewage sludge through fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 however due to complex structure of sewage sludge hydrolysis has been reported as the rate limiting step causing limited vfa production luo et al 2019 in addition methane production from acetate or h2 co2 prevents accumulation of vfas in the bulk liquid therefore preventing methane production in anaerobic digesters to allow the accumulation of vfas is another challenge for a successful metal bioleaching process yuan et al 2019 recently ph controlled acidic or alkaline anaerobic fermentation processes has gained much interest as methanogenic activity can be limited or ceased as a result of operating fermenters outside of optimal ph ranges 6 6 7 5 for methanogens yuan et al 2019 suppression of methanogenic activity or enhancement of hydrolytic processes is known to result in vfa accumulation chen et al 2007 tan et al 2012 accordingly ph controlled fermentation process is presumed to supply sufficient amounts of ligands i e dom vfa for solubilized heavy metals during fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process meulepas et al 2015 molaey et al 2021 the main aim of this study was to mobilize insoluble heavy metals in sewage sludge to fermentation liquor with the purpose of decreasing both heavy metal concentration and bioavailability in biosolid which then can be utilized for agricultural purposes there is currently a knowledge gap in the literature in terms of the effects of ph controlled fermentation process on bioleaching and bioavailability of heavy metals in sewage sludge therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 maximize hydrolysis efficiency and vfa production 2 assess bioleaching potential of heavy metals and 3 reduce bioavailability of metals in biosolid through ph controlled fermentation of sewage sludge at acidic neutral or alkaline ph levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of sewage sludge and inoculum sewage sludge used in ph controlled fermentation experiments was obtained from a mechanical decanter centrifuges sludge thickening unit of ataköy advanced biological wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in istanbul turkey primary clarifiers were out of operation in the wwtp throughout this study therefore the sewage sludge contained both inorganic matter and biomass wasted during the biological treatment processes the main characteristics of sewage sludge raw sludge were

68 days of the operation and the second container was fed after the 68th day of the operation raw sludge containers were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c throughout the study the inoculum used to start up anaerobic fermentation reactors was taken from a laboratory scale anaerobic digester which had been operated as seed reactor at 36 c for 280 days 2 2 investigation of fermentation and bioleaching via continuous fermentation experiment anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludge was carried out using three 1 3 l 0 8 l liquid 0 5 l headspace identical reactors during start up inoculum was added to the reactors with a substrate to inoculum ratio of 3 1 on the basis of vs content of the sludge the reactors were all started up with same operational conditions after 11th day of identical operation ph control was applied to two of the reactors whereas ph of the last reactor was not controlled hereafter called control reactor the ph of the first reactor hereafter called acidic reactor was kept below 5 5 by the addition of hydrochloric acid hcl and the ph of the second reactor hereafter called alkaline reactor was kept above 9 0 by the addition of naoh ionization constant pka of individual vfas control protonated and ionized fractions of vfas in the bulk solution and thus determines complexation ability of vfas with solubilized heavy metals gould and genetelli 1978 the pka values of the most common vfas i e acetic propionic butyric valeric and caproic acids range from 4 76 to 5 09 depending on the pka values and temperature 35 c more than 99 99 of these vfas exist in their ionized forms at a ph value above 9 0 whereas their protonated forms range from 85 acetic acid to 93 caproic acid below ph 5 0 therefore selected ph values in this study enabled investigation of bioleaching

samples were collected on the 88th day of the operation in order to investigate microbial community structure in all reactors samples were sent to bgi co ltd shenzhen china for microbiome analysis the bacterial composition of the samples was investigated using a metagenomic approach based on next generation dna sequencing details of the analysis were provided in the supplementary information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of fermentation reactors simultaneous hydrolysis and vfa production through anaerobic fermentation is essential to enable heavy metal bioleaching from sewage sludge and also to prevent recomplexation of solubilized heavy metals with organic and or inorganic residues in fermented sludge therefore fermentation performances of the reactors were initially evaluated in detail and then metal bioleaching was discussed considering the fermentation performance three anaerobic fermentation reactors were setup and operated for 109 days in semi continuous feeding mode fermentation performance was evaluated at mesophilic temperature 35 1 c at an olr of 8 4 g vs l d and srt of 4 days the olr applied was approximately 4 times higher than that of a typical anaerobic digester metcalf and eddy 2003 therefore the ph was at slightly acidic 6 1 0 1 levels in the first 11 days of operation in all reactors fig 2 a an insignificant methane production was observed in all reactors within the first 11 days methane yield and its percentage in biogas were less than 7 2 l ch4 kg vs 0 018 g codmethane g vs and 24 0 respectively fig 2b total vfa tvfa production also followed a similar path for all reactors and tvfa concentration was in the range of 3717 6507 mg cod l in the first 11 days fig 2c on day 11 ph control was initiated and acidic reactor s ph was kept below 5 5 whereas ph of the alkaline reactor was kept above 9 0 through the addition of necessary chemicals between days 11 and 68 ph of the control reactor slightly increased while acidic and alkaline reactors were operated at desired ph values except one period days 20 33 in alkaline reactor and days 39 68 in acidic reactor of the study where either acidic or alkaline reactor had extreme ph value due to problems related to manual ph control fig 2a during these periods external ph regulation was stopped and the reactor was allowed to compensate the low ph by itself after starting ph control on day 11 methanogenic activity stopped in acidic and alkaline reactors and methane production was not detected in both reactors until 68th day of the operation fig 2b it is known that optimum ph for methanogens is around neutral 6 6 7 5 values therefore cessation of methane production in acidic or alkaline ph levels was predictable on the other hand neutral ph in control reactor allowed methanogens to grow optimally and to produce methane with the yield of 35 3 l ch4 kg vs 0 088 g codmethane g vs and highest percentage 50 3 in biogas between days 11 and 68 fig 2b observing low methane yield in control reactor compared to that of conventional methanogenic sludge digesters was presumably the result of short srt 4 days in the reactor metcalf and eddy 2003 due to increasing methanogenic activity and limited hydrolysis of sewage sludge tvfa concentration in control reactor gradually decreased between days 11 and 68 fig 2b and 2c in acidic reactor tvfa concentration was about 4000 mg cod l until day 38 fig 2c however concurrent to decrease of ph in acidic fermentation reactor decrease of tvfa concentration was also observed fig 2a and 2c considering that ph of 3 also hinders the metabolism of fermenters babel et al 2004 low vfa production was predictable fig 2b and 2c on the other hand increase in tvfa concentration was observed in alkaline reactor between days 11 and 68 fig 2c on the 68th day of the reactor operation second raw sludge container which was stored at 4 c was fed to reactors the ph values of all reactors were almost stable between days 68 and 109 and also no considerable change was observed in terms of the methanogenic activity of the reactors fig 2a and 2b however tvfa concentrations significantly increased in all reactors following the feeding with raw sludge stored in the second container fig 2c although the previously used and current sludge were taken from the same treatment plant at the same time and had similar total cod concentrations observation of higher tvfa concentrations upon feeding with raw sludge in the second container could be presumably due to disintegration of sewage sludge during 68 days of storage at 4 c in addition upon feeding with the stored sludge ph levels raised from 3 to 5 5 in acidic reactor which is within the optimum operational ph range for fermentative bacteria causing enhanced vfa production which then resulted in increase of tvfa concentration in acidic reactor fig 2c all reactors were steady for approximately 40 days after 68th day of the operation fig 2a 2c total vfa concentration was the highest in alkaline reactor which was followed by acidic reactor then the lowest tvfa production was observed in control reactor at steady state tvfa production was 2 6 times higher in acidic 5126 247 mg cod l and 5 2 times higher in alkaline 10 374 302 mg cod l reactors compared to that of control reactor 1994 94 mg cod l fig 2c therefore it can be concluded that both acidic and alkaline conditions resulted in enhanced vfa production which can be explained by evaluating hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies together hydrolysis efficiency for a fermentation process comprises total solubilized organic matters which remain in the fermentation liquor as vfas scodvfa or non vfa compounds scodnon vfa and converted into methane codmethane whereas acidification efficiency represents only scodvfa in this study hydrolysis efficiencies obtained in control acidic and alkaline reactors were 12 14 and 34 respectively fig 2d although almost the same hydrolysis efficiencies were obtained in control and acidic reactors scodvfa in acidic reactor was approximately 3 0 times higher than control reactor fig 2d similarly in the study of yuan et al 2015 where the effect of ph 4 10 and uncontrolled on vfa accumulation was investigated in a sludge fermentation system the lowest vfa accumulation observed at uncontrolled ph was attributed to the highest methane production as well as the lowest hydrolysis efficiency moreover feng et al 2009 reported that activities of key enzymes i e phosphotransbutyrylase and butyrate kinase that are responsible for butyric acid production increased with decrease of ph below 5 0 therefore the reason of relatively higher vfa concentration in acidic reactor can be attributed to either enhanced vfa production at acidic ph or suppression of methanogenic activity due to low ph levels on the other hand the highest acidification efficiency scodvfa was about 18 6 and the lowest methane production codmethane was about 0 03 were obtained through alkaline fermentation fig 2c and 2d the lowest methane production could be presumed to be a result of decreased methanogenic archaea population due to high ph zheng et al 2013 whereas one of the reasons for the highest acidification in alkaline reactor could be enhanced protein and carbohydrate degradation in hydrolysis step sludge matrix was decomposed into either easily biodegradable or refractory doms at different characteristics ma et al 2019 especially concentration of biodegradable doms such as low molecular weight proteins was reported to increase at elevated ph levels ma et al 2019 both proteins and carbohydrates are the main constituents of bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps yuan et al 2015 feng et al 2009 degradation of protein or carbohydrate within eps could be enhanced through alkaline fermentation as their stabilities were weakened as a result of high dissociation of acidic groups in eps and repulsions between the negatively charged eps yuan et al 2015 moreover cation exchange in eps structure with na might also loosen its structure during alkaline fermentation assisted with naoh addition jin et al 2016 sem images of fermented sludge samples obtained from the reactors showed that integrity of sludge matrix was not deteriorated in either control or acidic reactors while a sticky framework appeared under alkaline ph which was probably evidence of eps denaturation fig si 1 accordingly intensive protein and carbohydrate degradation from eps structure was presumed to be main contributor for enhanced acidification in alkaline reactor yuan et al 2015 ma et al 2019 another reason for higher vfa production at alkaline ph levels could be attributed to higher activities of key enzymes i e phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase at high ph resulting in acetic acid production during sludge fermentation feng et al 2009 as a result obtaining enhanced vfa accumulation at elevated ph values could be correlated with improved protein and carbohydrate degradation enhanced vfa production and suppressed methanogenic activity consequently alkaline fermentation seemed to be the most effective fermentation practice for sewage sludge total vfa concentration is not the only consideration in metal bioleaching as ligand property of individual vfas can be different vfa distribution also becomes crucial during fermentation based anaerobic bioleaching process compared to control tvfa yield was enhanced in both acidic and alkaline conditions due to suppression of methanogenic activity or higher hydrolysis efficiency of sewage sludge fig 3 among all fermentation processes alkaline fermentation resulted in the highest yield of tvfa fig 3 acetic acid production in alkaline reactor was very high compared to other vfas and or other reactors corresponding to about 42 of tvfa in the reactor fig 3 vfas with low carbon number was reported to have greater role on mobilization of certain heavy metals wang et al 2019 acetic acid was found to have greater ability to mobilize certain metals such as cd pb and zn than propionic acid schwab et al 2008 moreover leaching efficiency of zn was reported to be highest in the presence of acetic acid which was followed by propionic butyric and valeric acids in descending order wang et al 2019 therefore increasing acetic acid production compared to other vfas through ph controlled fermentation process becomes a key consideration for heavy metal removal from sewage sludge consequently alkaline fermentation may assist heavy metal bioleaching from sewage sludge via enhanced production of acetic acid in agreement with the findings of this study the results reported in the literature showed that alkaline ph enhanced performance of sludge fermentation table 1 hydrolysis efficiencies 47 68 reported in the literature for alkaline fermentation at mesophilic temperatures were higher than the efficiency 34 obtained in this study table 1 this difference could be attributed to different characteristics of sewage sludge i e high vs ts ratio or different operational conditions such as longer fermentation time 9 20 days and stronger alkaline condition ph 11 table 1 on the other hand sewage sludge required shorter hydrolysis time in the current study with a higher hydrolysis efficiency compared to the value reported by jin et al 2016 even though the sewage sludge used in our study had relatively low vs ts ratio the main reason for observing higher hydrolysis efficiency in this study could be attributed to higher operational temperature provided throughout the fermentation experiment our results were also in agreement with the literature reports on acidification efficiency at different ph values table 1 similar to the results of this study higher vfa yields 218 236 mg cod g vs were reported through alkaline fermentation in the literature compared to those 50 159 mg cod g vs obtained through fermentation without ph control table 1 interestingly in our study vfa yield at ph 10 310 mg cod g vs was approximately 31 higher than the vfa yield 236 mg cod g vs reported by ma et al 2016 for the same ph although 20 lower hydrolysis efficiency was observed in our study table 1 lower vfa yield reported by ma et al 2016 could be related to batch operation of the fermenter where ammonia might have accumulated at high levels due to effective sludge hydrolysis and might be inhibitory to acidogenic population in the form of free ammonia at alkaline ph ye et al 2020 3 2 microbial community structure in fermentation reactors the representative bacterial sequences of samples taken from three reactors were classified at phylum level and the relative abundance was shown in fig si 2 moreover absolute abundance at phylum level was also provided in table si 1 bacterial community in the reactors was mainly consisted of seven bacteria phyla named as chloroflexi proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria tm7 sacchariabacteria and acidobacteria fig si 2 chloroflexi which has been reported to be responsible from carbohydrate degradation in anaerobic digesters zhao et al 2019 was one of the main phyla in control 50 3 acidic 20 1 and alkaline 46 7 reactors fig si 2 compared to control reactor decreased abundance of chloroflexi in acidic reactor was replaced by increased abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig si 2 both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes has been described as key microorganisms for hydrolysis and vfa production from various substrates under anaerobic conditions however proteobacteria has also been demonstrated as vfa consumer zhao et al 2019 among all reactors the least abundance of proteobacteria was observed in alkaline reactor that might be one of the possible reasons to obtain the highest vfa accumulation figs 3 and si 2 moreover alkaline conditions apparently enhanced relative abundance of firmicutes 26 9 compared to that of control 4 5 and acidic 8 3 reactors fig si 2 firmicutes could produce endospores to survive under extreme conditions and enhanced abundance of firmicutes during alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge has also been reported by other studies yuan et al 2015 as previously reported many lower level sequences related with the phylum firmicutes could produce vfas through anaerobic fermentation ma et al 2017 in this study the leading classes of clostridia and bacilli phylum firmicutes which have been described as acetate and butyrate fermenters in the literature ma et al 2017 accounted for 4 5 in control 8 2 in acidic and 26 7 in alkaline reactors therefore the highest vfa yield obtained in alkaline reactor can be attributed to the highest relative abundance of clostridia and bacilli the results of bacterial community analysis revealed that microbial structure were affected from operational ph dominating certain groups of microbes and resulting different fermentation performances 3 3 solubilization and transformation of heavy metals through ph controlled fermentation process the raw sludge used in ph controlled fermentation experiment contained 471 670 341 and 1367 mg kg dry solid of cr cu ni and zn respectively table 2 other common metals such as pb hg and cd were below detection limits in raw sludge therefore were not considered in the study fractionation analysis of raw sludge reported in a preceding publication showed that cr cu and zn were mainly existed in either indirectly bioavailable forg or non bioavailable fres fraction whereas ni was distributed among all bioavailable fractions fexch fcarb and forg molaey et al 2021 sum of exchangeable carbonate bound and organic sulfide bound fractions yield bioavailable fractions and accordingly bioavailability of metals in raw sludge could be ordered as ni 90 6 cu 75 0 zn 61 0 cr 47 0 table 2 during ph controlled fermentation experiment heavy metals could not be solubilized from sewage sludge in control reactor whereas heavy metals were extracted and released into fermentation liquor at certain levels during acidic and alkaline fermentation table 2 and fig 4 insoluble cr cu ni and zn were solubilized into acidic fermentation liquor at concentrations of 15 7 59 and 15 mg kg ds whereas soluble concentrations of cr cu ni and zn were 43 55 41 and 107 mg kg ds in alkaline fermentation liquor respectively table 2 heavy metal extraction from sewage sludge during anaerobic fermentation can be controlled by mechanisms relying on bioleaching i e eps destruction organic acid production complexation with ligands physico chemical leaching i e temperature ph oxidant availability or their combination meulepas et al 2015 dewil et al 2006 among the studied metals ni had the highest soluble fraction during ph controlled fermentation processes and it was the only metal that could be solubilized at 17 3 and 12 0 under acidic and alkaline conditions respectively fig 4 ni was different from other studied metals due to having exchangeable fraction in raw sludge the metals in exchangeable fraction are likely to be affected by changes in water ionic composition as they are adsorbed onto sludge surface through relatively weak electrostatic forces nkinahamira et al 2019 accordingly ni could be extracted from exchangeable fraction and released into fermentation liquor as a result of change in ionic composition by externally added acid or alkaline chemicals at steady state soluble portion of ni in alkaline reactor was 12 0 which was almost equal to its exchangeable fraction 11 7 in raw sludge while soluble fraction of ni in acidic reactor 17 3 exceeded its exchangeable fraction in raw sludge fig 4 a strong correlation has been reported for ph vfa concentration and carbonate bound fraction of ni indicating that higher vfa concentration along with lower ph can increase ni solubilization zhang et al 2016 as the ph was below 5 0 and vfa concentration exceeded 5126 247 mg cod l during steady state operation of acidic reactor synergistic effect of low ph and high vfa might have enabled ni solubilization from carbonate bound fraction figs 2a and 2c 4 other studied metals having limited exchangeable fractions 0 1 such as cr cu and zn could be solubilized only at percentages of 3 2 1 0 and 1 1 respectively through acidic fermentation fig 4 on the contrary alkaline fermentation with high hydrolysis efficiency could solubilize cr cu and zn at relatively higher concentrations 43 55 and 107 mg kg ds respectively and percentages 9 2 8 2 and 7 8 respectively table 2 and fig 4 in order to solubilize cr cu and zn which were predominantly associated with forg biological degradation of moms along with presence of soluble ligand is required meulepas et al 2015 therefore it can be stated that higher initial ph levels enhanced hydrolysis of moms and resulted in higher metal leaching efficiencies at the end of fermentation process heavy metals in sewage sludge were either released into fermentation liquor as soluble fraction fsolb or transported from bioavailable fractions fexch fcarb and forg to non bioavailable fraction fres of biosolid soluble fraction of heavy metals could be separated from the fermentate during dewatering applications however heavy metals that remain in bioavailable fractions would contribute to ecotoxicity upon application of biosolids to lands dong et al 2013 bioavailability of the studied metals ranged between 47 0 90 6 in raw sludge whereas it accounted for 45 9 67 3 in control 43 2 67 2 in acidic and 32 3 57 3 in alkaline biosolids table 2 the lowest bioavailability was obtained for alkaline biosolid due to the highest solubilization of heavy metals from forg through alkaline bioleaching especially directly bioavailable fraction sum of fexch and fcarb of ni and zn decreased from 42 to 34 and from 18 to 6 respectively when raw sludge was fermented at alkaline ph even though directly bioavailable fraction of zn was reduced considerably 12 major portion of reduced percentage was transported to indirectly bioavailable fraction forg rather than being in soluble form fsolb accordingly bioavailability of zn could only be reduced from 61 0 to 57 3 while bioavailability of cr cu and ni were reduced from 47 0 to 32 3 75 0 to 40 3 and 90 6 to 54 4 respectively through alkaline fermentation table 2 metal bioavailability can be reduced under aerobic conditions through various biological processes such as aerobic composting zheng et al 2007 vermicomposting wang et al 2013 and aerobic bioleaching xu and feng 2016 within a range of 3 64 table 3 however stabilization of organic wastes i e sewage sludge manure through conventional anaerobic digestion poses a challenge of concentrating heavy metals in biosolids leading either no change or limited reduction around 12 20 dong et al 2013 zheng et al 2020 in bioavailability of certain metals table 3 in our study bioavailability of all studied metals was reduced about 4 36 compared to raw sludge through anaerobic bioleaching of sewage sludge at alkaline ph table 2 and table 3 among bio based processes alkaline bioleaching seemed to be more practical as bioavailability reduction could be obtained within a shorter time without the need for aeration and or excess chemical addition and losing the energy potential of sewage sludge by mineralization of its organic content this study aims to enable utilization of biosolid on agricultural lands by solubilizing heavy metals and thus reducing total metal concentration and bioavailability in biosolid therefore re complexation of extracted metals with organic inorganic residues should be avoided through formation of soluble metal ligand complexes in the fermentation liquor in the literature various organic i e doms vfas and inorganic i e oh compounds were reported to act as ligands meulepas et al 2015 dewil et al 2006 especially at elevated ph levels if soluble organic ligands are not adequate in the environment hydroxyl ions may act as ligand to form insoluble metal hydroxides dewil et al 2006 however the metals targeted in this study have strong tendency to form complexes with organic compounds therefore organic type ligands might dominate formation of soluble metal ligand complexes within alkaline reactor presence of soluble organic ligands could be demonstrated by scod concentration which is comprised of vfas and other doms regarding non vfa compounds at higher ph values negative charges of doms increase due to enhanced ionization of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in doms wong et al 2007 correspondingly doms serve as effective binding sites for cationic heavy metals under alkaline conditions which may allow increased metal dom complexation during fermentation wong et al 2007 on the other hand anionic forms of vfas at alkaline ph might overcome other negatively charged organic ligands and dominate formation of soluble metal vfa complexes in fermentation liquor in our study acetate was the major vfa produced in alkaline reactor at ph values above 9 0 at 35 c 99 99 of the acetic acid exists in its ionized form acetate in the bulk solution while acetate percentage was below 15 at ph values below 5 0 at 35 c therefore bioleaching of all studied metals might be assisted by enhanced acetate production under alkaline condition figs 3 and 4 at the end of ph controlled fermentation experiment alkaline fermentation produced an alkaline biosolid with a lower metal concentration compared to that of raw sludge table 2 during alkaline fermentation cr cu ni and zn were solubilized from raw sludge and released into fermentation liquor at concentrations of 43 55 41 and 107 mg kg dry solid respectively table 2 remaining concentrations of cr cu ni and zn in alkaline biosolid were 428 615 300 and 1260 mg kg dry solid respectively table 2 the us environmental protection agency usepa regulates heavy metal concentration in biosolids for agricultural lands and has limited concentrations of cr cu ni and zn to 3000 4300 420 and 7500 mg kg dry solid respectively usepa 1993 the limit concentrations of heavy metals in biosolids regulated by the eu are 1000 1750 300 400 and 2500 4000 mg kg dry solid for cu ni and zn respectively whereas there is no limitation for cr in eu regulation european council directive 1986 in turkey maximum allowable concentrations of cr cu ni and zn are 1000 1000 300 and 2500 mg kg dry solid respectively turkish ministry of environment and urbanisation 2010 total concentrations of heavy metals remained in alkaline biosolid complied with all these regulations even though there is no limitation regarding metal bioavailability in biosolids utility of alkaline biosolid on agricultural lands should be evaluated by considering heavy metal concentration along with its bioavailability as alkaline biosolid had lower metal concentration and bioavailability this study would suggest its possible utilization as organic fertilizer for agricultural purposes although characteristics and metal content of sewage sludge might show local or seasonal variations this study provides valuable information on bioleaching and transformation potentials of studied metals during ph controlled fermentation of sewage sludge 3 4 environmental implications heavy metal toxicity in the environment depends on its total concentration as well as its bioavailability adamo et al 2018 bolan et al 2014 this study offers a bio based process to reduce toxicity potential of heavy metals in stabilized sewage sludge prior to its agricultural use our results show that anaerobic bioleaching through alkaline fermentation allows leaching of heavy metals from sewage sludge by the use of microorganisms and thus producing an alkaline biosolid with lower heavy metal concentration traditional anaerobic digestion allowed heavy metals to be slightly bioleached or concentrated in sewage sludge dong et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 accordingly utilization of alkaline biosolid instead of conventional anaerobic digestate can extend soil amendment period without achieving maximum allowable heavy metal concentration in the soil our study also evidences that alkaline fermentation reduces metal bioavailability since bioavailable metals remained in biosolid are likely to be released to water resources adamo et al 2018 a possible ecological threat can be prevented by utilizing alkaline biosolid in agricultural lands on the other hand biosolids obtained through conventional biological processes have acidic or neutral ph which would reduce soil alkalinity and thus probably lead to leaching of directly bioavailable metals bolan et al 2014 however alkaline biosolid obtained in our study can alleviate soil alkalinity and prevent subsequent metal leaching moreover amendment of soils particularly the acidic ones with alkaline biosolid would decrease agricultural lime utilization to neutralize soil ph even though long term pilot scale studies are required to assess practical implications of proposed process alkaline biosolid would decrease potential metal toxicity and preserve food security while decreasing requirement of chemical fertilizers 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel approach based on ph controlled fermentation and anaerobic metal bioleaching for the purpose of decreasing potential toxicity of heavy metals in sewage sludge prior to its land application the key conclusions are 1 alkaline fermentation maximized hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies and minimized vfa consumption through methane production 2 during alkaline fermentation 7 8 12 1 of insoluble heavy metals in sewage sludge were solubilized into fermentation liquor through anaerobic bioleaching 3 compared to raw sludge bioavailable fractions of cr cu ni and zn were decreased from 47 0 to 32 3 75 0 to 40 3 90 6 to 54 4 and 61 0 to 34 9 respectively through alkaline fermentation 4 alkaline fermentation of raw sludge lead to increase of non bioavailable fractions of heavy metals from 9 4 to 53 0 to 33 5 58 5 5 even though alkaline fermentation reduced potential toxicity of heavy metals in the biosolid future investigations are still required on site conditions to determine long term behavior of heavy metals applied with biosolid to different soils declaration of competing interest

16836,orthophosphate po4 addition is a common corrosion control treatment used to lower lead pb concentrations at the consumer s tap by forming relatively insoluble pb phosphate pb po4 minerals however some pb po4 particles that can form in drinking water are mobile nanoparticles i e 0 001 0 1 µm that have the potential to reach the tap point of use pou or pitcher filters are often used to manage risks during distribution system upsets when corrosion control treatment is not optimized or following pb service line replacements to abide by industry convention pou and pitcher filters must be nsf ansi certified for pb reduction nsf ansi 53 using a test water containing dissolved pb and large pb particles certification for particulates reduction nsf ansi 42 is done using a test water that contains particles but not leaded particles to address the lack of testing for pb nanoparticles this study challenged six certified commercially available faucet mounted pou 3 and pitcher 3 filters with aqueous suspensions of pb po4 nanoparticle for the water quality investigated the pb particles formed ranged between 0 016 and 0 098 µm based on scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis these particles represented 98 5 of total pb in suspension the total pb removals were between 44 6 and 65 1 for the pou filters and between 10 9 and 92 9 for the pitcher filters the electron microscopy results confirm that pb po4 nanoparticles passed through the filters the findings can inform future efforts to re examine the test waters

introduction there is no safe level of exposure to lead pb as it is a neurotoxin which can have detrimental human health effects even at low levels centers for disease control and prevention 2019 in drinking water distribution systems pb sources can include service lines brasses and solders lytle et al 2019 sandvig et al 2008 appropriately certified point of use pou filters and or pitcher filters have been recommended as a mitigation measure to decrease pb exposure bosscher et al 2019 particularly in short term response to an emergency pb release event pou and pitcher filters are also distributed by many cities in the united states us including cincinnati webb 2014 denver denver water 2020 and milwaukee milwaukee health department 2020 following pb service line replacement relevant voluntary certifications associated with the reduction of pb by pou and pitcher filters in drinking water are covered under standards nsf ansi 42 and nsf ansi 53 developed by the nsf american national standards institute nsf ansi 2019a b nsf ansi 42 is the standard aimed at reducing non health related contaminants that cause aesthetic effects e g chlorine taste and odor including class i particulates 0 5 to 1 µm to be certified under nsf ansi 42 a reduction 85 must be achieved from a 10 000 particles ml solution which does not contain pb nsf ansi 2019a the relevance of this aesthetic effects standard is that pb has been associated with other particles e g iron in water trueman and gagnon 2016 therefore this certification would conceivably ensure reduction of pb containing class i particulates from water nsf ansi 53 is a health effects standard directly associated with pb reduction for pou pitcher filters certification is carried out by challenging filters with two test waters with a pb concentration of 150 µg l one at ph 6 5 with dissolved pb added as pb no3 2 and the other at ph 8 5 with both dissolved and particulate pb added at ph 8 5 at least 20 of total pb in the nsf

the certification nsf ansi 2019b appropriately certified pou and pitcher filters have been shown to reduce pb in drinking water and provide a pb reduction option to homeowners and utilities under field settings certified pou filters and pitcher filters were provided to residents in cities such as flint mi newark nj and university park il aqua illinois 2019 bosscher et al 2019 cdm smith 2019 lytle et al 2020b us environmental protection agency 2019 to reduce pb in drinking water following distribution system upsets in flint mi following the transition to water from the flint river federal agencies including the us environmental protection agency usepa and the department of health and human services hhs recommended the use of nsf ansi 42 53 certified pou and pitcher filters or bottled water to lower exposure to pb from drinking water bosscher et al 2019 field drinking water sampling at over 345 locations in flint mi showed that all pou filters evaluated reduced pb levels below the certification target and 97 of the filtered samples had pb concentrations below 0 5 µg l bosscher et al 2019 pitcher filters could remove 99 85 of pb from an initial concentration of 13 200 µg l pieper et al 2019 deshommes et al 2010 tested certified pou and pitcher filters in the laboratory and field conditions concluding that pou filters adequately lowered pb concentrations below 10 µg l and only occasionally exceeded this threshold most of the certified pou filters and pitcher filters tested by purchase et al 2021 successfully decreased soluble pb concentrations below nsf ansi 53 standards for certification and 3 out of the 5 filters tested reduced particulate pb to values lower than 10 µg l not all studies on pou and pitcher filters systematically assessed the form of pb soluble colloidal particulate nor did they assess the nature e g size composition mineralogy of pb colloids and particles when present system wide corrosion control to decrease exposure to pb from drinking water involves the application of corrosion control treatment to form protective relatively insoluble pb minerals over leaded materials schock 1989 orthophosphate po4 for example is added by many utilities to promote the formation in pipe scales of insoluble pb phosphate pb po4 minerals such as hydroxypyromorphite pb5 po4 3 oh chloropyromorphite pb5 po4 3 cl and tertiary pb phosphate pb3

certain water qualities e g low hardness bae et al 2020 lytle et al 2020b trueman et al 2018 furthermore nanoparticulate pb 0 001 0 1 µm could present a challenge to certified pou and pitcher filters because they are certified under nsf ansi 42 53 to reduce much larger particles 0 1 µm nsf ansi 2019a b initial pb sampling from pou and pitcher filters in newark nj homes revealed that two of three sampled filters failed to reduce pb below 10 µg l but a large follow on pou and pitcher filter testing program initiated by the city found that 97 5 of the 198 filters evaluated reduced pb 10 µg l cdm smith 2019 furthermore flushing for 5 minutes increased the percentage to 99 5 cdm smith 2019 lopez 2019 lytle et al 2020b follow up usepa sampling at four of those homes found that pb po4 nanoparticles were present in the water before and after treatment by either a pou filter or a pitcher filter lytle et al 2020b the finding albeit isolated raised concerns over filter efficacy when leaded nanoparticles are present this then raised questions about the representativeness of pb particles used in the current certification protocol to challenge pou and pitcher filters given the reliance on using pou and pitcher filters to reduce pb under some circumstances questions remain regarding their effectiveness to remove very small pb particles the objectives of this study were to 1 challenge commercially available nsf ansi 42 53 certified pou and pitcher filters with a stable pb po4 nanoparticle suspension 2 quantify the pb fractions total particulate colloidal and soluble before and after filtration 3 identify other water quality changes that occur after water passes the filters this information will help inform the drinking water industry particularly with regard to efforts to develop more robust certification testing protocols for removing pb from drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 pou and pitcher filters tested in this study pou filters refer to devices which attach to the faucet as opposed to pitcher filters which do not three certified nsf ansi 42 53 pou filters and three certified pitcher filters were evaluated table 1 the three pou devices consisted of carbon block based filters containing natural zeolite with reported lifespan between 378 and 780 l the reported filter lifespan of the three pitchers were generally lower 56 8 454 l particularly for pitcher 3 the pitcher filters all utilized activated carbon and or ion exchange resin medias all filters reported high pb reduction efficiency 98 5 99 7 and particulate class i reduction efficiency 97 99 9 for nsf ansi 53 and nsf ansi 42 respectively except for pitcher 3 which was not certified under nsf ansi 42 2 2 preparation of challenge water synthetic stable pb po4 nanoparticle challenge water was prepared daily in the laboratory based on previous work from formal et al 2021 and lytle et al 2020a table 2 which is referred to as challenge water throughout this manuscript for the preparation of the challenge water a pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension 5 mg pb l soluble pb 10 µg l ph 7 5 7 mg c l as total inorganic carbon tic po4 in excess of 3 0 mg po4 l was first prepared daily the stock solution was prepared by adding sodium bicarbonate nahco3 fisher chemical fairlawn nj adjusting the ph to 7 5 0 1 with sodium hydroxide naoh and nitric acid hno3 0 6

de ionized di water the ph of the pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension was maintained at 7 5 0 1 throughout immediately after particle generation pb particle hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index were measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 malvern united kingdom based on dynamic light scattering dls principles for the first ten pou filters and pitcher filters tested the 2 000 mg po4 l stock solution was made from nah2po4 fisher chemical fairlawn nj resulting in a concentration of 3 mg po4 l whereas the remaining of the tests were done at a concentration of 3 4 mg po4 l throughout the experiments po4 levels were above the stochiometric ratio required to precipitate pb po4 particles i e soluble po4 was available challenge water was prepared daily 20 l for pitcher filters and 58 l for the pou filters based on the work of lytle et al 2020a challenge water was mixed using a stir plate and magnetic stir bar at room temperature in high density polyethylene hdpe carboys the carboys were filled with di water then sodium bicarbonate and po4 stock solution were added to obtain targeted water quality table 2 the ph of the challenge water was maintained at 7 5 0 1 with naoh 0 6 n and hno3 0 6 n once ph was stable the pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension was added to the challenge water after 30 minutes of mixing samples were drawn from the top and the bottom of the tanks and analyzed for total pb concentration to confirm suspension uniformity a hach denver co hq440d multi meter with a phc101 probe ph electrode was used to make ph measurements hach spectrophotometric method 8048 was followed for po4 measurements in the laboratory using a hach dr1900 spectrophotometer rapid screening of total pb concentration was performed using an anodic stripping voltammetry asv analyzer palintest sa1100 scanning analyzer golden co following the user manual to ensure pb concentration goals were achieved and mixing was uniform 3 challenging the filters 3 1 pou filters the laboratory pou challenge test apparatus consisted of a 60 l hdpe carboy with two ports located at the bottom fig 1 and supplementary information si figure s1 one was used for sampling during the experimental run and the other to supply challenge water to the pou filter a variable speed pump with a pressure gauge fed the water from the tank to the pou filter using 182 cm of ¼ teflon and 28 cm of ½ schedule 80 polyvinyl chloride pvc tubing the faucet used for the experiment was non metallic to avoid pb contamination sources challenge water interactions with ambient air were minimized by placing a hdpe floating lid in the tank and the ph electrode was inserted into a bored hole in the lid sampling was performed at the beginning of the experiments to assess loss of pb by adsorption to the tank or the tubing by allowing challenge water to stagnate over a 72 hour period in all the wetted parts of the experimental system no significant changes in pb characteristics or concentration of the challenge water were observed between the tank and the by pass of the pou filters a control test run was performed with the pou filter in by pass mode i e water was diverted around the filter to assess whether the relatively short plumbing distance between the tank and pou device changed the suspension properties results showed that changes in pb particle and suspension characteristics particle size shape distribution and total pb concentration of the test water as it was pumped from the tank and through the by pass of the pou filters were not observed data provided in si figures s2 and s3 also during one test run following collection of the samples from the tank and filtered by the pou samples were collected by placing the filter in by pass mode data provided in table s1 pou filters were conditioned and operated according to specific vendor supplied instructions for example pou filter housings equipped with a light indicator or a flow totalizer were operated appropriately by following instructions provided by the vendor minimum operating pressure was 20 psi and pressure readings were recorded throughout the experiments to ensure the devices were operated within specifications table s2 once the challenge water was fully mixed approximately 30 minutes the teflon and pvc tubing were flushed for at least 15 seconds in by pass mode and then the pou filter was turned to filtering mode water samples were collected from the challenge water tank and from water that passed through the pou filter at three time points at the beginning of each experiment 1 l after half of the challenge water volume 29 l had passed through the filter and when the challenge water tank was nearly empty 55 l pressure and flow rate after the pou filter unit were recorded during each sampling event lastly ph was monitored and adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 if required experiments were repeated in triplicate 3 2 pitcher filters the pitcher filters were rinsed three times with di water prior to testing in order to remove dust from the packaging and ensure no outside contamination they were conditioned according to manufacturer instructions di water was used in cases where water had to run through the filter and be discarded before the first use or if the filter had to be soaked in water as with the pou device evaluations precautions were taken to minimize pb losses to the tank by letting challenge water stagnate during a 72 hours period in the tank once the challenge water was completely mixed in a 26 5 l hdpe carboy it was added to the reservoir of the pitcher filters and filtered by gravity samples were collected from the challenge water and the effluent of the pitcher filter at the beginning of the experiment 1 l after half the water was filtered by the pitcher filter 10 l and when the solution was almost completely used 17 l experiments were repeated in triplicate 3 3 water quality and particles analysis a series of water samples were collected during each sampling event from the challenge water and after the faucet mounted pou filter or the pitcher filter as follows 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for total metals i e pb cu zn others analysis 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for ultrafiltration 60 ml sample in polypropylene syringe for 0 2 µm filtration 60 ml glass vial for immediate bench water quality analyses ph temperature po4 fig 2 water samples collected in the middle of the challenge experiments also included 60 ml amber glass vial for total inorganic carbon tic analysis and 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for analysis of wet chemistry parameters alkalinity po4 chloride immediately upon collection the water sample designated for ultrafiltration was filtered through a 400 ml amicon stirred cell with an anodisc ultracel 30 kda ultrafiltration disc which was estimated to be approximately equivalent to 0 01 µm pore size erickson 2009 guo and santschi 2006 previous internal investigations showed that the filtration apparatus can adsorb a significant amount of soluble pb to avoid this likelihood the stirred cell was filled with 120 ml of sample and then allowed to mix for 5 minutes and then discarded before the actual sample was filtered the remaining sample was placed in the pre rinsed stir cell and pushed through the ultra filter using pressurized nitrogen 10 psi the ultrafiltrate was collected in a 60 ml hdpe bottle this sample was defined as the soluble pb fraction for the purposes of this work operationally defined as pb passing an ultrafilter fig 3 which is consistent with the work of tobiason et al 2016 particulate and colloidal pb fraction was calculated by subtracting soluble pb from total pb fig 3 samples collected in the 60 ml syringe were filtered through a 0 2 µm whatman nucleporetm track etched 13 mm syringe filter membrane the colloidal fraction 0 2 µm was calculated by subtracting the soluble fraction from the 0 2 µm filtrate fig 3 this fraction includes nanoparticles 0 01 0 1 µm nanoparticles smaller than 0 01 µm can also be present in the soluble fraction but only represents a small percentage of nanoparticles based on size definition the particulate and colloidal pb 0 2 µm was calculated by subtracting the 0 2 µm filtrate from the total pb overall the classification of total pb into four pb fractions in this work followed a different and more refined filtration approach compared to the simpler operational distinction into soluble and particulate pb as determined by a single 0 45 µm syringe filtration in method 200 8 us environmental protection agency 1994b it is also different from the nsf ansi 53 2019b definition of particulate pb as it is the difference between total pb and the 0 1 µm filtrate with fine particulate further defined as the difference between 1 2 µm filtrate and 0 1 µm filtrate as a research tool particle size fractionation by filtration is limited by the filters commercially available and a trade off between ease of use of the filters and results obtained filters chosen in this study were readily available in the laboratory ultrafilters of 30 kda 0 01 µm pore size can retain most nanoparticles defined as particles between 1 100 nm present in samples which was necessary to quantify the pb soluble and nanoparticulate fractions filters of 0 2 µm were used to identify the colloidal pb fraction 0 2 µm as they capture small colloids and a broader range of particles than 0 45 µm filters all samples for laboratory metal analysis were acidified to ph 2 for at least 16 hours and analyzed using icp aes and icp ms following usepa methods 200 7 and 200 8 us environmental protection agency 1994a us environmental protection agency 1994b po4 concentrations were analyzed using usepa method 365 1 us environmental protection

vial were analyzed using bench analysis for total pb po4 ph and temperature using methods described previously presence of nanoparticles was systematically confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem for the challenge water and the filtered water for each run for solids analysis the challenge and filtered waters were prepared per lytle et al

gravity fed to each tube for 6 hours a sem stub was prepared for each filter material and allowed to air dry sem eds instruments detailed previously were used to analyze filtering material and

considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise figures were generated in sigmaplot version 14 5 systat software san jose ca 4 results and discussion 4 1 pb po4 stock solution pb po4 stock solution was prepared daily with an average standard deviation ph of 7 49 0 04 and total and soluble pb concentrations of 5 283 260 µg l and 4 3 10 4 µg l respectively during all pou and pitcher filter tests n 12 stock solutions the particulate and colloidal pb fraction averaged 99 9 of the total pb based on ultrafiltration fig 3 total and soluble po4 concentrations were 5 2 and 4 0 mg po4 l respectively pb particle size based on dynamic light scattering dls measurements averaged 0 083 0 016 µm from dynamic light scattering analysis the average polydispersity index of the stock solution was 0 16 and ranged from 0 05 to 0 39 signifying low sample heterogeneity sem and tem characterization revealed that the particles were hexagonal in shape fig 4 and xrd analysis of the nanoparticles identified the particles as hydroxypyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh which is consistent with previous work lytle et al 2020a tem particle image analysis resulted in an average diameter of 0 038 0 016 µm and sizes ranging between 0 017 and 0 095 µm based on the different size analysis methods average size of the particles differed as there are intrinsic variations in how the measurements are carried out for example light scattering methodologies can be biased by particle clustering as dynamic light scattering measures brownian motion and clustering is likely to prevent particles from following brownian motion despite variability in particle size methods dynamic light scattering sem and tem all approaches concluded that pb po4 nanoparticles i e 0 100 µm were suspended in the stock solution comparison between particle sizes measured by dynamic light scattering xrd sem and tem is presented in lytle et al 2020a for the same stock solution similarly nanoparticles were larger when measured using dynamic light scattering than sem tem which is attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in contrast in the nsf ansi 53 test water at ph 8 5 particles were 5 orders of magnitude larger than the nanoparticles present in the pb po4 stock suspension fig 5 based on the chemistry of the nsf ansi 53 prepared challenge water pb carbonates were most likely to be formed pb carbonate particles formed in water have been reported to be much larger than the pb po4 nanoparticles particles reported here korshin et al 2005 noel et al 2014 4 2 pou filters 4 2 1 challenge water characteristics pb size fractionation concentrations based on filtrations total particulate and colloidal 0 2µm colloidal 0 2 µm and soluble pb for the challenge water prior to filtration by pou filters are presented in fig 6 the average total and soluble pb concentration of all pou filter challenge waters was 100 1 3 6 and 1 1 0 3 µg l respectively and was statistically similar across all experiments the average particulate and colloidal pb concentration of the challenge waters was 99 2 3 8 µg l 98 9 of total pb of the particulate and colloidal pb fraction 53 7 20 4 µg l 53 5 was colloidal 0 2 µm and the remaining was particulate and colloidal 0 2 µm in size based on filtrations the pb present in the challenge water was therefore primarily in the particulate and colloidal forms and specifically colloidal 0 2 µm form which was consistent with the properties of the stock pb po4 solution fig 4 the presence of nanoparticles in the challenge water was confirmed by sem and tem analysis fig 7 challenge water samples were collected throughout the experiment and showed that the suspension remained stable over the course of the experiment table s3 lytle et al 2020a demonstrated that this challenge water remained stable over a 24 hour period a control test run was performed to demonstrate that pumping challenge water through plumbing between the tank and pou filter did not change the characteristics of the challenge water suspension specifically no pb concentration losses were observed between the tank and the pou filter figure s2 visual agreement of size and shape of pb particles obtained using the sem combined with eds for elemental composition determination figure s3 between tank and by pass water further confirmed that the test apparatus leading to the pou filters did not alter the properties of the nanoparticles figure s3 pb variability in the challenge water particulate and colloidal pb 0 2 µm as well as colloidal pb 0 2 µm was greater than it was for the particulate fraction more variations in the pb concentrations were observed for the samples filtered on 0 2 µm 49 2 21 4 µg l than for the samples which were ultra filtered 1 6 1 9 µg l the variability does not necessarily suggest that pb particle suspensions are difficult to consistently produce indeed sem and tem imaging confirmed the similarity in shape and size of nanoparticles generated in this study rather it more likely illustrates the inherent limitations of using filters to fractionate particles for instance voids in the 0 2 µm filters are not homogenous in size distribution nor do they have a nominal pore size of 0 2 µm but instead are constructed of etched pores figure s5 as pb particles are pushed through the filter using a syringe they can agglomerate particle particle interaction and or attach to the filter which can prevent them from passing despite a particle size smaller than 0 2 µm filtration results can also be influenced by the operator of the syringe filter with varying pressure applied on the syringe and rate of filtration the size of pb particles in the challenge water in the tank could not be reliably measured with dynamic light scattering because the concentration was too low target concentration of 100 µg l for an accurate determination determination of particle size by dynamic light scattering method could only be performed on the pb po4 stock solution target concentration of 5 000 µg l challenge water suspensions of 100 µg l were too dilute to reliably determine lead particle sizes by dynamic light scattering for small particles concentration must be sufficient to scatter the light as the scattering intensity is proportional to the radius of the particles hassan et al 2015 shaw 2014 stetefeld et al 2016 however sem and tem images and eds analyses of particles suspended in the challenge water showed that the size and shape of pb po4 nanoparticles were consistent and uniform with the stock suspensions figs 4 and 7 specifically the particles were hexagonal in shape and individually very small with most considered to be nanoparticles falling between 0 05 0 1 µm in size and all appeared to be smaller than 0 2 µm there were larger clusters of pb particle agglomerations that if present in the water i e not formed as an artifact of sample preparation could be removed through a 0 2 µm filter these observations were consistent across all runs supporting the conclusion that variability in fractionation results can be attributed to filtration artifacts the sem tem findings were an important confirmation that consistent water quality and pb suspension properties were achieved in all tests pb nanoparticle filter challenge water suspensions were generated in the laboratory according to previously reported procedures formal et al 2021 lytle et al 2020a and greatly differed from pb particles formed according to nsf ansi 53 used to certify pou filters for pb reduction nsf ansi 2019a b specifically the challenge water contained pb po4 nanoparticles as compared to relatively large pb carbonate particles generated under the nsf ansi 53 protocol figs 4 and 5 although laboratory generated the pb nanoparticles in this study closely resembled particles previously identified in one community s drinking water lytle et al 2020b and those mineralogically predicted for a po4 treated system schock 1989 trueman et al 2018 asv analyzer pb measurements performed at the time of sample collection were compared to corresponding results determined by icp ms aes figure s6 asv analyzer pb results agreed well with icp ms aes measurements slope of 1 08 and an r2 of 0 918 discrepancies between the methods tended to increase as pb concentration increased pb in the challenge water was well characterized by the asv analyzer in agreement with some previous studies doré et al 2020 4 3 performance of pou filters for pb po4 particles reduction none of the tested pou filters reduced total pb concentration below 10 µg l results were compared to a concentration of 10 µg l the nsf ansi 53 pb certification threshold at the time of this study since completion of the study the nsf ansi 53 certification threshold has been lowered to 5 µg l nsf ansi 2019b after filtration by the pou filters mean total pb concentrations ranged between 34 3 56 4 µg l with a maximum concentration of 88 4 µg l for pou 3 and are not statistically different fig 6 these concentrations are much greater than the previous and current pb certification thresholds under nsf ansi 53 for reference although a different test water than the current study that includes a 50 higher pb concentration was used the pb reductions achieved by the filters when using the pb po4 challenge water were strikingly lower 44 6 65 1 than the reported 99 pb particle reduction under the nsf ansi 53 certification protocol table 1 the removal of pb fractions differed among the pou filters despite variability in the 0 2 µm filtrate as previously noted pou 1 filtered out most of the particulate and colloidal fraction 66 4 followed by pou 2 56 5 particulate and colloidal pb reduction and pou 3 46 4 particulate and colloidal pb reduction the pou filters did not decrease the already low concentration of soluble pb present in the challenge water in general although the filters were not operated until recommended lifespan the concentration of pb passing the pou filters did not substantially change with increasing volume of water volume treated table s3 especially when considering filtration variabilities removal efficiency did not improve over the course of the experiments table s3 as might be observed if retained particles blocked filter pore voids with time since a fraction of the pb nanoparticles was trapped in the filters there was possibility that with time or longer testing pb nanoparticle reduction efficiency would have improved as void spaces decreased it is likely due to the filters were not run to their rated capacities after filtering 58 l of challenge water specifically the three pou filters were only operated to 7 5 15 1 of their reported filter capacities table 1 however a rather notable change was observed for pou 3 between the beginning of the experiment 1l filtered where on average 64 9 µg l remained in the filtered water versus 51 1 53 µg l at the middle end 29 55 l filtered of the experiment table s3 colloidal pb 0 2 µm concentrations were the lowest at the end of the experiment for this filter the primary nanoparticle removal mechanism by porous activated carbon block filters the main component of all but one of the devices evaluated in this work is to physically retain pb containing particles in the low void volumes between the carbon particles kuennen et al 1992 reed and arunachalam 1994 the pore size of solid carbon block filters ranges between 0 5 1 µm 500 1000 nm us environmental protection agency 2006 although being porous the pores are small enough to restrict relatively large pb particles e g nsf ansi 53 generated pb particles from passing however dispersed pb nanoparticles can pass through as demonstrated in this work specifically a large fraction of pb po4 nanoparticles ranging between 17 95 nm passed through certified pou filters sem images confirmed that nanoparticles passed through all of the pou filters figs 7 8 the nanoparticles were identical to those of the challenge water for all pou filters tested flow rates were generally slightly lower at the beginning of each experiment presumably as voids within the filters were cleared of additional fines from filter production or trapped air table s2 there was variability in the flow rates between test runs pressure remained stable within and between triplicate experimental runs except for the second replicate run of pou 3 which experienced more variable pressure for an unexplained reason table s2 the experimental apparatus was not designed to simultaneously fine tune flow rates and pressure the apparatus was able to maintain flow and pressure within manufacturers specifications which was the goal the differences in removal of the different pb fractions could be attributed to the different composition and construction of the pou filters all pou filters tested were dominantly composed of carbon blocks but analysis by sem tem revealed that the composition of the pou filter media differed table s4 differences in results could also be explained by different flow rates table s2 and pressures during operation as well as different structure of the filter media and the housing table 1 faucet mounted filters were made of solid block activated carbon which contains small activated carbon particles fused with ion exchange or sorption media which is responsible for metals removal deshommes et al 2010 4 4 pitcher filters 4 4 1 challenge water characteristics characteristics of the water used to challenge pitcher filters were consistent with waters used to challenge pou filters the total pb concentration in challenge water prepared to test the pou filters averaged 101 9 7 8 µg l and was statistically similar fig 9 soluble pb concentration only available for pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 averaged 2 1 2 5 µg l 1 9 of total pb total particulate and colloidal pb concentration averaged 99 9 6 2 µg l 98 1 of total pb and colloidal pb 0 2 µm concentration was 43 3 22 3 µg l 43 4 of total pb average size of particles measured by dynamic light scattering was 0 083 0 016 µm as measured in the pb po4 stock solution over the course of the experiment the characteristics of the challenge water remained stable notable pb fraction differences in challenge water were not observed after up to 8 hours stability of the challenge water was in agreement with the work of lytle et al 2020a 4 4 2 performance of pitcher filters for pb particles reduction pitcher 3 was the only filter to consistently decrease concentrations below 10 µg l but it was not able to meet the new 5 µg l certification target the total mean pb concentration in the challenge water of 105 3 9 6 µg l fig 9c was reduced to 7 5 1 5 µg l which is significantly lower than filtered water from pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 the percentage reduction in total pb obtained using the challenge water was slightly lower than the vendor reduction claims based on nsf ansi 53 test conditions table 1 nearly all of the pb that passed the pitcher filter 7 0 1 3 µg l was retained on a 0 2 µm filter in contrast 31 6 of total pb in the challenge water was retained on a 0 2 µm filter and this fraction increased by over 3 fold to 94 4 after filtration by the pitcher filter pitcher 3 removed a consistent amount of pb through the entire challenge test table s3 as the reduction efficiency of the filter to remove pb remained consistent with volume of water treated the pitcher reached 35 2 of the reported treated water volume capacity whereas pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 only treated 13 2 and 4 4 of its reported capacity respectively similar to the pou filters pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 failed to decrease pb concentrations of the challenge water to levels even close to 10 µg l allowing pb nanoparticles to easily pass fig 8 after filtration by the pitcher filters mean total pb concentration was 83 1 18 5 19 3 reduction and 88 2 6 4 µg l 10 9 reduction for pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 respectively results obtained by pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 are statistically similar for total pb a perplexing increase in soluble pb was observed in water filtered by pitcher 1 which cannot conceptually be explained by the slight ph increase through that filter differences in the make up materials and structure of the pitcher filters likely explain pb reduction efficiency differences and the changes observed in the pb fractions following filtration tables 1 and s4 pitcher 1 was made of an ion exchange resin mixed with activated carbon whereas pitcher 2 was largely made of activated carbon and a fibrous matrix to hold the media in place pitcher 3 was the most complex made of a layer of granular activated carbon followed by dual ion exchange resin the materials present in the tested pitcher filters were more diverse than in the faucet pous with organic resin present in 2 of the 3 units different forms and amounts of activated carbon were present in the units either as loose material in the casing of the filter or embedded in a membrane to understand pb removal mechanisms associated with pitcher 3 a new filter unit was dissected the two different media carbon based material and dual cation anion exchange resin were then separated to perform additional capacity challenge testing on each media component independently this simple experiment was not intended to replicate the earlier pitcher filter experiments but rather to understand where pb was retained by the pitcher 3 filter in a preliminary way because the filter s two media were separated pb reduction efficiency was expected to be different than when testing an intact filter also a small amount of media 5 ml was used in this test compared to an intact filter as only 35 of the capacity of the filter was reached at the end of a normal experiment in the laboratory the goal here was to exhaust the filtering material to understand the role of each media in removing pb from the challenge water specifically filtered total pb concentration increased from 56 1 µg l at the beginning of the experiment to 99 7 µg l at the end from a challenge water with a pb concentration of 106 0 µg l water was filtered until no pb reduction could be observed based on bench analysis asv analyzer of pb concentrations the carbon fraction of the filter media removed 17 3 µg l of pb at the beginning of the experiment compared to 49 9 µg l by the resin suggesting that pb reduction by pitcher 3 was mostly achieved by the resin portion of the media additionally sem images coupled with eds demonstrated that pb was removed from the water by the dual resin and that pb was bound mostly to one of the resins figure s7 indeed pb was observed on one type of resin beads whereas on the other type pb could not be observed this investigation was preliminary in nature and the results suggest a more detailed study is warranted 4 5 other water quality parameters the ph of challenge waters increased after passing through all pou filters from mean ph values of 7 5 0 03 fig 10 to between 8 6 and 9 8 with the highest ph measured for pou 2 at the beginning of the experiment but differences are not statistically significant table s3 fig 10 for pou filters initial ph was also higher than measurements conducted in the middle or end of the experiment since ph was decreasing as increasing volumes of water were filtered for the pitcher filters mean ph varied between 6 8 and 7 9 which is significantly lower than for the pou filters with the lowest value measured in pitcher 3 the different changes in ph observed between water filtered by the pou and pitcher filters is attributed to the different filtering media table 1 the filtering media of the pitcher filters consisted of activated carbon and or ion exchange resin whereas the point of use filters mainly consisted of solid block activated carbon impregnated with natural zeolite resin the decrease in ph observed through pitcher 3 was attributed to bicarbonate ions being removed through the anion exchange resin in the mixed ion exchange resin bed crone et al 2019 carrière et al 2011 bauman and eichhorn 1947 however caution should be exercised when evaluating ph measurements in low conductivity samples which would be the case for challenge water filtered by pitcher 3 for pitcher 3 soluble pb concentrations could not be obtained due to contamination of the samples from the stir cell of the ultrafilter filtering the challenge water by pitcher 3 dropped the ph to between 6 6 and 7 1 mean 6 8 in the filtrate investigations showed that presumably adsorbed pb was released from the stir cell at ph below 7 preliminary testing showed a release of the pb adsorbed in the stir cell of the ultrafilter when ph is below 7 of the devices tested pitcher 3 was the only one that decreased the ph of the challenge water whereas the other pous increased the ph of the filtered water fig 10 initially the drop in ph to 6 8 was thought to be associated with the pitcher s ability to remove pb by dissolving pb po4 particle schock et al 1996 within the filter and subsequent removal of dissolved pb one of the pb removal mechanisms of pb in granular activated carbon is by adsorption of free metal ions kuennen et al 1992 which would increase as the ph of the solution decreases a follow up test with pou 1 at ph 6 5 did not affect the performance of pou 1 with similar pb concentrations of 34 3 µg l and 33 7 µg l respectively thus the reduction of pb by pitcher 3 cannot solely be explained by the drop in ph of the bulk water passing challenge water through the pou and pitcher filters increased the concentration of several inorganic elements most notably fe mg s and zn which were observed in the virgin filter media table s4 all filters increased the effluent water fe concentration with pitcher 1 yielding the highest mean concentration 0 129 0 243 mg l vs 0 015 0 020 mg l for the challenge water mg and s concentrations were only increased by the faucet mounted pous with the highest mean concentrations for pou 3 0 065 0 059 mg mg l vs 0 007 0 003 mg mg l for the challenge water increases in fe mg s and zn are explained by the presence of trace contaminants on the filter media presumably associated with the product manufacturing process concentrations of p remained stable with slight increases decreases for the pou filters tested except for pitcher 3 4 6 implications although this work demonstrated a limitation of certified pou and pitcher filters to effectively reduce pb nanoparticles the conditions under which such particles may be present likely represent an extreme case the effectiveness of faucet mounted pou filters and pitcher filters to reduce pb in drinking water and provide protection until pb sources are removed has been demonstrated by others bosscher et al 2019 pieper et al 2019 purchase et al 2021 deshommes et al 2010 this work demonstrated pb nanoparticles can pass through pou and pitcher filters certified to remove particulate pb but the findings were not necessarily unexpected certification test water pb particles are much less challenging to remove due to their relatively large size and their behavior does not reflect that of much smaller pb nanoparticles which are fine enough to pass through the pores of carbon based filter blocks secondly the pb particulate challenge condition in this work likely represents an extreme case where very small homogenously dispersed pb nanoparticles were present in a relatively simple aqueous background chemistry despite being an extreme challenge the filters still managed to reduce pb by 10 9 92 9 the outcome of this work was consistent with filter effectiveness concerns initially raised in newark where similar appearing pb po4 nanoparticles were reported to have passed pou and pitcher filters cdm smith 2019 lytle et al 2020b and together clearly raises the need to perform future work in two areas first pou and pitcher filter certifiers should consider exploring alternative pb particle test suspensions that are more representative of the greater challenging particles pb particles come in many shapes and sizes the latter clearly being important to filter performance lytle et al 2020a detailed a recipe for producing stable pb po4 nanoparticles as a potential starting point for identifying a more challenging case an outcome may be that filter manufacturers consider reevaluating filter designs secondly there needs to be a broader and regular examination of the nature of pb particles formed in drinking water systems and isolated from consumer s tap water there is very little information available on the subject the nature of the pb particles should be related to pb source scale properties water quality corrosion control practices and other considerations to establish a better understanding of conditions that might produce pb nanoparticles improvements in sampling strategies protocols and analysis techniques should also be considered 5 conclusion in this study appropriately certified pou and pitcher filters for pb reduction in water reduced pb in pb po4 particle challenge suspensions containing 98 5 particulate and colloidal pb but to nowhere near the nsf ansi certification target of 10 µg l at the time of the study with the exception of one pitcher filter on average 45 of the total pb approximately 100 µg l passed through the pou and pitcher filters and the passing pb was in the particulate and colloidal form dominantly nanoparticles the findings are not necessarily surprising given that pb particles produced under the nsf ansi protocol are relatively large 700 1800 nm pb carbonate particles that would not pose the same filterability challenge although this work was not performed under nsf ansi certification protocols all filters were operated within manufacture provided specifications and baseline water quality fell within the bounds of drinking water supplies of the pitcher filters tested only pitcher 3 decreased total pb concentrations below 10 µg l but not below 5 µg l average of 7 5 µg l which appeared to be tied to attraction between the ion exchange resin and pb po4 nanoparticles given the results of this study showing that small pb po4 particles similar to those reported to be present in some community water distribution systems lytle et al 2020b passed filters there is an obvious need to better understand what drinking water quality conditions and mechanisms promote the formation and mobility of such particles in drinking water systems such an understanding will help target locations where additional pb sampling may be considered and filter device effectiveness explored lastly the results of this work should be considered by pou and pitcher filter certifiers and serve as the basis to consider alternative particle challenge conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16836,orthophosphate po4 addition is a common corrosion control treatment used to lower lead pb concentrations at the consumer s tap by forming relatively insoluble pb phosphate pb po4 minerals however some pb po4 particles that can form in drinking water are mobile nanoparticles i e 0 001 0 1 µm that have the potential to reach the tap point of use pou or pitcher filters are often used to manage risks during distribution system upsets when corrosion control treatment is not optimized or following pb service line replacements to abide by industry convention pou and pitcher filters must be nsf ansi certified for pb reduction nsf ansi 53 using a test water containing dissolved pb and large pb particles certification for particulates reduction nsf ansi 42 is done using a test water that contains particles but not leaded particles to address the lack of testing for pb nanoparticles this study challenged six certified commercially available faucet mounted pou 3 and pitcher 3 filters with aqueous suspensions of pb po4 nanoparticle for the water quality investigated the pb particles formed ranged between 0 016 and 0 098 µm based on scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis these particles represented 98 5 of total pb in suspension the total pb removals were between 44 6 and 65 1 for the pou filters and between 10 9 and 92 9 for the pitcher filters the electron microscopy results confirm that pb po4 nanoparticles passed through the filters the findings can inform future efforts to re examine the test waters

drinking water distribution systems pb sources can include service lines brasses and solders lytle et al 2019 sandvig et al 2008 appropriately certified point of use pou filters and or pitcher filters have been recommended as a mitigation measure to decrease pb exposure bosscher et al 2019 particularly in short term response to an emergency pb release event pou and pitcher filters are also distributed by many cities in the united states us including cincinnati webb 2014 denver denver water 2020 and milwaukee milwaukee health department 2020 following pb service line replacement relevant voluntary certifications associated with the reduction of pb by pou and pitcher filters in drinking water are covered under standards nsf ansi 42 and nsf ansi 53 developed by the nsf american national standards institute nsf ansi 2019a b nsf ansi 42 is the standard aimed at reducing non health related contaminants that cause aesthetic effects e g chlorine taste and odor including class i particulates 0 5 to 1 µm to be certified under nsf ansi 42 a reduction 85 must be achieved from a 10 000 particles ml solution which does not contain pb nsf ansi 2019a the relevance of this aesthetic effects standard is that pb has been associated with other particles e g iron in water trueman and gagnon 2016 therefore this certification would conceivably ensure reduction of pb containing class i particulates from water nsf ansi 53 is a health effects standard directly associated with pb reduction for pou pitcher filters certification is carried out by challenging filters with two test waters with a pb concentration of 150 µg l one at ph 6 5 with dissolved pb added as pb no3 2 and the other at ph 8 5 with both dissolved and particulate pb added at ph 8 5 at least 20 of total pb in the nsf ansi synthetic water should be fine particulate defined as particle size between 0 1 and 1 2 µm nsf ansi 2019b as of 2019 the filter must reduce the concentration of pb to 5 µg l or lower to obtain the certification nsf ansi 2019b appropriately certified pou and pitcher filters have been shown to reduce pb in drinking water and provide a pb reduction option to homeowners and utilities under field settings certified pou filters and pitcher filters were provided to residents in cities such as flint mi newark nj and university park il aqua illinois 2019 bosscher et al 2019 cdm smith 2019 lytle et al 2020b us environmental protection agency 2019 to reduce pb in drinking water following distribution system upsets in flint mi following the transition to water from the flint river federal agencies including the us environmental protection agency usepa and the department of health and human services hhs recommended the use of nsf ansi 42 53 certified pou and pitcher filters or bottled water to lower exposure to pb from drinking water bosscher et al 2019 field drinking water sampling at over 345 locations in flint mi showed that all pou filters evaluated reduced pb levels below the certification target and 97 of the filtered samples had pb concentrations below 0 5 µg l bosscher et al 2019 pitcher filters could remove 99 85 of pb from an initial concentration of 13 200 µg l pieper et al 2019 deshommes et al 2010 tested certified pou and pitcher filters in the laboratory and field conditions concluding that pou filters adequately lowered pb concentrations below 10 µg l and only occasionally exceeded this threshold most of the certified pou filters and pitcher filters tested by purchase et al 2021 successfully decreased soluble pb concentrations below nsf ansi 53 standards for certification and 3 out of the 5 filters tested reduced particulate pb to values lower than 10 µg l not all studies on pou and pitcher filters systematically assessed the form of pb soluble colloidal particulate nor did they assess the nature e g size composition mineralogy of pb colloids and particles when present system wide corrosion control to decrease exposure to pb from drinking water involves the application of corrosion control treatment to form protective relatively insoluble pb minerals over leaded materials schock 1989 orthophosphate po4 for example is added by many utilities to promote the formation in pipe scales of insoluble pb phosphate pb po4 minerals such as hydroxypyromorphite pb5 po4 3 oh chloropyromorphite pb5 po4 3 cl and tertiary pb phosphate pb3 po4 2 schock 1989 trueman et al 2018 however pb po4 compounds are also known to produce nanoparticles with high mobility tendencies if not immediately incorporated into the scale this occurs under certain water qualities e g low hardness bae et al 2020 lytle et al 2020b trueman et al 2018 furthermore nanoparticulate pb 0 001 0 1 µm could present a challenge to certified pou and pitcher filters because they are certified under nsf ansi 42 53 to reduce much larger particles 0 1 µm nsf ansi 2019a b initial pb sampling from pou and pitcher filters in newark nj homes revealed that two of three sampled filters failed to reduce pb below 10 µg l but a large follow on pou and pitcher filter testing program initiated by the city found that 97 5 of the 198 filters evaluated reduced pb 10 µg l cdm smith 2019 furthermore flushing for 5 minutes increased the percentage to 99 5 cdm smith 2019 lopez 2019 lytle et al 2020b follow up usepa sampling at four of those homes found that pb po4 nanoparticles were present in the water before and after treatment by either a pou filter or a pitcher filter lytle et al 2020b the finding albeit isolated raised concerns over filter efficacy when leaded nanoparticles are present this then raised questions about the representativeness of pb particles used in the current certification protocol to challenge pou and pitcher filters given the reliance on using pou and pitcher filters to reduce pb under some circumstances questions remain regarding their effectiveness to remove very small pb particles the objectives of this study were to 1 challenge commercially available nsf ansi 42 53 certified pou and pitcher filters with a stable pb po4 nanoparticle suspension 2 quantify the pb fractions total particulate colloidal and soluble before and after filtration 3 identify other water quality changes that occur after water passes the filters this information will help inform the drinking water industry particularly with regard to efforts to develop more robust certification testing protocols for removing pb from drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 pou and pitcher filters tested in this study pou filters refer to devices which attach to the faucet as opposed to pitcher filters which do not three certified nsf ansi 42 53 pou filters and three certified pitcher filters were evaluated table 1 the three pou devices consisted of carbon block based filters containing natural zeolite with reported lifespan between 378 and 780 l the reported filter lifespan of the three pitchers were generally lower 56 8 454 l particularly for pitcher 3 the pitcher filters all utilized activated carbon and or ion exchange resin medias all filters reported high pb reduction efficiency 98 5 99 7 and particulate class i reduction efficiency 97 99 9 for nsf ansi 53 and nsf ansi 42 respectively except for pitcher 3 which was not certified under nsf ansi 42 2 2 preparation of challenge water synthetic stable pb po4 nanoparticle challenge water was prepared daily in the laboratory based on previous work from formal et al 2021 and lytle et al 2020a table 2 which is referred to as challenge water throughout this manuscript for the preparation of the challenge water a pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension 5 mg pb l soluble pb 10 µg l ph 7 5 7 mg c l as total inorganic carbon tic po4 in excess of 3 0 mg po4 l was first prepared daily the stock solution was prepared by adding sodium bicarbonate nahco3 fisher chemical fairlawn nj adjusting the ph to 7 5 0 1 with sodium hydroxide naoh and nitric acid hno3 0 6 n fisher chemical fairlawn nj and finally adding solutions of po4 napo4 h2o fisher chemical fairlawn nj 2 263 mg po4 l and lead chloride pbcl2 acros organics morris plains nj 1 000 mg pb l to 1 l of de ionized di water the ph of the pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension was maintained at 7 5 0 1 throughout immediately after particle generation pb particle hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index were measured using a malvern zetasizer nano zs90 malvern united kingdom based on dynamic light scattering dls principles for the first ten pou filters and pitcher filters tested the 2 000 mg po4 l stock solution was made from nah2po4 fisher chemical fairlawn nj resulting in a concentration of 3 mg po4 l whereas the remaining of the tests were done at a concentration of 3 4 mg po4 l throughout the experiments po4 levels were above the stochiometric ratio required to precipitate pb po4 particles i e soluble po4 was available challenge water was prepared daily 20 l for pitcher filters and 58 l for the pou filters based on the work of lytle et al 2020a challenge water was mixed using a stir plate and magnetic stir bar at room temperature in high density polyethylene hdpe carboys the carboys were filled with di water then sodium bicarbonate and po4 stock solution were added to obtain targeted water quality table 2 the ph of the challenge water was maintained at 7 5 0 1 with naoh 0 6 n and hno3 0 6 n once ph was stable the pb po4 nanoparticle stock suspension was added to the challenge water after 30 minutes of mixing samples were drawn from the top and the bottom of the tanks and analyzed for total pb concentration to confirm suspension uniformity a hach denver co hq440d multi meter with a phc101 probe ph electrode was used to make ph measurements hach spectrophotometric method 8048 was followed for po4 measurements in the laboratory using a hach dr1900 spectrophotometer rapid screening of total pb concentration was performed using an anodic stripping voltammetry asv analyzer palintest sa1100 scanning analyzer golden co following the user manual to ensure pb concentration goals were achieved and mixing was uniform 3 challenging the filters 3 1 pou filters the laboratory pou challenge test apparatus consisted of a 60 l hdpe carboy with two ports located at the bottom fig 1 and supplementary information si figure s1 one was used for sampling during the experimental run and the other to supply challenge water to the pou filter a variable speed pump with a pressure gauge fed the water from the tank to the pou filter using 182 cm of ¼ teflon and 28 cm of ½ schedule 80 polyvinyl chloride pvc tubing the faucet used for the experiment was non metallic to avoid pb contamination sources challenge water interactions with ambient air were minimized by placing a hdpe floating lid in the tank and the ph electrode was inserted into a bored hole in the lid sampling was performed at the beginning of the experiments to assess loss of pb by adsorption to the tank or the tubing by allowing challenge water to stagnate over a 72 hour period in all the wetted parts of the experimental system no significant changes in pb characteristics or concentration of the challenge water were observed between the tank and the by pass of the pou filters a control test run was performed with the pou filter in by pass mode i e water was diverted around the filter to assess whether the relatively short plumbing distance between the tank and pou device changed the suspension properties results showed that changes in pb particle and suspension characteristics particle size shape distribution and total pb concentration of the test water as it was pumped from the tank and through the by pass of the pou filters were not observed data provided in si figures s2 and s3 also during one test run following collection of the samples from the tank and filtered by the pou samples were collected by placing the filter in by pass mode data provided in table s1 pou filters were conditioned and operated according to specific vendor supplied instructions for example pou filter housings equipped with a light indicator or a flow totalizer were operated appropriately by following instructions provided by the vendor minimum operating pressure was 20 psi and pressure readings were recorded throughout the experiments to ensure the devices were operated within specifications table s2 once the challenge water was fully mixed approximately 30 minutes the teflon and pvc tubing were flushed for at least 15 seconds in by pass mode and then the pou filter was turned to filtering mode water samples were collected from the challenge water tank and from water that passed through the pou filter at three time points at the beginning of each experiment 1 l after half of the challenge water volume 29 l had passed through the filter and when the challenge water tank was nearly empty 55 l pressure and flow rate after the pou filter unit were recorded during each sampling event lastly ph was monitored and adjusted to ph 7 5 0 1 if required experiments were repeated in triplicate 3 2 pitcher filters the pitcher filters were rinsed three times with di water prior to testing in order to remove dust from the packaging and ensure no outside contamination they were conditioned according to manufacturer instructions di water was used in cases where water had to run through the filter and be discarded before the first use or if the filter had to be soaked in water as with the pou device evaluations precautions were taken to minimize pb losses to the tank by letting challenge water stagnate during a 72 hours period in the tank once the challenge water was completely mixed in a 26 5 l hdpe carboy it was added to the reservoir of the pitcher filters and filtered by gravity samples were collected from the challenge water and the effluent of the pitcher filter at the beginning of the experiment 1 l after half the water was filtered by the pitcher filter 10 l and when the solution was almost completely used 17 l experiments were repeated in triplicate 3 3 water quality and particles analysis a series of water samples were collected during each sampling event from the challenge water and after the faucet mounted pou filter or the pitcher filter as follows 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for total metals i e pb cu zn others analysis 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for ultrafiltration 60 ml sample in polypropylene syringe for 0 2 µm filtration 60 ml glass vial for immediate bench water quality analyses ph temperature po4 fig 2 water samples collected in the middle of the challenge experiments also included 60 ml amber glass vial for total inorganic carbon tic analysis and 250 ml in hdpe wide mouth bottle for analysis of wet chemistry parameters alkalinity po4 chloride immediately upon collection the water sample designated for ultrafiltration was filtered through a 400 ml amicon stirred cell with an anodisc ultracel 30 kda ultrafiltration disc which was estimated to be approximately equivalent to 0 01 µm pore size erickson 2009 guo and santschi 2006 previous internal investigations showed that the filtration apparatus can adsorb a significant amount of soluble pb to avoid this likelihood the stirred cell was filled with 120 ml of sample and then allowed to mix for 5 minutes and then discarded before the actual sample was filtered the remaining sample was placed in the pre rinsed stir cell and pushed through the ultra filter using pressurized nitrogen 10 psi the ultrafiltrate was collected in a 60 ml hdpe bottle this sample was defined as the soluble pb fraction for the purposes of this work operationally defined as pb passing an ultrafilter fig 3 which is consistent with the work of tobiason et al 2016 particulate and colloidal pb fraction was calculated by subtracting soluble pb from total pb fig 3 samples collected in the 60 ml syringe were filtered through a 0 2 µm whatman nucleporetm track etched 13 mm syringe filter membrane the colloidal fraction 0 2 µm was calculated by subtracting the soluble fraction from the 0 2 µm filtrate fig 3 this fraction includes nanoparticles 0 01 0 1 µm nanoparticles smaller than 0 01 µm can also be present in the soluble fraction but only represents a small percentage of nanoparticles based on size definition the particulate and colloidal pb 0 2 µm was calculated by subtracting the 0 2 µm filtrate from the total pb overall the classification of total pb into four pb fractions in this work followed a different and more refined filtration approach compared to the simpler operational distinction into soluble and particulate pb as determined by a single 0 45 µm syringe filtration in method 200 8 us environmental protection agency 1994b it is also different from the nsf ansi 53 2019b definition of particulate pb as it is the difference between total pb and the 0 1 µm filtrate with fine particulate further defined as the difference between 1 2 µm filtrate and 0 1 µm filtrate as a research tool particle size fractionation by filtration is limited by the filters commercially available and a trade off between ease of use of the filters and results obtained filters chosen in this study were readily available in the laboratory ultrafilters of 30 kda 0 01 µm pore size can retain most nanoparticles defined as particles between 1 100 nm present in samples which was necessary to quantify the pb soluble and nanoparticulate fractions filters of 0 2 µm were used to identify the colloidal pb fraction 0 2 µm as they capture small colloids and a broader range of particles than 0 45 µm filters all samples for laboratory metal analysis were acidified to ph 2 for at least 16 hours and analyzed using icp aes and icp ms following usepa methods 200 7 and 200 8 us environmental protection agency 1994a us environmental protection agency 1994b po4 concentrations were analyzed using usepa method 365 1 us environmental protection agency 1993 samples collected in glass vials without airspace were analyzed for total inorganic carbon using astm d513 test method b astm international 2016 samples collected in the 60 ml clear glass vial were analyzed using bench analysis for total pb po4 ph and temperature using methods described previously presence of nanoparticles was systematically confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem for the challenge water and the filtered water for each run for solids analysis the challenge and filtered waters were prepared per lytle et al 2020b and harmon et al 2020 by placing a drop of sample water onto a tem 3 mm sample holder copper grid the tem copper grids were held in place by self closing forceps and allowed to air dry a f200x high resolution tem imaging system was used to analyze the grids the field emission gun was operating at 200 kv for all micrographs obtained and images were processed with imagej software program aluminum sample stub with double sided carbon adhesive was dabbed on the wet ultrafilter discs to collect particles for sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds particles were examined using a jem7600fe sem jeol usa inc peabody ma at 15 kv and a working distance of 8 mm an oxford x max 50 eds oxford instruments america inc concord ma and the low angle electron backscatter detector were used to identify elemental composition of the particles the eds spectra was analyzed using aztec software oxford instruments america inc concord ma size of particles was estimated based on sem and tem images using free javatm based image processing software called imagej fiji schindelin et al 2012 3 4 pou and pitcher filters material analysis while some information was provided by the filter vendors table 1 the elemental composition of the pou filters and pitcher filters media was further determined by sem eds before and after challenge water testing the devices were dismantled and sem stubs were prepared for each internal component material was examined using the sem eds mentioned in the previous section and jeol jsm 6490 lv jeol usa inc peabody ma coupled with oxford x max 50 mm2 eds oxford instruments america inc concord ma to determine composition to better understand the pb removal mechanisms for pitcher 3 a new filter was dismantled and filter material was separated into 5 ml of resin and 5 ml of carbon based material each of these separated materials was placed in a 20 ml 12 cm x 15 mm polypropylene tube bio rad laboratories hercules ca figure s4 challenge water was gravity fed to each tube for 6 hours a sem stub was prepared for each filter material and allowed to air dry sem eds instruments detailed previously were used to analyze filtering material and determine pb adsorption sites 3 5 statistical analysis non parametric statistical analyses kruskal wallis anova were performed in statistica version 13 tibco software palo alto ca differences were considered significant if p 0 05 unless stated otherwise figures were generated in sigmaplot version 14 5 systat software san jose ca 4 results and discussion 4 1 pb po4 stock solution pb po4 stock solution was prepared daily with an average standard deviation ph of 7 49 0 04 and total and soluble pb concentrations of 5 283 260 µg l and 4 3 10 4 µg l respectively during all pou and pitcher filter tests n 12 stock solutions the particulate and colloidal pb fraction averaged 99 9 of the total pb based on ultrafiltration fig 3 total and soluble po4 concentrations were 5 2 and 4 0 mg po4 l respectively pb particle size based on dynamic light scattering dls measurements averaged 0 083 0 016 µm from dynamic light scattering analysis the average polydispersity index of the stock solution was 0 16 and ranged from 0 05 to 0 39 signifying low sample heterogeneity sem and tem characterization revealed that the particles were hexagonal in shape fig 4 and xrd analysis of the nanoparticles identified the particles as hydroxypyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh which is consistent with previous work lytle et al 2020a tem particle image analysis resulted in an average diameter of 0 038 0 016 µm and sizes ranging between 0 017 and 0 095 µm based on the different size analysis methods average size of the particles differed as there are intrinsic variations in how the measurements are carried out for example light scattering methodologies can be biased by particle clustering as dynamic light scattering measures brownian motion and clustering is likely to prevent particles from following brownian motion despite variability in particle size methods dynamic light scattering sem and tem all approaches concluded that pb po4 nanoparticles i e 0 100 µm were suspended in the stock solution comparison between particle sizes measured by dynamic light scattering xrd sem and tem is presented in lytle et al 2020a for the same stock solution similarly nanoparticles were larger when measured using dynamic light scattering than sem tem which is attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in contrast in the nsf ansi 53 test water at ph 8 5 particles were 5 orders of magnitude larger than the nanoparticles present in the pb po4 stock suspension fig 5 based on the chemistry of the nsf ansi 53 prepared challenge water pb carbonates were most likely to be formed pb carbonate particles formed in water have been reported to be much larger than the pb po4 nanoparticles particles reported here korshin et al 2005 noel et al 2014 4 2 pou filters 4 2 1 challenge water characteristics pb size fractionation concentrations based on filtrations total particulate and colloidal 0 2µm colloidal 0 2 µm and soluble pb for the challenge water prior to filtration by pou filters are presented in fig 6 the average total and soluble pb concentration of all pou filter challenge waters was 100 1 3 6 and 1 1 0 3 µg l respectively and was statistically similar across all experiments the average particulate and colloidal pb concentration of the challenge waters was 99 2 3 8 µg l 98 9 of total pb of the particulate and colloidal pb fraction 53 7 20 4 µg l 53 5 was colloidal 0 2 µm and the remaining was particulate and colloidal 0 2 µm in size based on filtrations the pb present in the challenge water was therefore primarily in the particulate and colloidal forms and specifically colloidal 0 2 µm form which was consistent with the properties of the stock pb po4 solution fig 4 the presence of nanoparticles in the challenge water was confirmed by sem and tem analysis fig 7 challenge water samples were collected throughout the experiment and showed that the suspension remained stable over the course of the experiment table s3 lytle et al 2020a demonstrated that this challenge water remained stable over a 24 hour period a control test run was performed to demonstrate that pumping challenge water through plumbing between the tank and pou filter did not change the characteristics of the challenge water suspension specifically no pb concentration losses were observed between the tank and the pou filter figure s2 visual agreement of size and shape of pb particles obtained using the sem combined with eds for elemental composition determination figure s3 between tank and by pass water further confirmed that the test apparatus leading to the pou filters did not alter the properties of the nanoparticles figure s3 pb variability in the challenge water particulate and colloidal pb 0 2 µm as well as colloidal pb 0 2 µm was greater than it was for the particulate fraction more variations in the pb concentrations were observed for the samples filtered on 0 2 µm 49 2 21 4 µg l than for the samples which were ultra filtered 1 6 1 9 µg l the variability does not necessarily suggest that pb particle suspensions are difficult to consistently produce indeed sem and tem imaging confirmed the similarity in shape and size of nanoparticles generated in this study rather it more likely illustrates the inherent limitations of using filters to fractionate particles for instance voids in the 0 2 µm filters are not homogenous in size distribution nor do they have a nominal pore size of 0 2 µm but instead are constructed of etched pores figure s5 as pb particles are pushed through the filter using a syringe they can agglomerate particle particle interaction and or attach to the filter which can prevent them from passing despite a particle size smaller than 0 2 µm filtration results can also be influenced by the operator of the syringe filter with varying pressure applied on the syringe and rate of filtration the size of pb particles in the challenge water in the tank could not be reliably measured with dynamic light scattering because the concentration was too low target concentration of 100 µg l for an accurate determination determination of particle size by dynamic light scattering method could only be performed on the pb po4 stock solution target concentration of 5 000 µg l challenge water suspensions of 100 µg l were too dilute to reliably determine lead particle sizes by dynamic light scattering for small particles concentration must be sufficient to scatter the light as the scattering intensity is proportional to the radius of the particles hassan et al 2015 shaw 2014 stetefeld et al 2016 however sem and tem images and eds analyses of particles suspended in the challenge water showed that the size and shape of pb po4 nanoparticles were consistent and uniform with the stock suspensions figs 4 and 7 specifically the particles were hexagonal in shape and individually very small with most considered to be nanoparticles falling between 0 05 0 1 µm in size and all appeared to be smaller than 0 2 µm there were larger clusters of pb particle agglomerations that if present in the water i e not formed as an artifact of sample preparation could be removed through a 0 2 µm filter these observations were consistent across all runs supporting the conclusion that variability in fractionation results can be attributed to filtration artifacts the sem tem findings were an important confirmation that consistent water quality and pb suspension properties were achieved in all tests pb nanoparticle filter challenge water suspensions were generated in the laboratory according to previously reported procedures formal et al 2021 lytle et al 2020a and greatly differed from pb particles formed according to nsf ansi 53 used to certify pou filters for pb reduction nsf ansi 2019a b specifically the challenge water contained pb po4 nanoparticles as compared to relatively large pb carbonate particles generated under the nsf ansi 53 protocol figs 4 and 5 although laboratory generated the pb nanoparticles in this study closely resembled particles previously identified in one community s drinking water lytle et al 2020b and those mineralogically predicted for a po4 treated system schock 1989 trueman et al 2018 asv analyzer pb measurements performed at the time of sample collection were compared to corresponding results determined by icp ms aes figure s6 asv analyzer pb results agreed well with icp ms aes measurements slope of 1 08 and an r2 of 0 918 discrepancies between the methods tended to increase as pb concentration increased pb in the challenge water was well characterized by the asv analyzer in agreement with some previous studies doré et al 2020 4 3 performance of pou filters for pb po4 particles reduction none of the tested pou filters reduced total pb concentration below 10 µg l results were compared to a concentration of 10 µg l the nsf ansi 53 pb certification threshold at the time of this study since completion of the study the nsf ansi 53 certification threshold has been lowered to 5 µg l nsf ansi 2019b after filtration by the pou filters mean total pb concentrations ranged between 34 3 56 4 µg l with a maximum concentration of 88 4 µg l for pou 3 and are not statistically different fig 6 these concentrations are much greater than the previous and current pb certification thresholds under nsf ansi 53 for reference although a different test water than the current study that includes a 50 higher pb concentration was used the pb reductions achieved by the filters when using the pb po4 challenge water were strikingly lower 44 6 65 1 than the reported 99 pb particle reduction under the nsf ansi 53 certification protocol table 1 the removal of pb fractions differed among the pou filters despite variability in the 0 2 µm filtrate as previously noted pou 1 filtered out most of the particulate and colloidal fraction 66 4 followed by pou 2 56 5 particulate and colloidal pb reduction and pou 3 46 4 particulate and colloidal pb reduction the pou filters did not decrease the already low concentration of soluble pb present in the challenge water in general although the filters were not operated until recommended lifespan the concentration of pb passing the pou filters did not substantially change with increasing volume of water volume treated table s3 especially when considering filtration variabilities removal efficiency did not improve over the course of the experiments table s3 as might be observed if retained particles blocked filter pore voids with time since a fraction of the pb nanoparticles was trapped in the filters there was possibility that with time or longer testing pb nanoparticle reduction efficiency would have improved as void spaces decreased it is likely due to the filters were not run to their rated capacities after filtering 58 l of challenge water specifically the three pou filters were only operated to 7 5 15 1 of their reported filter capacities table 1 however a rather notable change was observed for pou 3 between the beginning of the experiment 1l filtered where on average 64 9 µg l remained in the filtered water versus 51 1 53 µg l at the middle end 29 55 l filtered of the experiment table s3 colloidal pb 0 2 µm concentrations were the lowest at the end of the experiment for this filter the primary nanoparticle removal mechanism by porous activated carbon block filters the main component of all but one of the devices evaluated in this work is to physically retain pb containing particles in the low void volumes between the carbon particles kuennen et al 1992 reed and arunachalam 1994 the pore size of solid carbon block filters ranges between 0 5 1 µm 500 1000 nm us environmental protection agency 2006 although being porous the pores are small enough to restrict relatively large pb particles e g nsf ansi 53 generated pb particles from passing however dispersed pb nanoparticles can pass through as demonstrated in this work specifically a large fraction of pb po4 nanoparticles ranging between 17 95 nm passed through certified pou filters sem images confirmed that nanoparticles passed through all of the pou filters figs 7 8 the nanoparticles were identical to those of the challenge water for all pou filters tested flow rates were generally slightly lower at the beginning of each experiment presumably as voids within the filters were cleared of additional fines from filter production or trapped air table s2 there was variability in the flow rates between test runs pressure remained stable within and between triplicate experimental runs except for the second replicate run of pou 3 which experienced more variable pressure for an unexplained reason table s2 the experimental apparatus was not designed to simultaneously fine tune flow rates and pressure the apparatus was able to maintain flow and pressure within manufacturers specifications which was the goal the differences in removal of the different pb fractions could be attributed to the different composition and construction of the pou filters all pou filters tested were dominantly composed of carbon blocks but analysis by sem tem revealed that the composition of the pou filter media differed table s4 differences in results could also be explained by different flow rates table s2 and pressures during operation as well as different structure of the filter media and the housing table 1 faucet mounted filters were made of solid block activated carbon which contains small activated carbon particles fused with ion exchange or sorption media which is responsible for metals removal deshommes et al 2010 4 4 pitcher filters 4 4 1 challenge water characteristics characteristics of the water used to challenge pitcher filters were consistent with waters used to challenge pou filters the total pb concentration in challenge water prepared to test the pou filters averaged 101 9 7 8 µg l and was statistically similar fig 9 soluble pb concentration only available for pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 averaged 2 1 2 5 µg l 1 9 of total pb total particulate and colloidal pb concentration averaged 99 9 6 2 µg l 98 1 of total pb and colloidal pb 0 2 µm concentration was 43 3 22 3 µg l 43 4 of total pb average size of particles measured by dynamic light scattering was 0 083 0 016 µm as measured in the pb po4 stock solution over the course of the experiment the characteristics of the challenge water remained stable notable pb fraction differences in challenge water were not observed after up to 8 hours stability of the challenge water was in agreement with the work of lytle et al 2020a 4 4 2 performance of pitcher filters for pb particles reduction pitcher 3 was the only filter to consistently decrease concentrations below 10 µg l but it was not able to meet the new 5 µg l certification target the total mean pb concentration in the challenge water of 105 3 9 6 µg l fig 9c was reduced to 7 5 1 5 µg l which is significantly lower than filtered water from pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 the percentage reduction in total pb obtained using the challenge water was slightly lower than the vendor reduction claims based on nsf ansi 53 test conditions table 1 nearly all of the pb that passed the pitcher filter 7 0 1 3 µg l was retained on a 0 2 µm filter in contrast 31 6 of total pb in the challenge water was retained on a 0 2 µm filter and this fraction increased by over 3 fold to 94 4 after filtration by the pitcher filter pitcher 3 removed a consistent amount of pb through the entire challenge test table s3 as the reduction efficiency of the filter to remove pb remained consistent with volume of water treated the pitcher reached 35 2 of the reported treated water volume capacity whereas pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 only treated 13 2 and 4 4 of its reported capacity respectively similar to the pou filters pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 failed to decrease pb concentrations of the challenge water to levels even close to 10 µg l allowing pb nanoparticles to easily pass fig 8 after filtration by the pitcher filters mean total pb concentration was 83 1 18 5 19 3 reduction and 88 2 6 4 µg l 10 9 reduction for pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 respectively results obtained by pitcher 1 and pitcher 2 are statistically similar for total pb a perplexing increase in soluble pb was observed in water filtered by pitcher 1 which cannot conceptually be explained by the slight ph increase through that filter differences in the make up materials and structure of the pitcher filters likely explain pb reduction efficiency differences and the changes observed in the pb fractions following filtration tables 1 and s4 pitcher 1 was made of an ion exchange resin mixed with activated carbon whereas pitcher 2 was largely made of activated carbon and a fibrous matrix to hold the media in place pitcher 3 was the most complex made of a layer of granular activated carbon followed by dual ion exchange resin the materials present in the tested pitcher filters were more diverse than in the faucet pous with organic resin present in 2 of the 3 units different forms and amounts of activated carbon were present in the units either as loose material in the casing of the filter or embedded in a membrane to understand pb removal mechanisms associated with pitcher 3 a new filter unit was dissected the two different media carbon based material and dual cation anion exchange resin were then separated to perform additional capacity challenge testing on each media component independently this simple experiment was not intended to replicate the earlier pitcher filter experiments but rather to understand where pb was retained by the pitcher 3 filter in a preliminary way because the filter s two media were separated pb reduction efficiency was expected to be different than when testing an intact filter also a small amount of media 5 ml was used in this test compared to an intact filter as only 35 of the capacity of the filter was reached at the end of a normal experiment in the laboratory the goal here was to exhaust the filtering material to understand the role of each media in removing pb from the challenge water specifically filtered total pb concentration increased from 56 1 µg l at the beginning of the experiment to 99 7 µg l at the end from a challenge water with a pb concentration of 106 0 µg l water was filtered until no pb reduction could be observed based on bench analysis asv analyzer of pb concentrations the carbon fraction of the filter media removed 17 3 µg l of pb at the beginning of the experiment compared to 49 9 µg l by the resin suggesting that pb reduction by pitcher 3 was mostly achieved by the resin portion of the media additionally sem images coupled with eds demonstrated that pb was removed from the water by the dual resin and that pb was bound mostly to one of the resins figure s7 indeed pb was observed on one type of resin beads whereas on the other type pb could not be observed this investigation was preliminary in nature and the results suggest a more detailed study is warranted 4 5 other water quality parameters the ph of challenge waters increased after passing through all pou filters from mean ph values of 7 5 0 03 fig 10 to between 8 6 and 9 8 with the highest ph measured for pou 2 at the beginning of the experiment but differences are not statistically significant table s3 fig 10 for pou filters initial ph was also higher than measurements conducted in the middle or end of the experiment since ph was decreasing as increasing volumes of water were filtered for the pitcher filters mean ph varied between 6 8 and 7 9 which is significantly lower than for the pou filters with the lowest value measured in pitcher 3 the different changes in ph observed between water filtered by the pou and pitcher filters is attributed to the different filtering media table 1 the filtering media of the pitcher filters consisted of activated carbon and or ion exchange resin whereas the point of use filters mainly consisted of solid block activated carbon impregnated with natural zeolite resin the decrease in ph observed through pitcher 3 was attributed to bicarbonate ions being removed through the anion exchange resin in the mixed ion exchange resin bed crone et al 2019 carrière et al 2011 bauman and eichhorn 1947 however caution should be exercised when evaluating ph measurements in low conductivity samples which would be the case for challenge water filtered by pitcher 3 for pitcher 3 soluble pb concentrations could not be obtained due to contamination of the samples from the stir cell of the ultrafilter filtering the challenge water by pitcher 3 dropped the ph to between 6 6 and 7 1 mean 6 8 in the filtrate investigations showed that presumably adsorbed pb was released from the stir cell at ph below 7 preliminary testing showed a release of the pb adsorbed in the stir cell of the ultrafilter when ph is below 7 of the devices tested pitcher 3 was the only one that decreased the ph of the challenge water whereas the other pous increased the ph of the filtered water fig 10 initially the drop in ph to 6 8 was thought to be associated with the pitcher s ability to remove pb by dissolving pb po4 particle schock et al 1996 within the filter and subsequent removal of dissolved pb one of the pb removal mechanisms of pb in granular activated carbon is by adsorption of free metal ions kuennen et al 1992 which would increase as the ph of the solution decreases a follow up test with pou 1 at ph 6 5 did not affect the performance of pou 1 with similar pb concentrations of 34 3 µg l and 33 7 µg l respectively thus the reduction of pb by pitcher 3 cannot solely be explained by the drop in ph of the bulk water passing challenge water through the pou and pitcher filters increased the concentration of several inorganic elements most notably fe mg s and zn which were observed in the virgin filter media table s4 all filters increased the effluent water fe concentration with pitcher 1 yielding the highest mean concentration 0 129 0 243 mg l vs 0 015 0 020 mg l for the challenge water mg and s concentrations were only increased by the faucet mounted pous with the highest mean concentrations for pou 3 0 065 0 059 mg mg l vs 0 007 0 003 mg mg l for the challenge water increases in fe mg s and zn are explained by the presence of trace contaminants on the filter media presumably associated with the product manufacturing process concentrations of p remained stable with slight increases decreases for the pou filters tested except for pitcher 3 4 6 implications although this work demonstrated a limitation of certified pou and pitcher filters to effectively reduce pb nanoparticles the conditions under which such particles may be present likely represent an extreme case the effectiveness of faucet mounted pou filters and pitcher filters to reduce pb in drinking water and provide protection until pb sources are removed has been demonstrated by others bosscher et al 2019 pieper et al 2019 purchase et al 2021 deshommes et al 2010 this work demonstrated pb nanoparticles can pass through pou and pitcher filters certified to remove particulate pb but the findings were not necessarily unexpected certification test water pb particles are much less challenging to remove due to their relatively large size and their behavior does not reflect that of much smaller pb nanoparticles which are fine enough to pass through the pores of carbon based filter blocks secondly the pb particulate challenge condition in this work likely represents an extreme case where very small homogenously dispersed pb nanoparticles were present in a relatively simple aqueous background chemistry despite being an extreme challenge the filters still managed to reduce pb by 10 9 92 9 the outcome of this work was consistent with filter effectiveness concerns initially raised in newark where similar appearing pb po4 nanoparticles were reported to have passed pou and pitcher filters cdm smith 2019 lytle et al 2020b and together clearly raises the need to perform future work in two areas first pou and pitcher filter certifiers should consider exploring alternative pb particle test suspensions that are more representative of the greater challenging particles pb particles come in many shapes and sizes the latter clearly being important to filter performance lytle et al 2020a detailed a recipe for producing stable pb po4 nanoparticles as a potential starting point for identifying a more challenging case an outcome may be that filter manufacturers consider reevaluating filter designs secondly there needs to be a broader and regular examination of the nature of pb particles formed in drinking water systems and isolated from consumer s tap water there is very little information available on the subject the nature of the pb particles should be related to pb source scale properties water quality corrosion control practices and other considerations to establish a better understanding of conditions that might produce pb nanoparticles improvements in sampling strategies protocols and analysis techniques should also be considered 5 conclusion in this study appropriately certified pou and pitcher filters for pb reduction in water reduced pb in pb po4 particle challenge suspensions containing 98 5 particulate and colloidal pb but to nowhere near the nsf ansi certification target of 10 µg l at the time of the study with the exception of one pitcher filter on average 45 of the total pb approximately 100 µg l passed through the pou and pitcher filters and the passing pb was in the particulate and colloidal form dominantly nanoparticles the findings are not necessarily surprising given that pb particles produced under the nsf ansi protocol are relatively large 700 1800 nm pb carbonate particles that would not pose the same filterability challenge although this work was not performed under nsf ansi certification protocols all filters were operated within manufacture provided specifications and baseline water quality fell within the bounds of drinking water supplies of the pitcher filters tested only pitcher 3 decreased total pb concentrations below 10 µg l but not below 5 µg l average of 7 5 µg l which appeared to be tied to attraction between the ion exchange resin and pb po4 nanoparticles given the results of this study showing that small pb po4 particles similar to those reported to be present in some community water distribution systems lytle et al 2020b passed filters there is an obvious need to better understand what drinking water quality conditions and mechanisms promote the formation and mobility of such particles in drinking water systems such an understanding will help target locations where additional pb sampling may be considered and filter device effectiveness explored lastly the results of this work should be considered by pou and pitcher filter certifiers and serve as the basis to consider alternative particle challenge conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16837,changes in global rainfall patterns and construction of artificial dams have led to widespread alteration of hydrological processes in riparian ecosystems at the same time many riparian ecosystems such as those associated with the yangtze are being subjected to enhanced inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p due to intensified agricultural activity in surrounding uplands together these environmental changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gasses ghgs fluxes from riparian soils we conducted an in situ experiment combined with quantitative pcr approach qpcr to elucidate the effects of hydrological alterations continuous flooding cf periodic flooding pf and no flooding nf and nutrient addition n addition urea 100 kg n ha 1 y 1 p addition p2o5 20 kg ha 1y 1 n p addition and control ck on three major ghgs including carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms our results showed that hydrological alterations greatly affected ghgs emissions possibly by altering soil moisture soil organic c and c n ratios the cf with higher soil moisture and lower c n ratio increased ch4 emissions 13 fold and reduced co2 and n2o emissions by 37 3 and 72 2 averaged over the growing seasons compared with no flooding pf enhanced ch4 emissions 5 7 fold and decreased n2o emissions by 69 0 in comparison with no flooding nutrient additions had no significant effect on co2 or ch4 flux but p addition significantly lowered n2o flux interactions between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions were not detected for any ghgs as a result hydrological alterations and nutrient additions affected the global warming potential gwp of growing season ghg budgets on a 100 year time horizon mainly by changing the co2 emissions cf reduced gwp from 597 to 439 g co2 eq m 2 and n p addition enhanced gwp from 489 to 625 g co2 eq m 2 the qpcr analysis revealed that decreased ch4 oxidation potential may lead to the enrichment of ch4 emissions under the hydrological alterations and reduced nitrification and denitrification potential contributed to the reduction of n2o fluxes under all the treatments our study indicates that continuous flooding could curb the contribution of riparian ghgs fluxes to global warming but that the combination of n and p additions may increase the greenhouse effect mainly by regulating the co2 emissions of growing season in riparian ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gasses hydrological alteration nitrogen addition phosphorus addition riparian zone three gorges reservoir 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are the three most important greenhouse gasses ghgs contributing to the greenhouse effect ipcc 2013 riparian zones are hot spots for ghgs emissions and remain one of the main uncertainties in global ghgs budgets schmidt et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in riparian ecosystems hydrological alteration and soil eutrophication induced by intensified anthropogenic activities could influence the flux of ghgs by altering the cycling of nitrogen and carbon zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 recently increasing attention has been paid to the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on the biogeochemical processes and soil microbial communities in riparian zones ye et al 2017 welsh et al 2019 pisani et al 2020 however it remains unclear how ghgs emissions and their net climate impact respond to both the hydrological alterations and nutrient addition in riparian zone petrescu et al 2015 garnier et al 2018 helton et al 2019 hydrological alteration plays an important role in regulating riparian ghgs fluxes by altering the aerobic anaerobic condition redox potential soil moisture content soil organic carbon and soil c n ratios dinsmore et al al 2009 jiang et al 2017 poblador et al 2017 although several studies have investigated the responses of ghgs flux to drying and rewetting cycles the mechanisms of how hydrological alterations affect ghgs emissions and ghgs budget in riparian ecosystem remain poorly understood likewise soil eutrophication due to inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p is another key factor directly linked to the ghgs emissions in riparian zones because n and p influence microbial activity soil organic carbon available nitrogen and vegetation structure tang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 van paassen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless little is known about the mechanisms of how n and p additions affect ghgs emissions under the conditions of the hydrological alterations in riparian ecosystems despite several studies into the effects of n and or p addition on ghgs emissions emissions of ghg from riparian soils are largely driven by soil microbial activities associated with c and n cycling canfield et al 2010 kuypers et al 2018 jansson and hofmockel 2020 stein 2020 soler jofra et al 2021 thus focusing on soil microbial functional gene abundance can give insight into the microbiological patterns and processes that underpin shifts in riparian soil ghg emission in response to altered hydrology and soil eutrophication in particular quantitative pcr qpcr can be used to investigate the links between the abundance of functional genes and net ch4 or n2o emissions for the functional genes related to ch4 mcra and pmoa genes were molecular markers for methanogens and methanotrophs which linked to ch4 production and consumption respectively le mer and roger 2001 lueders et al 2001 as for n2o both nitrification and denitrification processes can produce n2o canfield et al 2010 the nitrification potential is decided by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob which possess the amoa gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase wang et al 2017 xia et al 2019 the denitrification process is detected by narg nirk and nirs genes which dominated the nitrate and nitrite reductase yue et al 2015 kuypers et al 2018 since the completion of the three gorges dam in 2008 human induced off season water level fluctuations which are 175 m in winter and 145 m in summer above sea level have formed a water level fluctuation zone with a total area of 349 square kilometers bao et al 2015 over the past twelve years n and p inputs have been increased dramatically by human activities especially agricultural fertilization around the three gorges reservoir tgr gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus the water level fluctuation zone is an ideal place to investigate the response of ghg emissions to simultaneous hydrological alteration and soil nutrient enrichment the aim of this study was to explore how and by what mechanisms ghgs emissions respond to hydrological alterations together with n and p additions induced by intensified human activities in riparian ecosystem considering previous studies of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions we predicted that 1 continuous flooding and periodic flooding would increase the ch4 emission and decrease the n2o and co2 emissions by regulating n availability and creating anaerobic condition 2 nutrient additions could enhance ghgs emissions by increased n or p substrate which may stimulate the microbial activity 3 there are interactive effects between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions this study established a novel in situ experiment to investigate how riparian soil ghgs emissions respond to hydrological changes and n and p additions moreover qpcr was used to evaluate the potential roles of ch4 production oxidation nitrification and denitrification in the altered patterns of ghg emission under our experimental treatments in addition we evaluated the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on the global warming potential gwp on a 100 year horizon of three main ghgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design this study was conducted at zhongxian revegetation station 30 26 n 108 11 e located at the tgr chongqing china ye et al 2012 fig 1 this area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 16 5 19 c and annual mean precipitation ranging from 886 to 1614 mm ye et al 2015 80 of precipitation occurs between april to october mep 2014 our study area is located in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr where water levels fluctuate from 175 m a s l in winter to 145 m a s l in summer the duration of seasonal flooding differs according to elevation i e 145 155 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 286 days per year on average 155 165 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 237 days per year and 165 175 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 169 days per year ye et al 2020 the dominant species of our study site included perennials such as cynodon dactylon annual plants such as physalis minima polygonum hydropiper xanthium strumarium and echinochloa crusgalli and a few invasive species such as alternanthera philoxeroides to investigate the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions i e n and p on ghgs emissions in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr the prescribed hydrological alterations and n and p additions experiments were established at nine 15 3 m blocks along the elevation gradient 145 155 m low elevation le 155 165 m middle elevation me and 165 175 m high elevation he with a split plot design at the end of may 2019 each block was divided into three sub blocks which were set for hydrological alteration treatments including continuous flooding cf flooding water pumped from the river maintained at 5 cm above the soil surface periodic flooding pf three days of submergence at 5 cm above the soil surface followed by three days of well drained condition and no flooding nf no supernumerary water added to the plots each sub block was divided into four 1 3 m plots in each plot a pair of pvc tubes with 31 cm inner diameters and 60 cm high were inserted 50 cm deep into the ground thus 108 pairs of pvc tubes were established in total fig s1 to avoid interference between different treatments approximately 0 5 m and 2 m buffer zones were set between the neighboring plots and sub blocks respectively nutrient additions were operated on each pvc tube of each plot the nutrient additions experiment sets up four treatments with three replicates including n addition urea 100 kg n ha 1 y 1 p p2o5 20 kg ha 1y 1 n p addition and control ck nutrient additions were divided into three portions and applied monthly during the growing seasons from june to august to avoid the interference of sampling one of the paired pvc tubes in each plot was used for soil and root biomass sampling and the other was used for gas sampling 2 2 ghgs fluxes measurements ghgs fluxes co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured by using static opaque chamber and gas chromatography parkinson 1981 crill et al 1988 the chambers were 34 8 cm diameter and 50 cm high sealed on the top where a hose with a valve was set to connect the inside of the chamber a fan was installed in each chamber for mixing the air during sampling and a thermometer was set in the chamber for measuring atmospheric temperature gas samples were collected by plastic syringes from the chamber at 10 min intervals over 30 min samples were stored in gas sampling bags hede tech co china and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography perkinelmer 580 penkinelmer co usa within 24 h the gas chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd to analyze the ch4 fid co2 fid and n2o ecd ghgs fluxes were determined by the slopes of linear regressions for the ghgs concentration and sampling time from 0 min to 30 min the coefficients of determination r2 of the linear regressions were sometimes low for n2o 0 5 to avoid a bias from omitting low fluxes we keep those values when co2 and ch4 concentrations had a good linear trend with time dijkstra et al 2013 wang et al 2017 gas sampling was conducted twice or thrice per month between 8 00 and 12 00 am local time on sunny days for all treatments from early june to late august in 2019 gwp daily ghgs fluxes were represented by the fluxes measured between 8 00 to 12 00 am the seasonal cumulative ghgs fluxes were calculated according to wang et al 2017 by multiplying the average daily fluxes of two adjacent sampling dates by the time interval then summing the fluxes of all the time intervals according to the ipcc 2013 and kyoto protocol the gwp in g co2 eq m 2 on a 100 year time horizon of growing season was calculated by summing up seasonal cumulative co2 g co2 m 2 multiplied by 1 seasonal cumulative ch4 in g ch4 m 2 multiplied by 28 and seasonal cumulative n2o in mg n2o m 2 multiplied by 265 10 3 it should be noted that the co2 fluxes did not include the uptake of co2 by photosynthesis so the gwp of growing season budget would be overestimated 2 3 aboveground net primary production anpp root biomass and root properties in mid august two plots 0 5 0 5 m were selected from each sub block which can represent the average vegetation growth for each hydrological alteration treatments then the above ground biomass was harvested dried and weighed this biomass was used to estimated aboveground net primary production anpp because the aboveground plant biomass was highest in mid august in this area ye et al 2020 plant richness was calculated as the number of plant species in plots two soil cores with 5 cm diameter were collected from 0 to 20 cm soil layer under each treatment then roots were picked out manually and washed by double distilled water all root samples were dried 70 c 48 h and weighted ye et al 2012 root c and n were analyzed by stable isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo germany 2 4 soil sampling and analyses at the beginning of each month from june to august soil samples were collected from 0 to 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel corer after litter horizons were removed in all plots n 108 on each sampling occasion all soil samples were sieved by 2 mm mesh to remove plant root and stones and stored at 80 c before dna extraction and soil physicochemical analyses topsoil 0 10 cm was used for molecular analysis due to its expected sensitivity to the hydrological alterations and nutrient additions soil moisture were determined gravimetrically after drying 20 g of fresh soils at 105 c for 24 h soil ph was analyzed by using a ph meter phs 25 inesa scientific instrument co china in a mixture of air dried soil and water soil water 1 2 5 by weight the concentration of ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n were analyzed by extracting 10 g fresh soil with 50 ml of 2 mol l kcl solution and performing a colorimetric analysis with filtered kcl extractant by using automatic chemical analyzer easychem plus systea italy ma et al 2020 the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by extracting 10 g fresh soil with 50 ml of deionized water filtering 0 45 μm waterman and analyzed with toc analyzer vario toc cube hanau germany jones and willett 2006 the concentration of soil total carbon stc total nitrogen stn and soil organic carbon soc was analyzed by stable isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo germany with air dried and sieved 165 μm soil samples 2 5 surface water sampling and analyses surface water samples were collected from continuous flooding and periodic flooding treatments with 100 ml syringe to determine water quality parameters water samples for nh4 no3 and no2 analyses were filtered with membrane filter paper 0 45 μm waterman and analyzed using an automatic chemical analyzer easychem plus systea italy ma et al 2020 total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined with a toc analyzer vario toc cube hanau germany and an icp oes optima 8000dv penkinelmer co usa respectively surface water ph was detected by ph meter phs 25 inesa scientific instrument co china 2 6 quantification the abundance of functional genes microbial dna was extracted from topsoil 0 10 cm layer at the end of the experiment by using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobo laboratories ca usa following the manufacturer s instructions seven functional genes amoa arch amoa narg nirk nirs mcra and pmoa that code for the key enzymes in the processes of nitrification and denitrification ch4 production and oxidation were amplified the primers and qpcr conditions are listed in table s7 of the supporting information the qpcr assay was conducted using an cfx96 instrument biorad usa the 15 μl reaction mixture consisted of 7 5 ul of sybr green mix 2 0 7 ul of forward and reverse primers each 10 um and 1 ul of soil dna template standard curves were obtained from serial plasmid with known concentration which contained target genes each sample was analyzed for three replicates melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each qpcr to confirm the amplification specificities 2 7 data analysis repeated measures analysis of variance was used to detect the effect of the main factors e g elevation hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs fluxes with elevation hydrological alterations and nutrient additions as between subject factors and sampling time as a within subject factor including interactions tukey s hsd post hoc test with bonferroni adjustment was used to evaluate the differences in ghgs emissions vegetation traits water qualities soil properties and abundances of functional genes among treatments pearson correlation was performed to investigate the relationships between ghgs fluxes and soil properties and abundance of functional genes across all the sampling times all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 26 0 for windows and the corrplot and psych packages in r 3 5 2 3 results 3 1 vegetation characteristics over the three months of in situ experiment hydrological alterations had no significant effect on anpp table s2 but decreased the plant richness and plant cover with lower values in cf plots table s2 the anpp decreased along the elevation gradients with the highest value of 542 06 72 16 g m 2 at low elevation while plant richness increased from low elevation to high elevation table s2 plant richness and plant cover were similar among different nutrient addition treatments table s2 in general root biomass was not affected by hydrological alterations or nutrient additions while root n and root c n ratios were affected by hydrological alterations table s2 cf and pf treatments significantly enhanced root n by 28 7 and 13 4 respectively compared to nf treatments across all the nutrient addition treatments table s2 besides cf significantly decreased root c n ratio by 19 3 in comparison with nf plots nutrient additions did not affect root c n or c n ratio table s2 3 2 soil properties the background values of soil properties for each plot were homogeneous among different hydrological alterations treatments or nutrient additions plots table s3 soil ph soil moisture stc soc stn and soil c n ratio all decreased from low elevation to high elevation while doc increased from low elevation to high elevation table s3 after the three month in situ experiment hydrological alterations significantly increased soil moisture but reduced soc and soil c n ratio compared to the nf fig 5 nutrient additions reduced soc in the topsoil 0 10 cm fig 5c 3 3 greenhouse gasses co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes overall co2 ch4 and n2o emissions were similar across the elevation gradient table 1 no significant interaction between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions was observed for ghgs emissions table 1 seasonal co2 flux dynamics were observed p 0 001 table 1 and co2 release peaked on days 41 and 71 fig 2 hydrological alterations significantly affected co2 emissions cf reduced the average co2 flux by 37 3 compared to nf while pf had little effect on co2 emissions fig 3 d neither n nor p addition affected co2 releases whereas n p addition enhanced the average rate of co2 emission by 24 0 in comparison with the control plots fig 3d p 0 351 seasonal ch4 flux dynamics were detected p 0 001 table 1 and the highest value appeared on day 80 day under the cf treatment fig 2d compared with nf plots cf and pf substantially stimulated ch4 fluxes by 13 3 times p 0 001 and 5 7 times p 0 098 respectively fig 3e nutrient additions had no significant effect on ch4 emissions table 1 although there were higher values under n p addition treatments compared to the control plots fig 3b e in addition there were ch4 emission peaks after each time of nutrient additions fig 2 seasonal n2o flux dynamics were observed p 0 01 table 1 with the highest value on day 11 of the experimental period fig 2 hydrological alterations significantly reduced n2o emissions in comparison with nf plots cf and pf across different nutrient additions decreased the n2o fluxes by 72 2 p 0 046 and 69 0 p 0 061 respectively fig 3f the addition of p significantly stimulated the absorptions of n2o under the cf treatment 134 48 μg n2o m 2 h 1 and pf plots 111 44 μg n2o m 2 h 1 at 11 days fig 2g h 3 4 global warming potential gwp the gwp of the growing season ghg budget was 462 20 47 44 g co2 eq m 2 for the control within no flooding plots fig 4 a in general hydrological alterations significantly affected the gwp with a reduction of 157 80 41 24 g co2 eq m 2 under cf treatment mainly by decreasing co2 fluxes fig 4b however pf had little effects on gwp by enhanced ch4 emissions and inhibited co2 and n2o emissions fig 4b nutrient additions increased the gwp fig 4c p 0 076 mainly by enhancing the ch4 and co2 seasonal cumulative fluxes fig 4c and the degree of gwp enhancement was higher under the n p additions with an increase of 135 55 45 07 g co2 eq compared to the no nutrient addition treatment fig 4c 3 5 abundance of functional genes associated with ch4 and n2o fluxes the abundances of nitrifying genes arch amoa and amoa and denitrifying genes nirk nirs and narg varied significantly among the different hydrological alteration treatments fig 7a b fig s3 with lower values under cf compared to the no flooding plots the abundance of arch amoa was higher than amoa fig s3d e cf decreased the abundances of arch amoa and amoa by 62 2 and 25 1 respectively fig s3d e pf reduced the abundance of arch amoa by 50 7 fig s3d nutrient additions also significantly influenced the abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying genes individually the abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying genes were lower under the p addition treatment and higher under n p additions compared to the control plots fig 7a b hydrological alterations significantly decreased the abundances of methane producing mcra and methane oxidizing pmoa genes fig 7c d fig s3 f g with lower values in cf and pf plots than in nf plots nutrient additions significantly affected the abundances of methane producing and methane oxidizing genes with lower abundances under the p addition treatment and higher abundances under the n or n p additions fig 7c d 3 6 relationships between ghgs emission soil properties and functional genes generally ghgs emissions were strongly correlated with soil properties and abundances of functional genes fig 6 specifically co2 fluxes was significantly negatively correlated with soil temperature and moisture but positively correlated with the abundances of functional genes associated with nitrification denitrification and methane oxidation fig 6 the ch4 fluxes was positively correlated with soil moisture while negatively related to soil temperature and the abundance of nirs fig 6 the n2o emissions were negatively correlated with soil moisture and positively correlated with the abundance of amoa fig 6 moreover all the three ghgs fluxes were positively correlated with the doc concentration of the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 6a 4 discussion this study reported the responses and underlying mechanisms of riparian soil ghgs emissions to hydrological alterations and nutrient additions in previous studies the combined effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient n and p additions on ghg emissions have rarely been considered wang et al 2017 song et al 2020 wu et al 2020 our study provided insights into the key factors that hamper or enhance ghgs emissions under hydrological alterations and nutrient additions however in contrast to our hypothesis there were no interactive effects between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions 4 1 hydrological alterations increased ch4 emissions but decreased n2o and co2 fluxes hydrological alterations significantly affected ghgs emissions possibly by altering aerobic anaerobic condition redox potential soil moisture content soil organic carbon and the abundance of functional genes wang et al 2017 shingubara et al 2019 fig 5 our results supported our first hypothesis given that cf and pf significantly increased the ch4 fluxes over the three month observation period fig 3b these results were similar with feng et al 2020 who emphasized that the water table was the primary control of ch4 emissions regulated by microbes in bog lake peatland our results are also consistent with other previous studies that demonstrated how water table fluctuations can control soil aerobic anaerobic conditions and consequently ch4 emissions dinsmore et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 moreover the increased ch4 fluxes we have observed may be due to inhibition of ch4 oxidation stimulation of ch4 production or both wang et al 2017 our qpcr analysis further indicated that hydrological alteration enhanced ch4 emissions mainly by decreasing ch4 oxidation fig 7c d because flooding cuts off the oxygen in the air which will reduce the activities of methanotrophs le mer and roger 2001 however the abundance of functional genes associated with ch4 production was also lower in cf and pf plots when compared to nf plots which was probably related to the decrease of soc concentration under the cf and pf plots fig 5c one possible explanation is that as for cf and pf low soc concentrations and availability of substrates in soil layers could limit methanogen reproduction calabrese et al 2021 while high soc concentration and soil c n ratio in the nf could enhanced the microorganisms to fix carbon for reproduction leading to the higher abundance of functional gene mcra in nf this view is supported by the positive correlation between the abundance of mcra and soil c n ratio table s6 another explanation is that only certain metabolically active members of the methanogenic community were responsible for methane emission and the copy numbers of mcra could not fully represent the methane production potential watanabe et al 2009 ma et al 2013 hydrological alterations significantly decreased the n2o emission compared to the nf fig 3f n2o emission is closely related to soil nitrogen cycling especially nitrification and denitrification burgin and hamilton 2007 continuous flooding may result in relatively lower redox potential which could constrain nitrification sander et al 2014 meanwhile the abundance of nitrification genes arch amoa and amoa and nitrite reductase nirk and nirs genes can be the good indicator for the n2o emission zhou et al 2020 our qpcr analysis demonstrated that cf and pf decreased the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification fig 7a b suggesting that both nitrification and denitrification potentials were affected by hydrological alterations in addition hydrological alterations increased root n table s2 and root n was negatively correlated with the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification table s6 which provided direct evidence that hydrological alterations stimulated plant uptake of soil available n leading to less n available for nitrifiers and denitrifiers chen et al 2005 haddad et al 2017 hydrological alterations have a significant influence on co2 fluxes with lower co2 fluxes under cf treatment table 1 fig 3d these results are also supported by studies conducted at a paddy field in japan miyata et al 2000 peatland ecosystem hoyt et al 2019 hoyos santillan et al 2019 and a coastal wetland in the yellow river delta china zhao et al 2020 one possible explanation of our result is that continuous flooding not only inhibited the diffusion of co2 from soil to air but also decreased the decomposition activity of microorganisms and ecosystem respiration hatala et al 2012 jansson and hofmockel 2020 our qpcr analysis results showed that cf reduced the abundance of functional genes which partially indicated the reduction of heterotrophic respiration under cf treatment figs 6 b 7 moreover the co2 emission was related to the ch4 oxidized by methanotrophic fig 6b thus the lower abundance of functional genes associated with methane oxidation contributed to lower co2 emission in the cf plots than that in nf plots fig 7d 4 2 nutrient additions stimulated ghgs emissions but p addition reduced n2o fluxes nutrient additions regulated the ghgs emissions mainly by modifying the availability of n and p the activity of microorganisms and plant growth sundareshwar et al 2003 hirota et al 2004 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 our results that n and n p addition significantly increased n2o fluxes over the three month study compared to p addition plots fig 3c indicated that n nutrient is the limiting factor of n2o emissions in this riparian zone the finding that n addition enhanced n2o emissions is consistent with the previous studies which were conducted in the colorado shortgrass steppe mosier et al 1996 alpine meadow wu et al 2020 and coastal soils jia et al 2020 the potential mechanism for the different effect of n and p addition on n2o emissions could be the following 1 n or n p addition provided more substrate of inorganic nitrogen which stimulated the nitrification and denitrification process our qpcr analysis clearly showed that the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification was higher in n and n p addition and lower in p addition treatments which suggested that n and n p additions stimulated the process of both nitrification and denitrification gao et al 2018 wu et al 2020 fig 6a b furthermore n2o fluxes were significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of the amoa gene of ammonia oxidation bacteria aob which was higher under n and n p addition and lower under p addition and ck fig 6b fig s3 2 p addition alone may arouse root absorption of soil n which decreased the concentration of inorganic nitrogen and inhibited nitrification process and then influenced the denitrification process mori et al 2013 feng and zhu 2019 for example soil nh4 n under 0 10 cm layer were slightly lower under p addition compared with control plots p 0 42 fig 5e on the contrary ch4 fluxes were not significantly altered by nutrient additions which may result from the counteraction of direct and indirect influences the direct influence was the increased activity of methanotrophic bacteria after nutrient addition as indicated by enhance ch4 oxidation potential fig 7d which was confirmed by previous studies krüger and frenzel 2003 conrad and klose 2005 the indirect influence was caused by the increased plant anpp under the nutrient addition treatments which promotes ch4 emissions hirota et al 2004 wang et al 2017 therefore the lack of a significant effect of nutrient addition on ch4 emission is perhaps a result of the negative effect from microbes being offset by the positive influence from the plant co2 fluxes were also not significantly affected by nutrient additions during a three month experiment which was consistent with the previous studies bubier et al 2007 liu et al 2018 in general nutrient addition did not significantly affect co2 fluxes p 0 05 although n p addition increased the average co2 fluxes by 24 0 compared to the control plots fig 3d two opposite effects of nutrient addition may be responsible for this result that is inhibiting microbial respiration or enhancing plant respiration wang et al 2017 feng and zhu 2019 for example n addition may lead to soil acidification which could inhibit soil co2 efflux via suppressing microbial activity and root growth lu et al 2014 tian and niu 2015 feng and zhu 2019 meanwhile n and p additions could enhance plant uptake of soil n which would also enhance plant respiration but suppress microbial decomposition of soc feng and zhu 2019 further evidence is required to verify these speculations 4 3 no interactive effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions changes in water level and nutrient input often co occur in riparian ecosystems thus it is difficult to extrapolate ghgs responses to these changes based on the results from single factor experiments this research is among the few studies focusing on the interactions between water and nutrient addition at the ecosystem scale harpole et al 2007 demonstrated that water addition alone increases net co2 uptake but has no effect under n addition in a california grassland however our finding suggests that nutrient additions did not alter the effects of hydrological alterations on ghgs emissions in the riparian wetland one potential explanation is that microbial activity and community structure have changed except for physiological acclimation of microbes when facing the huge hydrological alterations our qpcr analysis demonstrated that hydrological alteration treatments greatly decreased the abundance of functional genes indicating that flooding reduced the microbial activity fig 7 fig s3 which was comparable with li et al 2019 and wang et al 2021 showing that microbial community and abundances were sensitive to environmental changes due to hydrological alterations in the tgr moreover decreased soil c n ratio induced by flooding would favor the bacteria which preferred to low soil c n ratios lauber et al 2008 ou et al 2019 we speculate that microbes reduce the demand for n or p because of declined microbial activity and shifting in community structure after three month hydrological alteration treatments in current study another possible explanation is that hydrological changes and nutrient additions regulated the ghgs emission by different control factors for example the environmental factors i e soil ph soil water content soc and c n ratio which were corelated with ghg fluxes or abundance of functional genes fig 6 and table s3 were only altered by hydrological changes but were uniform under different nutrient addition treatments fig 5a d g j further related research would be carried out in future work 4 4 the gwp of ghgs emissions was decreased by hydrological alterations but enhanced by nutrient additions few studies have quantified the climate impact of riparian ecosystems and its response to environmental changes using the widely used gwp on a 100 year time horizon this study estimated that the pristine water level fluctuation zone of tgr have a positive net gwp with growing season ghg budgets that is exerting a net warming impact on global radiation balance we further found that decreased co2 emissions led to reduction in gwp under cf treatments as supported by the previous study in the prairie pothole region of north america creed et al 2013 and a soil microcosm experiments zhao et al 2020 by contrast our results suggested that nutrient additions enhanced the gwp with higher value in n p addition treatment supported by the previous studies conducted in freshwater marshland zhang et al 2013 and in tropical forest hall and matson 1999 tian et al 2019 meanwhile our results showed that the gwp of growing season is 462 20 47 44 g co2 eq m 2 approximately 0 83 0 08 106 tco2 eq yr 1 in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr which accounted for around 61 of the ghgs emission for the whole reservoir 1 36 0 16 106 tco2 eq yr 1 li et al 2020 indicating the importance of ghgs emission from the riparian ecosystem however for the plant uptake of co2 was not included in this study the gwp of seasonal cumulative ghgs must be overestimated it has been suggested that global climate change will lead to more uneven precipitation patterns and hydrological alterations especially in riparian zone zhang et al 2020 with intensified human activities n and p input may increase in the near future gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 we estimated that the reduction of gwp induced by continuous flooding was 157 80 41 24 g co2 eq m 2 meanwhile n p treatment enhanced gwp by 135 55 45 07 g co2 eq m 2 if we simply extrapolate our results to the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr 349 km2 bao et al 2015 approximately 40 68 69 46 gg co2 eq per growing season will be taken up by continuous flooding and nearly 31 58 63 04 gg co2 eq per growing season will be increased if the water level fluctuation zone is subject to n and p inputs 5 conclusions hydrological alterations greatly affected the ghg emissions from riparian soils of the tgr these effects are likely due to the changes in soil moisture soil organic c soil c n ratios and functional genes associated with altered hydrology specifically hydrological alterations enhanced ch4 emission but inhibited co2 and n2o emissions nutrient additions only significantly affected n2o fluxes with higher values under n and n p addition treatments and minimum value under p addition contrary to our expectations there were no significantly interactive effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions as a result hydrological alterations reduced the gwp of growing season ghg budgets on a 100 year time horizon by decreasing the co2 fluxes while nutrient addition increased the gwp mainly by simulating the co2 and ch4 emissions the q pcr analysis revealed that decreased ch4 oxidation potential may lead to the enrichment of ch4 emissions and reduced nitrification and denitrification potential contributed to the reduction of n2o fluxes under all the treatments our study indicated that continuous flooding could alleviate the contribution of riparian ghgs fluxes to global warming by suppressing co2 emissions while the combination of n and p additions may accelerate global warming by stimulating cumulative co2 and ch4 emissions of growing season in riparian ecosystem author s contribution chen ye and quanfa zhang designed the

16837,changes in global rainfall patterns and construction of artificial dams have led to widespread alteration of hydrological processes in riparian ecosystems at the same time many riparian ecosystems such as those associated with the yangtze are being subjected to enhanced inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p due to intensified agricultural activity in surrounding uplands together these environmental changes may alter the magnitude and direction of greenhouse gasses ghgs fluxes from riparian soils we conducted an in situ experiment combined with quantitative pcr approach qpcr to elucidate the effects of hydrological alterations continuous flooding cf periodic flooding pf and no flooding nf and nutrient addition n addition urea 100 kg n ha 1 y 1 p addition p2o5 20 kg ha 1y 1 n p addition and control ck on three major ghgs including carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o fluxes as well as the underlying mechanisms our results showed that hydrological alterations greatly affected ghgs emissions possibly by altering soil moisture soil organic c and c n ratios the cf with higher soil moisture and lower c n ratio increased ch4 emissions 13 fold and reduced co2 and n2o emissions by 37 3 and 72 2 averaged over the growing seasons compared with no flooding pf enhanced ch4 emissions 5 7 fold and decreased n2o emissions by 69 0 in comparison with no flooding nutrient additions had no significant effect on co2 or ch4 flux but p addition significantly lowered n2o flux interactions between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions were not detected for any ghgs as a result hydrological alterations and nutrient additions affected the global warming potential gwp of growing season ghg budgets on a 100 year time horizon mainly by changing the co2 emissions cf reduced gwp from 597 to 439 g co2 eq m 2 and n p addition enhanced gwp from 489 to 625 g co2 eq m 2 the qpcr analysis revealed that decreased ch4 oxidation potential may lead to the enrichment of ch4 emissions under the hydrological alterations and reduced nitrification and denitrification potential contributed to the reduction of n2o fluxes under all the treatments our study indicates that continuous flooding could curb the contribution of riparian ghgs fluxes to global warming but that the combination of n and p additions may increase the greenhouse effect mainly by regulating the co2 emissions of growing season in riparian ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gasses hydrological alteration nitrogen addition phosphorus addition riparian zone three gorges reservoir 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are the three most important greenhouse gasses ghgs contributing to the greenhouse effect ipcc 2013 riparian zones are hot spots for ghgs emissions and remain one of the main uncertainties in global ghgs budgets schmidt et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in riparian ecosystems hydrological alteration and soil eutrophication induced by intensified anthropogenic activities could influence the flux of ghgs by altering the cycling of nitrogen and carbon zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 recently increasing attention has been paid to the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on the biogeochemical processes and soil microbial communities in riparian zones ye et al 2017 welsh et al 2019 pisani et al 2020 however it remains unclear how ghgs emissions and their net climate impact respond to both the hydrological alterations and nutrient addition in riparian zone petrescu et al 2015 garnier et al 2018 helton et al 2019 hydrological alteration plays an important role in regulating riparian ghgs fluxes by altering the aerobic anaerobic condition redox potential soil moisture content soil organic carbon and soil c n ratios dinsmore et al al 2009 jiang et al 2017 poblador et al 2017 although several studies have investigated the responses of ghgs flux to drying and rewetting cycles the mechanisms of how hydrological alterations affect ghgs emissions and ghgs budget in riparian ecosystem remain poorly understood likewise soil eutrophication due to inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p is another key factor directly linked to the ghgs emissions in riparian zones because n and p influence microbial activity soil organic carbon available nitrogen and vegetation structure tang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 tian et al 2019 van paassen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless little is known about the mechanisms of how n and p additions affect ghgs emissions under the conditions of the hydrological alterations in riparian ecosystems despite several studies into the effects of n and or p addition on ghgs emissions emissions of ghg from riparian soils are largely driven by soil microbial activities associated with c and n cycling canfield et al 2010 kuypers et al 2018 jansson and hofmockel 2020 stein 2020 soler jofra et al 2021 thus focusing on soil microbial functional gene abundance can give insight into the microbiological patterns and processes that underpin shifts in riparian soil ghg emission in response to altered hydrology and soil eutrophication in particular quantitative pcr qpcr can be used to investigate the links between the abundance of functional genes and net ch4 or n2o emissions for the functional genes related to ch4 mcra and pmoa genes were molecular markers for methanogens and methanotrophs which linked to ch4 production and consumption respectively le mer and roger 2001 lueders et al 2001 as for n2o both nitrification and denitrification processes can produce n2o canfield et al 2010 the nitrification potential is decided by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob which possess the amoa gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase wang et al 2017 xia et al 2019 the denitrification process is detected by narg nirk and nirs genes which dominated the nitrate and nitrite reductase yue et al 2015 kuypers et al 2018 since the completion of the three gorges dam in 2008 human induced off season water level fluctuations which are 175 m in winter and 145 m in summer above sea level have formed a water level fluctuation zone with a total area of 349 square kilometers bao et al 2015 over the past twelve years n and p inputs have been increased dramatically by human activities especially agricultural fertilization around the three gorges reservoir tgr gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus the water level fluctuation zone is an ideal place to investigate the response of ghg emissions to simultaneous hydrological alteration and soil nutrient enrichment the aim of this study was to explore how and by what mechanisms ghgs emissions respond to hydrological alterations together with n and p additions induced by intensified human activities in riparian ecosystem considering previous studies of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions we predicted that 1 continuous flooding and periodic flooding would increase the ch4 emission and decrease the n2o and co2 emissions by regulating n availability and creating anaerobic condition 2 nutrient additions could enhance ghgs emissions by increased n or p substrate which may stimulate the microbial activity 3 there are interactive effects between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions this study established a novel in situ experiment to investigate how riparian soil ghgs emissions respond to hydrological changes and n and p additions moreover qpcr was used to evaluate the potential roles of ch4 production oxidation nitrification and denitrification in the altered patterns of ghg emission under our experimental treatments in addition we evaluated the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on the global warming potential gwp on a 100 year horizon of three main ghgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design this study was conducted at zhongxian revegetation station 30 26 n 108 11 e located at the tgr chongqing china ye et al 2012 fig 1 this area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 16 5 19 c and annual mean precipitation ranging from 886 to 1614 mm ye et al 2015 80 of precipitation occurs between april to october mep 2014 our study area is located in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr where water levels fluctuate from 175 m a s l in winter to 145 m a s l in summer the duration of seasonal flooding differs according to elevation i e 145 155 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 286 days per year on average 155 165 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 237 days per year and 165 175 m a s l has an average flooding duration of 169 days per year ye et al 2020 the dominant species of our study site included perennials such as cynodon dactylon annual plants such as physalis minima polygonum hydropiper xanthium strumarium and echinochloa crusgalli and a few invasive species such as alternanthera philoxeroides to investigate the effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions i e n and p on ghgs emissions in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr the prescribed hydrological alterations and n and p additions experiments were established at nine 15 3 m blocks along the elevation gradient 145 155 m low elevation le 155 165 m middle elevation me and 165 175 m high elevation he with a split plot design at the end of may 2019 each block was divided into three sub blocks which were set for hydrological alteration treatments including continuous flooding cf flooding water pumped from the river maintained at 5 cm above the soil surface periodic flooding pf three days of submergence at 5 cm above the soil surface followed by three days of well drained condition and no flooding nf no supernumerary water added to the plots each sub block was divided into four 1 3 m plots in each plot a pair of pvc tubes with 31 cm inner diameters and 60 cm high were inserted 50 cm deep into the ground thus 108 pairs of pvc tubes were established in total fig s1 to avoid interference between different treatments approximately 0 5 m and 2 m buffer zones were set between the neighboring plots and sub blocks respectively nutrient additions were operated on each pvc tube of each plot the nutrient additions experiment sets up four treatments with three replicates including n addition urea 100 kg n ha 1 y 1 p p2o5 20 kg ha 1y 1 n p addition and control ck nutrient additions were divided into three portions and applied monthly during the growing seasons from june to august to avoid the interference of sampling one of the paired pvc tubes in each plot was used for soil and root biomass sampling and the other was used for gas sampling 2 2 ghgs fluxes measurements ghgs fluxes co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes were measured by using static opaque chamber and gas chromatography parkinson 1981 crill et al 1988 the chambers were 34 8 cm diameter and 50 cm high sealed on the top where a hose with a valve was set to connect the inside of the chamber a fan was installed in each chamber for mixing the air during sampling and a thermometer was set in the chamber for measuring atmospheric temperature gas samples were collected by plastic syringes from the chamber at 10 min intervals over 30 min samples were stored in gas sampling bags hede tech co china and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography perkinelmer 580 penkinelmer co usa within 24 h the gas chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and an electron capture detector ecd to analyze the ch4 fid co2 fid and n2o ecd ghgs fluxes were determined by the slopes of linear regressions for the ghgs concentration and sampling time from 0 min to 30 min the coefficients of determination r2 of the linear regressions were sometimes low for n2o 0 5 to avoid a bias from omitting low fluxes we keep those values when co2 and ch4 concentrations had a good linear trend with time dijkstra et al 2013 wang et al 2017 gas sampling was conducted twice or thrice per month between 8 00 and 12 00 am local time on sunny days for all treatments from early june to late august in 2019 gwp daily ghgs fluxes were represented by the fluxes measured between 8 00 to 12 00 am the seasonal cumulative ghgs fluxes were calculated according to wang et al 2017 by multiplying the average daily fluxes of two adjacent sampling dates by the time interval then summing the fluxes of all the time intervals according to the ipcc 2013 and kyoto protocol the gwp in g co2 eq m 2 on a 100 year time horizon of growing season was calculated by summing up seasonal cumulative co2 g co2 m 2 multiplied by 1 seasonal cumulative ch4 in g ch4 m 2 multiplied by 28 and seasonal cumulative n2o in mg n2o m 2 multiplied by 265 10 3 it should be noted that the co2 fluxes did not include the uptake of co2 by photosynthesis so the gwp of growing season budget would be overestimated 2 3 aboveground net primary production anpp root biomass and root properties in mid august two plots 0 5 0 5 m were selected from each sub block which can represent the average vegetation growth for each hydrological alteration treatments then the above ground biomass was harvested dried and weighed this biomass was used to estimated aboveground net primary production anpp because the aboveground plant biomass was highest in mid august in this area ye et al 2020 plant richness was calculated as the number of plant species in plots two soil cores with 5 cm diameter were collected from 0 to 20 cm soil layer under each treatment then roots were picked out manually and washed by double distilled water all root samples were dried 70 c 48 h and weighted ye et al 2012 root c and n were analyzed by stable isotope mass spectrometer delta v advantage thermo germany 2 4 soil sampling and analyses at the beginning of each month from june to august soil samples were collected from 0 to 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers with a 5 cm diameter stainless steel corer after litter horizons were removed in all plots n 108 on each sampling occasion all soil samples were sieved by 2 mm mesh to remove plant root and stones and stored at 80 c before dna extraction and soil physicochemical analyses topsoil 0 10 cm was used for molecular analysis due to its expected sensitivity to the hydrological alterations and nutrient additions soil moisture were determined gravimetrically after drying 20 g of fresh soils at 105 c for 24 h soil ph was analyzed by using a ph meter phs 25 inesa scientific instrument co china in a mixture of air dried soil and water soil water 1 2 5 by weight the concentration of ammonium nh4 n and nitrate no3 n were analyzed by extracting 10 g fresh soil with 50 ml of 2 mol l kcl solution and performing a colorimetric analysis with filtered kcl extractant by using automatic chemical analyzer easychem plus systea italy ma et

thermo germany with air dried and sieved 165 μm soil samples 2 5 surface water sampling and analyses surface water samples were collected from continuous flooding and periodic flooding treatments with 100 ml syringe to determine water quality parameters water samples for nh4 no3 and no2 analyses were filtered with membrane filter paper 0 45 μm waterman and analyzed using an automatic chemical

mcra and pmoa that code for the key enzymes in the processes of nitrification and denitrification ch4 production and oxidation were amplified the primers and qpcr conditions are listed in table s7 of

each 10 um and 1 ul of soil dna template standard curves were obtained from serial plasmid with known concentration which contained target genes each sample was analyzed for three replicates melting curve analysis was performed at the end of each qpcr to confirm the amplification specificities 2 7 data analysis repeated measures analysis of variance was used to detect the effect of the main

three months of in situ experiment hydrological alterations had no significant effect on anpp table s2 but decreased the plant richness and plant cover with lower values in cf plots table s2 the anpp

significantly increased soil moisture but reduced soc and soil c n ratio compared to the nf fig 5 nutrient additions reduced soc in the topsoil 0 10 cm fig 5c 3 3 greenhouse gasses co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes overall co2 ch4 and n2o emissions were similar across the elevation gradient table 1 no significant interaction between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions was observed for ghgs emissions table 1 seasonal co2 flux dynamics were observed p 0 001 table 1 and co2 release peaked on days 41 and 71 fig 2 hydrological alterations significantly affected co2 emissions cf reduced the average co2 flux by 37 3 compared to nf while pf had little effect on co2 emissions fig 3 d neither n nor p addition affected co2 releases whereas n p addition enhanced the average rate of co2 emission by 24 0 in comparison with the control plots fig 3d p 0 351 seasonal ch4 flux dynamics were detected p 0 001 table 1 and the highest value appeared on day 80 day under the cf treatment fig 2d compared with nf plots cf and pf substantially stimulated ch4 fluxes by 13 3 times p 0 001 and 5 7 times p 0 098 respectively fig 3e nutrient additions had no significant effect on ch4 emissions table

n2o flux dynamics were observed p 0 01 table 1 with the highest value on day 11 of the experimental period fig 2 hydrological alterations significantly reduced n2o emissions in comparison with nf plots cf and pf across different nutrient additions decreased the n2o fluxes by 72 2 p 0 046 and 69 0 p 0 061 respectively fig 3f the addition of p significantly stimulated the absorptions of n2o under the cf treatment 134 48 μg n2o m 2 h 1 and pf plots 111 44 μg n2o m 2 h 1 at 11 days fig 2g h 3 4 global warming potential gwp the gwp of the growing season ghg budget was 462 20 47 44 g co2 eq m 2 for the control within no flooding plots fig 4 a in general hydrological alterations significantly affected the gwp with a reduction of 157 80 41 24 g co2 eq m 2 under cf treatment mainly by decreasing co2 fluxes fig 4b however pf had little effects on gwp by enhanced ch4 emissions and inhibited co2 and n2o emissions fig 4b nutrient additions increased the gwp fig 4c p 0 076 mainly by enhancing the ch4 and co2 seasonal cumulative fluxes fig 4c and the degree of gwp enhancement was higher under the n p additions with an increase of 135 55 45 07 g co2 eq compared to the no nutrient addition treatment fig 4c 3 5 abundance of functional genes associated with ch4 and n2o fluxes the abundances of nitrifying genes arch amoa and amoa and denitrifying genes nirk nirs and narg varied significantly among the different hydrological alteration treatments fig 7a b fig s3 with lower values under cf compared to the no flooding plots the abundance of arch amoa was higher than amoa fig s3d e cf decreased the abundances of arch amoa and amoa by 62 2 and 25 1 respectively fig s3d e pf reduced the abundance of arch amoa by 50 7 fig s3d nutrient additions also significantly influenced the abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying genes individually the abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying genes were lower under the p addition treatment and higher under n p additions compared to the control plots fig 7a b hydrological alterations significantly decreased the abundances of methane producing mcra and methane oxidizing pmoa genes fig 7c d fig s3 f g with lower values in cf and pf plots than in nf plots nutrient additions significantly affected the abundances of methane producing and methane oxidizing genes with lower abundances under the p addition treatment and higher abundances under the n or n p additions fig 7c d 3 6 relationships between ghgs emission soil properties and functional genes generally ghgs emissions were strongly correlated with soil properties and abundances of functional genes fig 6 specifically co2 fluxes was significantly negatively correlated with soil temperature and moisture but positively correlated with the abundances of functional genes associated with nitrification denitrification and methane oxidation fig 6 the ch4 fluxes was positively correlated with soil moisture while negatively related to soil temperature and the abundance of nirs fig 6 the n2o emissions were negatively correlated with soil moisture and positively correlated with the abundance of amoa fig 6 moreover all the three ghgs fluxes were positively correlated with the doc concentration of the 0 10 cm soil layer fig 6a 4 discussion this study reported the responses and underlying mechanisms of riparian soil ghgs emissions to hydrological alterations and nutrient additions in previous studies the combined effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient n and p additions on ghg emissions have rarely been considered wang et al 2017 song et al 2020 wu et al 2020 our study provided insights into the key factors that hamper or enhance ghgs emissions under hydrological alterations and nutrient additions however in contrast to our hypothesis there were no interactive effects between hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions 4 1 hydrological alterations increased ch4 emissions but decreased n2o and co2 fluxes hydrological alterations significantly affected ghgs emissions possibly by altering aerobic anaerobic condition redox potential soil moisture content soil organic carbon and the abundance of functional genes wang et al 2017 shingubara et al 2019 fig 5 our results supported our first hypothesis given that cf and pf significantly increased the ch4 fluxes over the three month observation period fig 3b these results were similar with feng et al 2020 who emphasized that the water table was the primary control of ch4 emissions regulated by microbes in bog lake peatland our results are also consistent with other previous studies that demonstrated how water table fluctuations can control soil aerobic anaerobic conditions and consequently ch4 emissions dinsmore et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 moreover the increased ch4 fluxes we have observed may be due to inhibition of ch4 oxidation stimulation of ch4 production or both wang et al 2017 our qpcr analysis further indicated that hydrological alteration enhanced ch4 emissions mainly by decreasing ch4 oxidation fig 7c d because flooding cuts off the oxygen in the air which will reduce the activities of methanotrophs le mer and roger 2001 however the abundance of functional genes associated with ch4 production was also lower in cf and pf plots when compared to nf plots which was probably related to the decrease of soc concentration under the cf and pf plots fig 5c one possible explanation is that as for cf and pf low soc concentrations and availability of substrates in soil layers could limit methanogen reproduction calabrese et al 2021 while high soc concentration and soil c n ratio in the nf could enhanced the microorganisms to fix carbon for reproduction leading to the higher abundance of functional gene mcra in nf this view is supported by the positive correlation between the abundance of mcra and soil c n ratio table s6 another explanation is that only certain metabolically active members of the methanogenic community were responsible for methane emission and the copy numbers of mcra could not fully represent the methane production potential watanabe et al 2009 ma et al 2013 hydrological alterations significantly decreased the n2o emission compared to the nf fig 3f n2o emission is closely related to soil nitrogen cycling especially nitrification and denitrification burgin and hamilton 2007 continuous flooding may result in relatively lower redox potential which could constrain nitrification sander et al 2014 meanwhile the abundance of nitrification genes arch amoa and amoa and nitrite reductase nirk and nirs genes can be the good indicator for the n2o emission zhou et al 2020 our qpcr analysis demonstrated that cf and pf decreased the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification fig 7a b suggesting that both nitrification and denitrification potentials were affected by hydrological alterations in addition hydrological alterations increased root n table s2 and root n was negatively correlated with the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification table s6 which provided direct evidence that hydrological alterations stimulated plant uptake of soil available n leading to less n available for nitrifiers and denitrifiers chen et al 2005 haddad et al 2017 hydrological alterations have a significant influence on co2 fluxes with lower co2 fluxes under cf treatment table 1 fig 3d these results are also supported by studies conducted at a paddy field in japan miyata et al 2000 peatland ecosystem hoyt et al 2019 hoyos santillan et al 2019 and a coastal wetland in the yellow river delta china zhao et al 2020 one possible explanation of our result is that continuous flooding not only inhibited the diffusion of co2 from soil to air but also decreased the decomposition activity of microorganisms and ecosystem respiration hatala et al 2012 jansson and hofmockel 2020 our qpcr analysis results showed that cf reduced the abundance of functional genes which partially indicated the reduction of heterotrophic respiration under cf treatment figs 6 b 7 moreover the co2 emission was related to the ch4 oxidized by methanotrophic fig 6b thus the lower abundance of functional genes associated with methane oxidation contributed to lower co2 emission in the cf plots than that in nf plots fig 7d 4 2 nutrient additions stimulated ghgs emissions but p addition reduced n2o fluxes nutrient additions regulated the ghgs emissions mainly by modifying the availability of n and p the activity of microorganisms and plant growth sundareshwar et al 2003 hirota et al 2004 kim et al 2015 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 our results that n and n p addition significantly increased n2o fluxes over the three month study compared to p addition plots fig 3c indicated that n nutrient is the limiting factor of n2o emissions in this riparian zone the finding that n addition enhanced n2o emissions is consistent with the previous studies which were conducted in the colorado shortgrass steppe mosier et al 1996 alpine meadow wu et al 2020 and coastal soils jia et al 2020 the potential mechanism for the different effect of n and p addition on n2o emissions could be the following 1 n or n p addition provided more substrate of inorganic nitrogen which stimulated the nitrification and denitrification process our qpcr analysis clearly showed that the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrification and denitrification was higher in n and n p addition and lower in p addition treatments which suggested that n and n p additions stimulated the process of both nitrification and denitrification gao et al 2018 wu et al 2020 fig 6a b furthermore n2o fluxes were significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of the amoa gene of ammonia oxidation bacteria aob which was higher under n and n p addition and lower under p addition and ck fig 6b fig s3 2 p addition alone may arouse root absorption of soil n which decreased the concentration of inorganic nitrogen and inhibited nitrification process and then influenced the denitrification process mori et al 2013 feng and zhu 2019 for example soil nh4 n under 0 10 cm layer were slightly lower under p addition compared with control plots p 0 42 fig 5e on the contrary ch4 fluxes were not significantly altered by nutrient additions which may result from the counteraction of direct and indirect influences the direct influence was the increased activity of methanotrophic bacteria after nutrient addition as indicated by enhance ch4 oxidation potential fig 7d which was confirmed by previous studies krüger and frenzel 2003 conrad and klose 2005 the indirect influence was caused by the increased plant anpp under the nutrient addition treatments which promotes ch4 emissions hirota et al 2004 wang et al 2017 therefore the lack of a significant effect of nutrient addition on ch4 emission is perhaps a result of the negative effect from microbes being offset by the positive influence from the plant co2 fluxes were also not significantly affected by nutrient additions during a three month experiment which was consistent with the previous studies bubier et al 2007 liu et al 2018 in general nutrient addition did not significantly affect co2 fluxes p 0 05 although n p addition increased the average co2 fluxes by 24 0 compared to the control plots fig 3d two opposite effects of nutrient addition may be responsible for this result that is inhibiting microbial respiration or enhancing plant respiration wang et al 2017 feng and zhu 2019 for example n addition may lead to soil acidification which could inhibit soil co2 efflux via suppressing microbial activity and root growth lu et al 2014 tian and niu 2015 feng and zhu 2019 meanwhile n and p additions could enhance plant uptake of soil n which would also enhance plant respiration but suppress microbial decomposition of soc feng and zhu 2019 further evidence is required to verify these speculations 4 3 no interactive effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions changes in water level and nutrient input often co occur in riparian ecosystems thus it is difficult to extrapolate ghgs responses to these changes based on the results from single factor experiments this research is among the few studies focusing on the interactions between water and nutrient addition at the ecosystem scale harpole et al 2007 demonstrated that water addition alone increases net co2 uptake but has no effect under n addition in a california grassland however our finding suggests that nutrient additions did not alter the effects of hydrological alterations on ghgs emissions in the riparian wetland one potential explanation is that microbial activity and community structure have changed except for physiological acclimation of microbes when facing the huge hydrological alterations our qpcr analysis demonstrated that hydrological alteration treatments greatly decreased the abundance of functional genes indicating that flooding reduced the microbial activity fig 7 fig s3 which was comparable with li et al 2019 and wang et al 2021 showing that microbial community and abundances were sensitive to environmental changes due to hydrological alterations in the tgr moreover decreased soil c n ratio induced by flooding would favor the bacteria which preferred to low soil c n ratios lauber et al 2008 ou et al 2019 we speculate that microbes reduce the demand for n or p because of declined microbial activity and shifting in community structure after three month hydrological alteration treatments in current study another possible explanation is that hydrological changes and nutrient additions regulated the ghgs emission by different control factors for example the environmental factors i e soil ph soil water content soc and c n ratio which were corelated with ghg fluxes or abundance of functional genes fig 6 and table s3 were only altered by hydrological changes but were uniform under different nutrient addition treatments fig 5a d g j further related research would be carried out in future work 4 4 the gwp of ghgs emissions was decreased by hydrological alterations but enhanced by nutrient additions few studies have quantified the climate impact of riparian ecosystems and its response to environmental changes using the widely used gwp on a 100 year time horizon this study estimated that the pristine water level fluctuation zone of tgr have a positive net gwp with growing season ghg budgets that is exerting a net warming impact on global radiation balance we further found that decreased co2 emissions led to reduction in gwp under cf treatments as supported by the previous study in the prairie pothole region of north america creed et al 2013 and a soil microcosm experiments zhao et al 2020 by contrast our results suggested that nutrient additions enhanced the gwp with higher value in n p addition treatment supported by the previous studies conducted in freshwater marshland zhang et al 2013 and in tropical forest hall and matson 1999 tian et al 2019 meanwhile our results showed that the gwp of growing season is 462 20 47 44 g co2 eq m 2 approximately 0 83 0 08 106 tco2 eq yr 1 in the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr which accounted for around 61 of the ghgs emission for the whole reservoir 1 36 0 16 106 tco2 eq yr 1 li et al 2020 indicating the importance of ghgs emission from the riparian ecosystem however for the plant uptake of co2 was not included in this study the gwp of seasonal cumulative ghgs must be overestimated it has been suggested that global climate change will lead to more uneven precipitation patterns and hydrological alterations especially in riparian zone zhang et al 2020 with intensified human activities n and p input may increase in the near future gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 we estimated that the reduction of gwp induced by continuous flooding was 157 80 41 24 g co2 eq m 2 meanwhile n p treatment enhanced gwp by 135 55 45 07 g co2 eq m 2 if we simply extrapolate our results to the water level fluctuation zone of the tgr 349 km2 bao et al 2015 approximately 40 68 69 46 gg co2 eq per growing season will be taken up by continuous flooding and nearly 31 58 63 04 gg co2 eq per growing season will be increased if the water level fluctuation zone is subject to n and p inputs 5 conclusions hydrological alterations greatly affected the ghg emissions from riparian soils of the tgr these effects are likely due to the changes in soil moisture soil organic c soil c n ratios and functional genes associated with altered hydrology specifically hydrological alterations enhanced ch4 emission but inhibited co2 and n2o emissions nutrient additions only significantly affected n2o fluxes with higher values under n and n p addition treatments and minimum value under p addition contrary to our expectations there were no significantly interactive effects of hydrological alterations and nutrient additions on ghgs emissions as a result hydrological alterations reduced the gwp of growing season ghg budgets on a 100 year time horizon by decreasing the co2 fluxes while nutrient addition increased the gwp mainly by simulating the co2 and ch4 emissions the q pcr analysis revealed that decreased ch4 oxidation potential may lead to the enrichment of ch4 emissions and reduced nitrification and denitrification potential contributed to the reduction of n2o fluxes under all the treatments our study indicated that continuous flooding could alleviate the contribution of riparian ghgs fluxes to global warming by suppressing co2 emissions while the combination of n and p additions may accelerate global warming by stimulating cumulative co2 and ch4 emissions of growing season in riparian ecosystem author s contribution chen ye and quanfa zhang designed the

16838,rising incidence of waterborne diseases including legionellosis linked to low chlorine residuals in buildings and the availability of inexpensive testing options create an opportunity for citizen science chorine monitoring to complement sampling done by water utilities university researchers and flint residents coordinated a citizen science chlorine surveillance campaign in flint michigan in 2015 19 that helped expose the nature of two deadly legionnaires disease outbreaks in 2014 2015 during the flint water crisis and progress of system recovery during the federal emergency results obtained with an inexpensive color wheel were in agreement with a digital colorimeter r2 0 99 p 2 81 10 21 at 15 sites geographically distributed across flint blinded tests revealed good agreement between official n 2051 and citizen n 654 data in terms of determining whether regulatory guidelines for chlorine were met but a discovery that the citizen data were statistically lower than the city s p 0 00001 especially in warm summer months led to recommendations for increased flushing of service lines before measurements this work suggests that expanded citizen surveillance of chlorine site specific flushing advice and guidance on decisions about water heater set point could help consumers reduce legionella risks in their homes citizen science initiatives for chlorine monitoring offer a unique opportunity for mutually beneficial collaborations between consumers and utilities to reduce the main source of waterborne disease in developed countries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine residual citizen science flint water crisis flushing legionella pneumophila water age 1 introduction 1 1 chlorine monitoring and public health chlorine disinfection revolutionized water treatment when it was introduced in 1908 leal et al 1909 cdc 1999 awwa 2018 since the early 20th century maintaining appropriately high chlorine residual levels in the water distribution system has been required to inactivate fecal pathogens and the concept of too much free chlorine generally arose only when consumers reported skin irritation swimming pool odor and taste issues or excess pipe corrosion suffet et al 1996 rushing and edwards 2004 al jasser 2007 gurian and tarr 2011 sarver et al 2011 near the end of the 20th century concerns over carcinogenic byproducts from chlorine disinfection were addressed through the stage 1 and stage 2 disinfection byproducts rule creating regulatory pressure to remove organic matter lower chlorine doses or use alternative residual disinfectants such as chloramine usepa 2005 this led to several unintended consequences first a well intentioned switch from chlorine to chloramine to reduce total trihalomethanes in washington d c triggered a massive water lead contamination event edwards et al 2004 edwards et al 2009 confirming a hypothesis that high levels of free chlorine had been acting as a form of lead corrosion control schock 1989 edwards 2004 edwards and dudi 2004 schock and giani 2004 lytle and schock 2005 second it was recently discovered that opportunistic pathogens growing inside premise i e building plumbing such as legionella pneumophila and non tuberculous mycobacteria are now the major source of waterborne diseases hospitalizations and deaths in developed countries nrc 2004 falkinham et al 2015 collier et al 2021 and regulations have not yet responded to a possible need for increased chlorine or chloramine residuals to help reduce these risks in buildings and homes third although unrelated to the united states tthm rule over 2300 people became sick and seven individuals died in the 2000 walkerton canada disaster due to high levels of escherichia coli 0157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni in drinking water from failure to maintain appropriately high chlorine residuals and it was revealed that there was falsification of chlorine residual records covering up problems with chlorine dose hrudey et al 2003 all three of these issues were of concern in the 2014 15 flint water crisis fwc and its aftermath a failure to maintain federally required corrosion control during a switch in source waters caused destabilization of pipe scales containing iron and lead reduced chlorine levels boil water orders and two legionnaires disease ld outbreaks killing at least 13 and perhaps as many as 70 people schwake et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 zahran et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 nelson et al 2020 delayed public reporting of these legionella deaths and falsification of lead monitoring results created justifiable widespread public distrust in the water and a state of science anarchy in which the word of government agencies regarding water safety was not trusted by residents roy 2017 roy and edwards 2019 although there is no evidence of falsified official chlorine data during the fwc we did note during our august 2015 field sampling and sustained monitoring of one flint home later in 2015 that chlorine levels were often undetectable in residences edwards 2015 flintwaterstudy 2015 officially reported chlorine levels did wildly fluctuate due to hyperchlorination sometimes exceeding the 4 mg l maximum residual disinfectant level i e 7 mg l masten et al 2016 which likely contributed to skin irritation rashes and chlorine odor complaints from flint residents u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2016 the haphazard dosing practices and lack of corrosion control also led to dbp violations and boil water advisories due to fecal contamination masten et al 2016 allen et al 2017 goodwill et al 2018 the lack of orthophosphate high chloride concentrations from flint river and corrosion of unlined iron pipes increased chlorine demand causing chlorine depletion in areas farthest from the treatment plant and producing instances in which 5 15 of official measurements did not have detectable chlorine flintwaterstudy 2015 masten et al 2016 rhoads et al 2017 we realized that the official chlorine monitoring at 10 officially selected distribution system sites 25 sites during the flint federal emergency arcadis 2017 could be supplemented with citizen science monitoring stations to independently check official data providing proof of concept that consumers might be able to monitor chlorine levels in their own homes that could someday contribute to making informed decisions about controlling risks of opportunistic pathogens this idea is analogous to the manner in which managers of large buildings are presently required to develop a legionella risk management plan cdc 2018 moreover in the absence of federal laws to control opportunistic pathogens in buildings usepa n d nasem 2020 there is an emerging need for simple robust and inexpensive chlorine monitoring by building managers and consumers to assess pathogen risks this is analogous to current recommendations that consumers should consider testing water in their homes for elevated lead and copper to assess the personal risks for exposure even if a city is meeting the epa lead and copper rule that was designed to reduce such risks across an entire city usepa 2017c 1 2 citizen science and public trust citizen science collaborations utilize public participation in research projects and data collection after training with appropriate instruments bonney et al 2014 cooper 2016 bates 2018 hammes 2019 and such testing can increase consumer confidence maik et al 2019 citizen scientists have monitored water temperature dissolved oxygen ph conductivity nitrate phosphate cultivable bacteria cultivable fungi and agrichemicals in freshwater or drinking water farnham et al 2017 brouwer et al 2018 safford and peters 2018 ali et al 2019 quinlivan et al 2020 importantly the fwc was first exposed in our citizen science coordinated sampling of one home in april and citywide testing of 269 homesin august 2015 pieper et al 2017 2018 our efforts benefited from consumer health concerns and achieved an extraordinarily successful sample kit return rate of 90 pieper et al 2018 after our field teams sampling in 2015 helped identify two legionnaires disease outbreaks edwards 2015 pruden and schwake 2016 schwake et al 2016 rhoads et al 2017 the authors of this paper 7 citizen and 2 university scientists collaborated with epa and fema to track the system recovery the water quality improved after the switchback to detroit water october 2015 and then increased doses of orthophosphate december 2015 and chlorine january 2016 an expanded water flushing program implemented through 34 geographically distributed flushing hydrants in january december 2016 helped reduce problems associated with high water age residents were also enlisted to flush their pipes at no cost twice a day for 5 min over two weeks in may 2016 to remove sediment reduce water age and increase chlorine stability usepa 2017a arcadis 2017 masten et al 2019 roy and edwards 2019 officially reported chlorine residual levels increased and stabilized from low levels during the crisis and since october 2016 the flint system has been meeting a more stringent than required goal of 0 5 mg l as cl2 in 95 monthly samples and also meeting all dbp regulatory limits friedman et al 2010 arcadis 2018 trust in flint water remains very low with the latest poll showing that over 96 of residents used only bottled water for cooking and 60 using bottled water for bathing flint cares 2018 there are strong beliefs that chlorine residuals remain low and that the potential for growth of dangerous bacteria and legionella are high fonger 2017 fonger et al 2019 these fears were compounded by some misinformation about dangerous levels of chemicals and bacteria such as shigella in potable water after switching back to detroit water roy 2017 roy and edwards 2019 owczarzak and holland 2016 maki et al 2019 edwards et al 2019 gomez et al 2020 and later scientific evidence that this was not the case allen et al 2017 goodwill et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 mcclung et al 2020 could not fully counter those fears to help address all of these concerns and examine a proof of concept for citizen chlorine monitoring that might someday help consumers manage their own legionella risks the authors executed a multi year citizen science effort to monitor chlorine residuals this investigative citizen science project relied on residents training residents in the appropriate use of both a standard digital field spectrophotometer digital colorimeter and a simple colorimetric disk color wheel not currently approved for compliance monitoring deem and feagin 2016 washington state department of health 2020 fig 1 a in this research we a evaluate the performance of color wheel versus a digital colorimeter for citizen monitoring of chlorine b map trends and examine the reliability of citizen chlorine residuals in flint versus official monitoring data for 2018 19 c identify human and financial challenges associated with monitoring and d discuss implications of at home chlorine monitoring to support legionella risk management strategies or to complement official data 2 materials and methods 2 1 official chlorine and water temperature measurements the chlorine residual and water temperature data from 30 official water distribution monitoring stations across flint including businesses community centers pumping stations and fire stations were obtained from monthly water quality reports archived on the michigan environment great lakes and energy website http www michigan gov flintwater the official sampling protocol requires flushing 10 30 min based on calculations to ensure data is representative of chlorine in the water mains us environmental protection agency usepa 2017b kristzian 2018 2 2 citizen chlorine measurements a university researcher co author mae on this paper first trained a flint citizen scientist co author lw on this paper in chlorine measurements and provided her with a digital colorimeter in august 2015 pieper et al 2017 lw monitored chlorine daily at her kitchen tap for three weeks in august september 2015 and reported 100 non detect chlorine measurements in real time on our website edwards 2015 rhoads et al 2017 she then trained other citizen scientists in use of the digital colorimeter and the color wheel one of seven trained citizen scientists on our team measured total residual chlorine every week at 14 locations fig 1b around flint mi including at eight official monitoring stations during june december 2018 and april august 2019 the following standard protocol was followed at each site a access a cold water tap b flush water for five minutes c grab water sample in a 10 ml aliquot and d process the sample on the pocket colorimeter ii dr300 or the color disc cn 66f manufactured by hach using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 and note the reading for a small subset of data collection citizen scientists flushed for 10 40 min at 2 common sites during october december 2018 to help explain discrepancies between the citizen and official data to establish inter reliability between the two methods the color wheel range 0 3 4 mg l and digital colorimeter range 0 02 2 00 mg l were tested in parallel fig 2 at all 14 citizen locations on february 13 2020 testing was also conducted in the household of a flint citizen scientist which has high water age and characteristically low 0 2 mg l chlorine concentrations on august 13 2020 the citizen scientist co authors on this paper also innovated the following additional steps a take pictures of chlorine readings on their smartphones b create notes of the sampling site date and time on the image itself fig 1a and c send the records to another citizen scientist km who uploaded all image files to a shared drive and entered all chlorine measurement data in mg l as cl2 on a shared spreadsheet 2 3 statistical analyses all data were analyzed in microsoft excel version 2019 and rstudio version 3 3 2 a p value of 0 05 with an alpha value α of 0 05 was selected to determine statistical significance the pearson s coefficient correlation test was used to examine the association between chlorine measurements from color wheel and digital colorimeter 3 results and discussion 3 1 color wheel is an inexpensive and robust citizen science tool the color wheel performed well compared to the digital colorimeter fig 2 and recording near identical measurements in the 0 1 2 mg l as cl2 range r2 0 99 p 2 81 10 21 the digital colorimeter an industry standard costs roughly seven times the simpler color wheel us 457 vs us 65 but both use the same standard method and reagents apha awwa wef 1998 for high chlorine concentration solutions 0 05 0 5 that require serial dilutions like those used in ebola viral disease outbreak disinfection response measurement errors in the color wheel can exceed 10 wells et al 2016 however such discrepancies were not observed for the color wheel in our dilution free tap water testing supporting a general observation that simpler technologies might improve the accuracy and legitimacy of data collected by citizen scientists kosmala et al 2016 hadj hammou et al 2017 3 2 citizen science data and the flint water distribution system recovery after flint switched back to detroit water in october 2015 it began meeting the american water works association and partnership for safe water goal of 95 monthly samples registering free chlorine 0 2 mg l starting january 2016 as well as the flint specific goal of 0 5 mg l set by agencies assisting in flint s recovery beginning september 2016 friedman 2017 awwa 2017 this trend continued in 2018 19 per official monitoring data summarized in this paper fig 3 a which is also in compliance with michigan regulations of at least 95 sample measurements containing 0 1 mg l chlorine state of michigan 2014 of the 654 measurements made by citizen scientist co authors of this article fig 3b almost 90 n 585 were 0 2 mg l demonstrating satisfactory residuals for most distributed water the sentinel home of citizen scientist lw began reporting detectable chlorine as early as august 2016 edwards 2017 rhoads et al 2017 but levels at this location were still low in 2020 with chlorine levels of only 0 1 mg l measured after 20 min of flushing fig 2 the citizen data were always significantly lower than official data unpaired two tailed t test p 0 00001 at the common sites with the average difference i e official chlorine citizen chlorine of 0 53 mg l range 0 11 to 0 94 mg l for measurements made every 10 or 11 days fig 3c this was later attributed at least in part to the shorter fixed 5 minute flushing time used in the citizen sampling to explain this discrepancy citizen scientists would eventually measure chlorine following extended flushing at two sites fig 4 b this resolved the discrepancy at one location but at the other site the mean official chlorine was still 60 higher than the citizen sampled chlorine it was discovered that the magnitude of the discrepancy between the citizen and official sampling increased with temperature fig 4a ii vs iv as might be expected if the chlorine demand of service lines and premise plumbing increases at higher temperature nguyen et al 2012 garcia avila et al 2020 these citizen science findings were eventually presented to the flint water interagency coordination committee and state of michigan officials fonger 2018 snyder 2018 intensive bacterial monitoring by epa our research group and others indicated that legionella levels returned to normal levels starting in 2016 schwake et al 2016 rhoads et al 2017 rhoads et al 2020 and there were no reported problems with regulated total coliform bacteria during the 2018 19 time period of this study city of flint 2021 moreover chlorine residuals are a complex function of water age water temperature water main materials on the journey to homes as well as factors specific to each home including its age types of premise plumbing materials and water use patterns al jasser 2007 hallam et al 2002 hua et al 1999 powell et al 2000 rhoads et al 2014 future citizen science studies could benefit from complementary measurements of pathogens and ascertaining specifics of premise plumbing in addition to the chlorine residual monitoring reported herein 3 3 people and funding challenges are a legitimate concern the research reported herein cost about us 1980 in total material costs i e 21 color wheels 1 digital colorimeter and reagents and us 25 000 in citizen scientist wages the wages would be reduced by a factor of about 10 per sample if consumers were to only collect routine samples in their home or neighborhood rather than attempting to replicate monitoring all over the city of 21 interested volunteers who were offered training webber 2017 and received color wheel kits seven citizen science co authors utilized color wheels for monitoring for a color wheel utilization rate of 33 7 of 21 were used 14 of 21 color wheels were not returned thus 1000 chlorine readings cost us 693 based on use of seven color wheels and 1000 powder pillow chlorine reagent packs and if the 14 lost color wheels are considered costs increase to us 1603 for comparison color wheels used in analyzing ebola disinfecting solutions chlorine levels in a prior study cost us 193 for 1000 tests using one color wheel and 1000 reagent packs wells et al 2016 in contrast official chlorine sampling relies on salaried government or contractual laboratory employees who are trained and required to take weekly measurements as this two year effort demonstrates trained citizen scientists can perform comparable surveillance given personal interest and funding availability in the absence of in depth training financial incentives and or high personal interest it might be hard to maintain a short or long term surveillance program of this nature participation in our 2015 collaborative efforts that helped expose the flint water crisis benefited from the perception that many citizens correctly felt it was a life or death situation financial incentives to residents for monitoring have precedent in federal lead and copper rule monitoring and in educational programs to reduce lead exposure per experiences in philadelphia new york cleveland and elsewhere jordan et al 2003 sunrise water 2011 newark education workers caucus v city of newark 2019 jaskositz et al 2020 such incentives might also be considered to encourage citizen monitoring of chlorine 3 4 expanded chlorine monitoring to manage opportunistic pathogen risks it is increasingly recognized that low chlorine levels in distribution systems may pose a health risk for opportunistic pathogens exposure in consumer homes and these important gaps in existing utility monitoring might be partly filled by consumer monitoring as described herein microbial sampling of water mains during warmer months in 13 chlorinated distribution systems in the us revealed culturable legionella pneumophila when water temperatures exceeded 18 c 64 4 f and chlorine residuals dropped below 0 1 mg l lechevallier 2019 indicating increased risk of legionella entering buildings that could be further magnified by more growth of legionella within buildings similar trends have emerged for other opportunistic pathogens like mycobacterium avium norton et al 2004 pryor et al 2004 within individual building systems the national academies recommends maintaining 0 3 mg l chlorine residual by boosting chlorine at the point of entry to counter legionella growth american society for heating refrigeration and airconditioning engineers ashrae 2015 american society for heating refrigeration and airconditioning engineers ashrae 2020 nasem 2020 there is some growing evidence that chlorine concentrations 0 5 mg l can significantly reduce detectable legionella levels alary and joly 1992 orsi et al 2014 rhoads et al 2017 zahran et al 2018 rhoads et al 2020 in a simulation of the flint system using premise plumbing reactors culturable legionella pneumophila did not persist even with residuals near 0 2 mg l martin et al 2020 it is also known that there are often neighborhoods with relatively low chlorine and high legionella risk that can go undetected with the utility selected distribution system monitoring sites utilities that report any households with water ages exceeding seven 29 utilities or 10 days 15 utilities awwa 2018 oversized distribution systems stagnation zones in pipe networks or aging infrastructure might want to consider spatiotemporal expansion of chlorine surveillance to detect

over 50 of utilities were at least somewhat concerned about pathogen growth in building plumbing less than 10 had or were developing a monitoring and control plan awwa 2018 public water systems and building managers considering recruitment of consumers for disinfectant monitoring could reduce initial materials costs by about 84 if the default digital colorimeter is replaced with inexpensive

building water stagnation in the covid 19 global pandemic the ongoing covid 19 global pandemic has caused a radical shift in working habits reducing building occupancy and concerns about the danger of

residuals in certain sections of their distribution systems during the pandemic have responded by increasing system flushing spearing et al 2020 as reduced and or rotational occupancy of buildings become the norm in the foreseeable future building owners managers and residents may be asked or take the initiative to monitor chlorine residuals and even conduct flushing to maintain water quality 4 conclusions this is the first research to design implement and vet a citizen science approach to citywide chlorine monitoring we empowered residents who wished to collect independent chlorine data for comparison to the official state data and reached the following conclusions the color wheel is an easy inexpensive and robust citizen science tool for regular monitoring of chlorine residual by consumers citizen monitoring can vet official pronouncements of stable chlorine residuals in a water distribution system when exposing problems during a water crisis federal emergency or routine monitoring synchronizing the flushing time can resolve some and perhaps all of the statistically higher chlorine measurements in official testing compared with citizen data a combination of citizen training financial incentives and high personal commitment were needed to make this effort successful during more routine monitoring whereas financial incentives were not needed when residents were highly motivated to expose perceptions of dangerous water a decision tree based on color wheel chlorine measurements flushing water heater temperature and water utility actions might eventually gain approval to help consumers maintain good disinfection and reduce legionella risk in homes and buildings the work provides a methodology to scale up chorine surveillance embracing the proposed vision of citizen science as a core tenet of environmental protection at the epa nacept 2016 in this case for a vitally important water quality measurement that could help address the primary source of

16838,rising incidence of waterborne diseases including legionellosis linked to low chlorine residuals in buildings and the availability of inexpensive testing options create an opportunity for citizen science chorine monitoring to complement sampling done by water utilities university researchers and flint residents coordinated a citizen science chlorine surveillance campaign in flint michigan in 2015 19 that helped expose the nature of two deadly legionnaires disease outbreaks in 2014 2015 during the flint water crisis and progress of system recovery during the federal emergency results obtained with an inexpensive color wheel were in agreement with a digital colorimeter r2 0 99 p 2 81 10 21 at 15 sites geographically distributed across flint blinded tests revealed good agreement between official n 2051 and citizen n 654 data in terms of determining whether regulatory guidelines for chlorine were met but a discovery that the citizen data were statistically lower than the city s p 0 00001 especially in warm summer months led to recommendations for increased flushing of service lines before measurements this work suggests that expanded citizen surveillance of chlorine site specific flushing advice and guidance on decisions about water heater set point could help consumers reduce legionella risks in their homes citizen science initiatives for chlorine

disinfection revolutionized water treatment when it was introduced in 1908 leal et al 1909 cdc 1999 awwa 2018 since the early 20th century maintaining appropriately high chlorine residual levels in the water distribution system has been required to inactivate fecal pathogens and the concept of too much free chlorine generally arose only when consumers reported skin irritation swimming pool odor and taste issues or excess pipe corrosion suffet et al 1996 rushing and edwards 2004 al jasser 2007 gurian and tarr 2011 sarver et al 2011 near the end of the 20th century concerns over carcinogenic byproducts from chlorine disinfection were addressed through the stage 1 and stage 2 disinfection byproducts rule creating regulatory pressure to remove organic matter lower chlorine doses or use alternative residual disinfectants such as chloramine usepa 2005 this led to several unintended consequences first a well intentioned switch from chlorine to chloramine to reduce total trihalomethanes in washington d c triggered a massive water lead contamination event edwards et al 2004 edwards et al 2009 confirming a hypothesis that high levels of free chlorine had been acting as a form of lead corrosion control schock 1989 edwards 2004 edwards and dudi 2004 schock and giani 2004 lytle and schock 2005 second it was recently discovered that opportunistic pathogens growing inside premise i e building plumbing such as legionella pneumophila and non tuberculous mycobacteria are now the major source of waterborne diseases hospitalizations and deaths in developed countries nrc 2004 falkinham et al 2015 collier et al 2021 and regulations have not yet responded to a possible need for increased chlorine or chloramine residuals to help reduce these risks in buildings and homes third although unrelated to the united states tthm rule over 2300 people became sick and seven individuals died in the 2000 walkerton canada disaster due to high levels of escherichia coli 0157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni in drinking water from failure to maintain appropriately high chlorine residuals and it was revealed that there was falsification of chlorine residual records covering up problems with chlorine dose hrudey et al 2003 all three of these issues were of concern in the 2014 15 flint water crisis fwc and its aftermath a failure to maintain federally required corrosion control during a switch in source waters caused destabilization of pipe scales containing iron and lead reduced chlorine levels boil water orders and two legionnaires disease ld outbreaks killing at least 13 and perhaps as many as 70 people schwake et al 2016 pieper et al 2017 rhoads et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 zahran et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 nelson et al 2020 delayed public reporting of these legionella deaths and falsification of lead monitoring results created justifiable widespread public distrust in the water and a state of science anarchy in which the word of government agencies regarding water safety was not trusted by residents roy 2017 roy and edwards 2019 although there is no evidence of falsified official chlorine data during the fwc we did note during our august 2015 field sampling and sustained monitoring of one flint home later in 2015 that chlorine levels were often undetectable in residences edwards 2015 flintwaterstudy 2015 officially reported chlorine levels did wildly fluctuate due to hyperchlorination sometimes exceeding the 4 mg l maximum residual disinfectant level i e 7 mg l masten et al 2016 which likely contributed to skin irritation rashes and chlorine odor complaints from flint residents u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2016 the haphazard dosing practices and lack of corrosion control also led to dbp violations and boil water advisories due to fecal contamination masten et al 2016 allen et al 2017 goodwill et al 2018 the lack of orthophosphate high chloride concentrations from flint river and corrosion of unlined iron pipes increased chlorine demand causing chlorine depletion in areas farthest from the treatment plant and producing instances in which 5 15 of official measurements did not have detectable chlorine flintwaterstudy 2015 masten et al 2016 rhoads et al 2017 we realized that the official chlorine monitoring at 10 officially selected distribution system sites 25 sites during the flint federal emergency arcadis 2017 could be supplemented with citizen science monitoring stations to independently check official data providing proof of concept that consumers might be able to monitor chlorine levels in their own homes that could someday contribute to making informed decisions about controlling risks of opportunistic pathogens this idea is analogous to the manner in which managers of large buildings are presently required to develop a legionella risk management plan cdc 2018 moreover in the absence of federal laws to control opportunistic pathogens in buildings usepa n d nasem 2020 there is an emerging need for simple robust and inexpensive chlorine monitoring by building managers and consumers to assess pathogen risks this is analogous to current recommendations that consumers should consider testing water in their homes for elevated lead and copper to assess the personal risks for exposure even if a city is meeting the epa lead and copper rule that was designed to reduce such risks across an entire city usepa 2017c 1 2 citizen science and public trust citizen science collaborations utilize public participation in research projects and data collection after training with appropriate instruments bonney et al 2014 cooper 2016 bates 2018 hammes 2019 and such testing can increase consumer confidence maik et al 2019 citizen scientists have monitored water temperature dissolved oxygen

expanded water flushing program implemented through 34 geographically distributed flushing hydrants in january december 2016 helped reduce problems associated with high water age residents were also enlisted to flush their pipes at no cost twice a day for 5 min over two weeks in may 2016 to remove sediment reduce water age and increase chlorine stability usepa 2017a arcadis 2017 masten et al 2019 roy and edwards 2019 officially reported chlorine residual levels increased and stabilized from low levels during the crisis and since october 2016 the flint system has been meeting a more stringent than required goal of 0 5 mg l as cl2 in 95 monthly samples and also meeting all dbp regulatory limits friedman et al 2010 arcadis 2018 trust in flint water remains very low with the latest poll showing that over 96 of residents used only bottled water for cooking and 60 using bottled water for bathing flint cares 2018 there are strong beliefs that chlorine residuals remain low and that the potential for growth of dangerous bacteria and legionella are high fonger 2017 fonger et al 2019 these fears were compounded by some misinformation about dangerous levels of chemicals and bacteria such as shigella in potable water after switching back to detroit water roy 2017 roy and edwards 2019 owczarzak and holland 2016 maki et al 2019 edwards et al 2019 gomez et al 2020 and later scientific evidence that this was not the case allen et al 2017 goodwill et al 2018 roy and edwards 2019 mcclung et al 2020 could not fully counter those fears to help address all of these concerns and examine a proof of concept for citizen chlorine monitoring that might someday help consumers manage their own legionella risks the authors executed a multi year citizen science effort to monitor chlorine residuals this investigative citizen science project relied on residents training residents in the appropriate use of both a standard digital field spectrophotometer digital colorimeter and a simple colorimetric disk color wheel not currently approved for compliance monitoring deem and feagin 2016 washington state department of health 2020 fig 1 a in this research we a evaluate the performance of color wheel versus a digital colorimeter for citizen monitoring of chlorine b map trends and examine the reliability of citizen chlorine residuals in flint versus official monitoring data for 2018 19 c identify human and financial challenges associated with monitoring and d discuss implications of at home chlorine monitoring to support legionella risk management strategies or to complement official data 2 materials and methods 2 1 official chlorine and water temperature measurements the chlorine residual and water temperature data from 30 official water distribution monitoring stations across flint including businesses community centers pumping stations and fire stations were obtained from monthly water quality reports archived on the michigan environment great lakes and energy website http www michigan gov flintwater the official sampling protocol requires flushing 10 30 min based on calculations to ensure data is representative of chlorine in the water mains us environmental protection agency usepa 2017b kristzian 2018 2 2 citizen chlorine measurements a university researcher co author mae on this paper first trained a flint citizen scientist co author lw on this paper in chlorine measurements and provided her with a digital colorimeter in august 2015 pieper et al 2017 lw monitored chlorine daily at her kitchen tap for three weeks in august september 2015 and reported 100 non detect chlorine measurements in real time on our website edwards 2015 rhoads et al 2017 she then trained other citizen scientists in use of the digital colorimeter and the color wheel one of seven trained citizen scientists on our team measured total residual chlorine every week at 14 locations fig 1b around flint mi including at eight official monitoring stations during june december 2018 and april august 2019 the following standard protocol was followed at each site a access a cold water tap b flush water for five minutes c grab water sample in a 10 ml aliquot and d process the sample on the pocket colorimeter ii dr300 or the color disc cn 66f manufactured by hach using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method apha awwa wef 1998 and note the reading for a small subset of data collection citizen scientists flushed for 10 40 min at 2 common sites during october december 2018 to help explain discrepancies between the citizen and official data to establish inter reliability between the two methods the color wheel range 0 3 4 mg l and digital colorimeter range 0 02 2 00 mg l were tested in parallel fig 2 at all 14 citizen locations on february 13 2020 testing was also conducted in the household of a flint citizen scientist which has high water age and characteristically low 0 2 mg l chlorine concentrations on august 13 2020 the citizen scientist co authors on this paper also innovated the following additional steps a take pictures of chlorine readings on their smartphones b create notes of the sampling site date and time on the image itself fig 1a and c send the records to another citizen scientist km who uploaded all image files to a shared drive and entered all chlorine measurement data in mg l as cl2 on a shared spreadsheet 2 3 statistical analyses all data were analyzed in microsoft excel version 2019 and rstudio version 3 3 2 a p value of 0 05 with an alpha value α of 0 05 was selected to determine statistical significance the pearson s coefficient correlation test was used to examine the association between chlorine measurements from color wheel and digital colorimeter 3 results and discussion 3 1 color wheel is an inexpensive and robust citizen science tool the color wheel performed well compared to the digital colorimeter fig 2 and recording near identical measurements in the 0 1 2 mg l as cl2 range r2 0 99 p 2 81 10 21 the digital colorimeter an industry standard costs roughly seven times the simpler color wheel us 457 vs us 65 but both use the same standard method and reagents apha awwa wef 1998 for high chlorine concentration solutions 0 05 0 5 that require serial dilutions like those used in ebola viral disease outbreak disinfection response measurement errors in the color wheel can exceed 10 wells et al 2016 however such discrepancies were not observed for the color wheel in our dilution free tap water testing supporting a general observation that simpler technologies might improve the accuracy and legitimacy of data collected by citizen scientists kosmala et al 2016 hadj hammou et al 2017 3 2 citizen science data and the flint water distribution system recovery after flint switched back to detroit water in october 2015 it began meeting the american water works association and partnership for safe water goal of 95 monthly samples registering free chlorine 0 2 mg l starting january 2016 as well as the flint specific goal of 0 5 mg l set by agencies assisting in flint s recovery beginning september 2016 friedman 2017 awwa 2017 this trend continued in 2018 19 per official monitoring data summarized in this paper fig 3 a which is also in compliance with michigan regulations of at least 95 sample measurements containing 0 1 mg l chlorine state of michigan 2014 of the 654 measurements made by citizen scientist co authors of this article fig 3b almost 90 n 585 were 0 2 mg l demonstrating satisfactory residuals for most distributed water the sentinel home of citizen scientist lw began reporting detectable chlorine as early as august 2016 edwards 2017 rhoads et al 2017 but levels at this location were still low in 2020 with chlorine levels of only 0 1 mg l measured after 20 min of flushing fig 2 the citizen data were always significantly lower than official data unpaired two tailed t test p 0 00001 at the common sites with the average difference i e official chlorine citizen chlorine of 0 53 mg l range 0 11 to 0 94 mg l for measurements made every 10 or 11 days fig 3c this was later attributed at least in part to the shorter fixed 5 minute flushing time used in the citizen sampling to explain this discrepancy citizen scientists would eventually measure chlorine following extended flushing at two sites fig 4 b this resolved the discrepancy at one location but at the other site the mean official chlorine was still 60 higher than the citizen sampled chlorine it was discovered that the magnitude of the discrepancy between the citizen and official sampling increased with temperature fig 4a ii vs iv as might be expected if the chlorine demand of service lines and premise plumbing increases at higher temperature nguyen et al 2012 garcia avila et al 2020 these citizen science findings were eventually presented to the flint water interagency coordination committee and state of michigan officials fonger 2018 snyder 2018 intensive bacterial monitoring by epa our research group and others indicated that legionella levels returned to normal levels starting in 2016 schwake et al 2016 rhoads et al 2017 rhoads et al 2020 and there were no reported problems with regulated total coliform bacteria during the 2018 19 time period of this study city of flint 2021 moreover chlorine residuals are a complex function of water age water temperature water main materials on the journey to homes as well as factors specific to each home including its age types of premise plumbing materials and water use patterns al jasser 2007 hallam et al 2002 hua et al 1999 powell et al 2000 rhoads et al 2014 future citizen science studies could benefit from complementary measurements of pathogens and ascertaining specifics of premise plumbing in addition to the chlorine residual monitoring reported herein 3 3 people and funding challenges are a legitimate concern the research reported herein cost about us 1980 in total material costs i e 21 color wheels 1 digital colorimeter and reagents and us 25 000 in citizen scientist wages the wages would be reduced by a factor of about 10 per sample if consumers were to only collect routine samples in their home or neighborhood rather than attempting to replicate monitoring all over the city of 21 interested volunteers who were offered training webber 2017 and received color wheel kits seven citizen science co authors utilized color wheels for monitoring for a color wheel utilization rate of 33 7 of 21 were used 14 of 21 color wheels were not returned thus 1000 chlorine readings cost us 693 based on use of seven color wheels and 1000 powder pillow chlorine reagent packs and if the 14 lost color wheels are considered costs increase to us 1603 for comparison color wheels used in analyzing ebola disinfecting solutions chlorine levels in a prior study cost us 193 for 1000 tests using one color wheel and 1000 reagent packs wells et al 2016 in contrast official chlorine sampling relies on salaried government or contractual laboratory employees who are trained and required to take weekly measurements as this two year effort demonstrates trained citizen scientists can perform comparable surveillance given personal interest and funding availability in the absence of in depth training financial incentives and or high personal interest it might be hard to maintain a short or long term surveillance program of this nature participation in our 2015 collaborative efforts that helped expose the flint water crisis benefited from the perception that many citizens correctly felt it was a life or death situation financial incentives to residents for monitoring have precedent in federal lead and copper rule monitoring and in educational programs to reduce lead exposure per experiences in philadelphia new york cleveland and elsewhere jordan et al 2003 sunrise water 2011 newark education workers caucus v city of newark 2019 jaskositz et al 2020 such incentives might also be considered to encourage citizen monitoring of chlorine 3 4 expanded chlorine monitoring to manage opportunistic pathogen risks it is increasingly recognized that low chlorine levels in distribution systems may pose a health risk for opportunistic pathogens exposure in consumer homes and these important gaps in existing utility monitoring might be partly filled by consumer monitoring as described herein microbial sampling of water mains during warmer months in 13 chlorinated distribution systems in the us revealed culturable legionella pneumophila when water temperatures exceeded 18 c 64 4 f and chlorine residuals dropped below 0 1 mg l lechevallier 2019 indicating increased risk of legionella entering buildings that could be further magnified by more growth of legionella within buildings similar trends have emerged for other opportunistic pathogens like mycobacterium avium norton et al 2004 pryor et al 2004 within individual building systems the national academies recommends maintaining 0 3 mg l chlorine residual by boosting chlorine at the point of entry to counter legionella growth american society for heating refrigeration and airconditioning engineers ashrae 2015 american society for heating refrigeration and airconditioning engineers ashrae 2020 nasem 2020 there is some growing evidence that chlorine concentrations 0 5 mg l can significantly reduce detectable legionella levels alary and joly 1992 orsi et al 2014 rhoads et al 2017 zahran et al 2018 rhoads et al 2020 in a simulation of the flint system using premise plumbing reactors culturable legionella pneumophila did not persist even with residuals near 0 2 mg l martin et al 2020 it is also known that there are often neighborhoods with relatively low chlorine and high legionella risk that can go undetected with the utility selected distribution system monitoring sites utilities that report any households with water ages exceeding seven 29 utilities or 10 days 15 utilities awwa 2018 oversized distribution systems stagnation zones in pipe networks or aging infrastructure might want to consider spatiotemporal expansion of chlorine surveillance to detect

firstly applied as the superb carbon catalyst to activate peroxydisulfate pds for the degradation of bisphenol s bps via a non radical pathway results showed that ng had a very high catalytic performance and degraded most of bps within 20 0 min out performing many popular metal based catalysts the doped n atoms i e graphitic n and pyridinic n in ng were identified as the possible reactive sites for the pds activation it is proposed that pds could form the metastable surface bound pds complexes on the ng surface which promoted the bps degradation the ng pds system had a strong anti interference ability for the environmental background substances and a wide operative ph range so it had a good application prospect in the actual wastewater environment this study not only provides

formation of surface bound reactive species duan et al 2018 chen et al 2018 compared with the popular carbon nanomaterials ng prepared by detonation with negative oxygen balance explosives is considered to be a promising alternative for non radical activation of persulfate it is because ng not only has excellent sp2 hybridged structure large specific surface area but also contains a certain amount of doped nitrogen chen et al 2003 li et al 2015 greiner et al 1988 sun et al 2008 however to the best of our knowledge the catalytic performances of ng are rarely explored herein for

crystallographic structure defects functional groups and specific surface area of ng and graphite powder 300 mesh were determined by different techniques respectively details were presented in the supplementary data 2 2 experimental procedures the sequential scenario experiment was carried out in 250 0 ml a glass conical bottle containing 30 0 mg ng and 200 0 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs the initial concentration of bps is 50 0 mg l 1 the suspension was stirred in the dark at room temperature 25 1 c for 20 0 min to achieve an adsorption equilibrium adsorption stage after that pds with the final concentration of 4 0 mm was added to initiate the oxidation reaction oxidation stage as the decomposition of pds and bps may rapidly acidify the solution pbs 40 0 mm was used to maintain the solution ph at 7 0 preliminary experiment suggested that phosphate ions have negligible effect on the oxidation of bps at predefined time intervals 2 0 ml of suspension was filtered to separate the liquid and solid phases the collected ng was washed twice with 10 0 ml methanol to recover the adsorbed bps and the concentrations of bps in the filtrate and methanol were immediately determined by a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 the oxidation kinetics experiments were conducted by mixing 15 0 mg ng in 100 0 ml pbs buffer ph 7 0 containing 50 0 mg l 1 bps and 4 0 mm pds in 150 0 ml glass conical bottle with magnetic stirring at different time intervals a small volume of suspension solution was withdrawn filtered and then determined by hplc to explore the roles of reactive radicals different radical scavengers nan3 tba and methanol were added into the solution to quench the possible 1o2 oh and so4 respectively in addition a series of experiments were performed to examine the effects of pds concentrations different anions humic acid ha and solution ph on the oxidation of bps using the batch method described above 2 3 analysis bps was quantitated by hplc equipped with an agilent polar reversed phase c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm and a uv detector the determination wavelength and mobile phase were 258 nm and methanol water 45 55 v v respectively an emx plus electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker germany was employed to determine the possible free radicals and 1o2 in the reactive system using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents the concentrations of total organic carbon toc were measured using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ng for the purpose of comparison the morphology of ng and flake graphite powder was simultaneously characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a d it was observed that the graphite powder had an irregular lamellar structure while ng was primarily composed of agglomerated spherical and near spherical nanoparticles from the tem images it was clearly observed that the radius and size of ng were smaller which made the specific surface areas of ng 436 9 m2 g 1 be much higher than that of graphite 13 7 m2 g 1 fig 1e presents the xrd pattern of ng where a very intense and narrow peak at 26 5 and a small peak at 54 7 were observed corresponding to the 002 and 004 lattice planes of the graphite crystals respectively by comparing with the xrd patterns of ng and flake graphite the peaks at 26 5 and 54 7 were consistent well indicating the very similar crystal structure of ng and flake graphite the structure of ng was further investigated by raman spectroscopy as shown in fig 1f a small peak of d band 1346 cm 1 and a large peak of g band 1578 cm 1 were displayed where the g peak came from the vibration of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice and the d band was associated with the structural defects amorphous carbon and edges the ratio of the d and g band intensities i d i g was usually used to evaluate the defect and amorphous carbon contents of a carbonous material in this study the i d i g values of both ng 0 21 and graphite 0 14 were much smaller compared with that of other carbon nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide etc xie et al 2017 suggesting their low amorphous carbon or defects contents table s1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps data illustrated that ng contained not only c 93 5 and o 2 54 but also n 3 35 fig 1g in contrast flake graphite was only composed of c 98 3 and o 1 7 3 2 catalytic performance of ng to distinguish whether bps was adsorbed or oxidized on the ng surface a sequential scenario experiment i e adsorption stage and oxidation stage was performed to evaluate the individual contribution of ng pds and ng pds to the removal of bps fig 2 a in the absence of ng it was found that the concentrations of bps in water was almost unchanged with time even in the case of pds addition this phenomenon indicated that bps was stable in water and a simple mixture of bps and pds was unable to trigger the oxidation of bps when ng alone was added into the bps solution adsorption stage fig 2a shows that the concentrations of bps in water declined rapidly and an adsorption equilibrium was reached within about 5 0 min meanwhile we determined the concentrations of adsorbed bps on the ng surface through methanol extraction it was showed that most of the disappeared bps from water could be recovered indicating that bps was mainly adsorbed on ng surface in the adsorption stage and no degradation occurred as pds and ng was simultaneously added interestingly it was found that the adsorption equilibrium of bps on ng was broken again and a second decline of the bps concentrations was triggered for example almost all bps in the bulk solution and on the ng surface disappeared within 20 0 min because all sites had been occupied when an adsorption equilibrium was arrived and no sites were newly created with the addition of pds the rapid loss of bps in the oxidation stage was thought to derive from the degradation of bps metal based catalysts fe2o3 cuo nzvi and co3o4 were employed to compare with ng for the bps removal fig 2b zhang et al 2014 previous studies had reported that nzvi is one of the most efficient catalyst for pds activation jiang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however as seen from fig 2b ng exhibited the best activation performance for pds among these catalysts further confirming its strong catalytic ability zhu et al 2018 fig 2b also displays the oxidation kinetics of bps in the ng pds system in which the curve was fitted by the pseudo first order eq 1 equation 1 ln c t c 0 k 1 t where c t and c 0 mg l 1 are the concentrations of bps in solution at a given time t and time zero respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order equation as stated above bps in the reaction system disappeared very quickly with the progress of the reaction and the degradation curve was fitted well by the pseudo first order equation fig 2b to further assess the role of pds in this reaction the effect of pds concentrations on the bps oxidation was investigated at a fixed ng dosage 150 mg l 1 as depicted in fig 2c bps was sensitive to the presence of pds where merely 0 1 mm of pds significantly triggered the oxidation of bps with the further increase of the pds concentration to 4 0 mm bps in the bulk solution and on ng surface were almost completely oxidized after 30 0 min reaction indicating the oxidant role of pds in bps degradation reaction using toc analyzer we further measured the degree of mineralization as shown in fig 2d only about 10 0 of organic carbon remained in water after 20 0 min reaction suggesting that the ng pds system is a very effective approach for the removal of bps from water 3 3 effects of solution ph the effects of solution ph on the bps oxidation were displayed in fig 3 results showed that bps could be quickly removed within ph 5 2 7 8 and the change of ph in this range had no significant effects on the oxidation rate of bps comparatively the oxidation of bps was slightly suppressed at ph 2 9 and 8 5 previous studies and our preliminary experiment in deionized water demonstrated that the oxidation of phenolics catalyzed by persulfate could reduce the solution ph due to the generation of acidic bisulfate shi et al 2020 therefore the slowed reaction rate at ph 2 9 was likely due to the suppression effect of h in the bulk solution on the bps oxidation which was unfavorable for the reaction progress to the right in alkaline environment the catalytic efficiency of ng on bps degradation also slightly decreased which was likely related to the adsorption capacity of bps on the ng surface based on the pka of bps 7 42 and 8 03 and the zeta potential data of ng fig s2 both bps and ng were negatively charged in the alkaline ph range thus the electrostatic repulsion among the ng surface bps and s2o8 2 anions was not conductive to their contact each other and the subsequent oxidative reaction this phenomenon implied that the oxidation of bps occurred on the ng surface however albeit the slower reaction rates at ph 2 9 and 8 5 than these at other ph it should be noted that a high removal efficiency of about 97 0 for bps was still achieved after 40 0 min reaction this results clearly indicated that the pds ng system had a wide operative ph range and could be applied even in the acidic and basic environments 3 4 reaction mechanisms previous research had documented that the degradation of organic pollutants through pds activation by carbonous materials was usually carried out via free radicals i e oh and so4 non radical singlet oxygen 1o2 or surface confined persulfate complexes pathways jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020 to identify whether the reactive oxidative species ros such as oh so4 or 1o2 were responsible for the degradation of bps in the pds ng system a series of quenching experiments were conducted to probe the mechanism of pds activation through the addition of methanol to destroy the possible oh and so4 tba to decompose oh or nan3 to decay 1o2 as depicted in fig 4 the addition of methanol and tba had little effects on the oxidation of bps even when the added methanol reached a high dose 600 mm which clearly suggested that the free radicals i e oh and so4 were not the major reactive species responsible for the oxidation of bps in the pds ng system employing the epr technique we further in situ detected the possible production of free radicals in the pds ng system using dmpo as the spin trapping agent it was showed that neither dmpo oh nor dmpo so4 adducts appeared in the epr spectra fig 5 which was consistent to our above quenching experiment and verified that these two radicals did not take part in the oxidation of bps in the pds ng system although the addition of nan3 slightly suppressed the degradation of bps fig 4 the epr spectrum of the pds ng system using temp as the spin trapping agent did not show any signals suggesting no 1o2 occurred fig 5 interestingly in fig 5 a characteristic signal with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was found in the pds ng catalytic system this signal was assigned to 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidone 2 oxy 1 or 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox which was an oxidized derivative of dmpo and was generally caused through the direct oxidation of dmpo by the surface confined persulfate complexes according to previous studies jiang et al 2018 lee et al 2015 in contrast no noticeable dmpox signal was observed in control experiments with ng or pds alone because no free radicals i e oh and so4 and 1o2 were found in the pds ng system we speculated the oxidation of bps was likely caused by the surface bound reactive species of pds on the ng surface in this mechanism pds was proposed to bound onto the ng surface to form the pds ng complexes then the interface pds interaction induced the charge rearrangement of pds which not only weakened its oo bond but also made pds more reactive to organic pollutants lee et al 2015 finally the electron transfer from bps to the pds ng complexes through the sp2 hybridized surface led to the oxidation of bps and decomposition of pds using the liner sweep voltammetry lsv measurement a more direct evidence for the formation of pds ng surface complexes was provided as depicted in fig 6 an obvious current increase was seen on the ng glassy carbon electrode gce with the addition of pds suggesting the intimate interaction of ng with pds and the possible formation of pds ng complexes when pds and bps were added simultaneously a broad oxidation peak along with a significant current increase were observed which indicated the faster charge transfer and the accelerated bps oxidation in the ternary ng pds bps system based on previous literature the eminent catalytic abilities of carbonaceous materials for persulfate activation were usually attributed to different reasons such as their metallic impurities yu et al 2020 o containing functional groups structural defects wang et al 2016 or heteroatoms such as n and p atoms chen et al 2019 ding et al 2020 etc respectively however how did ng activate pds or what were the activate sites in ng to answer this question we firstly examined the possible role of metal impurities in ng on the degradation of bps pei et al 2019 liang et al 2020 according to liu et al liu et al 2008 ng was continuously washed with 3 m hcl and water the result showed that there was no significant difference in catalytic efficiencies between the treated and untreated ng suggesting that the degradation of bps is not due to the metal impurities in ng data not shown subsequently we compared the catalytic efficiencies of graphite and ng for the oxidation of bps fig s3 xrd raman and xps data demonstrated that the sp2 hybridized structure and partial properties such as structural defects and oxygen contents of ng were similar to those of graphite except ng contained the higher amount of n doping fig 1 and table s1 as displayed in fig s3a ng exhibited the much higher catalytic efficiency than graphite at the same mass dose about 49 0 and 100 0 of bps were removed from the ng system through the adsorption and oxidative degradation respectively within 30 0 min in contrast only 6 0 of bps were removed via adsorption from the graphite system and the addition of pds had insignificant impact on the degradation of bps increasing graphite to the same surface area dose with ng it was found that the increased graphite did not significantly enhance the degradation rate of bps fig s3b obviously the result suggested that the doped n atoms in ng rather than the defects and o containing functional groups likely played a key role in the pds activation to further verify the role of the n dopants in the bps oxidation we analyzed the n bonding configuration changes in ng before and after reaction using the xps technique as seen in fig 7 the n signal of ng was mainly composed of graphitic n at 401 3 ev 53 2 followed by pyridinic n at 398 3 ev 13 0 pyrrolic n at 399 7 ev 14 5 and nitric oxide at 402 6 ev 19 3 according to previous studies chen et al 2018 yu et al 2020 ye et al 2020 graphitic n had the highest catalytic performance among four n bonding configurations graphitic n with high electronegativity could attract electrons from the adjacent carbon atoms to form the positively charged carbon domains these activated carbon atoms would strongly interact persulfate to form the highly reactive surface bound complexes for pollutants oxidation via non radical pathway in addition it was reported that pyridinic n could also break the inertness of sp2 hybridized surface and facilitate the formation of the surface bound reactive complexes wang et al 2019 after reaction interestingly we observed that the contents of both graphitic n and pyridinic n declined from 53 2 and 13 0 to 47 9 and 10 9 respectively along with a synchronized increase of pyrrolic n from 14 5 to 22 5 this result was consistent with the observations of chen et al 2018 and indicated that the graphitic n and pyridinic n in ng were the active sites for pds activation and bps degradation ye et al 2020 additionally the xps spectra also showed that the o and s contents in ng increased after reaction fig s4 this suggested that many reaction intermediates were adsorbed or bound on the ng surface which not only shielded the active sites on ng but also caused the decline of the ng reusability fig s5 3 5 effects of environmental background substances all experiments above were performed in deionized water but the real wastewater and natural water commonly contained various background substances such as natural organic matter and inorganic ions previous studies demonstrated that these substances could influence the oxidation rate of pollutants in many catalytic systems duan et al 2016a shi et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in this study the effects of cl hco3 and ha on the oxidation of bps were examined as shown in fig s6 the presence of hco3 cl and ha presented a marginal impact on the pds activation and the bps oxidation suggesting that the pds ng system had a strong anti interference ability and could be applied in the actual water environment 3 6 oxidation of other bisphenol compounds the ng pds catalytic system was also tested to degrade bpa bpb bpc bpf and bpaf in order to verify its effectiveness for other bisphenol compounds except for bps fig s7 it was found that almost all of these compounds can be completely degraded in the pds ng system within 20 0 min reaction clearly suggesting that the ng pds system had the superior catalytic ability and could be used for the degradation of bisphenol pollutants in wastewater however for other organic pollutants the catalytic efficiency of this method should be further tested in the future to obtain a better knowledge on its selectivity and oxidation potential 4 conclusions in this study ng was firstly applied for the pds activation and the subsequent oxidative removal of bps from water compared with many metal based catalysts ng showed a much higher catalytic efficiency for the pds activation and mineralized most of bps within a short time in this reaction pds was activated mainly through the non radical pathway rather than the free radical pathway which made the ng pds system had a wide operative ph range as well as a strong anti interference ability for the environmental background substances therefore ng has the great application potential to the actual water environment it was found that the doped n atoms i e graphitic n and pyridinic n in the carbon network of ng were the possible active sites which facilitated the formation of surface bound pds complexes and the degradation of bps this work not only enriches the carbonaceous family used in the pds activation but also provides an insight into the possible reaction mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

the roles of reactive radicals different radical scavengers nan3 tba and methanol were added into the solution to quench the possible 1o2 oh and so4 respectively in addition a series of experiments were performed to examine the effects of pds concentrations different anions humic acid ha and solution ph on the oxidation of bps using the batch method described above 2 3 analysis bps was quantitated by hplc equipped with an agilent polar reversed phase c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm and a uv detector the determination wavelength and mobile phase were 258 nm and methanol water 45 55 v v respectively an emx plus electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer bruker germany was employed to determine the possible free radicals and 1o2 in the reactive system using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agents the concentrations of total organic carbon toc were measured using a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of ng for the purpose of comparison the morphology of ng and flake graphite powder was simultaneously characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1 a d it was observed that the graphite powder had an irregular lamellar structure while ng was primarily composed of agglomerated spherical and near spherical nanoparticles from the tem images it was clearly observed that the radius and size of ng were smaller which made the specific surface areas of ng 436 9 m2 g 1 be much higher than that of graphite 13 7 m2 g 1 fig 1e presents the xrd pattern of ng where a very intense and narrow peak at 26 5 and a small peak at 54 7 were observed corresponding to the 002 and 004 lattice planes of the graphite crystals respectively by comparing with the xrd patterns of ng and flake graphite the peaks at 26 5 and 54 7 were consistent well indicating the very similar crystal structure of ng and flake graphite the structure of ng was further investigated by raman spectroscopy as shown in fig 1f a small peak of d band 1346 cm 1 and a large peak of g band 1578 cm 1 were displayed where the g peak came from the vibration of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice and the d band was associated with the structural defects amorphous carbon and edges the ratio of the d and g band intensities i d i g was usually used to evaluate the defect and amorphous carbon contents of a carbonous material in this study the i d i g values of both ng 0 21 and graphite 0 14 were much smaller compared with that of other carbon nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide etc xie et al 2017 suggesting their low amorphous carbon or defects contents table s1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps data illustrated that ng contained not only c 93 5 and o 2 54 but also n 3 35 fig 1g in contrast flake graphite was only composed of c 98 3 and o 1 7 3 2 catalytic performance of ng to distinguish whether bps was adsorbed or oxidized on the ng surface a sequential scenario experiment i e adsorption stage and oxidation stage was performed to evaluate the individual contribution of ng pds and ng pds to the removal of bps fig 2 a in the absence of ng it was found that the concentrations of bps in water was almost unchanged with time even in the case of pds addition this phenomenon indicated that bps was stable in water and a simple mixture of bps and pds was unable to trigger the oxidation of bps when ng alone was added into the bps solution adsorption stage fig 2a shows that the concentrations of bps in water declined rapidly and an adsorption equilibrium was reached within about 5 0 min meanwhile we determined the concentrations of adsorbed bps on the ng surface through methanol extraction it was showed that most of the disappeared bps from water could be recovered indicating that bps was mainly adsorbed on ng surface in the adsorption stage and no degradation occurred as pds and ng was simultaneously added interestingly it was found that the adsorption equilibrium of bps on ng was broken again and a second decline of the bps concentrations was triggered for example almost all bps in the bulk solution and on the ng surface disappeared within 20 0 min because all sites had been occupied when an adsorption equilibrium was arrived and no sites were newly created with the addition of pds the rapid loss of bps in the oxidation stage was thought to derive from the degradation of bps metal based catalysts fe2o3 cuo nzvi and co3o4 were employed to compare with ng for the bps removal fig 2b zhang et al 2014 previous studies had reported that nzvi is one of the most efficient catalyst for pds activation jiang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however as seen from fig 2b ng exhibited the best activation performance for pds among these catalysts further confirming its strong catalytic ability zhu et al 2018 fig 2b also displays the oxidation kinetics of bps in the ng pds system in which the curve was fitted by the pseudo first order eq 1 equation 1 ln c t c 0 k 1 t where c t and c 0 mg l 1 are the concentrations of bps in solution at a given time t and time zero respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order equation as stated above bps in the reaction system disappeared very quickly with the progress of the reaction and the degradation curve was fitted well by the pseudo first order equation fig 2b to further assess the role of pds in this reaction the effect of pds concentrations on the bps oxidation was investigated at a fixed ng dosage 150 mg l 1 as depicted in fig 2c bps was sensitive to the presence of pds where merely 0 1 mm of pds significantly triggered the oxidation of bps with the further increase of the pds concentration to 4 0 mm bps in the bulk solution and on ng surface were almost completely oxidized after 30 0 min reaction indicating the oxidant role of pds in bps degradation reaction using toc analyzer we further measured the degree of mineralization as shown in fig 2d only about 10 0 of organic carbon remained in water after 20 0 min reaction suggesting that the ng pds system is a very effective approach for the removal of bps from water 3 3 effects of solution ph the effects of solution ph on the bps oxidation were displayed in fig 3 results showed that bps could be quickly removed within ph 5 2 7 8 and the change of ph in this range had no significant effects on the oxidation rate of bps comparatively the oxidation of bps was slightly suppressed at ph 2 9 and 8 5 previous studies and our preliminary experiment in deionized water demonstrated that the oxidation of phenolics catalyzed by persulfate could reduce the solution ph due to the generation of acidic bisulfate shi et al 2020 therefore the slowed reaction rate at ph 2 9 was likely due to the suppression effect of h in the bulk solution on the bps oxidation which was unfavorable for the reaction progress to the right in alkaline environment the catalytic efficiency of ng on bps degradation also slightly decreased which was likely related to the adsorption capacity of bps on the ng surface based on the pka of bps 7 42 and 8 03 and the zeta potential data of ng fig s2 both bps and ng were negatively charged in the alkaline ph range thus the electrostatic repulsion among the ng surface bps and s2o8 2 anions was not conductive to their contact each other and the subsequent oxidative reaction this phenomenon implied that the oxidation of bps occurred on the ng surface however albeit the slower reaction rates at ph 2 9 and 8 5 than these at other ph it should be noted that a high removal efficiency of about 97 0 for bps was still achieved after 40 0 min reaction this results clearly indicated that the pds ng system had a wide operative ph range and could be applied even in the acidic and basic environments 3 4 reaction mechanisms previous research had documented that the degradation of organic pollutants through pds activation by carbonous materials was usually carried out via free radicals i e oh and so4 non radical singlet oxygen 1o2 or surface confined persulfate complexes pathways jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020 to identify whether the reactive oxidative species ros such as oh so4 or 1o2 were responsible for the degradation of bps in the pds ng system a series of quenching experiments were conducted to probe the mechanism of pds activation through the addition of methanol to destroy the possible oh and so4 tba to decompose oh or nan3 to decay 1o2 as depicted in fig 4 the addition of methanol and tba had little effects on the oxidation of bps even when the added methanol reached a high dose 600 mm which clearly suggested that the free radicals i e oh and so4 were not the major reactive species responsible for the oxidation of bps in the pds ng system employing the epr technique we further in situ detected the possible production of free radicals in the pds ng system using dmpo as the spin trapping agent it was showed that neither dmpo oh nor dmpo so4 adducts appeared in the epr spectra fig 5 which was consistent to our above quenching experiment and verified that these two radicals did not take part in the oxidation of bps in the pds ng system although the addition of nan3 slightly suppressed the degradation of bps fig 4 the epr spectrum of the pds ng system using temp as the spin trapping agent did not show any signals suggesting no 1o2 occurred fig 5 interestingly in fig 5 a characteristic signal with an intensity ratio of 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 was found in the pds ng catalytic system this signal was assigned to 5 5 dimethylpyrrolidone 2 oxy 1 or 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidone 2 oxyl dmpox which was an oxidized derivative of dmpo and was generally caused through the direct oxidation of dmpo by the surface confined persulfate complexes according to previous studies jiang et al 2018 lee et al 2015 in contrast no noticeable dmpox signal was observed in control experiments with ng or pds alone because no free radicals i e oh and so4 and 1o2 were found in the pds ng system we speculated the oxidation of bps was likely caused by the surface bound reactive species of pds on the ng surface in this mechanism pds was proposed to bound onto the ng surface to form the pds ng complexes then the interface pds interaction induced the charge rearrangement of pds which not only weakened its oo bond but also made pds more reactive to organic pollutants lee et al 2015 finally the electron transfer from bps to the pds ng complexes through the sp2 hybridized surface led to the oxidation of bps and decomposition of pds using the liner sweep voltammetry lsv measurement a more direct evidence for the formation of pds ng surface complexes was provided as depicted in fig 6 an obvious current increase was seen on the ng glassy carbon electrode gce with the addition of pds suggesting the intimate interaction of ng with pds and the possible formation of pds ng complexes when pds and bps were added simultaneously a broad oxidation peak along with a significant current increase were observed which indicated the faster charge transfer and the accelerated bps oxidation in the ternary ng pds bps system based on previous literature the eminent catalytic abilities of carbonaceous materials for persulfate activation were usually attributed to different reasons such as their metallic impurities yu et al 2020 o containing functional groups structural defects wang et al 2016 or heteroatoms such as n and p atoms chen et al 2019 ding et al 2020 etc respectively however how did ng activate pds or what were the activate sites in ng to answer this question we firstly examined the possible role of metal impurities in ng on the degradation of bps pei et al 2019 liang et al 2020 according to liu et al liu et al 2008 ng was continuously washed with 3 m hcl and water the result showed that there was no significant difference in catalytic efficiencies between the treated and untreated ng suggesting that the degradation of bps is not due to the metal impurities in ng data not shown subsequently we compared the catalytic efficiencies of graphite and ng for the oxidation of bps fig s3 xrd raman and xps data demonstrated that the sp2 hybridized structure and partial properties such as structural defects and oxygen contents of ng were similar to those of graphite except ng contained the higher amount of n doping fig 1 and table s1 as displayed in fig s3a ng exhibited the much higher catalytic efficiency than graphite at the same mass dose about 49 0 and 100 0 of bps were removed from the ng system through the adsorption and oxidative degradation respectively within 30 0 min in contrast only 6 0 of bps were removed via adsorption from the graphite system and the addition of pds had insignificant impact on the degradation of bps increasing graphite to the same surface area dose with ng it was found that the increased graphite did not significantly enhance the degradation rate of bps fig s3b obviously the result suggested that the doped n atoms in ng rather than the defects and o containing functional groups likely played a key role in the pds activation to further verify the role of the n dopants in the bps oxidation we analyzed the n bonding configuration changes in ng before and after reaction using the xps technique as seen in fig 7 the n signal of ng was mainly composed of graphitic n at 401 3 ev 53 2 followed by pyridinic n at 398 3 ev 13 0 pyrrolic n at 399 7 ev 14 5 and nitric oxide at 402 6 ev 19 3 according to previous studies chen et al 2018 yu et al 2020 ye et al 2020 graphitic n had the highest catalytic performance among four n bonding configurations graphitic n with high electronegativity could attract electrons from the adjacent carbon atoms to form the positively charged carbon domains these activated carbon atoms would strongly interact persulfate to form the highly reactive surface bound complexes for pollutants oxidation via non radical pathway in addition it was reported that pyridinic n could also break the inertness of sp2 hybridized surface and facilitate the formation of the surface bound reactive complexes wang et al 2019 after reaction interestingly we observed that the contents of both graphitic n and pyridinic n declined from 53 2 and 13 0 to 47 9 and 10 9 respectively along with a synchronized increase of pyrrolic n from 14 5 to 22 5 this result was consistent with the observations of chen et al 2018 and indicated that the graphitic n and pyridinic n in ng were the active sites for pds activation and bps degradation ye et al 2020 additionally the xps spectra also showed that the o and s contents in ng increased after reaction fig s4 this suggested that many reaction intermediates were adsorbed or bound on the ng surface which not only shielded the active sites on ng but also caused the decline of the ng reusability fig s5 3 5 effects of environmental background substances all experiments above were performed in deionized water but the real wastewater and natural water commonly contained various background substances such as natural organic matter and inorganic ions previous studies demonstrated that these substances could influence the oxidation rate of pollutants in many catalytic systems duan et al 2016a shi et al 2020 wang et al 2018 in this study the effects of cl hco3 and ha on the oxidation of bps were examined as shown in fig s6 the presence of hco3 cl and ha presented a marginal impact on the pds activation and the bps oxidation suggesting that the pds ng system had a strong anti interference ability and could be applied in the actual water environment 3 6 oxidation of other bisphenol compounds the ng pds catalytic system was also tested to degrade bpa bpb bpc bpf and bpaf in order to verify its effectiveness for other bisphenol compounds except for bps fig s7 it was found that almost all of these compounds can be completely degraded in the pds ng system within 20 0 min reaction clearly suggesting that the ng pds system had the superior catalytic ability and could be used for the degradation of bisphenol pollutants in wastewater however for other organic pollutants the catalytic efficiency of this method should be further tested in the future to obtain a better knowledge on its selectivity and oxidation potential 4 conclusions in this study ng was firstly applied for the pds activation and the subsequent oxidative removal of bps from water compared with many metal based catalysts ng showed a much higher catalytic efficiency for the pds activation and mineralized most of bps within a short time in this reaction pds was activated mainly through the non radical pathway rather than the free radical pathway which made the ng pds system had a wide operative ph range as well as a strong anti interference ability for the environmental background substances therefore ng has the great application potential to the actual water environment it was found that the doped n atoms i e graphitic n and pyridinic n in the carbon network of ng were the possible active sites which facilitated the formation of surface bound pds complexes and the degradation of bps this work not only enriches the carbonaceous family used in the pds activation but also provides an insight into the possible reaction mechanisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
