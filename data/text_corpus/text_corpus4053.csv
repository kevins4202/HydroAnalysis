20265,this article presents preliminary design formulas developed using a database of container ships built since 2015 artificial neural networks and multiple nonlinear regressions with randomly searched functions were used to develop these formulas the use of random search for nonlinear functions in a multiple nonlinear regression model gave estimates which were just as precise as estimates created by the artificial neural network all equations presented in this paper could have practical application for the estimation of dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught moulded and side depth the equations were developed in relation to deadweight teu capacity and ship speed these kinds of relationships have not been demonstrated before in ship theory a statistical analysis showed that the main dimensions of the container ships can be estimated highly accurately by using the equations presented in the paper the study showed that taking into account deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as three input parameters can improve the accuracy of an estimation by up to 44 percent than when compared to the estimate accuracy of the design equations which are based on one input parameter keywords ship design ann regression container ship main dimensions 1 introduction traditional ship design process is described as an iterative procedure in the form of a design spiral and was introduced by j h evans 1959 as shown in fig 1 the main stages of the ship design process are basic contract and detailed design basic design consists of the phases of concept and preliminary design the concept stage is carried out on the 1st circuit and the preliminary design stage through the next three circuits around the design spiral first the main dimensions of a ship are estimated at the preliminary stage as noted by papanikolaou 2014 a relational or empirical method based on comparative data from a similar built ship may be used to estimate main dimensions the use of empirical design formulas developed through regression fitting is a variation of this method there is a comparatively scant list of publications providing regression formulas to estimate the dimensions of container ships historically piko introduced one of the first collections of regression analyses in 1980 characteristics such as length breadth draught gross and net registered tons power and speed have each been regressed against deadweight nonlinear regression techniques were used to regress each of the above characteristics for container ships and other vessels the data source used in this publication was used to analyse a sample size of 10 334 ships including 289 container ships the main drawback of this study is that it is currently an outdated database kristensen 2013 published a set of linear and nonlinear regressions to estimate main dimensions ship mass and various design parameters these regressions were developed using a database of ships built between 1990 and 2010 kristensen used a teu container number for the estimation of ship dimensions papanikolaou 2014 published a set of nonlinear regressions to determine main dimensions light ship mass and the dimensional relations of many ship types including container ships regression formulas for estimating main container ship dimensions were developed by using deadweight capacity as an input parameter in this publication usually in the first phase of the design the dimensions of the ship are determined on the basis of one or two design parameters which are based on the requirements of the owner as noted by chądzyński 2001 teu capacity and speed are the main problems and deadweight capacity is a derivative problem in the design of container ships deadweight capacity includes but is not limited to the mass of containers ship stores and ballast storage mass clearly depends on the service range speed and total fuel consumption of the vessel fuel consumption depends on many factors such as ship resistance propulsion and other criteria however design characteristic estimates based solely on the number of teu containers does not include ballast and storage mass in addition to teu or deadweight capacity the speed of the ship is also a significant ship owner requirement the ship designer begins the design of the spiral using these parameters and estimates the main dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught and side depth at the early design stage the design formulas for estimating the main dimensions of the container ship proposed in literature do not take speed into account in recent years alternative design methods have been used for the preliminary design of ships these methods include a concurrent design method presented in elvekrok 1997 and chądzyński 2001 the multi attribute decision making madm approach presented in trincas et al 2018 the holistic approach introduced by papanikolaou 2009 or an integrated ship design method presented in la monaca et al 2020 the main aim of these methods is to shorten the specific design stages and to reduce the overall design cycle these methods treat ship design as a whole and use as much information as possible at all design stages including preliminary design it offers multiple design variants and an efficient selection method for choosing an optimal solution studies nikolopoulos et al 2020 as well as previous studies koutroukis et al 2013 soultanias 2014 and priftis et al 2018 can find the applications of holistic ship design optimization principles applied to container vessels in consequence during preliminary design the main dimensions of the container ship can generally be estimated by means of deadweight or teu capacity with the speed of the ship being an additional parameter this approach can reduce errors in the estimation of design parameters relationships between design parameters deadweight teu capacity and velocity developed by this method may also be used in concurrent and holistic design methods container ship design trends have been strongly influenced by market and trade demands over the years and even more so today the 2007 2008 financial crisis together with changes in fuel prices and strict emission requirements all had an influence on these trends these changes have also been influenced by the recent regulations limiting ship exhaust emissions as mentioned in soultanias et al 2014 and nikolopoulos et al 2020 these changes have created a completely new framework for the design of commercial vessels fig 2 shows the mean froude number and the ratio of container number teu to ship velocity v since 2000 this figure shows that the number of froude decreases and the ratio of teu v has increased since 2010 in addition the most recent container ships usually had a higher teu v ratio and a lower froude number froude number and the number of containers have a crucial impact on the main requirements of the ship owner such as transport capacity and ship speed in particular increasing the ratio of teu v and decreasing the number of froude increases the transport capacity of the ship changes the main dimensions and affects the ship design in order to take these trends into account in the design of container ships the updating of empiric formulas has become an important issue and is the main purpose of this study 2 aim of the research alternative design methods are currently used in marine technology these methods require the most complex and accurate design formulas to minimize design errors developing equations based on multiple input variables could improve the estimation accuracy and could be used in these methods therefore the aim of this study was to develop a set of complex design equations to estimate the main dimensions for modern container ships built from 2015 taking into account teu dwt capacity and velocity as follows 1 y f d w t t e u v where y estimated design parameter dwt deadweight tonnage teu twenty foot equivalent unit v velocity f a design formula to calculate selected design parameter y the second aim of this study was to identify the best parameter among all of the above which offered the most effective estimation of main dimensions 3 data collection the source of the data used in this study was sea web ships 2020 which is considered to be representative of the world fleet data from this database was used in this research for the latest new built container ship from 2015 to 2020 the quality and representative nature of the data set are of the utmost importance when using the regression method usually the use of poor quality data sets will lead to incorrect regression models and coefficients the sea web ships database contains a data set of 1183 container ships built in 2015 including sister ships of identical or similar dimensions the database was verified and only container ships of different dimensions were used in this study after this reduction the total sample size was 215 ships the following main dimensions were taken into account within this research length between perpendiculars lbp breadth moulded b draught moulded t side depth d vs dwt and teu capacity and velocity v the ranges of these parameters their ratios and froude number are summarized in table 1 4 research method in this study two estimation methods such as artificial neural network and multiple nonlinear regression with randomly searched function were used to estimate the main dimensions of the container vessel the following test statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the estimates pearson correlation coefficient pcc 2 p c c y y y e y e y y 2 y e y e 2 root mean square error rmse 3 rmse y y e 2 n where y output value from data set ye estimated output value by the use of regression model n number of records in data set 4 1 artificial neural network in recent years artificial neural networks have been used for ship design regression analysis for example alkan et al 2004 calculated the stability parameters of the fishing vessel through the use of neural networks an artificial neural network was developed to estimate the vertical centers of gravity and buoyancy and the transverse metacenter height using sample ship data ekinci et al 2011 used a neural network to estimate the main dimensions of oil chemical tankers cheng et al 2017 published a comparative review on the sensitivity analysis and simplification of the artificial neural network ann for ship motion prediction gurgen et al 2018 developed an artificial neural network to estimate the dimensions of the chemical tanker main dimensions of the ship such as overall length length between perpendiculars breadth draught and freeboard were determined on the basis of deadweight and speed of the vessel in this paper song et al 2020 used the radial base function artificial neural network to simulate ship rolling motion the disturbing moment and roll time series were calculated through the use of this method sahin et al 2020 estimated the dilution factors by using an artificial neural network model linked to main ship parameters on the preliminary design stage dilution factors were estimated through the use of gross and deadweight ton passenger number freeboard engine power propeller number and block coefficient in this study luan et al 2020 also used artificial neural networks to determine the fuel consumption of container vessels all the above authors argued that neural networks could produce more accurate models for complex systems than standard statistical methods the theory of an artificial neural network was created on the basis of a biological nervous system a biological nervous system is a structure consisting of neurons and the connections between them a numerical model of this neural network is based on the structure and signal transmission of a biological nervous system an artificial neural network is a collection of artificial neurons which are aggregated into an input output and one or more hidden layers haykin 1994 in a single artificial neuron input values xi are processing from previous layers through bias b weights wi and activation function φ up to the output value y as follows 4 y φ b i 1 n w i x i where x i input values y neuron output value w i weight b bias φ activation function the activation function φ transforms the total weighted input value to output node a number of different binary linear or nonlinear functions are often used as activation functions in hidden and output neural network layers in this study a standard logistic function was used as activation function as follows 5 f x 1 1 exp a the network structure consisting of a set of neurons activation functions and weights determines the relationship between input and output data lee et al 2016 the main challenges in the development of neural networks are the selection of the optimal network architecture and the calculation of weight values in this process the weight values are searched on the basis of input and output data until the network response is consistent with the results for this purpose different ann structures and training methods are used in this study a fully connected multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and activation functions of φ presented in 4 was used multilayer perceptron is the most popular ann structure hunter et al 2012 and is often used in data driven modelling a back propagation training method fausett 1994 haykin 1994 patterson 1996 with levenberga marquardt algorithm bishop 1995 shepherd 1997 and broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno method bishop 1995 broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 shepherd 1997 was used in this study an additional problem in the development of neural networks is what is known as an over fitting phenomenon this phenomenon occurs when the model has too many variables in relation to the sample size used for the regression a cross validation method is usually used to detect and prevent over fitting in this method the dataset is usually broken down to data used for network training a training set data used for network validation during training a validation set data used for network testing only a test set in this study 70 of all cases were selected for training on a random basis 15 were used for validation and 15 of the data that had never been used for training were used again for testing before the training process input and output data were normalized to the range of 1 to 1 this normalization generally speeds up the training of a network and leads to faster convergence the sum of the square error function sos was used as an error function in the development process statistica software tibco 2017 was used to develop train and test artificial the neural networks 4 2 multiple nonlinear regression a multiple nonlinear regression model is defined as follows adamowski et al 2012 6 y a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a k x i x j where y dependent variable x independent variables a0 a1 ak regression coefficients k observation number the following three general models based on model 8 were defined in this paper 7 model 1 y a 0 a 1 d w t c 1 a 2 v c 2 a 3 d w t c 3 v c 4 8 model 2 y a 0 a 1 t e u c 1 a 2 v c 2 a 3 t e u c 3 v c 4 9 model 3 y a 0 a 1 d w t c 1 a 2 t e u c 2 a 3 v c 3 a 4 d w t c 4 t e u c 5 v c 6 where a0 a1 a4 coefficients c1 c2 c6 real exponents selecting the best fitting functions in these models by using iterative method leads to a large number of possible variants a search through these variants though the use of an exact search algorithm can be computationally expensive and time consuming to solve this problem a random search method was used this method is based on two search stages in the first stage the real exponent values c1 c2 c6 are randomized then a0 a1 a4 coefficient values are regressed and the rmse and variance inflation factor values are calculated variance inflation factor vif is often used to measure and evaluate multicollinearity multicollinearity causes the model to deteriorate and occurs when the regression model predictors are fully correlated in practice a vif value exceeding 10 indicates a problematic degree of multicollinearity finally the best functions with the lowest rmse and vif values of less than 10 are selected through a looped search and their list is created block diagrams of this procedure is shown in fig 3 in the second stage of the search three of the most accurate functions with the lowest rmse in this list are searched more thoroughly in this procedure the real exponents c1 c6 are slightly modified by means of an iterated search the search order of each exponent is random so each is repeated several times as in the previous procedure functions with the lowest rmse value and vif value less than 10 are finally selected the disadvantage of this method is that the solution found may not be as optimal as the more accurate approach but multiple searches allow the discovery of a solution that could be close to the optimal result an example of a search for equations to estimate the length between perpendiculars using regression model 3 described in equation 11 is shown in appendix 1 5 results and discussion 5 1 design equations developed through the use of artificial neural networks the most effective solutions were obtained when using mlp neural networks with the following structures ann1 2 3 4 using dwt capacity and velocity v in the input layer ann2 2 8 4 using teu capacity and velocity v in the input layer ann3 3 7 4 using dwt and teu capacity as well as velocity v in the input layer the length between perpendiculars lbp breadth b draught t and size depth d were used in the output layer of these neural networks the structures of the neural networks are shown in fig 4 the mathematical forms of the neural networks are shown in appendix 1 by equations a2 1 appendix 2 provides an example of the practical use of the ann3 neural network for the calculation of ship dimensions table 2 and fig 5 show the rmse value of these neural networks broken down into training validation and test sets the table and figure show that the least accurate solutions were obtained using the ann1 network in which the dwt load capacity and speed were in the input layer the ann3 neural network with dwt and teu capacity as well as v in the input layer is the most accurate for estimating draught and size depth the most accurate method for estimating b and lbp was the ann2 neural network with only teu and v in the input layer in general the rmse values for all networks are relatively low table 2 also shows that the algorithms used made it possible to train the network quickly even over 78 training epochs the statistics for the test sets are particularly important as the data in these sets was not used to develop the networks only test them the neural network s ability to generalize new cases was verified by using the test set statistic values the rmse values for test data vary slightly from training and validation set statistics of the ann1 ann2 and ann3 networks these test set statistics show that these networks are probably not overfitted and could offer good generalization fig 6 shows regression between the estimated and data values through the use of the ann1 ann2 and ann3 neural networks this figure shows that the pearson correlation coefficient values for all models are high and were calculated as 0 986 0 989 0 989 0 992 0 992 0 993 and 0 994 respectively for the lbp b t and d dimension 5 2 design equations developed by the use of multiple nonlinear regression with randomized functions the following equations based on defined regression

knots fig 7 shows the values of the rmse relating to regression equation 10 21 the figure indicates that model 3 has greater accuracy than models 1 and 2 the rmse values of model 3 are relatively low and were calculated as 9 16 1 41 0 54 and 0 99 for lbp b t and d dimension respectively a comparison of the rmse values calculated for models 1 and 2 shows that estimating b and d dimensions using model 1 offers a slightly lower rmse value than using model 2 estimating lbp and d using model 2 offers a reasonably lower rmse value that using model 1 regression between the estimated and ship dimensions values through the use of regression models are shown in fig 8 this figure shows that the pearson correlation coefficient values for all models are high and their ranges were calculated as 0 994 0 995 0 992 0 994 0 988 0 989 and 0 990 0 992 respectively for lbp b d and d dimensions 5 3 a comparison of methods in terms of estimation accuracy table 4 shows the values of rmse relating to the best models of each method this table indicates that regression model 3 estimating lbp b and d is characterized by a slightly lower rmse value than the ann2 and ann3 neural networks the greatest differences in the rmse value occurred when estimating lbp while the smallest were seen when estimating d both methods were characterized by the same rmse value of draught t fig 9 illustrates estimations developed by using both methods when compared to sample ship data this figure shows that the dimension values estimated using both methods are close to an ideal form 5 4 model comparison relating to input parameters in addition common nonlinear regressions which depended on a single variable i e dwt or teu capacity were developed to investigate the effect of input parameters on the accuracy of the estimate as follows 22 l b p 3 656 d w t 0 38 23 b 1 15 d w t 0 32 24 t 0 624 d w t 0 27 25 d 0 349 d w t 0 37 26 l b p 3 16 t e u 0 34 27 b 3 27 t e u 0 29 28 t 1 571 t e u 0 24 29 d 0 349 t e u 0 33 fig 10 shows lbp b t and d estimated values as the full range of teu and dwt calculated by using equations 22 29 fig 11 shows rmse values relating to input parameters for models developed by using all methods presented in the article this figure indicates that as the number of input parameters increases the rmse value decreases standard regression models based only on dwt or teu capacity were found to be the least accurate this figure shows that rmse value variance between simple and complex models is up to 44 of the draught d estimation fig 11 also shows that estimation lbp using teu or teu and v as input parameters results in less rmse value than dwt or dwt and v as input parameters estimation b using teu as an input parameter results in lower rmse value than dwt as an input parameter estimation d using dwt or dwt and v as input parameters results in less rmse value than teu or teu and v as input parameters estimation d using teu and dwt as input parameters results in a similar rmse value 5 5 comparison in terms of computing time required to develop the different models fig 12 shows computing time required to develop the different models the models were developed through the use of a computer with a 2 ghz intel core i5 processor and 8 gb ram this figure shows that computing time required to develop artificial neural networks is 2 3 times lower than for regression equation developed through the use of multiple nonlinear regression with randomized functions model 3 takes almost 3 times longer than models 1 and 2 the longer computational time required to develop regression equations using multiple nonlinear regression with randomized functions results from a more complex calculation algorithm as well as the number of predictors and independent variables in the regression model 6 conclusions within this study a set of artificial neural networks and regression equations were developed to estimate container ship dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught and side depth through the use of deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as input variables neural networks and regressions were developed using data taken from most up to date container ships built since 2015 a statistical analysis of equations developed here confirms that results provided using artificial neural networks and multiple nonlinear regressions offer good correlation with container ship data and are characterized by high estimation accuracy the use of random search for nonlinear functions in a multiple nonlinear regression model gave estimates which were just as precise as estimates created by the artificial neural network however computing time required the development of regression equations by using random search takes more time than for training artificial neural networks the study shows that simultaneously taking into account deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as input parameters can reduce estimation error between 14 and 44 than when compared to the regressions estimation errors 22 29 which only take into account teu or dwt capacity similarly if we simultaneously take into account two input parameters such as dwt or teu capacity and ship speed this can reduce the estimation error between 7 and 38 than compared to regression errors the study also shows that the following input design parameters such as teu capacity offers more accurate estimation of the length between perpendiculars and breadth than dwt capacity dwt capacity offers a more accurate estimation of draught than teu capacity teu and dwt capacity offer similar error estimation of side depth d the equations presented here update the design equations presented in literature and could have a practical application in the commercial design of container ships but they may two limitations firstly all formulas may be inaccurate in the design of an innovative container ship secondly the equations were developed with container ship data with limited parameter ranges therefore these equations can only be used to estimate the dimensions for container ships with design characteristic ranges presented in table 1 the application of the developed equations to calculate ship dimensions with characteristics outside these ranges could be associated the risk of estimations that might be less accurate credit authorship contribution

20265,this article presents preliminary design formulas developed using a database of container ships built since 2015 artificial neural networks and multiple nonlinear regressions with randomly searched functions were used to develop these formulas the use of random search for nonlinear functions in a multiple nonlinear regression model gave estimates which were just as precise as estimates created by the artificial neural network all equations presented in this paper could have practical application for the estimation of dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught moulded and side depth the equations were developed in relation to deadweight teu capacity and ship speed these kinds of relationships have not been demonstrated before in ship theory a statistical analysis showed that the main dimensions of the container ships can be estimated highly accurately by using the equations presented in the paper the study showed that taking into account deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as three input parameters can improve the accuracy of an estimation by up to 44 percent than when compared to the estimate accuracy of the design equations which are based on one input parameter keywords ship design ann regression container ship main dimensions 1 introduction traditional ship design process is described as an iterative procedure in the form of a design spiral and was introduced by j h evans 1959 as shown in fig 1 the main stages of the ship design process are basic contract and detailed design basic design consists of the phases of concept and preliminary design the concept stage is carried out on the 1st circuit and the preliminary design stage through the next three circuits around the design spiral first the main dimensions of a ship are estimated at the preliminary stage as noted by papanikolaou 2014 a relational or empirical method based on comparative data from a similar built ship may be used to estimate main dimensions the use of empirical design formulas developed through regression fitting is a variation of this method there is a comparatively scant list of publications providing regression formulas to estimate the dimensions of container ships historically piko introduced one of the first collections of regression analyses in 1980 characteristics such as length breadth draught gross and net registered tons power and speed have each been regressed against deadweight nonlinear regression techniques were used to regress each of the above characteristics for container ships and other vessels the data source used in this publication was used to analyse a sample size of 10 334 ships including 289 container ships the main drawback of this study is that it is currently an outdated database kristensen 2013 published a set of linear and nonlinear regressions to estimate main dimensions ship mass and various design parameters these regressions were developed using a database of ships built between 1990 and 2010 kristensen used a teu container number for the estimation of ship dimensions papanikolaou 2014 published a set of nonlinear regressions to determine main dimensions light ship mass and the dimensional relations of many ship types including container ships regression formulas for estimating main container ship dimensions were developed by using deadweight capacity as an input parameter in this publication usually in the first phase of the design the dimensions of the ship are determined on the basis of one or two design parameters which are based on the requirements of the owner as noted by chądzyński 2001 teu capacity and speed are the main problems and deadweight capacity is a derivative problem in the design of container ships deadweight capacity includes but is not limited to the mass of containers ship stores and ballast storage mass clearly depends on the service range speed and total fuel consumption of the vessel fuel consumption depends on many factors such as ship resistance propulsion and other criteria however design characteristic estimates based solely on the number of teu containers does not include ballast and storage mass in addition to teu or deadweight capacity the speed of the ship is also a significant ship owner requirement the ship designer begins the design of the spiral using these parameters and estimates the main dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught and side depth at the early design stage the design formulas for estimating the main dimensions of the container ship proposed in literature do not take speed into account in recent years alternative design methods have been used for the preliminary design of ships these methods include a concurrent design method presented in elvekrok 1997 and chądzyński 2001 the multi attribute decision making madm approach presented in trincas et al 2018 the holistic approach introduced by papanikolaou 2009 or an integrated ship design method presented in la monaca et al 2020 the main aim of these methods is to shorten the specific design stages and to reduce the overall design cycle these methods treat ship design as a whole and use as much information as possible at all design stages including preliminary design it offers multiple design variants and an efficient selection method for choosing an optimal solution studies nikolopoulos et al 2020 as well as previous studies koutroukis et al 2013 soultanias 2014 and priftis et al 2018 can find the applications of holistic ship design optimization principles applied to container vessels in consequence during preliminary design the main dimensions of the container ship can generally be estimated by means of deadweight or teu capacity with the speed of the ship being an additional parameter this approach can reduce errors in the estimation of design parameters relationships between design parameters deadweight teu capacity and velocity developed by this method may also be used in concurrent and holistic design methods container ship design trends have been strongly influenced by market and trade demands over the years and even more so today the 2007 2008 financial crisis together with changes in fuel prices and strict emission requirements all had an influence on these trends these changes have also been influenced by the recent regulations limiting ship exhaust emissions as mentioned in soultanias et al 2014 and nikolopoulos et al 2020 these changes have created a completely new framework for the design of commercial vessels fig 2 shows the mean froude number and the ratio of container number teu to ship velocity v since 2000 this figure shows that the number of froude decreases and the ratio of teu v has increased since 2010 in addition the most recent container ships usually had a higher teu v ratio and a lower froude number froude number and the number of containers have a crucial impact on the main requirements of the ship owner such as transport capacity and ship speed in particular increasing the ratio of teu v and decreasing the number of froude increases the transport capacity of the ship changes the main dimensions and affects the ship design in order to take these trends into account in the design of container ships the updating of empiric formulas has become an important issue and is the main purpose of this study 2 aim of the research alternative design methods are currently used in marine technology these methods require the most complex and accurate design formulas to minimize design errors developing equations based on multiple input variables could improve the estimation accuracy and could be used in these methods therefore the aim of this study was to develop a set of complex design equations to estimate the main dimensions for modern container ships built from 2015 taking into account teu dwt capacity and velocity as follows 1 y f d w t t e u v where y estimated design parameter dwt deadweight tonnage teu twenty foot equivalent unit v velocity f a design formula to calculate selected design parameter y the second aim of this study was to identify the best parameter among all of the above which offered the most effective estimation of main dimensions 3 data collection the source of the data used in this study was sea web ships 2020 which is considered to be representative of the world fleet data from this database was used in this research for the latest new built container ship from 2015 to 2020 the quality and representative nature of the data set are of the utmost importance when using the regression method usually the use of poor quality data sets will lead to incorrect regression models and coefficients the sea web ships database contains a data set of 1183 container ships built in 2015 including sister ships of identical or similar dimensions the database was verified and only container ships of different dimensions were used in this study after this reduction the total sample size was 215 ships the following main dimensions were taken into account within this research length between perpendiculars lbp breadth moulded b draught moulded t side depth d vs dwt and teu capacity and velocity v the ranges of these parameters their ratios and froude number are summarized in table 1 4 research method in this study two estimation methods such as artificial neural network and multiple nonlinear regression with randomly searched function were used to estimate the main dimensions of the container vessel the following test statistics were used to assess the accuracy of the

of regression model n number of records in data set 4 1 artificial neural network in recent years artificial neural networks have been used for ship design regression analysis for example alkan et al 2004 calculated the stability parameters of the fishing vessel through the use of neural networks an artificial neural network was developed to estimate the vertical centers of gravity and buoyancy and the transverse metacenter height using sample ship data ekinci et al 2011 used a neural network to estimate the main dimensions of oil chemical tankers cheng et al 2017 published a comparative review on the sensitivity analysis and simplification of the artificial neural network ann for ship motion prediction gurgen et al 2018 developed an artificial neural network to estimate the dimensions of the chemical tanker main dimensions of the ship such as overall length length between perpendiculars breadth draught and freeboard were determined on the basis of deadweight and speed of the vessel in this paper song et al 2020 used the radial base function artificial neural network to simulate ship rolling motion the disturbing moment and roll time series were calculated through the use of this method sahin et al 2020 estimated the dilution factors by using an artificial neural network model linked to main ship parameters on the preliminary design stage dilution factors were estimated through the use of gross and deadweight ton passenger number freeboard engine power propeller number and block coefficient in this study luan et al 2020 also used artificial neural networks to determine the fuel consumption of container vessels all the above authors argued that neural networks could produce more accurate models for complex systems than standard statistical methods the theory of an artificial neural network was created on the basis of a biological nervous system a biological nervous system is a structure consisting of neurons and the connections between them a numerical model of this neural network is based on the structure and signal transmission of a biological nervous system an artificial neural network is a collection of artificial neurons which are aggregated into an input output and one or more hidden layers haykin 1994 in a single artificial neuron input values xi are processing from previous layers through bias b weights wi and activation function φ up to the output value y as follows 4 y φ b i 1 n w i x i where x i input values y neuron output value w i weight b bias φ activation function the activation function φ transforms the total weighted input value to output node a number of different binary linear or nonlinear functions are often used as activation functions in hidden and output neural network layers in this study a standard logistic function was used as activation function as follows 5 f x 1 1 exp a the network structure consisting of a set of neurons activation functions and weights determines the relationship between input and output data lee et al 2016 the main challenges in the development of neural networks are the selection of the optimal network architecture and the calculation of weight values in this process the weight values are searched on the basis of input and output data until the network response is consistent with the results for this purpose different ann structures and training methods are used in this study a fully connected multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer and activation functions of φ presented in 4 was used multilayer perceptron is the most popular ann structure hunter et al 2012 and is often used in data driven modelling a back propagation training method fausett 1994 haykin 1994 patterson 1996 with levenberga marquardt algorithm bishop 1995 shepherd 1997 and broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno method bishop 1995 broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 shepherd 1997 was used in this study an additional problem in the development of neural networks is what is known as an over fitting phenomenon this phenomenon occurs when the model has too many variables in relation to the sample size used for the regression a cross validation method is usually used to detect and prevent over fitting in this method the dataset is usually broken down to data used for network training a training set data used for network validation during training a validation set data used for network testing only a test set in this study 70 of all cases were selected for training on a random basis 15 were used for validation and 15 of the data that had never been used for training were used again for testing before the training process input and output data were normalized to the range of 1 to 1 this normalization generally speeds up the training of a network and leads to faster convergence the sum of the square error function sos was used as an error function in the development process statistica software tibco 2017 was used to develop train and test artificial the neural networks 4 2 multiple nonlinear regression a multiple nonlinear regression model is defined as follows adamowski et al 2012 6 y a 0 a 1 x i a 2 x j a 3 x i 2 a 4 x j 2 a k x i x j where y dependent variable x independent variables a0 a1 ak regression coefficients k observation number the following three general models based on model 8 were defined in this paper 7 model 1 y a 0 a 1 d w t c 1 a 2 v c 2 a 3 d w t c 3 v c 4 8 model 2 y a 0 a 1 t e u c 1 a 2 v c 2 a 3 t e u c 3 v c 4 9 model 3 y a 0 a 1 d w t c 1 a 2 t e u c 2 a 3 v c 3 a 4 d w t c 4 t e u c 5 v c 6 where a0 a1 a4 coefficients c1 c2 c6 real exponents selecting the best fitting functions in these models by using iterative method leads to a large number of possible variants a search through these variants though the use of an exact search algorithm can be computationally expensive and time consuming to solve this problem a random search method was used this method is based on two search stages in the first stage the real exponent values c1 c2 c6 are randomized then a0 a1 a4 coefficient values are regressed and the rmse and variance inflation factor values are calculated variance inflation factor vif is often used to measure and evaluate multicollinearity multicollinearity causes the model to deteriorate and occurs when the regression model predictors are fully correlated in practice a vif value exceeding 10 indicates a problematic degree of multicollinearity finally the best functions with the lowest rmse and vif values of less than 10 are selected through a looped search and their list is created block diagrams of this procedure is shown in fig 3 in the second stage of the search three of the most accurate functions with the lowest rmse in this list are searched more thoroughly in this procedure the real exponents c1 c6 are slightly modified by means of an iterated search the search order of each exponent is random so each is repeated several times as in the previous procedure functions with the lowest rmse value and vif value less than 10 are finally selected the disadvantage of this method is that the solution found may not be as optimal as the more accurate approach but multiple searches allow the discovery of a solution that could be close to the optimal result an example of a search for equations to estimate the length between perpendiculars using regression model 3 described in equation 11 is shown in appendix 1 5 results and discussion 5 1 design equations developed through the use of artificial neural networks the most effective solutions were obtained when using mlp neural networks with the following structures ann1 2 3 4 using dwt capacity and velocity v in the input layer ann2 2 8 4 using teu capacity and velocity v in the input layer ann3 3 7 4 using dwt and teu capacity as well as velocity v in the input layer the length between perpendiculars lbp breadth b draught t and size depth d were used in the output layer of these neural networks the structures of the neural networks are shown in fig 4 the mathematical forms of the neural networks are shown in appendix 1 by equations a2 1 appendix 2 provides an example of the practical use of the ann3 neural network for the calculation of ship dimensions table 2 and fig 5 show the rmse value of these neural networks broken down into training validation and test sets the table and figure show that the least accurate solutions were obtained using the ann1 network in which the dwt load capacity and speed were in the input layer the ann3 neural network with dwt and teu capacity as well as v in the input layer is the most accurate for estimating draught and size depth the most accurate method for estimating b and lbp was the ann2 neural network with only teu and v in the input layer in general the rmse values for all networks are relatively low table 2 also shows that the algorithms used made it possible to train the network quickly even over 78 training epochs the statistics for the test sets are particularly important as the data in these sets was not used to develop the networks only test them the neural network s ability to generalize new cases was verified by using the test set statistic values the rmse values for test data vary slightly from training and validation set statistics of the ann1 ann2 and ann3 networks these test set statistics show that these networks are probably not overfitted and could offer good generalization fig 6 shows regression between the estimated and data values through the use of the ann1 ann2 and ann3 neural networks this figure shows that the pearson correlation coefficient values for all models are high and were calculated as 0 986 0 989 0 989 0 992 0 992 0 993 and 0 994

and were calculated as 9 16 1 41 0 54 and 0 99 for lbp b t and d dimension respectively a comparison of the rmse values calculated for models 1 and 2 shows that estimating b and d dimensions using model 1 offers a slightly lower rmse value than using model 2 estimating lbp and d using model 2 offers a reasonably lower rmse value that using model 1 regression between the estimated and ship dimensions values through the use of regression models are shown in fig 8 this figure shows that the pearson correlation coefficient values for all models are high and their ranges were calculated as

differences in the rmse value occurred when estimating lbp while the smallest were seen when estimating d both methods were characterized by the same rmse value of draught t fig 9 illustrates estimations developed by using both methods when compared to sample ship data this figure shows that the dimension values estimated using both methods are close to an ideal form 5 4 model comparison relating to input parameters in addition common nonlinear regressions which depended on a single variable i e dwt or teu capacity were developed to investigate the effect of input parameters on the accuracy of the estimate as follows 22 l b p 3 656 d w t 0 38 23 b 1 15 d w t 0 32 24 t 0 624 d w t 0 27 25 d 0 349 d w t 0 37 26 l b p 3 16 t e u 0 34 27 b 3 27 t e u 0 29 28 t 1 571 t e u 0 24 29 d

developed by using all methods presented in the article this figure indicates that as the number of input parameters increases the rmse value decreases standard regression models based only on dwt or teu capacity were found to be the least accurate this figure shows that rmse value variance between simple and complex models is up to 44 of the draught d estimation fig 11 also shows that estimation lbp using teu or teu and v as input parameters results in less rmse value than dwt or dwt and v as input parameters estimation b using teu as an input parameter results in lower rmse value than dwt as an input parameter estimation d using dwt or dwt and v as input parameters results in less rmse value than teu or teu and v as input parameters estimation d using teu and dwt as input parameters results in a similar rmse value 5 5 comparison in terms of computing time required to develop the different models fig 12 shows computing time required to develop the different models the models were developed through the use of a computer with a 2 ghz intel core i5 processor and 8 gb ram this figure shows that computing time required to develop artificial neural networks is 2 3 times lower than for regression equation developed through the use of multiple nonlinear regression with randomized functions model 3 takes almost 3 times longer than models 1 and 2 the longer computational time required to develop regression equations using multiple nonlinear regression with randomized functions results from a more complex calculation algorithm as well as the number of predictors and independent variables in the regression model 6 conclusions within this study a set of artificial neural networks and regression equations were developed to estimate container ship dimensions such as length between perpendiculars breadth draught and side depth through the use of deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as input variables neural networks and regressions were developed using data taken from most up to date container ships built since 2015 a statistical analysis of equations developed here confirms that results provided using artificial neural networks and multiple nonlinear regressions offer good correlation with container ship data and are characterized by high estimation accuracy the use of random search for nonlinear functions in a multiple nonlinear regression model gave estimates which were just as precise as estimates created by the artificial neural network however computing time required the development of regression equations by using random search takes more time than for training artificial neural networks the study shows that simultaneously taking into account deadweight teu capacity and ship speed as input parameters can reduce estimation error between 14 and 44 than when compared to the regressions estimation errors 22 29 which only take into account teu or dwt capacity similarly if we simultaneously take into account two input parameters such as dwt or teu capacity and ship speed this can reduce the estimation error between 7 and 38 than compared to regression errors the study also shows that the following input design parameters such as teu capacity offers more accurate estimation of the length between perpendiculars and breadth than dwt capacity dwt capacity offers a more accurate estimation of draught than teu capacity teu and dwt capacity offer similar error estimation of side depth d the equations presented here update the design equations presented in literature and could have a practical application in the commercial design of container ships but they may two limitations firstly all formulas may be inaccurate in the design of an innovative container ship secondly the equations were developed with container ship data with limited parameter ranges therefore these equations can only be used to estimate the dimensions for container ships with design characteristic ranges presented in table 1 the application of the developed equations to calculate ship dimensions with characteristics outside these ranges could be associated the risk of estimations that might be less accurate credit authorship contribution

20266,the interaction between an oceanic internal solitary wave isw and a prototype submerged floating tunnel sft is numerically investigated effect of oceanic internal solitary wave amplitude the relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline cross sectional geometry of the sft and the density ratio of the two fluid layers are analyzed at a potential application site the dynamic response of an sft composed of a tube joint mooring system forced by an oceanic isw is studied using finite element method fem modeling the numerical results show that the isw induced force can be effectively reduced by adopting a parametric sft cross section instead of a circle or ellipse the influence of the relative distance of the sft to the isw pycnocline is crucial and can remarkably alter the vertical force and buoyancy weight ratio bwr of the sft during isw propagation large shear forces and bending moments on the sft can occur affecting the tension in the mooring lines and threatening the safety and reliability of the sft system however the deflections and accelerations of the sft under the applied isw are within structural serviceability requirements due to the low frequency of the isw compared to the natural frequency of the sft tube keywords internal solitary wave submerged floating tunnel cfd dynamic response fluid structure interaction 1 introduction internal waves have been confirmed by satellite images and in situ observations as ubiquitous in oceanic environments vázquez et al 2008 klymak et al 2006 the mechanism of internal waves generation is generally as a result of stratified flows over topographic variations such as sills ridges and continental shelf edges corresponding to an energy conversion from barotropic tide into baroclinic internal wave ramirez and renouard 1998 hibiya 1986 internal solitary waves isws associated with non linear characteristics are representative of internal waves isw s have been recorded with amplitude over 170 m klymak et al 2006 and have been observed to penetrate the entire water depth these isws can induce large wave forcing and hence cause severe hazards to the operation and maintenance of marine engineering structures a moored submerged floating tunnel sft as a novel sea crossing infrastructure suspended under water is subject to the impacts of hydrodynamic loads induced by isws therefore if an sft is built in regions active with isw s it is imperative to analyze the characteristics of interaction between isws and the sft tube body the sft tube can be regarded as a cylindrical structure which is a common component of marine engineering structures previous studies of the isw s effect on cylinders have been carried out using numerous approaches ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 experimentally investigated the interaction of a small amplitude internal solitary wave and a horizontal circular cylinder in a two layer miscible fluid system and analyzed the effects of the pycnocline thickness and distance between the cylinder and pycnocline on the hydrodynamic loading on the cylinder wang et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the isw induced forces acting on a cylinder and explored the effect of splitter plates on force reduction using numerical simulations cui et al 2019 experimentally studied the motion and mooring force of a floating model under isw impact and found that the isw amplitude and the model size are crucial factors affecting the structural response ding et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic forces exerted by isws on extended and tandem cylinders using openfoam and verified their results against experimental data however due to the limitations of these small scale laboratory tests and simple sft cross sectional shapes considered the characteristics of interaction between isws and an sft under realistic oceanic conditions cannot be properly assessed by the experimental and numerical studies completed thus far empirical methods for isw induced load estimation mainly applies the morison equation si et al 2012 adopted the morison equation to compute the shear forces and torques induced by isws on a rigid cylindrical pile under continuously stratified ocean conditions in the south china sea cai et al 2003 2006 2008 and used the morison equation modal separation and linear regression analysis to estimate the forces and torques resulting from isws with and without shear flow on vertical cylindrical piles and proposed a simple isw induced force prediction method based on the dominant term of the global force lin and zan 2021 discussed the influence of adopting local or global empirical parameters on the predictability of the isw force on a cylinder using the morison equation and concluded that the contribution of the nonlinear term is significant however the resulting modified coefficients in the morison formula are not universal but vary with the adopted isw theory and model settings research on the impacts of isws on other marine engineering structures is extensive song et al 2011 established an analytical model to compute the forces and response motion of a spar platform under isws where the drag and inertial forces are computed by the morison equation lü et al 2016 studied the impacts of a parabolic background current on force and torque exerted by isws on the tendon legs of a tension leg platform using the morison equation chen et al 2017 2020 experimentally measured the forces and pitch moments exerted by isws on a semi submersible model to obtain empirical coefficients based on the morison equation and examined various wave propagation directions concluding that the inline and transverse forces are affected significantly by isws direction however most previous studies focused on vertical cylindrical offshore structures with comparatively small diameters such as vertical piles or tendon legs investigations of isw impacts on a large diameter horizontal cylinder such as an sft are lacking moreover due to the specific structural characteristics of an sft its buoyancy weight ratio bwr has a dominant effect on its mooring tension and dynamic response which influences the serviceability and reliability of the coupled sft system the internal wave can directly change the structural buoyancy and hence change the bwr most previous research on isw s and marine engineering structures focused either on the detailed turbulent flow forces induced by the isw or on the structural response but combining turbulent flow simulation with structural dynamic response analysis in a systematic assessment had not yet been accomplished to eliminate the scale effect this present paper studies a full scale prototype sft subjected to oceanic isw characteristics of the detailed isw sft interaction during isw evolution are revealed using computational fluid dynamics cfd dynamic response analysis for a coupled tube joint mooring system is then carried out to analyze the isw impacts on the sft the paper is structured as follows the applied isw theory and oceanic isw properties are described in section 2 section 3 introduces the model set up and numerical validation section 4 quantifies the influence of the isw amplitude the sft cross sectional shape the distance from the sft to the pycnocline and the fluid density ratio on the isw sft interaction the dynamic response of the sft in oceanic isw conditions is analyzed and the effects of bwr change on the structural internal forcing are discussed in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 isw wave theory at present there are several wave theories that can be applied to describe the shape of an isw the korteweg de vries kdv theory formulated by diederic korteweg and gustav de vires can be adopted to analytically define the internal wave profile this theory is only suitable for small amplitude and weakly nonlinear and dispersive waves koop and butler 1981 by increasing its nonlinearity an extended kdv ekdv kakutani and yamasaki 1978 wave theory containing both quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms can be applied moreover a modified kdv theory mkdv is formulated for large amplitude internal waves michallet and barthélémy 1998 the interface displacement governed by the mkdv theory is expressed by eq 1 1 ζ x t a sech 2 κ x c m k d v t 1 μ tanh 2 κ x c m k d v t where a is the internal wave amplitude c mkdv is

of internal wave structure inside the strait is not the aim of this research but rather to approximate the isw s observed in the region for a conservative analysis of the sft dynamic response therefore the isw characteristics recorded at wenchang station are applied for the analysis of hydrodynamic forces serviceability and reliability of the sft in this study since the measured isw amplitude is quite large compared with the strait depth of around 100 m the mkdv theory is adopted for the isw description in this study 3 numerical model 3 1 model setup most sft s have been designed with simple cross section shapes such as square polygonal circular or elliptical the circular and elliptical shapes exhibit more streamlined hydrodynamic behavior experiencing smaller displacements and less stress than other bluff shapes gang et al 2018 li and jiang 2016 a parametric method using machine learning to predict the optimal sft cross section shape for improving the hydrodynamic performance was presented in zou et al 2020b zou et al 2020c where the objective is to minimize the hydrodynamic forces time averaged drag and root mean square lift on the sft the parametric shape has been compared with the simpler circular and elliptical shapes under extreme events zou et al 2020a in the current study parametric circular and elliptical shapes for the sft cross section with equal clearance 5 m 11 m applied in previous research are compared under isw conditions assuming the tunnel wall thickness is 1 m the maximum width and height of the parametric circular and elliptical shapes are 20 m 10 m 14 m 14 m and 16 m 10 m respectively a two dimensional numerical isw tank is generated using ansys fluent to simulate the interaction between an isw and the sft fig 2 a the computational domain is 4500 m in length and 100 m in height filled with a stratified two layer fluid the center of the sft is located 200 m from the inlet the thicknesses of the upper layer and lower layer fluids are 30 m and 70 m respectively for a typical case the isw the amplitude a is selected as 20 m with a characteristic wavelength of 144 m the densities of the fluids in the upper layer and lower layer are 1022 kg m3 and 1024 kg m3 respectively based on the actual oceanic condition in which the oceanic density difference is generally less than 3 4 kg m3 zhu et al 2016 the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 with a dispersed type interface model is applied to capture the pycnocline since the surface wave amplitude is relatively small compared with the isw amplitude the top boundary is assumed to be a rigid lid in all simulations freestream quantities of turbulence intensity and turbulence length scale are specified at the inlet boundary as per zou et al 2020d an outflow boundary is employed at the outlet a simplified no slip hydraulically smooth wall condition is applied on the sft cross section surface and the bottom boundary the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations with an rng k ε turbulence model are applied with a standard wall function the reliability of this model for hydrodynamic force prediction of the sft at high reynolds numbers was verified by zou et al 2020b the urans model was verified for its ability to provide sufficiently efficient and accurate isw induced force predictions liuet al 2020 and vortex generation simulation hsu et al 2004 however the detection of small flow features such as vortex dynamics in the boundary layer should be simulated by les or dns models which incur additional computation loads and are beyond the scope of this research the computational domain is divided into several blocks of different resolutions fig 2 b the subdomain around the sft cross section surface is a 30 m 30 m rectangular block with a high quality unstructured mesh including 40 layers of quadrangular cells that cover the boundary layer the first grid layer cell thickness normal to the sft surface is 0 003 m within the acceptable range of y at 30 200 kuzmin et al 2007 above this first cell the cell thickness stretches with a growth rate of 1 2 the subdomain within the isw propagation region has a horizontal and vertical mesh size of 2 m and 0 2 m respectively the adjacent subdomain crossing the sft has a minimum grid size of 0 4 m the structured mesh size in the rest of the subdomain is generally 2 m and in the damping zone an increasingly coarse mesh with a bias factor of 2 is set to cause extra numerical diffusion an adaptive time step was selected and the maximum courant number is set to 0 25 the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling a high performance computing hpc cluster is applied to run parallel computation tasks the direct inlet velocity prescription method is used to generate an isw at the inlet boundary by a user defined function udf ansys inc 2013 where the theoretical horizontal orbital velocities and surface elevation are imposed directly miquel et al 2018 and the pressure is set to be hydrostatic the udf specifies the velocity components and fluid volume fraction for each cell on the boundary cavaliere et al 2021 revealed that the pycnocline thickness affects isws kinematics for a thick pycnocline layer condition both the wave celerity and the velocity gradients decrease and the hydrodynamic force on the sft induced by the isw is reduced therefore as a conservative calculation of the hydrodynamic force on the sft only a thin pycnocline between the two layer fluid is added the thin pycnocline was set by a smooth tanh initial density distribution between the upper and lower layers as in ding et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 to avoid numerical instability at the interface in this study the isw horizontal velocity distribution in the pycnocline layer is given by a linear velocity transition between the upper and lower layers as shown in eq 17 17 u y u 1 u 2 d p y y c d p 2 u 2 where y is the vertical coordinate of the grid y c is the position of the mid pycnocline layer d p is thickness of the pycnocline layer in order to determine the appropriate pycnocline layer thickness a sensitivity analysis is carried out we consider three different pycnocline layer thicknesses 0 05 m 1 m and 5 m these are tested for the case with isw amplitude of 20 m sft relative distance from the pycnocline of 10 m and parametric cross section shape in order to shorten the simulation time fluid densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 in the upper layer and lower layer are selected respectively time series of the isw induced horizontal and vertical forces per meter on the sft for each pycnocline layer thickness are shown in fig 3 it can be found that numerical instabilities occur fig 3 a with d p 0 05 m while spikes can be effectively eliminated with d p 1 m or 5 m however as d p increases to 5 m the hydrodynamic forces on the sft are underpredicted with a maximum force deviation around 2 kn compared to d p 0 05 m whereas the difference in force computation between d p 1 m and 0 05 m is minor this indicates that stable and accurate results are achieved with a pycnocline layer thickness of 1 m and hence d p 1 m is adopted in subsequent simulations for wave absorption a dampening sink term given by eq 18 is added in the momentum equation within a damping length of 2000 m from the outlet boundary to avoid wave reflection ansys 2019 18 s c 1 ρ v 1 2 c 2 ρ v v f x f y where c 1 and c 2 are linear and quadratic damping resistance respectively f x and f y are damping functions for inline and cross flow directions respectively v is flow vertical velocity it features a combination of linear and quadratic damping which allows the use of either one or a combination of both approaches in this research c 1 10 s 1 c 2 10 m 1 3 2 model validation the dimensionless hydrodynamic force on an isolated cylinder is defined in eq 19 19 c x y f x y ρ 2 ρ 1 g a where f x and f y are horizontal and vertical force per meter on the cylinder respectively g is gravitational acceleration and a is the cross sectional area of the cylinder note that the forces on the cylinder are normalized in eq 19 and hence c x y is dimensionless if ρ 1 is close to ρ 2 the hydrodynamic force f x y will be close to 0 thus c x y will not be infinite numerical results are further verified by comparison to experimental data of horizontal force on the cylinder ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 and an empirical formula in this experiment the fluid densities of the upper layer and lower layers are ρ 1 1000 kg m3 and ρ 2 1021 kg m3 respectively the thicknesses of the upper layer and lower layers are h 1 4 cm and h 2 8 5 cm respectively the center of the1 5 cm diameter cylinder is located a distance of h 0 9 cm from the flume bottom the isw amplitude is 0 77 cm per the morison equation the horizontal hydrodynamic load per meter can be estimated by the sum of the inertial and drag forces given by eq 20 20 f x t 1 2 c d ρ d u u c m ρ a u t where u is the horizontal velocity component of the isw fluid particles which can be computed by using eq 14 c m and c d are inertia and drag coefficients respectively and can be set as c m 2 0 c d 1 2 based on previous studies cai et al 2006 cai et al 2003 the comparison of the horizontal hydrodynamic loads on the cylinder from each study is shown in fig 4 where vt h 0 is a dimensionless value from ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 it illustrates that the morison equation generally overpredicts the negative hydrodynamic force and underestimates the positive hydrodynamic force while the numerical simulation results provide a better agreement with the experimental data the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results can be attributed to a difference of the isw generation mechanism where a hump type isw was produced by the wave maker in the experiment while the mkdv theory is applied in the numerical simulation to elucidate the mechanism of isw sft interaction under oceanic conditions and investigate the influence of factors including the isw amplitude the sft relative distance to the pycnocline defined as the vertical distance between the centre position of the sft and the initial location of the interface between the two layers of fluids the sft cross sectional shape and fluid density on the sft hydrodynamics a sensitivity analysis is conducted by comparing the temporal variation of force coefficients on the sft the velocity and pressure fields in the vicinity of the sft at specific moments and the corresponding interface position of the two fluid layers 4 sensitivity analysis of influence factors 4 1 effect of isw amplitude cases of isw amplitude a 20 m 25 m 30 m and 35 m are selected with a relative distance to the pycnoclilne of 40 m parametric cross sectional shape and upper and lower layer densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of isw amplitude on the hydrodynamic force on the sft time series of force coefficient variation in horizontal and vertical directions for different isw amplitudes are illustrated in fig 5 positive horizontal force means the force direction is the same as the isw propagation direction and positive vertical force means the force direction is upward assuming that the initial condition is when the sft is neutrally buoyant it can be found that c x drops firstly to its negative maximum and undergoes a sharp increase to about double the maximum magnitude followed by a plunge and oscillation around the equilibrium after the isw passes over the sft it is worth noting that the larger the isw amplitude is the later the maximum negative force occurs for a large isw amplitude the isw can act on the sft surface directly and a strong interaction between the isw and the sft occurs along with fluid mixing and wave dissipation and reflection which prolongs the interaction time thus the larger the isw amplitude is the later the maximum negative force occurs however according to eqs 1 and 14 the isw s flow velocities increase with increasing the isw s amplitude and hence the isw with a large amplitude propagates faster than those smaller amplitude cases the irregularity in the temporal distribution of c x and c y for large isw amplitudes also indicates the complex mechanisms of the strong interaction between the isw and the sft it can be deduced that reflected waves bounce back from the sft contributing to secondary peaks and interfacial instabilities this also shows that the absolute maximum c x and c y increase with increasing isw amplitude the absolute maximum c x reaches 0 6 at a 35 m while the absolute maximum c y is 2 7 fig 6 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions of the two layers of fluids when the horizontal force coefficient on the sft reaches its negative maximum thus different characteristics of the isw sft interaction for various isw amplitudes can be clearly elaborated note that the negative maximum of c x increases with increasing isw amplitude which corresponds an increase of the isw water particle velocity magnitude in each fluid layer at a 20 m fig 6 a b the pycnocline keeps stable and no evident deformation of the isw profile or fluid mixing can be observed however at a 25 m fig 6 c d the isw profile gets distorted and mixing of fluids across the pycnocline is gradually generated above the leading edge of the sft as the isw trough approaches the sft the increasing velocities of both the convergence flow in the upper layer and divergence flow in the lower layer enlarge the shear stress at the interface which enhances disturbance of the flow and triggers mixing instabilities the thickness of the mixing layer increases with increasing isw amplitude the flow area is partially blocked by the sft and the isw profile distorts the interface of the isw is generally parallel to the upper left quadrant sft surface and steepens with increasing isw amplitude the isw energy is dissipated and backflow and mixing are generated making the flow field at the interface complex fig 6 d f for a 35 m fig 6 e f as the isw propagates the isw can act on the sft surface directly which can lead to reflection of the isw the irregularity at the local negative maximum of the horizontal force fig 5 a can be attributed to distortion of the isw shape and strong interaction between the isw and the sft however c x for a 35 m does not show an increase after the isw trough passes over the sft compared with a 30 m since the strong isw sft interaction for a 35 m dissipates the wave energy therefore the isw amplitude is reduced after passing over the sft 4 2 effect of sft cross section geometry circular elliptical and parametric sft cross section shapes are investigated for an isw amplitude of 20 m relative distance to the pycnocline of 40 m and upper and lower layer fluid densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of the sft cross section shape on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft time series of force coefficients in horizontal and vertical directions are illustrated in fig 7 the circular shape has the largest maximum absolute values of forces while the parametric shape with its streamlined curvature generates the minimum forcing oscillation among the three shapes it can also be found that c x of all three shapes in both directions decreases at first continuously increases afterward and gradually decreases back to its equilibrium the parametric shape experiences its negative maximum of c x at 150 s while the elliptical and circular shapes reach their negative maxima after 200 s as shown in fig 7 the circular shape s force signal has a lower oscillation frequency than the elliptical shape fig 8 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions of the two layers of fluids when c x on the sft reaches its negative maximum characteristics of the isw sft interaction as a function of sft cross sectional shape can be clearly elaborated for the circular and elliptical cross sectional shapes fig 8 b d the negative maximum value of c x generally occurs when the isw trough is above the apex of the sft the flow streamlines at the edges of the sft are distorted by the bluff body and the shape curvature in turn increases the velocity magnitude at the apex and nadir points furthermore as the flow passes over the sft the shear stress near the sft surface grows and the flow separates from the sft due to the strong adverse pressure gradient apg resulting from the shape curvature triggering a wide wake recirculation regime and periodic vortex shedding at the left edge note that the isw trough travels to the right resulting in flow toward the left in the lower fluid layer the vortex shedding process together with the steady pressure gradient amplifies the gross hydrodynamic force on the sft the horizontal force induced by vortex shedding partially compensates for the reduction in horizontal force when the isw trough is above the sft fig 7 a from fig 7 b the frequency of vortex shedding can be estimated to be around 0 03 hz the intrinsic isw characteristic frequency is 0 0078 hz based on eq 16 it can be deduced that the vortex shedding frequency is much faster than the intrinsic isw characteristic frequency vortex shedding affects the sft around 170 s before the isw trough passes over the sft and dissipates after the back shoulder of the isw passes over the right edge of the sft at around 380 s if the vortex shedding frequency is close to the structural natural frequency the occurrence of fatigue damage to the sft tube and its support connections should be considered as a design criterion the circular shape with its large curvature increases the form drag on the sft the isw profile shoals above the circular shape and the distorted wave profile entrains the fluid from the upper layer into the lower layer causing significant fluid mixing strong isw sft interaction and energy dissipation fig 8 a b furthermore for the circular shape fig 7 shows that the hydrodynamic force induced by vortex shedding dominates the oscillation of vertical force on the sft whereas the parametric shape experiences reduced flow separation and vortex shedding 4 3 effect of sft relative distance to pycnocline the dimensionless relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline is defined as the vertical distance between the centre position of the sft and the initial interface between the two fluid layers cases with sft relative distance of d 0 m 10 m 20 m 30 m and 40 m are selected with an isw amplitude of 20 m parametric cross sectional shape and upper and lower layer densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of the sft relative distance to the pycnocline on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft forces on the sft for different relative distances from the sft to the pycnocline are shown in fig 9 the oscillatory component of force on the sft is quite different with different relative distances due to a complex combination of buoyancy drag and inertia force contributions apart from the case of d 0 m the absolute maximum force on the sft decreases with increasing relative distance the maximum horizontal force coefficient is for d 10 m with a value of c x 0 5 while the absolute maximum c y is for d 10 m with a value of c y 2 0 in order to further elaborate the effect of relative distance on the forces affecting the sft the evolution of the pycnocline location and velocity field in the vicinity of the sft at different time instants are explored for the cases relative distance of 10 m and 40 m for d 10 m fig 10 as the isw propagates and approaches the sft the sft is fully submerged in the bottom layer fluid at the outset the horizontal water particle velocity above the upper left quadrant surface of the sft increases when the sft s front shoulder touches the top left edge of the sft at 96 s due to the narrowed flow cross sectional area fig 10 a b the increased pressure acting on the right edge increases the horizontal force on the sft until its local negative maximum is reached fig 9 a afterward the isw profile is distorted when it interacts with the sft and separates into two parts one part of the isw is transmitted over the sft and the other part is reflected assuming that the initial condition is when the sft is neutrally buoyant as the front shoulder of the isw gradually crosses over the sft the buoyancy continuously reduces while the vertical force increases fig 9 b until the interface between the two layers of fluid hits the lower surface of the sft at 200 s fig 10 c d the upper surface of the sft is fully submerged in the upper layer fluid and the tangential water particle velocity increases near sft apex at 200 s while the velocity near the lower surface reduces to 0 this ultimately causes a clear velocity difference between the upper and lower half of the sft inducing an upward force on the sft shown as a hump in fig 9 b the water particle velocity near the right edge half is generally higher than near the left edge half furthermore a small amount of reverse flow is generated below the lower right edge enhancing the force on the sft fig 9 a at around 368 s the back shoulder of the isw hits the sft fig 10 e f increasing the local water particle velocity the increased pressure acting on the right edge increases the horizontal force to its local negative maximum fig 9 a similarly as the back shoulder of the isw crosses over the sft the buoyancy of the sft continuously increases fig 9 b and as the back shoulder of the isw hits the sft upper right quadrant at 419 s fig 10 g h the water particle velocity magnitude near the right edge surface increases and hence the horizontal force ranks to its local positive peak value fig 9 a also note that the fluid mixing layer thickness increases as the isw propagates and interacts with the sft for d 40 m fig 11 the forcing time series on the sft is less complex because the sft is fully submerged in the bottom layer during the whole isw propagation process when the isw front shoulder passes above the sft the horizontal water particle velocity is opposite the isw propagation direction generating a stagnation point at the upper right quadrant the flow velocity rapidly increases near the lower surface of the sft resulting in a larger dynamic pressure so lower static pressure in the non stagnated area along the lower surface than the upper half of the sft fig 11 a b both the horizontal and vertical forces in fig 9 decrease at t 150 s when the isw trough propagates above the sft apex at around 242 s fig 11 c d the stagnation point at the rear moves to the right edge tip and the dynamic pressure difference between the right and left quadrants of the sft decreases as the isw back shoulder propagates above the sft at 348 s fig 11 e f the stagnation points at the rear moves to the lower surface at the same time water particle speed acting on the upper right surface is higher than the lower right surface the flow separates and forms a wake region at the left edge which increases the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of the sft resulting in an increase in the horizontal force fig 9 a from fig 9 b it is clear that the vertical force on the sft is affected significantly by the relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline the buoyancy of the sft also changes significantly as a function of the relative distance to the pycnocline and contributes to the vertical force leading to a clear enhancement of the vertical force on the sft for d 10 m compared with d 40 m it can be deduced that in this study the buoyancy change dominates the vertical force distribution however we note that the results above partially contradict the achievements by ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 and ding et al 2020 which concluded that the horizontal load is maximum when the cylinder is located on the bottom of the flume and is minimum when the cylinder is near the interface this discrepancy is induced by the isw properties and the ratio of isw amplitude to sft cylinder cross section diameter is very different with the confined model scales and a small isw amplitudes of their studies they did not observe the complex flow field strong interaction between isw and structure nor the dramatic buoyancy shift of the structure seen in our research this underscores the necessity of large scale modeling of the sft under real oceanic conditions that cannot be simulated in laboratory experiments note that the existence of buoyancy change and large velocity gradients at the fluid interface induces prominent vertical loads and shear flows which should be further evaluated in dynamic structural analysis 4 4 effect of fluid density cases with the fluid density ratio of the two layers ρ 1 ρ 2 0 970 0 980 0 990 and 0 998 with a fixed upper layer density of 1022 kg m3 but varying lower layer density are selected an isw amplitude of 20 m relative distance to the pycnocline of 40 m and parametric cross sectional shape are used for all the cases to investigate the influence of the fluid density on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft fig 12 illustrates that the absolute maximum of the force coefficient remains almost unchanged for different fluid density ratios indicating the fluid density ratio is not a crucial factor for the dimensionless hydrodynamic force on the sft according to eq 19 the isw induced hydrodynamic force on the sft is generally proportional to the fluid density difference per the mkdv theory in eq 14 the convection diffusion process is inhibited as the fluid density ratio increases due to the decrease of travelling wave speed fig 13 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions in the two layers when c x reaches its positive maximum as the fluid density ratio increases the velocity magnitude of water particles decreases in both the upper and lower layers also the water particle speed at the nadir apex of the sft decreases with increasing fluid density ratio however from fig 13 b d f it is seen that the thickness of fluid mixing at the interface increases with increasing fluid density ratio 5 dynamic responses analysis 5 1 structural serviceability requirements the sft as a flexible structure allows deflections and accelerations to a certain extent however deflection and acceleration affect the serviceability of the structure and human perception of comfort making it a vital metric for reliability assessment of the structure structural deflection and acceleration are related to the serviceability limit state sls for the sft to perform its intended function furthermore structural vibration duration frequency and direction affect human tolerance to the sft s motion due to the absence of design criteria for serviceability requirement of an sft the design code of similar structures such as movable highway bridges floating bridges and fixed bridges can be applied per aashto 2010 koglin 2003 motion criteria focused on assurance of human comfort while walking or driving on floating bridges is assessed using normal storm 1 year storm conditions and the serviceability limits for deflection and acceleration are listed in table 1 5 2 structural dynamic response analysis in order to examine the isw impact on the dynamic response of the sft to oceanic conditions the finite element method fem software lusas v15 2 f e a ltd is employed for prototype sft modelling a case study of an sft built in the qiongzhou strait is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability based on structural dynamic behavior prediction since the qiongzhou strait is regarded as one of the potential sft application sites in china requiring for a tunnel length of about 20 km a three dimensional sft model of coupled tube joint mooring components with a total length of 20 km and tunnel element length of 100 m is generated in this study tunnel tube section elements and mooring lines are modeled as thick beams bms3 and tunnel joints are simulated as point joints jsh4 with six degrees of freedom dof including three linear spring units and three torque spring units the total number of elements is 4599 the shear and bending stiffness of the tunnel joint in vertical and horizontal directions are assumed as the same mooring lines with a longitudinal spacing of 100 m are arranged symmetrically to balance restoring forces an internal rigid constraint is applied to each mooring end at the tube and the other mooring end connecting the seafloor is a rotational release both ends of the tunnel tube are fixed the added mass of the tube is assumed to be a constant value and the gross density including added mass of the tube is taken as 6088 kg m3 the classical mass and stiffness dependent rayleigh damping is selected and shown in eqs 21 and 22 21 β 1 ξ 2 ω i ω j ω i ω j 22 β 2 ξ 2 ω i ω j where β 1 and β 2 are the real valued mass and stiffness proportional damping coefficients ξ is modal damping ratio ω i and ω j are the i th and j th mode natural frequencies of the sft system respectively the structural damping limits the sft hydro elastic response with the rayleigh damping coefficients β 1 and β 2 determined by the dominant structural natural frequencies and taken as 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the fem model and material settings are described in fig 14 and table 2 and detailed model descriptions can be referred to in our previous research zou et al 2021 for fluid and structure coupling two way fully coupled three dimensional fluid structure interaction fsi simulation is particularly time consuming an alternative approach is presented in this study which simplifies the hydrodynamic load into two dimensions the fluid pressure acting on the sft is transferred to the fem model while the effects of displacement and deformation of the sft on the flow field are neglected in the one way fsi model the applied shear stiffness of the tunnel joint table 2 is less than the axial stiffness which means the hydrodynamic load direction transverse to the tunnel tube in the horizontal plane is more critical than the longitudinal direction therefore the scenario of isw induced force transverse to the tube is considered more conservative than oblique internal wave loading conditions furthermore as per chen et al 2020 the effect of isw direction on the vertical force on the sft is negligible therefore as a conservative scenario the applied external isw induced dynamic load is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the tube element nodes in a direction transverse to the tunnel span this uniformly distributed load along the fixed end tube is regarded as one of the worst case scenarios because it generates the largest shear force at the end of tube in addition to large bending moments at both mid span and tube ends a tube submergence depth of 40 m corresponding to the case d 10 m in section 3 5 is selected for structural dynamic simulation in which the influence of buoyancy shift on the sft can be clearly seen as shown in fig 15 fig 16 a depicts the envelopes of the tube deflection and acceleration in both horizontal and vertical directions under the isw it is observed that the maximum deflection of the tube is about 2 75 cm at mid span while the maximum acceleration of the tube is about 2 mm s2 near the shore connections however these values are far less than that of the aforementioned structural severability requirements table 1 implying the effect of internal waves on the dynamic motions of the sft tube is negligible this is because unlike the surface waves for which the wave frequency may overlap the structural natural frequency and amplify the structural response zou et al 2021 the frequency of the isw is much lower than the natural frequency of the sft tube therefore the sft is not prone to the resonance with the isw fig 16 b shows the envelope of the internal force in the sft tube along the span under the isw the maximum shear force reaches 1 8 mn in the vertical direction and the maximum bending moment in the horizontal plane can be over 45 mn m near the shore connection due to the end constrains even though the displacement and acceleration of the sft subjected to the isw are relatively small the large shear force and bending moment due to the buoyancy shift induced by isw still affects bwr and ultimately the tension force in the mooring lines this can threaten the safety and reliability of the sft system which should be carefully examined during engineering design 6 conclusion in this paper the cfd software fluent is applied to simulate the oceanic isw s generation and propagation the mechanism of interaction between the isw and sft is revealed by elucidating the velocity fields around the sft during the isw propagation the fluid mixing process between the two layers and the shape of the isw profile are compared among different conditions the forces induced by isw on the sft are calculated under various cases of isw amplitude sft cross sectional shape relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline and fluid density ratio the structural motion response and dynamic forcing of a super long sft composed of a coupled tube joint mooring system are assessed under oceanic isw conditions the main conclusions are briefly summarized as follows 1 the maximum sft forces in both horizontal and vertical directions and the thickness of the mixing layer increase with increasing isw amplitude strong isw sft interaction and severe energy dissipation can be found when the isw amplitude is large 2 the most streamlined sft cross section geometry the parametric shape experiences reduced flow separation and vortex shedding as well as the minimum isw induced force compared with the circular and elliptical shapes furthermore the isw induced forces on the parametric cross section shape sft are mainly caused by the pressure gradient while vortex shedding contributes comparatively larger forces on the sft with the circular shape 3 the influence of the relative distance from the sft to the pycnocline is crucial due to a complex combination of buoyancy drag and inertia force contributions the buoyancy change induced by the isw evolution can remarkably alter the vertical force and bwr of the sft it is imperative to simulate a prototype sft under real isw conditions including a complex flow field strong interaction between the isw and structure and the structural buoyancy change 4 the isw induced forces on the sft are proportional to the fluid density difference the fluid mixing thickness at the interface increases with increasing fluid density ratio 5 the deflections and accelerations of the sft under the isw are far smaller than the structural serviceability requirements of floating bridges as the isw is a long wave its frequency is much lower than the natural frequency of the sft tube therefore resonance of the tunnel tube under isw conditions becomes unlikely 6 due to bwr change during the isw evolution a large shear force and bending moment on the sft may occur which affects the tension force in the mooring lines and can threaten the safety and reliability of the sft system nevertheless it should be clarified that in the present study the isw induced forces on the sft are assumed to act uniformly and transverse to the tunnel tube as a worst case scenario discrepancy in the dynamic response estimation can be induced by the two dimensionality of hydrodynamic forces and by neglect of the impacts on the surrounding fluid field of structure deformation and movement a related and practical hazard comes from isw fissions into rank ordered packets of internal solitons which can propagate shoreward from the edge of the continental shelf the impacts of internal wave packets on the sft

20266,the interaction between an oceanic internal solitary wave isw and a prototype submerged floating tunnel sft is numerically investigated effect of oceanic internal solitary wave amplitude the relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline cross sectional geometry of the sft and the density ratio of the two fluid layers are analyzed at a potential application site the dynamic response of an sft composed of a tube joint mooring system forced by an oceanic isw is studied using finite element method fem modeling the numerical results show that the isw induced force can be effectively reduced by adopting a parametric sft cross section instead of a circle or ellipse the influence of the relative distance of the sft to the isw pycnocline is crucial and can remarkably alter the vertical force and buoyancy weight ratio bwr of the sft during isw propagation large shear forces and bending moments on the sft can occur affecting the tension in the mooring lines and threatening the safety and reliability of the sft system however the deflections and accelerations of the sft under the applied isw are within structural serviceability requirements due to the low frequency of the isw compared to the natural frequency of the sft tube keywords internal solitary wave submerged floating tunnel cfd dynamic response fluid structure interaction 1 introduction internal waves have been confirmed by satellite images and in situ observations as ubiquitous in oceanic environments vázquez et al 2008 klymak et al 2006 the mechanism of internal waves generation is generally as a result of stratified flows over topographic variations such as sills ridges and continental shelf edges corresponding to an energy conversion from barotropic tide into baroclinic internal wave ramirez and renouard 1998 hibiya 1986 internal solitary waves isws associated with non linear characteristics are representative of internal waves isw s have been recorded with amplitude over 170 m klymak et al 2006 and have been observed to penetrate the entire water depth these isws can induce large wave forcing and hence cause severe hazards to the operation and maintenance of marine engineering structures a moored submerged floating tunnel sft as a novel sea crossing infrastructure suspended under water is subject to the impacts of hydrodynamic loads induced by isws therefore if an sft is built in regions active with isw s it is imperative to analyze the characteristics of interaction between isws and the sft tube body the sft tube can be regarded as a cylindrical structure which is a common component of marine engineering structures previous studies of the isw s effect on cylinders have been carried out using numerous approaches ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 experimentally investigated the interaction of a small amplitude internal solitary wave and a horizontal circular cylinder in a two layer miscible fluid system and analyzed the effects of the pycnocline thickness and distance between the cylinder and pycnocline on the hydrodynamic loading on the cylinder wang et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the isw induced forces acting on a cylinder and explored the effect of splitter plates on force reduction using numerical simulations cui et al 2019 experimentally studied the motion and mooring force of a floating model under isw impact and found that the isw amplitude and the model size are crucial factors affecting the structural response ding et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic forces exerted by isws on extended and tandem cylinders using openfoam and verified their results against experimental data however due to the limitations of these small scale laboratory tests and simple sft cross sectional shapes considered the characteristics of interaction between isws and an sft under realistic oceanic conditions cannot be properly assessed by the experimental and numerical studies completed thus far empirical methods for isw induced load estimation mainly applies the morison equation si et al 2012 adopted the morison equation to compute the shear forces and torques induced by isws on a rigid cylindrical pile under continuously stratified ocean conditions in the south china sea cai et al 2003 2006 2008 and used the morison equation modal separation and linear regression analysis to estimate the forces and torques resulting from isws with and without shear flow on vertical cylindrical piles and proposed a simple isw induced force prediction method based on the dominant term of the global force lin and zan 2021 discussed the influence of adopting local or global empirical parameters on the predictability of the isw force on a cylinder using the morison equation and concluded that the contribution of the nonlinear term is significant however the resulting modified coefficients in the morison formula are not universal but vary with the adopted isw theory and model settings research on the impacts of isws on other marine engineering structures is extensive song et al 2011 established an analytical model to compute the forces and response motion of a spar platform under isws where the drag and inertial forces are computed by the morison equation lü et al 2016 studied the impacts of a parabolic background current on force and torque exerted by isws on the tendon legs of a tension leg platform using the morison equation chen et al 2017 2020 experimentally measured the forces and pitch moments exerted by isws on a semi submersible model to obtain empirical coefficients based on the morison equation and examined various wave propagation directions concluding that the inline and transverse forces are affected significantly by isws direction however most previous studies focused on vertical cylindrical offshore structures with comparatively small diameters such as vertical piles or tendon legs investigations of isw impacts on a large diameter horizontal cylinder such as an sft are lacking moreover due to the specific structural characteristics of an sft its buoyancy weight ratio bwr has a dominant effect on its mooring tension and dynamic response which influences the serviceability and reliability of the coupled sft system the internal wave can directly change the structural buoyancy and hence change the bwr most previous research on isw s and marine engineering structures focused either on the detailed turbulent flow forces induced by the isw or on the structural response but combining turbulent flow simulation with structural dynamic response analysis in a systematic assessment had not yet been accomplished to eliminate the scale effect this present paper studies a full scale prototype sft subjected to oceanic isw characteristics of the detailed isw sft interaction during isw evolution are revealed using computational fluid dynamics cfd dynamic response analysis for a coupled tube joint mooring system is then carried out to analyze the isw impacts on the sft the paper is structured as follows the applied isw theory and oceanic isw properties are described in section 2 section 3 introduces the model set up and numerical validation section 4 quantifies the influence of the isw amplitude the sft cross sectional shape the distance from the sft to the pycnocline and the fluid density ratio on the isw sft interaction the dynamic response of the sft in oceanic isw conditions is analyzed and the effects of bwr change on the structural internal forcing are discussed in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 isw wave theory at present there are several wave theories that can be applied to describe the shape of an isw the korteweg de vries kdv theory formulated by diederic korteweg and gustav de vires can be adopted to analytically define the internal wave profile this theory is only suitable for small amplitude and weakly nonlinear and dispersive waves koop and butler 1981 by increasing its nonlinearity an extended kdv ekdv kakutani and yamasaki 1978 wave theory containing both quadratic and cubic nonlinear terms can be applied moreover a modified kdv theory mkdv is formulated for large amplitude internal waves michallet and barthélémy 1998 the interface displacement governed by the mkdv theory is expressed by eq 1 1 ζ x t a sech 2 κ x c m k d v t 1 μ tanh 2 κ x c m k d v t where a is the internal wave amplitude c mkdv is the phase velocity and μ and κ are fluid thickness coefficients given by 2 c m k d v c m b α a β h 2 β 2 α h 2 3 μ h h i f h 0 h i f h 0 4 κ b a h h 0 5 with 5 c m 2 g h 2 1 1 4 h 1 h 2 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 h 2

layer respectively h is total water depth and h c is the critical level the polarity of the isw is determined by the position of the interface with respect to the critical level h c when the interface is below above h c the isw is of elevation depression the horizontal velocities of water particles in the upper and lower layers for a depression type isw are given by 14 u i x t 1 i 1 c m k d v ζ x t h i 1 i 1 ζ x t where i 1 2 represents the upper and lower layer fluids respectively the characteristic wavelength of the mkdv isw is expressed as 15 λ 2 h h c h h c 3 h c 3 3 h h h the integral frequency scale ω m of the mkdv isw is shown as 16 ω m c m k d v κ μ 1 2 arctanh μ 1 2 2 2 isw properties based on field observations and high resolution satellite images at wenchang station 112 e 19 35 n shown in fig 1 from april to october 2005 strong isws were identified in the continental shelf area with the largest isw amplitude 25 35 m and the isw packet near hainan island is dominated by the diurnal tide xu et al 2010 as one of the potential sft construction sites in china yan et al 2016 zou et al 2020a the qiongzhou strait is close to wenchang station note that detailed reproduction of internal wave structure inside the strait is not the aim of this research but rather to approximate the isw s observed in the region for a conservative analysis of the sft dynamic response therefore the isw characteristics recorded at wenchang station are applied for the analysis of hydrodynamic forces serviceability and reliability of the sft in this study since the measured isw amplitude is quite large compared with the strait depth of around 100 m the mkdv theory is adopted for the isw description in this study 3 numerical model 3 1 model setup most sft s have been designed with simple cross section shapes such as square polygonal circular or elliptical the circular and elliptical shapes exhibit more streamlined hydrodynamic behavior experiencing smaller displacements and less stress than other bluff shapes gang et al 2018 li and jiang 2016 a parametric method using machine learning to predict the optimal sft cross section shape for improving the hydrodynamic performance was presented in zou et al 2020b zou et al 2020c where the objective is to minimize the hydrodynamic forces time averaged drag and root mean square lift on the sft the parametric shape has been compared with the simpler circular and elliptical shapes under extreme events zou et al 2020a in the current study parametric circular and elliptical shapes for the sft cross section with equal clearance 5 m 11 m applied in previous research are compared under isw conditions assuming the tunnel wall thickness is 1 m the maximum width and height of the parametric circular and elliptical shapes are 20 m 10 m 14 m 14 m and 16 m 10 m respectively a two dimensional numerical isw tank is generated using ansys fluent to simulate the interaction between an isw and the sft fig 2 a the computational domain is 4500 m in length and 100 m in height filled with a stratified two layer fluid the center of the sft is located 200 m from the inlet the thicknesses of the upper layer and lower layer fluids are 30 m and 70 m respectively for a typical case the isw the amplitude a is selected as 20 m with a characteristic wavelength of 144 m the densities of the fluids in the upper layer and lower layer are 1022 kg m3 and 1024 kg m3 respectively based on the actual oceanic condition in which the oceanic density difference is generally less than 3 4 kg m3 zhu et al 2016 the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 with a dispersed type interface model is applied to capture the pycnocline since the surface wave amplitude is relatively small compared with the isw amplitude the top boundary is assumed to be a rigid lid in all simulations freestream quantities of turbulence intensity and turbulence length scale are specified at the inlet boundary as per zou et al 2020d an outflow boundary is employed at the outlet a simplified no slip hydraulically smooth wall condition is applied on the sft cross section surface and the bottom boundary the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations with an rng k ε turbulence model are applied with a standard wall function the reliability of this model for hydrodynamic force prediction of the sft at high reynolds numbers was verified by zou et al 2020b the urans model was verified for its ability to provide sufficiently efficient and accurate isw induced force predictions liuet al 2020 and vortex generation simulation hsu et al 2004 however the detection of small flow features such as vortex dynamics in the boundary layer should be simulated by les or dns models which incur additional computation loads and are beyond the scope of this research the computational domain is divided into several blocks of different resolutions fig 2 b the subdomain around the sft cross section surface is a 30 m 30 m rectangular block with a high quality unstructured mesh including 40 layers of quadrangular cells that cover the boundary layer the first grid layer cell thickness normal to the sft surface is 0 003 m within the acceptable range of y at 30 200 kuzmin et al 2007 above this first cell the cell thickness stretches with a growth rate of 1 2 the subdomain within the isw propagation region has a horizontal and vertical mesh size of 2 m and 0 2 m respectively the adjacent subdomain crossing the sft has a minimum grid size of 0 4 m the structured mesh size in the rest of the subdomain is generally 2 m and in the damping zone an increasingly coarse mesh with a bias factor of 2 is set to cause extra numerical diffusion an adaptive time step was selected and the maximum courant number is set to 0 25 the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling a high performance computing hpc cluster is applied to run parallel computation tasks the direct inlet velocity prescription method is used to generate an isw at the inlet boundary by a user defined function udf ansys inc 2013 where the theoretical horizontal orbital velocities and surface elevation are imposed directly miquel et al 2018 and the pressure is set to be hydrostatic the udf specifies the velocity components and fluid volume fraction for each cell on the boundary cavaliere et al 2021 revealed that the pycnocline thickness affects isws kinematics for a thick pycnocline layer condition both the wave celerity and the velocity gradients decrease and the hydrodynamic force on the sft induced by the isw is reduced therefore as a conservative calculation of the hydrodynamic force on the sft only a thin pycnocline between the two layer fluid is added the thin pycnocline was set by a smooth tanh initial density distribution between the upper and lower layers as in ding et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 to avoid numerical instability at the interface in this study the isw horizontal velocity distribution in the pycnocline layer is given by a linear velocity transition between the upper and lower layers as shown in eq 17 17 u y u 1 u 2 d p y y c d p 2 u 2 where y is the vertical coordinate of the grid y c is the position of the mid pycnocline layer d p is thickness of the pycnocline layer in order to determine the appropriate pycnocline layer thickness a sensitivity analysis is carried out we consider three different pycnocline layer thicknesses 0 05 m 1 m and 5 m these are tested for the case with isw amplitude of 20 m sft relative distance from the pycnocline of 10 m and parametric cross section shape in order to shorten the simulation time fluid densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 in the upper layer and lower layer are selected respectively time series of the isw induced horizontal and vertical forces per meter on the sft for each pycnocline layer thickness are shown in fig 3 it can be found that numerical instabilities occur fig 3 a with d p 0 05 m while spikes can be effectively eliminated with d p 1 m or 5 m however as d p increases to 5 m the hydrodynamic forces on the sft are underpredicted with a maximum force deviation around 2 kn compared to d p 0 05 m whereas the difference in force computation between d p 1 m and 0 05 m is minor this indicates that stable and accurate results are achieved with a pycnocline layer thickness of 1 m and hence d p 1 m is adopted in subsequent simulations for wave absorption a dampening sink term given by eq 18 is added in the momentum equation within a damping length of 2000 m from the outlet boundary to avoid wave reflection ansys 2019 18 s c 1 ρ v 1 2 c 2 ρ v v f x f y where c 1 and c 2 are linear and quadratic damping resistance respectively f x and f y are damping functions for inline and cross flow directions respectively v is flow vertical velocity it features a combination of linear and quadratic damping which allows the use of either one or a combination of both approaches in this research c 1 10 s 1 c 2 10 m 1 3 2 model validation the dimensionless hydrodynamic force on an isolated cylinder is defined in eq 19 19 c x y f x y ρ 2 ρ 1 g a where f x and f y are horizontal and vertical force per meter on the cylinder respectively g is gravitational acceleration and a is the cross sectional area of the cylinder note that the forces on the cylinder are normalized in eq 19 and hence c x y is dimensionless if ρ 1 is close to ρ 2 the hydrodynamic force f x y will be close to 0 thus c x y will not be infinite numerical results are further verified by comparison to experimental data of horizontal force on the cylinder ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 and an empirical formula in this experiment the fluid densities of the upper layer and lower layers are ρ 1 1000 kg m3 and ρ 2 1021 kg m3 respectively the thicknesses of the upper layer and lower layers are h 1 4 cm and h 2 8 5 cm respectively the center of the1 5 cm diameter cylinder is located a distance of h 0 9 cm from the flume bottom the isw amplitude is 0 77 cm per the morison equation the horizontal hydrodynamic load per meter can be estimated by the sum of the inertial and drag forces given by eq 20 20 f x t 1 2 c d ρ d u u c m ρ a u t where u is the horizontal velocity component of the isw fluid particles which can be computed by using eq 14 c m and c d are inertia and drag coefficients respectively and can be set as c m 2 0 c d 1 2 based on previous studies cai et al 2006 cai et al 2003 the comparison of the horizontal hydrodynamic loads on the cylinder from each study is shown in fig 4 where vt h 0 is a dimensionless value from ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 it illustrates that the morison equation generally overpredicts the negative hydrodynamic force and underestimates the positive hydrodynamic force while the numerical simulation results provide a better agreement with the experimental data the discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results can be attributed to a difference of the isw generation mechanism where a hump type isw was produced by the wave maker in the experiment while the mkdv theory is applied in the numerical simulation to elucidate the mechanism of isw sft interaction under oceanic conditions and investigate the influence of factors including the isw amplitude the sft relative distance to the pycnocline defined as the vertical distance between the centre position of the sft and the initial location of the interface between the two layers of fluids the sft cross sectional shape and fluid density on the sft hydrodynamics a sensitivity analysis is conducted by comparing the temporal variation of force coefficients on the sft the velocity and pressure fields in the vicinity of the sft at specific moments and the corresponding interface position of the two fluid layers 4 sensitivity analysis of influence factors 4 1 effect of isw amplitude cases of isw amplitude a 20 m 25 m 30 m and 35 m are selected with a relative distance to the pycnoclilne of 40 m parametric cross sectional shape and upper and lower layer densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of isw amplitude on the hydrodynamic force on the sft time series of force coefficient variation in horizontal and vertical directions for different isw amplitudes are illustrated in fig 5 positive horizontal force means the force direction is the same as the isw propagation direction and positive vertical force means the force direction is upward assuming that the initial condition is when the sft is neutrally buoyant it can be found that c x drops firstly to its negative maximum and undergoes a sharp increase to about double the maximum magnitude followed by a plunge and oscillation around the equilibrium after the isw passes over the sft it is worth noting that the larger the isw amplitude is the later the maximum negative force occurs for a large isw amplitude the isw can act on the sft surface directly and a strong interaction between the isw and the sft occurs along with fluid mixing and wave dissipation and reflection which prolongs the interaction time thus the larger the isw amplitude is the later the maximum negative force occurs however according to eqs 1 and 14 the isw s flow velocities increase with increasing the isw s amplitude and hence the isw with a large amplitude propagates faster than those smaller amplitude cases the irregularity in the temporal distribution of c x and c y for large isw amplitudes also indicates the complex mechanisms of the strong interaction between the isw and the sft it can be deduced that reflected waves bounce back from the sft contributing to secondary peaks and interfacial instabilities this also shows that the absolute maximum c x and c y increase with increasing isw amplitude the absolute maximum c x reaches 0 6 at a 35 m while the absolute maximum c y is 2 7 fig 6 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions of the two layers of fluids when the horizontal force coefficient on the sft reaches its negative maximum thus different characteristics of the isw sft interaction for various isw amplitudes can be clearly elaborated note that the negative maximum of c x increases with increasing isw amplitude which corresponds an increase of the isw water particle velocity magnitude in each fluid layer at a 20 m fig 6 a b the pycnocline keeps stable and no evident deformation of the isw profile or fluid mixing can be observed however at a 25 m fig 6 c d the isw profile gets distorted and mixing of fluids across the pycnocline is gradually generated above the leading edge of the sft as the isw trough approaches the sft the increasing velocities of both the convergence flow in the upper layer and divergence flow in the lower layer enlarge the shear stress at the interface which enhances disturbance of the flow and triggers mixing instabilities the thickness of the mixing layer increases with increasing isw amplitude the flow area is partially blocked by the sft and the isw profile distorts the interface of the isw is generally parallel to the upper left quadrant sft surface and steepens with increasing isw amplitude the isw energy is dissipated and backflow and mixing are generated making the flow field at the interface complex fig 6 d f for a 35 m fig 6 e f as the isw propagates the isw can act on the sft surface directly which can lead to reflection of the isw the irregularity at the local negative maximum of the horizontal force fig 5 a can be attributed to distortion of the isw shape and strong interaction between the isw and the sft however c x for a 35 m does not show an increase after the isw trough passes over the sft compared with a 30 m since the strong isw sft interaction for a 35 m dissipates the wave energy therefore the isw amplitude is reduced after passing over the sft 4 2 effect of sft cross section geometry circular elliptical and parametric sft cross section shapes are investigated for an isw amplitude of 20 m relative distance to the pycnocline of 40 m and upper and lower layer fluid densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of the sft cross section shape on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft time series of force coefficients in horizontal and vertical directions are illustrated in fig 7 the circular shape has the largest maximum absolute values of forces while the parametric shape with its streamlined curvature generates the minimum forcing oscillation among the three shapes it can also be found that c x of all three shapes in both directions decreases at first continuously increases afterward and gradually decreases back to its equilibrium the parametric shape experiences its negative maximum of c x at 150 s while the elliptical and circular shapes reach their negative maxima after 200 s as shown in fig 7 the circular shape s force signal has a lower oscillation frequency than the elliptical shape fig 8 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions of the two layers of fluids when c x on the sft reaches its negative maximum characteristics of the isw sft interaction as a function of sft cross sectional shape can be clearly elaborated for the circular and elliptical cross sectional shapes fig 8 b d the negative maximum value of c x generally occurs when the isw trough is above the apex of the sft the flow streamlines at the edges of the sft are distorted by the bluff body and the shape curvature in turn increases the velocity magnitude at the apex and nadir points furthermore as the flow passes over the sft the shear stress near the sft surface grows and the flow separates from the sft due to the strong adverse pressure gradient apg resulting from the shape curvature triggering a wide wake recirculation regime and periodic vortex shedding at the left edge note that the isw trough travels to the right resulting in flow toward the left in the lower fluid layer the vortex shedding process together with the steady pressure gradient amplifies the gross hydrodynamic force on the sft the horizontal force induced by vortex shedding partially compensates for the reduction in horizontal force when the isw trough is above the sft fig 7 a from fig 7 b the frequency of vortex shedding can be estimated to be around 0 03 hz the intrinsic isw characteristic frequency is 0 0078 hz based on eq 16 it can be deduced that the vortex shedding frequency is much faster than the intrinsic isw characteristic frequency vortex shedding affects the sft around 170 s before the isw trough passes over the sft and dissipates after the back shoulder of the isw passes over the right edge of the sft at around 380 s if the vortex shedding frequency is close to the structural natural frequency the occurrence of fatigue damage to the sft tube and its support connections should be considered as a design criterion the circular shape with its large curvature increases the form drag on the sft the isw profile shoals above the circular shape and the distorted wave profile entrains the fluid from the upper layer into the lower layer causing significant fluid mixing strong isw sft interaction and energy dissipation fig 8 a b furthermore for the circular shape fig 7 shows that the hydrodynamic force induced by vortex shedding dominates the oscillation of vertical force on the sft whereas the parametric shape experiences reduced flow separation and vortex shedding 4 3 effect of sft relative distance to pycnocline the dimensionless relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline is defined as the vertical distance between the centre position of the sft and the initial interface between the two fluid layers cases with sft relative distance of d 0 m 10 m 20 m 30 m and 40 m are selected with an isw amplitude of 20 m parametric cross sectional shape and upper and lower layer densities of 1022 kg m3 and 1054 kg m3 respectively to investigate the influence of the sft relative distance to the pycnocline on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft forces on the sft for different relative distances from the sft to the pycnocline are shown in fig 9 the oscillatory component of force on the sft is quite different with different relative distances due to a complex combination of buoyancy drag and inertia force contributions apart from the case of d 0 m the absolute maximum force on the sft decreases with increasing relative distance the maximum horizontal force coefficient is for d 10 m with a value of c x 0 5 while the absolute maximum c y is for d 10 m with a value of c y 2 0 in order to further elaborate the effect of relative distance on the forces affecting the sft the evolution of the pycnocline location and velocity field in the vicinity of the sft at different time instants are explored for the cases relative distance of 10 m and 40 m for d 10 m fig 10 as the isw propagates and approaches the sft the sft is fully submerged in the bottom layer fluid at the outset the horizontal water particle velocity above the upper left quadrant surface of the sft increases when the sft s front shoulder touches the top left edge of the sft at 96 s due to the narrowed flow cross sectional area fig 10 a b the increased pressure acting on the right edge increases the horizontal force on the sft until its local negative maximum is reached fig 9 a afterward the isw profile is distorted when it interacts with the sft and separates into two parts one part of the isw is transmitted over the sft and the other part is reflected assuming that the initial condition is when the sft is neutrally buoyant as the front shoulder of the isw gradually crosses over the sft the buoyancy continuously reduces while the vertical force increases fig 9 b until the interface between the two layers of fluid hits the lower surface of the sft at 200 s fig 10 c d the upper surface of the sft is fully submerged in the upper layer fluid and the tangential water particle velocity increases near sft apex at 200 s while the velocity near the lower surface reduces to 0 this ultimately causes a clear velocity difference between the upper and lower half of the sft inducing an upward force on the sft shown as a hump in fig 9 b the water particle velocity near the right edge half is generally higher than near the left edge half furthermore a small amount of reverse flow is generated below the lower right edge enhancing the force on the sft fig 9 a at around 368 s the back shoulder of the isw hits the sft fig 10 e f increasing the local water particle velocity the increased pressure acting on the right edge increases the horizontal force to its local negative maximum fig 9 a similarly as the back shoulder of the isw crosses over the sft the buoyancy of the sft continuously increases fig 9 b and as the back shoulder of the isw hits the sft upper right quadrant at 419 s fig 10 g h the water particle velocity magnitude near the right edge surface increases and hence the horizontal force ranks to its local positive peak value fig 9 a also note that the fluid mixing layer thickness increases as the isw propagates and interacts with the sft for d 40 m fig 11 the forcing time series on the sft is less complex because the sft is fully submerged in the bottom layer during the whole isw propagation process when the isw front shoulder passes above the sft the horizontal water particle velocity is opposite the isw propagation direction generating a stagnation point at the upper right quadrant the flow velocity rapidly increases near the lower surface of the sft resulting in a larger dynamic pressure so lower static pressure in the non stagnated area along the lower surface than the upper half of the sft fig 11 a b both the horizontal and vertical forces in fig 9 decrease at t 150 s when the isw trough propagates above the sft apex at around 242 s fig 11 c d the stagnation point at the rear moves to the right edge tip and the dynamic pressure difference between the right and left quadrants of the sft decreases as the isw back shoulder propagates above the sft at 348 s fig 11 e f the stagnation points at the rear moves to the lower surface at the same time water particle speed acting on the upper right surface is higher than the lower right surface the flow separates and forms a wake region at the left edge which increases the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of the sft resulting in an increase in the horizontal force fig 9 a from fig 9 b it is clear that the vertical force on the sft is affected significantly by the relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline the buoyancy of the sft also changes significantly as a function of the relative distance to the pycnocline and contributes to the vertical force leading to a clear enhancement of the vertical force on the sft for d 10 m compared with d 40 m it can be deduced that in this study the buoyancy change dominates the vertical force distribution however we note that the results above partially contradict the achievements by ermanyuk ermanyuk and gavrilov 2005 and ding et al 2020 which concluded that the horizontal load is maximum when the cylinder is located on the bottom of the flume and is minimum when the cylinder is near the interface this discrepancy is induced by the isw properties and the ratio of isw amplitude to sft cylinder cross section diameter is very different with the confined model scales and a small isw amplitudes of their studies they did not observe the complex flow field strong interaction between isw and structure nor the dramatic buoyancy shift of the structure seen in our research this underscores the necessity of large scale modeling of the sft under real oceanic conditions that cannot be simulated in laboratory experiments note that the existence of buoyancy change and large velocity gradients at the fluid interface induces prominent vertical loads and shear flows which should be further evaluated in dynamic structural analysis 4 4 effect of fluid density cases with the fluid density ratio of the two layers ρ 1 ρ 2 0 970 0 980 0 990 and 0 998 with a fixed upper layer density of 1022 kg m3 but varying lower layer density are selected an isw amplitude of 20 m relative distance to the pycnocline of 40 m and parametric cross sectional shape are used for all the cases to investigate the influence of the fluid density on the hydrodynamic forcing of the sft fig 12 illustrates that the absolute maximum of the force coefficient remains almost unchanged for different fluid density ratios indicating the fluid density ratio is not a crucial factor for the dimensionless hydrodynamic force on the sft according to eq 19 the isw induced hydrodynamic force on the sft is generally proportional to the fluid density difference per the mkdv theory in eq 14 the convection diffusion process is inhibited as the fluid density ratio increases due to the decrease of travelling wave speed fig 13 shows the volume fraction and velocity field distributions in the two layers when c x reaches its positive maximum as the fluid density ratio increases the velocity magnitude of water particles decreases in both the upper and lower layers also the water particle speed at the nadir apex of the sft decreases with increasing fluid density ratio however from fig 13 b d f it is seen that the thickness of fluid mixing at the interface increases with increasing fluid density ratio 5 dynamic responses analysis 5 1 structural serviceability requirements the sft as a flexible structure allows deflections and accelerations to a certain extent however deflection and acceleration affect the serviceability of the structure and human perception of comfort making it a vital metric for reliability assessment of the structure structural deflection and acceleration are related to the serviceability limit state sls for the sft to perform its intended function furthermore structural vibration duration frequency and direction affect human tolerance to the sft s motion due to the absence of design criteria for serviceability requirement of an sft the design code of similar structures such as movable highway bridges floating bridges and fixed bridges can be applied per aashto 2010 koglin 2003 motion criteria focused on assurance of human comfort while walking or driving on floating bridges is assessed using normal storm 1 year storm conditions and the serviceability limits for deflection and acceleration are listed in table 1 5 2 structural dynamic response analysis in order to examine the isw impact on the dynamic response of the sft to oceanic conditions the finite element method fem software lusas v15 2 f e a ltd is employed for prototype sft modelling a case study of an sft built in the qiongzhou strait is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability based on structural dynamic behavior prediction since the qiongzhou strait is regarded as one of the potential sft application sites in china requiring for a tunnel length of about 20 km a three dimensional sft model of coupled tube joint mooring components with a total length of 20 km and tunnel element length of 100 m is generated in this study tunnel tube section elements and mooring lines are modeled as thick beams bms3 and tunnel joints are simulated as point joints jsh4 with six degrees of freedom dof including three linear spring units and three torque spring units the total number of elements is 4599 the shear and bending stiffness of the tunnel joint in vertical and horizontal directions are assumed as the same mooring lines with a longitudinal spacing of 100 m are arranged symmetrically to balance restoring forces an internal rigid constraint is applied to each mooring end at the tube and the other mooring end connecting the seafloor is a rotational release both ends of the tunnel tube are fixed the added mass of the tube is assumed to be a constant value and the gross density including added mass of the tube is taken as 6088 kg m3 the classical mass and stiffness dependent rayleigh damping is selected and shown in eqs 21 and 22 21 β 1 ξ 2 ω i ω j ω i ω j 22 β 2 ξ 2 ω i ω j where β 1 and β 2 are the real valued mass and stiffness proportional damping coefficients ξ is modal damping ratio ω i and ω j are the i th and j th mode natural frequencies of the sft system respectively the structural damping limits the sft hydro elastic response with the rayleigh damping coefficients β 1 and β 2 determined by the dominant structural natural frequencies and taken as 0 02 and 0 03 respectively the fem model and material settings are described in fig 14 and table 2 and detailed model descriptions can be referred to in our previous research zou et al 2021 for fluid and structure coupling two way fully coupled three dimensional fluid structure interaction fsi simulation is particularly time consuming an alternative approach is presented in this study which simplifies the hydrodynamic load into two dimensions the fluid pressure acting on the sft is transferred to the fem model while the effects of displacement and deformation of the sft on the flow field are neglected in the one way fsi model the applied shear stiffness of the tunnel joint table 2 is less than the axial stiffness which means the hydrodynamic load direction transverse to the tunnel tube in the horizontal plane is more critical than the longitudinal direction therefore the scenario of isw induced force transverse to the tube is considered more conservative than oblique internal wave loading conditions furthermore as per chen et al 2020 the effect of isw direction on the vertical force on the sft is negligible therefore as a conservative scenario the applied external isw induced dynamic load is assumed to be uniformly distributed along the tube element nodes in a direction transverse to the tunnel span this uniformly distributed load along the fixed end tube is regarded as one of the worst case scenarios because it generates the largest shear force at the end of tube in addition to large bending moments at both mid span and tube ends a tube submergence depth of 40 m corresponding to the case d 10 m in section 3 5 is selected for structural dynamic simulation in which the influence of buoyancy shift on the sft can be clearly seen as shown in fig 15 fig 16 a depicts the envelopes of the tube deflection and acceleration in both horizontal and vertical directions under the isw it is observed that the maximum deflection of the tube is about 2 75 cm at mid span while the maximum acceleration of the tube is about 2 mm s2 near the shore connections however these values are far less than that of the aforementioned structural severability requirements table 1 implying the effect of internal waves on the dynamic motions of the sft tube is negligible this is because unlike the surface waves for which the wave frequency may overlap the structural natural frequency and amplify the structural response zou et al 2021 the frequency of the isw is much lower than the natural frequency of the sft tube therefore the sft is not prone to the resonance with the isw fig 16 b shows the envelope of the internal force in the sft tube along the span under the isw the maximum shear force reaches 1 8 mn in the vertical direction and the maximum bending moment in the horizontal plane can be over 45 mn m near the shore connection due to the end constrains even though the displacement and acceleration of the sft subjected to the isw are relatively small the large shear force and bending moment due to the buoyancy shift induced by isw still affects bwr and ultimately the tension force in the mooring lines this can threaten the safety and reliability of the sft system which should be carefully examined during engineering design 6 conclusion in this paper the cfd software fluent is applied to simulate the oceanic isw s generation and propagation the mechanism of interaction between the isw and sft is revealed by elucidating the velocity fields around the sft during the isw propagation the fluid mixing process between the two layers and the shape of the isw profile are compared among different conditions the forces induced by isw on the sft are calculated under various cases of isw amplitude sft cross sectional shape relative distance of the sft to the pycnocline and fluid density ratio the structural motion response and dynamic forcing of a super long sft composed of a coupled tube joint mooring system are assessed under oceanic isw conditions the main conclusions are briefly summarized as follows 1 the maximum sft forces in both horizontal and vertical directions and the thickness of the mixing layer increase with increasing isw amplitude strong isw sft interaction and severe energy dissipation can be found when the isw amplitude is large 2 the most streamlined sft cross section geometry the parametric shape experiences reduced flow separation and vortex shedding as well as the minimum isw induced force compared with the circular and elliptical shapes furthermore the isw induced forces on the parametric cross section shape sft are mainly caused by the pressure gradient while vortex shedding contributes comparatively larger forces on the sft with the circular shape 3 the influence of the relative distance from the sft to the pycnocline is crucial due to a complex combination of buoyancy drag and inertia force contributions the buoyancy change induced by the isw evolution can remarkably alter the vertical force and bwr of the sft it is imperative to simulate a prototype sft under real isw conditions including a complex flow field strong interaction between the isw and structure and the structural buoyancy change 4 the isw induced forces on the sft are proportional to the fluid density difference the fluid mixing thickness at the interface increases with increasing fluid density ratio 5 the deflections and accelerations of the sft under the isw are far smaller than the structural serviceability requirements of floating bridges as the isw is a long wave its frequency is much lower than the natural frequency of the sft tube therefore resonance of the tunnel tube under isw conditions becomes unlikely 6 due to bwr change during the isw evolution a large shear force and bending moment on the sft may occur which affects the tension force in the mooring lines and can threaten the safety and reliability of the sft system nevertheless it should be clarified that in the present study the isw induced forces on the sft are assumed to act uniformly and transverse to the tunnel tube as a worst case scenario discrepancy in the dynamic response estimation can be induced by the two dimensionality of hydrodynamic forces and by neglect of the impacts on the surrounding fluid field of structure deformation and movement a related and practical hazard comes from isw fissions into rank ordered packets of internal solitons which can propagate shoreward from the edge of the continental shelf the impacts of internal wave packets on the sft

20267,in this study the employability of the vertical axis crossflow whirlybird rotor as a hydrokinetic turbine is examined further design parameters are optimized that affect the rotor performance torque power power coefficient and torque coefficient are calculated at various angular speeds and tip speed ratio tsr by numerical method using computational fluid dynamics cfd further different results of numerical analysis are validated with the experiment numerical analysis results shown in the form of pressure contour velocity contour and velocity vector are served to explain the flow phenomenon surrounding the rotor subsequently effects of the number of blades blade angle rotor diameter rotor height blade length and free stream velocity on the performance of rotor are also investigated it is found that with the increase in blade number blade angle and blade length the maximum torque coefficient and maximum power coefficient increase up to a certain limit and then drop drastically in view of these the optimal blade number blade angle and blade length are determined as 27 75 and 30 mm respectively for the present design configuration of the rotor moreover the

conversion systems electricity demand is increasing with the modernization of civilization to fulfill the demand different renewable and non renewable energy sources are used to produce electricity the river or canal water ocean waves are some of the potential sources of renewable energy however harnessing electric energy from the river water on a large scale by constructing the dam raises some problems like the migration of residents high initial cost difficulties in maintenance installation space for power and environmental flora fauna issues these facts lead to developing micro power stations especially in the remote areas which are off grid and where flowing flow is available and the power requirement is not so high a hydrokinetic turbine hkt is a turbine that uses free stream velocity to convert fluid energy into mechanical energy and finally electricity is produced from it kumar and sarkar 2016a energy can be harnessed by using hkt if free stream velocity is minimum 0 5 m s and having 1 75m of water depth to install the turbine thorpton energy 2021 talukdar et al 2019 so far there are different types of hydrokinetic turbines designed and applied in the field fig 1 kumar and sarkar 2016a mostly they can be classified based on various aspects say based on fluid flow direction hkt can be classified as axial flow and crossflow further axial flow turbine is classified based on axis alignment as horizontal axis and inclined axis whereas crossflow turbine is classified as the vertical axis and in plane axis furthermore crossflow vertical axis hkt can also be classified based on their blade construction viz savonius darrieus gorlov etc there are different advantages of cross flow vertical axis turbine for example simple design and construction low manufacturing cost low maintenance cost low transportation cost and ability to install in small and narrow rivers however there are some disadvantages also like low efficiency and inability to self start compared to the axial flow horizontal axis turbine the details of different crossflow turbines and their performance affecting parameters are also discussed in appendix a based on fluid flow conditions available theoretical power installation facility in a particular site hkts are chosen or designed kumar and saini 2016 saini and saini 2019 2020 2020 le et al 2014 1 2 working principle of hydrokinetic turbines based on the energy conversion technique hydrokinetic energy converters are classified as turbine type and non turbine type talukdar et al 2019 the turbine type energy converter machine or hydrokinetic turbine hkt is based on a rotating machine whether other types of motion viz oscillation torsional buffering drives non turbine type converter in general the working principle of the hkt is similar to the wind turbines the only difference is the fluid handled designs of most hkts are conceptualized from the wind turbine rotors and subsequent design modifications are done to suit the working environment the study shows that the performance of the hkt is superior to that of the wind turbine saini and saini 2019 sarma et al 2014 the maximum power extracted by hkt run in the same operating condition has been found to be increased by 61 32 compared to wind turbines sarma et al 2014 primarily hkts are designed based on drag and lift force techniques savonius hkt is drag based turbine and darrieous gorlov hkts are lift based turbine in general drag based turbines have less tip speed ratio tsr experience comparatively less starting torque problems compared to the lift based turbines on the other hand horizontal axis turbine has better efficiency coefficient of power compared to vertical axis turbines but due to complexity in mounting arrangement vertical axis hkts are preferred thus researchers always in search of a hkt model having a simple design better starting torque and high coefficient of power 1 3 scope of the work in the present study the whirlybird crossflow vertical axis turbine is planned to introduce to work under the hydro environment as hkt in view of its better self starting capability in wind environment and high power coefficient comparable to those of horizontal axis turbines this turbine is generally preferred moreover it has a narrow range of tip speed ratio and this turbine works well in both low and high wind conditions dragomirescu 2011 1 4 literature review on whirlybird turbine whirlybird roof top rotor ventilators are generally used for ventilation purposes as they can work without any external supply of electric energy the rising heat within the room and passing wind outside turn the turbine ventilate the house simultaneously thus whirlybird roof top rotor ventilator is used as a turbine to convert the wind kinetic energy into electrical energy by placing a generator beneath the spinning turbine torasaa and sermsri 2015 sometimes the effectiveness of the roof ventilator is increased by adding the extra fins in the ventilator system to help it work faster and make it more spin efficient daut et al 2011 furthermore to reduce the starting torque of this rotor modification is done in the positions of the stator and rotor in addition to this a magnetic levitation system is also attached kaewtip and hoonchareon 2014 this whirlybird turbine system uses different generators like permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg axial flux permanent magnet afpm ac generator and ac synchronous generator to produce electricity and then stores it in a battery further the battery supplies power to the small electronic systems lloyd and michener 2014 zagade et al 2015 suresh et al 2017 it is observed that a 24 inch turbine rotor with ac generator can produce 10 12 v at 285 300 rpm zagade et al 2016 the study shows that more mass flow occurs at the large throat diameter of the whirlybird turbine ventilator and the same increases with the rotational speed of the turbo ventilator jadhav et al 2016 khan et al 2008 in order to increase the rotation of the turbine a wind cup arrangement is applied that improves the efficiency of the turbine ventilator by 1 7 harun et al 2018 summary of investigations performed by various researchers on whirlybird rotor is mentioned in table 1 table 1 discusses numerical and experimental studies their specific analysis method parameters investigated range of parameters optimum values and performance enhancement criterion 1 5 objectives and outline of the work from the literature survey a necessity of introducing a hkt is felt having a simple design better starting torque with a high coefficient of power it is found that whirlybird crossflow vertical axis turbine can harvest wind power even when the wind speed is low it is also observed that it has better self starting capability and a high coefficient of power comparable to those of horizontal axis turbines and other vertical axis turbines even in low wind speed conditions dragomirescu 2011 these phenomena inspire to employ this turbine as hkt under the hydro environment and to optimize its design parameters suitable for hydro environment which is the nobility of the work therefore objectives of the study are set as i to explore the performance of whirlybird hkt numerically and experimentally in different operating conditions ii to explain the flow phenomenon surrounding the rotor iii to explore the effect of different design parameters viz the number of blades blade angle rotor diameter rotor height blade length on the performance of the rotor finally the

software through the computational fluid dynamics cfd commercial package fluent the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation along with the continuity equation is solved to get the velocity field the pressure field tangential velocity and the rotor torque lien and ahmed 2010 furthermore the k ε turbulence model and the couple algorithm are used when solving the continuity and the rans equations kumar and sarkar 2016b wu et al 2012 k ε turbulence model is adopted because in general this model is suitable for simulating the 3d model having curved surfaces like rotor blade surface and sharp edges like rotor blade tip results obtained through this technique have perfect agreement with experimental results of vertical axis crossflow type of hkts in appendix b analysis presented by other researchers is depicted in table b1 a comparative analysis of different turbulence models on the proposed rotor is also presented in figure b1 appendix b for better accuracy the second order upwind scheme and dynamic mesh are used in a dynamic mesh setup a flow driven simulation is adopted with six degree of freedom solver in flow driven simulation the tsr value is unknown initially and can be found after the simulation however in conventional technique multi reference frame mrf tsr value is known before the simulation le et al 2014 fleisinger et al 2014 le et al 2014 reported that in the flow driven simulation the power coefficient curve is similar to those obtained in simulation with given tsr verified for the present study and presented in appendix c further in six degree of freedom solver rotation setting is made with single degree of rotation by putting mass the moment of inertia and axis of rotation the mass and moment of inertia for different rotor dimensions is depicted in appendix d thereafter dynamic mesh zone for each domain is created for the analysis details of dynamic mesh setup are presented in the form of a flow diagram in appendix e for superior rotor design the rotor performances are explored with the modification of following design parameters viz number of blades 12 31 inlet blade angles 15 90 rotor diameter 100 mm 300 mm rotor height 100

height h the design of the turbine and channel is created in design modeler ansys fig 2 information related to the size of fluid domain and rotating domain suggested by various researchers are presented in appendix b table b1 after that a mesh has been generated in the mesh module of ansys fig 3 further the model is imported to fluent boundary conditions are added for simulating velocity and pressure field with output torque and power table 3 and fig 2 suitable boundary condition setup for similar rotors suggested by various researchers is also presented in appendix b table b1 finally torque coefficient ct and power coefficient cp are calculated the velocity triangle at inlet and outlet for stage 1 and stage 2 are shown in fig 4 where u uw u ur uf α and β are the absolute velocity

velocity of fluid with rotor linear velocity rotor blade angle respectively subscript 1 2 and 3 4 indicate inlet outlet at stage 1 and stage 2 of rotor blade respectively as in the crossflow rotor fluid flow traverses the rotor blade twice when fluid flow from inlet to outlet so that stage 1 is considered for first time traverse and stage 2 is considered for second time traverse in the rotor blade to achieve a better mesh resolution and boundary layer the 20 layer of inflations are applied on the blade surface to describe the boundary layer flow fig 3 kumar and saini 2017 in the k ε turbulence model y value was recommended as less than one in order to fix the first prism layer above the blade surface kumar and saini 2017 as boundary layer flow over the rotor blade are more concerned to describe the flow surrounding the rotor the first prism layer above the blade surface wall is considered according to the y value 1 wherever for channel wall this value may be higher 2 2 time step independency and grid independency test computational results accuracy is affected by the size of the time step and mesh number the refinement of the time step and increased mesh number leads to higher accuracy in lieu of expensive computation time in consequence of this the time step and grid independence test is performed fig 5 and fig 6 where power coefficient cp and torque coefficient ct are defined as follows nag and sarkar 2020 1 c p p r o t p max 2 p max 0 5 ρ d h u 3 3 c t 4 t ρ u 2 d 2 h some other dimensionless numbers used in performance analysis are defined as follows 4 t s r ω d 2 u 5 σ n t b π d 6 a r h d 7 b r h d w h where pmax is maximum power available in the free stream prot is the power generated by the rotor and d represents the rotor diameter h

blade tb represents thickness of blade ar represents aspect ratio w represents channel width h represents channel height and br represents blockage ratio different level of mesh refinement details is listed in table 4 to determine the time step and grid independency the torque coefficient and power coefficient of the rotor are calculated for different refinement levels at 200 mm diameter 200 mm height 15 numbers of blade 30 blade angle length of blade 50 mm and 1 m s free stream velocity at refinement level 1 by choosing different time step 0 05 0 01 0 002 and 0 0004 s the time step independency is performed here 0 002 s time step is selected for further analysis as insignificant change is noticed in the results beyond this time step furthermore simulation is performed at different grid refinement levels here grid refinement level 4 is adopted as insignificant change is also noticed in the result beyond this grid size time step independency analysis in torque coefficient and power coefficient variation with flow time is shown in fig 5 whereas fig 6 shows grid independency analysis of the torque coefficient and power coefficient variation with angular velocity level 4 has 754646 elements with an average aspect ratio skewness and orthogonal quality of 1 906 0 22991 and 0 76851 respectively for cfd analysis these values can be considered as acceptable in view of a similar study conducted by sarma et al 2014 on savonius hkt where 196629 elements were selected for the computational domain of l w h as 1820 900 240 in mm with average skewness orthogonal quality and aspect ratio of 0 263 0 81 and 7 67 respectively further the study indicated that the numerical result has very good agreement with the experimental result therefore it may be believed that the present simulated results also have good conformity with the experimental result moreover the simulations is considered to be converged once the residuals of continuity velocities turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulence kinetic energy dissipation ε get stable and there is no significant changes in results after certain lenth of iteration and flow time presented in appendix f 2 3 validations by comparison with experimental setup result and details the experimental work is performed in the hydraulic flume setup fig 7 available in fluid machine laboratory department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology indian school of mines dhanbad to validate the numerical results in fig 7 a partially immerged rotor was shown for photographic representation however all the experiments are performed in full immerged conditions the experimental setup comprises two 10 hp electrical water pumps pressure gauge water flow control gate and butterfly valve channel length 6000 mm width 700 mm and height 600 mm with transparent observation panel rotor shaft mounting frame adjustable water storage tank etc the rotor is made of steel material having the following dimensions 200 mm diameter 200 mm height 15 numbers of blade 30 blade angle 0 35 mm blade thickness tb length of blade 50 mm and 1 mm endplate the blockage ratio br 0 214 is considered for numerical and experimental analysis according to present design data of channel and rotor as no significant effect found on turbine performance up to br 0 214 however for higher br 0 25 performance of rotor is considerably influenced fig 8 kolekar and banerjee 2015 reported that no significant variation of turbine performance is found for lower blockage ratios 0 1 and also for lower tsr values 4 0 in addition whelan et al 2009 has also reported that performance of rotor does not effected much for lower blockage ratio however for higher blockage 0 3 performance of rotor is highly influenced therefore it is considered that there is no significant effect of the blockage ratio on the performance in the present analysis as it has a lower blockage ratio br 0 214 and low range of tsr during experimentation free stream velocity was maintained as 1 m s and flow height maintain 400 mm by the help of the gate and butterfly valve so that rotor fully immerged in water in order to reduce the free surface effect once the flow velocity and height maintained in the channel the output reading i e torque power and speed of rotor are noted through the measuring instruments the details of the measuring instrument with its range accuracy uncertainties and time response are provided by the manufacturer are mentioned in table 5 thereafter the torque coefficient and power coefficient are calculated as per the data obtained from the experiment the maximum torque coefficient ctmax and maximum power coefficient cpmax obtained from numerical analysis are 0 616 0 0352 and experimental analysis are 0 69 0 0368 respectively fig 9 the percentage of error for ctmax and cpmax between numerical and experimental analysis are found as 12 and 4 55 respectively 2 4 flow driven simulation with given loads the torque and rotational speed corresponding to different loading conditions are shown in fig 10 for the rotor obtained from flow driven simulation fig 10 indicates the performance of the turbine under three different loading conditions namely free load condition and two applied load conditions with counter torques t of 0 3 n m and 0 5 n m initially in the free load condition the rotor accelerates fast from t 0 0 0 25s and the rotational speed then increases from 0 rpm to 10 rpm afterwards it accelerates slowly with the rotational speed finally reaches a maximum value of 17 rpm at t 1s that express the high self starting capability as it has quick acceleration in the beginning of the speed curve when the counter torque is applied rotational speed decreases significantly corresponding to the intensity of applied torque however torque and rotational speed variation trend are similar if high counter torque applied the rotational speed of the turbine is greatly reduced and the turbine starts to rotate in the opposite direction that demonstrate an over loading condition the counter torque values varies according to design parameters and operating condition used further the rotor s performance is calculated based on different loading conditions for various design parameters and operating conditions 2 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty ε demonstrates a measure of the fitness of a result value obtained in the experimental exercise in the engineering field in general for the performance of the rotor in the channel different parameters are measured namely velocity speed of rotor rotor torque and rotor power further based on the measured parameters tsr ct and cp are calculated in this study the uncertainty ε analysis is performed to find out the error on performance parameters by the help of eqs 8 10 nag and sarkar 2020 the uncertainties in tsr ct and cp of whirlybird rotor are found 5 3 6 2 and 6 9 respectively 8 t s r r u ω 2 ω

mesh fluid flow analysis of simple vertical axis crossflow whirlybird rotor has been investigated numerical analysis results are presented in the following sub sections here pressure and velocity distributions within the computational domain are represented in the contour form the torque power torque coefficient and power coefficient on the rotor at different parameters are also depicted in graphical form in the following subsections 3 1 influence of number of blades on turbine performance numerical simulation is performed to estimate ct and cp varying with an angular velocity corresponding to different numbers of blade n 12 31 at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm u of 1 m s length of blade 50 mm and 30 of blade angle at the inlet β1 the results obtained from the simulation in the form of ct ctmax cp and cpmax corresponding to the different number of blades are depicted in table 6 and fig 11 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in the number of blades are also depicted in table 6 this result indicates that initially with the increase in blade number ctmax increases significantly and after adding more blades to the rotor magnitude of the ctmax increment reduces and beyond a certain blade number no significant change is observed although the ctmax rises with the blade number from 12 to 27 however the magnitude of the increment reduces consecutively and cpmax decreases when the blade number increases from 27 to 31 this indicates that an increase of blade number beyond a certain value will cause a depletion in power production thus the optimal blade number is considered as 27 furthermore ct and cp relationship with tsr corresponding to different solidities ϭ 0 007 0 017 at u of 1 m s and 30 of blade angle at inlet β1 are depicted in fig 12 subsequently it is found that the variation of ct and cp with different solidities have a similar trend to the variation of ct and cp with the different number of blade while the cpmax found as 0 0455 corresponding to the solidity of 0 015 and tsr of 0 076 3 2 effect of blade angle the pressure and velocity distribution over the entire flow domain is shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in the form of contour for different blade angles at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm optimal blade number of 27 1 m s free stream velocity length of blade 50 mm and 1 s flow time the maximum pressure and maximum velocity found on the whirlybird rotor at different inlet blade angle β1 are depicted in table 7 it is observed that the maximum pressure increases with the increase in blade angle up to 75 and beyond that starts decreasing result also shows that pressure and velocity distribution patterns are similar for different blade angles but having different magnitudes a comparison is furnished to corroborate the flow velocity pattern surrounding the whirlybird rotor with the result obtained by kumar and saini 2017 for savonius hkt fig 14 shows that the velocity pattern at the inlet of the whirlybird rotor is similar for the given boundary conditions a high speed zone is found at the blade tip due to the rotor rotation whereas a low speed zone wake zone is found downstream of the rotor blades besides it is observed that flow velocity decreases sharply in the wake zone at the left and right side of the wake zone the flow velocity increases again periodically i e periodic high speed zone occurs subsequently the performance analysis is investigated at an optimal blade number of 27 by varying β1 the ct and cp varying with angular velocity are evaluated at different β1 15 90 with an interval of 15 at u of 1 m s fig 15 the ctmax and cpmax found on the whirlybird rotor at different inlet blade angles β1 are depicted in table 8 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in blade angle also depicted in table 8 the result discloses that initially with the increase in β1 ctmax increases significantly and beyond a certain β1 angle it drops drastically although the cpmax rises with the β1 from 15 to 75 however the increment reduces gradually and cpmax decreases between 75 and 90 blade angle this intends that an increase beyond a certain β1value will cause a drop in power production therefore the optimal blade angle is considered as 75 furthermore for more precise analysis the numerical simulation performed with more refinement β1 near the 75 i e at 70 and 80 fig 16 the maximum ct is found as 1 098 and 0 94 at 70 and 80 respectively and cpmax are found as 0 198 and 0 186 at 70 and 80 respectively higher cpmax value at β1 75 compare to 70 and 80 indicates that the optimum blade angle is 75 3 3 effect of rotor diameter and height the ct and cp are calculated with varying whirlybird rotor diameter d 100 150 200 250 300 mm and rotor height h 100 150 200 250 300 mm at n of 27 β1 of 75 l 50 mm and free stream velocity of 1 m s moreover for different rotor diameters height and aspect ratio ar the ct vs tsr and cp vs tsr are illustrated in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 the ctmax and cpmax found on the whirlybird rotor at different rotor diameters height and ar are depicted in table 9 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in rotor diameter and height also depicted in table 9 from the analysis it is detected that with the increase in rotor diameter ctmax increases considerably and beyond a certain diameter this value drops drastically whereas cpmax increases with rotor diameter and this percentage enhancement reduces with higher diameter although with an increase in rotor height ctmax and cpmax both increase significantly however this percentage enhancement decreases gradually with bigger height variation of ct and cp with tsr at simulated diameter and height d and h 100 150 200 250 and 300 mm have a similar trend and drastic drops are found in all values of ct when diameter increases beyond 200 mm it is also observed that with the increase in rotor diameter the ar decreases whereas with an increase in rotor height the ar increases when rotor diameter are variable at ar 0 67 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 0 498 and 0 389 corresponding to tsr 0 16 and 0 38 respectively whereas when rotor height are variable at ar 1 5 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 1 775 and 0 385 corresponding to tsr 0 15 and 0 264 respectively the plotting trend of the power coefficient corresponding to tsr for different d h and ars are displayed in figs 17 figs 18 and 19 the result indicates that the coefficient of power corresponding to both d and h of 300 mm and both ar equal to1 5 and 0 67 outperforms the other four combinations of d h and ar moreover it is observed that with a higher diameter cpmax found at a higher value of tsr compare to a higher height the maximum cp value of all simulated d h and ars are found to appear between 0 044 and 0 389 at tsr ranges between 0 198 and 0 38 thus the analysis establishes the fact that the rotor diameter and height have significant influence on turbine output as theoretically the power is proportional to the sweeping area d h of the turbine 3 4 effect of blade length the variation of ct and cp corresponding to tsr with varying blade length l 25 30 35 40 45 50 and 55 mm at n of 27 β1 of 75 d of 200 mm h of 200 mm and free stream velocity of 1 m s shown in fig 20 the ctmax and cpmax found 1 124 0 25 1 121 0 2657 1 14 0 2656 1 105 0 256 1 089 0 234 1 048 0 2 and 0 95 0 157 corresponding to l 25 30 35 40 45 50 and 55 mm respectively initially the performance of rotor calculated at blade length 50 mm and further the length of blade changed till optimal length of blade achieved the maximum cp 0 2657 found at blade length 30 mm beyond that depletion observed so that the optimal length of blade considered as 30 mm 3 5 performance of rotor under different free stream velocities the velocity vector in contour form for different free stream velocities are shown in fig 21 at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm n of 27 β1 of 75 and flow time of 1 s it is found that with the rise in free stream velocity the intensity of high rotating vortices at rotor tip wake zone downstream of the rotor blades at left and right side of wake zone is increased sharply it is also found that patterns of velocity vectors are similar for different free stream velocities but with different magnitudes a vortex is observed inside the runner dragomirescu 2011 has reported that the size of the vortex increases with an increase in tsr and consequently the performance of the turbine deteriorates at highertsr whirlybird turbine performance is analyzed at different u i e 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s 2 5 m s and 3 0 m s with rotor configuration as d of 200 mm h of 200 mm n of 27 β1 of 75 and l of 30 mm the relationship of torque vs angular velocity and power vs angular velocity are shown in fig 22 whereas the ct and cp corresponding to various angular velocities and tsrs are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the maximum torque power ctmax cpmax and tsr found on the whirlybird rotor at different free stream velocities are depicted in table 10 and table 11 the percentage difference in t and prot due to an increase in free stream velocity is also depicted in table 10 it is noted from table 10 and fig 22 that the output torque and power are substantially dependent on u these values indicate that initially with an increase in free stream velocity maximum torque and power increases significantly and later with higher free stream velocities the increment of maximum torque and power reduces gradually the relationship between ct vs angular velocity and cp vs angular velocity is depicted in fig 23 and ct vs tsr and cp vs tsr is depicted in fig 24 it is also observed that ct and cp at simulated free stream velocity u 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m s have a similar tendency and the maximum cp of all simulated free stream velocities appears between 0 25 and 0 28 at tsr between 0 27 and 0 29 table 11 in an experimental study on vertical axis crossflow modified savonius rotor golecha et al 2011 reported the cpmax and ctmax value as 0 14 and 0 2 respectively corresponding to the rotor diameter of 245 mm and height of 170 mm numerical analysis confirms that the power torque cpmax and ctmax are 1 36 w 0 21 n m 0 069 and 0 096 respectively for the vertical axis crossflow savonius rotor corresponding to the d of 200 mm h of 180 mm and u of 1 m s by nag and sarkar 2020 in the similar line of analysis in the similar condition the result obtained from the present analysis shows that power torque cpmax and ctmax are 5 31 w 2 24 n m 0 266 and 1 12 respectively corresponding to the d of 200 mm and h of 200 mm which is comparatively better than the previous 4 conclusions in this study performance analysis of the whirlybird rotor has been investigated by numerical analysis and validated with experimental results further the effect of number of blades n 12 31 solidity ϭ 0 007 0 017 blade angle β1 15 90 rotor diameter d 100 300 mm rotor height h 100 300 mm aspect ratio ar 0 5 2 0 blade length l 25 55 mm and free stream velocity u 0 5 3 m s on performance of rotor also investigated the key finding of the present investigation summarized as following points it is observed that pressure and velocity distribution patterns are similar for rotors having different numbers of the blade with varying pressure and velocity magnitude it is noted that the velocity pattern at the inlet to the rotors are similar in all cases a high speed zone is formed at the blade tip due to turbine rotation whereas a low speed zone wake zone is shaped downstream of the rotor blades where flow velocity decreases sharply on the left side and right side of the wake zone the flow velocity experiences a periodic high speed zone maximum torque coefficient and maximum power coefficient increase with the number of blade and blade angle β1 upto a limit and after that these values reduce drastically this means that an increase beyond a certain number of blades blade angles and length of blade will cause a depletion in power production therefore the optimal blade number blade angle and length of blade are considered as 27 75 and 30 mm respectively for the whirlybird rotor with the present design configuration the variation of ct and cp with different solidities are found to have a similar trend to the variation of ct and cp with different number of blade the cpmax value is found as 0 0455 corresponding to a solidity of 0 015 and tsr of 0 076 the analysis confirms that the rotor diameter height and stream velocity have a significant influence on the power produced by the turbine as power is proportional to the swept area and cube of free stream velocity the maximum power and torque coefficients increase with the increase in rotor diameter and rotor height as swept area increases however the percentage of enhancement decreases successively with larger diameter and height the maximum coefficient of performance found at a higher diameter and height for variable rotor diameter the ctmax and cpmax are found to be 0 498 and 0 389 corresponding to the tsr value of 0 16 and 0 38 respectively at ar 0 67 for variable rotor height at ar 1 5 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 1 775 and 0 385 corresponding to tsr of 0 15 and 0 264 respectively the maximum cp of all simulated d h and ars appear between 0 044 and 0 389 corresponding to the tsr range between 0 198 and 0 38 it is also found that ct and cp at simulated free stream velocity u 0 5 3 m s have a similar trend and that the maximum cp of all simulated free stream velocity appears between 0 25 and 0 28 at tsr between 0 27 and 0 29 when considering the following design configuration of rotor optimal blade number 27 blade angle 75 length of blade 30 mm 200 mm diameter and 200 mm height at the same time the maximum ct appears between 1 063 and 1 12 studies reported by dragomirescu 2011 for crossflow whirlybird wind turbine shows that the maximum power coefficients 0 45 at tsr 0 3 and suggested that the turbine can operate only in a relatively narrow range of tsr tsr less than 0 6 in the present study the maximum power coefficient is found as 0 389 at tsr 0 38 therefore result obtained in the present study have satisfactory agreement with the result reported by dragomirescu 2011 in a similar condition power torque cpmax and ctmax obtained in the present analysis are comparatively better than the results reported by golecha et al 2011 and nag and sarkar 2020 it is observed that whirlybird vertical axis crossflow rotor having a high starting torque coefficient compare to the other types of rotor that lead the turbine to start fast even in low free stream velocity although the rotor has a low range of tsr it works well in both low as well as high free stream velocity conditions this rotor produces significant power and works efficiently even in low free stream condition 0 5 1 m s giving the flexibility to employ this rotor in low free stream conditions compared to other types of rotor credit authorship contribution statement ravindra bhagat software investigation formal analysis data curation dinesh kumar

results of numerical analysis are validated with the experiment numerical analysis results shown in the form of pressure contour velocity contour and velocity vector are served to explain the flow phenomenon surrounding the rotor subsequently effects of the number of blades blade angle rotor diameter rotor height blade length and free stream velocity on the performance of rotor are also investigated it is found that with the increase in blade number blade angle and blade length the maximum torque coefficient and maximum power coefficient increase up to a certain limit and then drop drastically in view of these the optimal blade number blade angle and blade length are determined as 27 75 and 30 mm respectively for the present design configuration of the rotor moreover the

conversion systems electricity demand is increasing with the modernization of civilization to fulfill the demand different renewable and non renewable energy sources are used to produce electricity the river or canal water ocean waves are some of the potential sources of renewable energy however harnessing electric energy from the river water on a large scale by constructing the dam raises some problems like the migration of residents high initial cost difficulties in maintenance installation space for power and environmental flora fauna issues these facts lead to developing micro power stations especially in the remote areas which are off grid and where flowing flow is available and the power requirement is not so high a hydrokinetic turbine hkt is a turbine that uses free stream velocity to convert fluid energy into mechanical energy and finally electricity is produced from it kumar and sarkar 2016a energy can be harnessed by using hkt if free stream velocity is minimum 0 5 m s and having 1 75m of water depth to install the turbine thorpton energy 2021 talukdar et al 2019 so far there are different types of hydrokinetic turbines designed and applied in the field fig 1 kumar and sarkar 2016a mostly they can be classified based on various aspects say based on fluid flow direction hkt can be classified as axial flow and crossflow further axial flow turbine is classified based on axis alignment as horizontal axis and inclined axis whereas crossflow turbine is classified as the vertical axis and in plane axis furthermore crossflow vertical axis hkt can also be classified based on their blade construction viz savonius darrieus gorlov etc there are different advantages of cross flow vertical axis turbine for example simple design and construction low manufacturing cost low maintenance cost low transportation cost and ability to install in small and narrow rivers however there are some disadvantages also like low efficiency and inability to self start compared to the axial flow horizontal axis turbine the details of different crossflow turbines and their performance affecting parameters are also discussed in appendix a based on fluid flow conditions available theoretical power installation facility in a particular site hkts are chosen or designed kumar and saini 2016 saini and saini 2019 2020 2020 le et al 2014 1 2 working principle of hydrokinetic turbines based on the energy conversion technique hydrokinetic energy converters are classified as turbine type and non turbine type talukdar et al 2019 the turbine type energy converter machine or hydrokinetic turbine hkt is based on a rotating machine whether other types of motion viz oscillation torsional buffering drives non turbine type converter in general the working principle of the hkt is similar to the wind turbines the only difference is the fluid handled designs of most hkts are conceptualized from the wind turbine rotors and subsequent design modifications are done to suit the working environment the study shows that the performance of the hkt is superior to that of the wind turbine saini and saini 2019 sarma et al 2014 the maximum power extracted by hkt run in the same operating condition has been found to be increased by 61 32 compared to wind turbines sarma et al 2014 primarily hkts are designed based on drag and lift force techniques savonius hkt is drag based turbine and darrieous gorlov hkts are lift based turbine in general drag based turbines have less tip speed ratio tsr experience comparatively less starting torque problems compared to the lift based turbines on the other hand horizontal axis turbine has better efficiency coefficient of power compared to vertical axis turbines but due to complexity in mounting arrangement vertical axis hkts are preferred thus researchers always in search of a hkt model having a simple design better starting torque and high coefficient of power 1 3 scope of the work in the present study the whirlybird crossflow vertical axis turbine is planned to introduce to work under the hydro environment as hkt in view of its better self starting capability in wind environment and high power coefficient comparable to those of horizontal axis turbines this turbine is generally preferred moreover it has a narrow range of tip speed ratio and this turbine works well in both low and high wind conditions dragomirescu 2011 1 4 literature review on whirlybird turbine whirlybird roof top rotor ventilators are generally used for ventilation purposes as they can work without any external supply of electric energy the rising heat within the room and passing wind outside turn the turbine ventilate the house simultaneously thus whirlybird roof top rotor ventilator is used as a turbine to convert the wind kinetic energy into electrical energy by placing a generator beneath the spinning turbine torasaa and sermsri 2015 sometimes the effectiveness of the roof ventilator is increased by adding the extra fins in the ventilator system to help it work faster and make it more spin efficient daut et al 2011 furthermore to reduce the starting torque of this rotor modification is done in the positions of the stator and rotor in addition to this a magnetic levitation system is also attached kaewtip and hoonchareon 2014 this whirlybird turbine system uses different generators like permanent magnet synchronous generator pmsg axial flux permanent magnet afpm ac generator and ac synchronous generator to produce electricity and then stores it in a battery further the battery supplies power to the small electronic systems lloyd and michener 2014 zagade et al 2015 suresh et al 2017 it is observed that a 24 inch turbine rotor with ac generator can produce 10 12 v at 285 300 rpm zagade et al 2016 the study shows that more mass flow occurs at the large throat diameter of the whirlybird turbine ventilator and the same increases with the rotational speed of the turbo ventilator jadhav et al 2016 khan et al 2008 in order to increase the rotation of the turbine a wind cup arrangement is applied that improves the efficiency of the turbine ventilator by 1 7 harun et al 2018 summary of investigations performed by various researchers on whirlybird rotor is mentioned in table 1 table 1 discusses numerical and experimental studies their specific analysis method parameters investigated range of parameters optimum values and performance enhancement criterion 1 5 objectives and outline of the work from the literature survey a necessity of introducing a hkt is felt having a simple design better starting torque with a high coefficient of power it is found that whirlybird crossflow vertical axis turbine can harvest wind power even when the wind speed is low it is also observed that it has better self starting capability and a high coefficient of power comparable to those of horizontal axis turbines and other vertical axis turbines even in low wind speed conditions dragomirescu 2011 these phenomena inspire to employ this turbine as hkt under the hydro environment and to optimize its design parameters suitable for hydro environment which is the nobility of the work therefore objectives of the study are set as i to explore the performance of whirlybird hkt numerically and experimentally in different operating conditions ii to explain the flow phenomenon surrounding the rotor iii to explore the effect of different design parameters viz the number of blades blade angle rotor diameter rotor height blade length on the performance of the rotor finally the

design parameters this study comprises 3d modelling of the rotor and flume 3d model mesh generation with initial and boundary conditions implemented in the computational setup on the other hand an experimental investigation is conducted in a laboratory setup consists of a hydraulic flume and the proposed turbine rotor through numerical analysis the flow environment is simulated and the results

software through the computational fluid dynamics cfd commercial package fluent the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation along with the continuity equation is solved to get the velocity field the pressure field tangential velocity and the rotor torque lien and ahmed 2010 furthermore the k ε turbulence model and the couple algorithm are used when solving the continuity and the rans equations kumar and sarkar 2016b wu et al 2012 k ε turbulence model is adopted because in general this model is suitable for simulating the 3d model having curved surfaces like rotor blade surface and sharp edges like rotor blade tip results obtained through this technique have perfect agreement with experimental results of vertical axis crossflow type of hkts in appendix b analysis presented by other researchers is depicted in table b1 a comparative analysis of different turbulence models on the proposed rotor is also presented in figure b1 appendix b for better accuracy the second order upwind scheme and dynamic mesh are used in a dynamic mesh setup a flow driven simulation is adopted with six degree of freedom solver in flow driven simulation the tsr value is unknown initially and can be found after the simulation however in conventional technique multi reference frame mrf tsr value is known before the simulation le et al 2014 fleisinger et al 2014 le et al 2014 reported that in the flow driven simulation the power coefficient curve is similar to those obtained in simulation with given tsr verified for the present study and presented in appendix c further in six degree of

velocity of fluid with rotor linear velocity rotor blade angle respectively subscript 1 2 and 3 4 indicate inlet outlet at stage 1 and stage 2 of rotor blade respectively as in the crossflow rotor fluid flow traverses the rotor blade twice when fluid flow from inlet to outlet so that stage 1 is considered for first time traverse and stage 2 is considered for second time traverse in the rotor blade to achieve a better mesh resolution and boundary layer the 20 layer of inflations are applied on the blade surface to describe the boundary layer flow fig 3 kumar and saini 2017 in the k ε turbulence model y value was recommended as less than one in order to fix the first prism layer above the blade surface kumar and saini 2017 as boundary layer flow over the rotor blade are more concerned to describe the flow surrounding the rotor the first prism layer above the blade surface wall is considered according to the y value 1 wherever for channel wall this value may be higher 2 2 time step independency and grid independency test computational results accuracy is affected by the size of the time step and mesh number the refinement of the time step and increased mesh number

different grid refinement levels here grid refinement level 4 is adopted as insignificant change is also noticed in the result beyond this grid size time step independency analysis in torque coefficient and power coefficient variation with flow time is shown in fig 5 whereas fig 6 shows grid independency analysis of the torque coefficient and power coefficient variation with angular velocity level 4 has 754646 elements with an average aspect ratio skewness and orthogonal quality of 1 906 0 22991 and 0 76851 respectively for cfd analysis these values can be considered as acceptable in view of a similar study conducted by sarma et al 2014 on savonius hkt where 196629 elements were selected for the computational domain of l w h as 1820 900 240 in mm with average skewness orthogonal quality and aspect ratio of 0 263 0 81 and 7 67 respectively further the study indicated that the numerical result has very good agreement with the experimental result therefore it may be believed that the present simulated results also have good conformity with the experimental result moreover the simulations is considered to be converged once the residuals of continuity velocities turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulence kinetic energy dissipation ε get stable and there is no significant changes in results after certain lenth of iteration and flow time presented in appendix f 2 3 validations by comparison with experimental setup result and details the experimental work is performed in the hydraulic flume setup fig 7 available in fluid machine laboratory department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology indian school of mines dhanbad to validate the numerical results in fig 7 a partially immerged rotor was shown for photographic representation however all the experiments are performed in full immerged conditions the experimental setup comprises two 10 hp electrical water pumps pressure gauge water flow control gate and butterfly valve channel length 6000 mm width 700 mm and height 600 mm with transparent observation panel rotor shaft mounting frame adjustable water storage tank etc the rotor is made of steel material having the following dimensions 200 mm diameter 200 mm height 15 numbers of blade 30 blade angle 0 35 mm blade thickness tb length of blade 50 mm and 1 mm endplate the blockage ratio br 0 214 is considered for numerical and experimental analysis according to present design data of channel and rotor as no significant effect found on turbine performance up to br 0 214 however for higher br 0 25 performance of rotor is considerably influenced fig 8 kolekar and banerjee 2015 reported that no significant variation of turbine performance is found for lower blockage ratios 0 1 and also for lower tsr values 4 0 in addition whelan et al 2009 has also reported that performance of rotor does not effected much for lower blockage ratio however for higher blockage 0 3 performance of rotor is highly influenced therefore it is considered that there is no significant effect of the blockage ratio on the performance in the present analysis as it has a lower blockage ratio br 0 214 and low range of tsr during experimentation free stream velocity was maintained as 1 m s and flow height maintain 400 mm by the help of the gate and butterfly valve so that rotor fully immerged in water in order to reduce the free surface effect once the flow velocity and height maintained in the channel the output reading i e torque power and speed of rotor are noted through the measuring instruments the details of the measuring instrument with its range accuracy uncertainties and time response are provided by the manufacturer are mentioned in table 5 thereafter the torque coefficient and power coefficient are calculated as per the data obtained from the experiment the maximum torque coefficient ctmax and maximum power coefficient cpmax obtained from numerical analysis are 0 616 0 0352 and experimental analysis are 0 69 0 0368 respectively fig 9 the percentage of error for ctmax and cpmax between numerical and experimental analysis are found as 12 and 4 55 respectively 2 4 flow driven simulation with given loads the torque and rotational speed corresponding to different loading conditions are shown in fig 10 for the rotor obtained from flow driven simulation fig 10 indicates the performance of the turbine under three different loading conditions namely free load condition and two applied load conditions with counter torques t of 0 3 n m and 0 5 n m initially in the free load condition the rotor accelerates fast from t 0 0 0 25s and the rotational speed then increases from 0 rpm to 10 rpm afterwards it accelerates slowly with the rotational speed finally reaches a maximum value of 17 rpm at t 1s that express the high self starting capability as it has quick acceleration in the beginning of the speed curve when the counter torque is applied rotational speed decreases significantly corresponding to the intensity of applied torque however torque and rotational speed variation trend are similar if high counter torque applied the rotational speed of the turbine is greatly reduced and the turbine starts to rotate in the opposite direction that demonstrate an over loading condition the counter torque values varies according to design parameters and operating condition used further the rotor s performance is calculated based on different loading conditions for various design parameters and operating conditions 2 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty ε demonstrates a measure of the fitness of a result value obtained in the experimental exercise in the engineering field in general for the performance of the rotor in the channel different parameters are measured namely velocity speed of rotor rotor torque and rotor power further based on the measured parameters tsr ct and cp are calculated in this study the uncertainty ε analysis is performed to find out the error on performance parameters by the help of eqs 8 10 nag and sarkar 2020 the uncertainties in tsr ct and cp of whirlybird rotor are found 5 3 6 2 and 6 9 respectively 8 t s r r u ω 2 ω

mesh fluid flow analysis of simple vertical axis crossflow whirlybird rotor has been investigated numerical analysis results are presented in the following sub sections here pressure and velocity distributions within the computational domain are represented in the contour form the torque power torque coefficient and power coefficient on the rotor at different parameters are also depicted in graphical form in the following subsections 3 1 influence of number of blades on turbine performance numerical simulation is performed to estimate ct and cp varying with an angular velocity corresponding to different numbers of blade n 12 31 at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm u of 1 m s length of blade 50 mm and 30 of blade angle at the inlet β1 the results obtained from the simulation in the form of ct ctmax cp and cpmax corresponding to the different number of blades are depicted in table 6 and fig 11 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in the number of blades are also depicted in table 6 this result indicates that initially with the increase in blade number ctmax increases significantly and after adding more blades to the rotor magnitude of the ctmax increment reduces and beyond a certain blade number no significant change is observed although the ctmax rises with the blade number from 12 to 27 however the magnitude of the increment reduces consecutively and cpmax decreases when the blade number increases from 27 to 31 this indicates that an increase of blade number beyond a certain value will cause a depletion in power production thus the optimal blade number is considered as 27 furthermore ct and cp relationship with tsr corresponding to different solidities ϭ 0 007 0 017 at u of 1 m s and 30 of blade angle at inlet β1 are depicted in fig 12 subsequently it is found that the variation of ct and cp with different solidities have a similar trend to the variation of ct and cp with the different number of blade while the cpmax found as 0 0455 corresponding to the solidity of 0 015 and tsr of 0 076 3 2 effect of blade angle the pressure and velocity distribution over the entire flow domain is shown in fig 13 and fig 14 in the form of contour for different blade angles at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm optimal blade number of 27 1 m s free stream velocity length of blade 50 mm and 1 s flow time the maximum pressure and maximum velocity found on the whirlybird rotor at different inlet blade angle β1 are depicted in table 7 it is observed that the maximum pressure increases with the increase in blade angle up to 75 and beyond that starts decreasing result also shows that pressure and velocity distribution patterns are similar for different blade angles but having different magnitudes a comparison is furnished to corroborate the flow velocity pattern surrounding the whirlybird rotor with the result obtained by kumar and saini 2017 for savonius hkt fig 14 shows that the velocity pattern at the inlet of the whirlybird rotor is similar for the given boundary conditions a high speed zone is found at the blade tip due to the rotor rotation whereas a low speed zone wake zone is found downstream of the rotor blades besides it is observed that flow velocity decreases sharply in the wake zone at the left and right side of the wake zone the flow velocity increases again periodically i e periodic high speed zone occurs subsequently the performance analysis is investigated at an optimal blade number of 27 by varying β1 the ct and cp varying with angular velocity are evaluated at different β1 15 90 with an interval of 15 at u of 1 m s fig 15 the ctmax and cpmax found on the whirlybird rotor at different inlet blade angles β1 are depicted in table 8 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in blade angle also depicted in table 8 the result discloses that initially with the increase in β1 ctmax increases significantly and beyond a certain β1 angle it drops drastically although the cpmax rises with the β1 from 15 to 75 however the increment reduces gradually and cpmax decreases between 75 and 90 blade angle this intends that an increase beyond a certain β1value will cause a drop in power production therefore the optimal blade angle is considered as 75 furthermore for more precise analysis the numerical simulation performed with more refinement β1 near the 75 i e at 70 and 80 fig 16 the maximum ct is found as 1 098 and 0 94 at 70 and 80 respectively and cpmax are found as 0 198 and 0 186 at 70 and 80 respectively higher cpmax value at β1 75 compare to 70 and 80 indicates that the optimum blade angle is 75 3 3 effect of rotor diameter and height the ct and cp are calculated with varying whirlybird rotor diameter d 100 150 200 250 300 mm and rotor height h 100 150 200 250 300 mm at n of 27 β1 of 75 l 50 mm and free stream velocity of 1 m s moreover for different rotor diameters height and aspect ratio ar the ct vs tsr and cp vs tsr are illustrated in fig 17 fig 18 and fig 19 the ctmax and cpmax found on the whirlybird rotor at different rotor diameters height and ar are depicted in table 9 the percentage difference in ctmax and cpmax due to an increase in rotor diameter and height also depicted in table 9 from the analysis it is detected that with the increase in rotor diameter ctmax increases considerably and beyond a certain diameter this value drops drastically whereas cpmax increases with rotor diameter and this percentage enhancement reduces with higher diameter although with an increase in rotor height ctmax and cpmax both increase significantly however this percentage enhancement decreases gradually with bigger height variation of ct and cp with tsr at simulated diameter and height d and h 100 150 200 250 and 300 mm have a similar trend and drastic drops are found in all values of ct when diameter increases beyond 200 mm it is also observed that with the increase in rotor diameter the ar decreases whereas with an increase in rotor height the ar increases when rotor diameter are variable at ar 0 67 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 0 498 and 0 389 corresponding to tsr 0 16 and 0 38 respectively whereas when rotor height are variable at ar 1 5 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 1 775 and 0 385 corresponding to tsr 0 15 and 0 264 respectively the plotting trend of the power coefficient corresponding to tsr for different d h and ars are displayed in figs 17 figs 18 and 19 the result indicates that the coefficient of power corresponding to both d and h of 300 mm and both ar equal to1 5 and 0 67 outperforms the other four combinations of d h and ar moreover it is observed that with a higher diameter cpmax found at a higher value of tsr compare to a higher height the maximum cp value of all simulated d h and ars are found to appear between 0 044 and 0 389 at tsr ranges between 0 198 and 0 38 thus the analysis establishes the fact that the rotor diameter and height have significant influence on turbine output as theoretically the power is proportional to the sweeping area d h of the turbine 3 4 effect of blade length the variation of ct and cp corresponding to tsr with varying blade length l 25 30 35 40 45 50 and 55 mm at n of 27 β1 of 75 d of 200 mm h of 200 mm and free stream velocity of 1 m s shown in fig 20 the ctmax and cpmax found 1 124 0 25 1 121 0 2657 1 14 0 2656 1 105 0 256 1 089 0 234 1 048 0 2 and 0 95 0 157 corresponding to l 25 30 35 40 45 50 and 55 mm respectively initially the performance of rotor calculated at blade length 50 mm and further the length of blade changed till optimal length of blade achieved the maximum cp 0 2657 found at blade length 30 mm beyond that depletion observed so that the optimal length of blade considered as 30 mm 3 5 performance of rotor under different free stream velocities the velocity vector in contour form for different free stream velocities are shown in fig 21 at d of 200 mm h of 200 mm n of 27 β1 of 75 and flow time of 1 s it is found that with the rise in free stream velocity the intensity of high rotating vortices at rotor tip wake zone downstream of the rotor blades at left and right side of wake zone is increased sharply it is also found that patterns of velocity vectors are similar for different free stream velocities but with different magnitudes a vortex is observed inside the runner dragomirescu 2011 has reported that the size of the vortex increases with an increase in tsr and consequently the performance of the turbine deteriorates at highertsr whirlybird turbine performance is analyzed at different u i e 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s 2 5 m s and 3 0 m s with rotor configuration as d of 200 mm h of 200 mm n of 27 β1 of 75 and l of 30 mm the relationship of torque vs angular velocity and power vs angular velocity are shown in fig 22 whereas the ct and cp corresponding to various angular velocities and tsrs are shown in fig 23 and fig 24 the maximum torque power ctmax cpmax and tsr found on the whirlybird rotor at different free stream velocities are depicted in table 10 and table 11 the percentage difference in t and prot due to an increase in free stream velocity is also depicted in table 10 it is noted from table 10 and fig 22 that the output torque and power are substantially dependent on u these values indicate that initially with an increase in free stream velocity maximum torque and power increases significantly and later with higher free stream velocities the increment of maximum torque and power reduces gradually the relationship between ct vs angular velocity and cp vs angular velocity is depicted in fig 23 and ct vs tsr and cp vs tsr is depicted in fig 24 it is also observed that ct and cp at simulated free stream velocity u 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 3 m s have a similar tendency and the maximum cp of all simulated free stream velocities appears between 0 25 and 0 28 at tsr between 0 27 and 0 29 table 11 in an experimental study on vertical axis crossflow modified savonius rotor golecha et al 2011 reported the cpmax and ctmax value as 0 14 and 0 2 respectively corresponding to the rotor diameter of 245 mm and height of 170 mm numerical analysis confirms that the power torque cpmax and ctmax are 1 36 w 0 21 n m 0 069 and 0 096 respectively for the vertical axis crossflow savonius rotor corresponding to the d of 200 mm h of 180 mm and u of 1 m s by nag and sarkar 2020 in the similar line of analysis in the similar condition the result obtained from the present analysis shows that power torque cpmax and ctmax are 5 31 w 2 24 n m 0 266 and 1 12 respectively corresponding to the d of 200 mm and h of 200 mm which is comparatively better than the previous 4 conclusions in this study performance analysis of the whirlybird rotor has been investigated by numerical analysis and validated with experimental results further the effect of number of blades n 12 31 solidity ϭ 0 007 0 017 blade angle β1 15 90 rotor diameter d 100 300 mm rotor height h 100 300 mm aspect ratio ar 0 5 2 0 blade length l 25 55 mm and free stream velocity u 0 5 3 m s on performance of rotor also investigated the key finding of the present investigation summarized as following points it is observed that pressure and velocity distribution patterns are similar for rotors having different numbers of the blade with varying pressure and velocity magnitude it is noted that the velocity pattern at the inlet to the rotors are similar in all cases a high speed zone is formed at the blade tip due to turbine rotation whereas a low speed zone wake zone is shaped downstream of the rotor blades where flow velocity decreases sharply on the left side and right side of the wake zone the flow velocity experiences a periodic high speed zone maximum torque coefficient and maximum power coefficient increase with the number of blade and blade angle β1 upto a limit and after that these values reduce drastically this means that an increase beyond a certain number of blades blade angles and length of blade will cause a depletion in power production therefore the optimal blade number blade angle and length of blade are considered as 27 75 and 30 mm respectively for the whirlybird rotor with the present design configuration the variation of ct and cp with different solidities are found to have a similar trend to the variation of ct and cp with different number of blade the cpmax value is found as 0 0455 corresponding to a solidity of 0 015 and tsr of 0 076 the analysis confirms that the rotor diameter height and stream velocity have a significant influence on the power produced by the turbine as power is proportional to the swept area and cube of free stream velocity the maximum power and torque coefficients increase with the increase in rotor diameter and rotor height as swept area increases however the percentage of enhancement decreases successively with larger diameter and height the maximum coefficient of performance found at a higher diameter and height for variable rotor diameter the ctmax and cpmax are found to be 0 498 and 0 389 corresponding to the tsr value of 0 16 and 0 38 respectively at ar 0 67 for variable rotor height at ar 1 5 the ctmax and cpmax are found as 1 775 and 0 385 corresponding to tsr of 0 15 and 0 264 respectively the maximum cp of all simulated d h and ars appear between 0 044 and 0 389 corresponding to the tsr range between 0 198 and 0 38 it is also found that ct and cp at simulated free stream velocity u 0 5 3 m s have a similar trend and that the maximum cp of all simulated free stream velocity appears between 0 25 and 0 28 at tsr between 0 27 and 0 29 when considering the following design configuration of rotor optimal blade number 27 blade angle 75 length of blade 30 mm 200 mm diameter and 200 mm height at the same time the maximum ct appears between 1 063 and 1 12 studies reported by dragomirescu 2011 for crossflow whirlybird wind turbine shows that the maximum power coefficients 0 45 at tsr 0 3 and suggested that the turbine can operate only in a relatively narrow range of tsr tsr less than 0 6 in the present study the maximum power coefficient is found as 0 389 at tsr 0 38 therefore result obtained in the present study have satisfactory agreement with the result reported by dragomirescu 2011 in a similar condition power torque cpmax and ctmax obtained in the present analysis are comparatively better than the results reported by golecha et al 2011 and nag and sarkar 2020 it is observed that whirlybird vertical axis crossflow rotor having a high starting torque coefficient compare to the other types of rotor that lead the turbine to start fast even in low free stream velocity although the rotor has a low range of tsr it works well in both low as well as high free stream velocity conditions this rotor produces significant power and works efficiently even in low free stream condition 0 5 1 m s giving the flexibility to employ this rotor in low free stream conditions compared to other types of rotor credit authorship contribution statement ravindra bhagat software investigation formal analysis data curation dinesh kumar

20268,slamming induced whipping is traditionally computed as the response of a linear elastic structural model however in order to investigate the consequence of whipping on the hull girder s collapse the hydro structure interaction must be performed in a fully coupled approach where the nonlinearities of both domains are considered therefore this paper presents a new approach developed for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem the structural part is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected with a nonlinear hinge described by the nonlinear relation between the internal bending moment and the relative rotation angle the hydrodynamic problem is solved using the 3d boundary element method and the exact coupling between the structural and the 3d hydrodynamic models is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic boundary value problem for each shape function of the finite element beam model the hydroelastoplastic response is calculated using a hybrid nonlinear time domain approach allowing for very fast computation of the nonlinear whipping response finally the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a broad range of ships and it is compared to the linear whipping response in order to derive the whipping effectiveness coefficients it is shown that the nonlinear structural behavior has a very small influence on the whipping response and thus the effectiveness of whipping should not be reduced keywords hydroelastoplasticity nonlinear whipping dynamic collapse ultra large container ships 1 introduction the modern world is driven by the need for safe environmentally friendly and economical ship designs in consequence the prediction of wave induced motions and loads is of paramount importance the classic seakeeping methods used for computing the hydrodynamic responses of a ship are based on the assumption that structural deformations are small and consequently the ship is considered as a rigid body this leads to the so called quasi static approach for evaluating the structural response where the effects of the structural dynamics ship vibrations are neglected this approach works well as far as the response of the structural natural modes is not dynamically amplified which is the case most often in practice but not always for the cases where the dynamic amplification of the structural response is important the full coupling of the hydrodynamic loading and the structural response is required as far as the global structural response is concerned two main physical phenomena are of concern springing and whipping the springing is a resonant phenomenon and represents the entertained hull vibrations induced by the continuous action of the wave loading while the whipping represents the transient hull vibrations induced by the impulsive hydrodynamic loading slamming green water etc due to its resonant character the springing response becomes significant only when the excitation frequencies are close to the frequencies of the structural natural modes contrary to springing the whipping is mainly driven by the nature of the impulsive loading which is usually independent of the structural natural frequencies this means that any floating body can be potentially affected if the ratio of the impulsive loading duration and the structural natural period is critical in the case of ultra large container ships ulcs the natural frequencies are usually low few seconds and at the same time the slamming loads are important large bow flare combined with the relatively high ship speed hence ulcs are prone to both springing and whipping types of hydroelastic responses only the whipping phenomenon is of concern in this paper the preliminary investigations by bishop and price 1979 fostered an understanding of the physical phenomena behind the hydroelasticity of ships since then several more or less sophisticated models were proposed where the hydroelastic problem is solved at different levels of complexity and accuracy one of the well established methods was proposed by tuitman and malenica 2009 and it solves the fully coupled hydroelastic problem by making use of the generalized modes approach the natural modes can be calculated either using a one dimensional 1d beam model or the full three dimensional 3d finite element method fem model of the ship structure after solving the general seakeeping problem in the frequency domain using a 3d boundary element method bem based on green s sources the time domain simulation is performed following the approach proposed by cummins 1962 aside from that several nonlinear effects are added such as the froude krylov correction and the slamming loads which are calculated using the generalized wagner model gwm wagner 1932 de lauzon et al 2015 the method allows for the computation of springing and whipping responses and was validated with both experimental and full scale results derbanne et al 2010 more recently kim et al 2013 developed a similar fully coupled hydroelastic method in their method the hydrodynamic problem is solved using a b spline 3d rankine panel method while the structural model can also be either a 1d or a 3d fem model the slamming loads are also determined using the gwm the coupling between the structural and the hydrodynamic model is made directly which allows direct access to the structural responses at any required position the method showed good results when compared with the model tests kim et al 2014 nevertheless the computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques have evolved significantly in the past decade seng 2012 developed a numerical method for computing the springing and slamming induced whipping responses of a ship using openfoam an open source cfd package weller et al 1998 the structural part was modeled as a classical non uniform timoshenko beam model and the transfer of the displacement and fluid forces was performed using the modal spaces the procedure developed by seng 2012 agreed satisfactorily with model tests and showed the potential to accurately predict the global hydroelastic responses using the so called field methods seng et al 2014 the prediction of extreme loads including wave induced vibrations using numerical solutions of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations has also been reported by oberhagemann et al 2015 more recently several researchers investigated the hydroelastic response using fully coupled cfd fea finite element analysis for example lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2018 and seng et al 2018 takami and iijima 2019 investigated the combined global and local hydroelastic response in a large container ship based on two way coupled cfd and fea for the hydrodynamic part they adopted a commercial solver named star ccm while the structural part is modeled as a 3d finite element fe model and the fea solver of choice was the dynamic explicit solver implemented in ls dyna the two way coupling is performed in a staggered manner and shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data however the cost of running a two way strongly coupled simulation is very high 30 h per physical 10 s in full scale on a modern workstation in the aforementioned methods and investigations as well as in the works reported in the extensive literature reviews by chen et al 2006 hirdaris and temarel 2009 and temarel et al 2016 ergin et al 2018 the structural behavior is always treated as linear and elastic however the real structural behavior is nonlinear elastic plastic this means that when a ship is subjected to an extreme loading scenario the hull girder might suffer from local buckling or plastic deformations comporting different than the linear elastic assumption moreover it should be mentioned that after the two accidents msc napoli and mol comfort branch 2008 classnk 2014 the importance of whipping on the extreme hull girder loads has received much attention but its consequences on the hull girder s collapse are still unclear the most common practice to evaluate the ultimate strength of a relatively flexible floating structure is to compare the maximum dynamic vertical bending moment vbm after a slamming event which is derived from hydroelastic calculations with the quasi static hull girder capacity where the quasi static hull girder ultimate strength is determined either by simplified methods such as the smith method or by some more advanced methods such as idealized structural unit method or nonlinear finite element method smith 1977 ueda and rashed 1984 paik et al 2008 some aspects regarding the current procedure remain unclear for example the influence of the dynamic effects associated with the whipping induced stresses or the capability of the current hydroelastic methods to accurately predict the extreme dynamic response on the basis of a linear elastic structural model the first aspect was previously investigated by the authors and it was found that the dynamic factors are having a minimal effect over the structural capacity the comprehensive analyses of the dynamic ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be found in jagite et al 2019a and jagite et al 2020b while the analyses of the dynamic hull girder ultimate strength are presented in jagite et al 2019b and jagite et al 2020a the second aspect represents the starting point of the research work presented in this paper aiming at analyzing the influence of the nonlinearities existing in the structural model over the slamming induced whipping response thus the hydroelastic problem transforms into a hydroelastoplastic problem in the hydroelastoplasticity of ships the structural behavior is nonlinear including material and geometric nonlinearities a preliminary investigation on the hydroelastoplastic response of a ship subjected to slamming induced whipping was reported by dow 1981 they developed a numerical model that considers the ship as 21 lumped masses connected by beam elements the lumped masses included the hydrodynamic added mass of the first elastic mode for the structural part only four of the total beam elements were enforced with a precomputed moment curvature behavior others kept a purely elastic behavior dow 1981 applied a short impulse load 0 05 s near the fore end of the ship which was supposed to represent the bottom impact slamming their preliminary results showed that the hull girder capacity was increased by about 70 95 when short impulsive loads were applied however dow 1981 acknowledged that the loading scenarios considered were not representing the reality and more realistic scenarios should be considered where the high frequency loads whipping are combined with the low frequency loads wave loads and with the still water component about 30 years later iijima et al 2011 investigated the dynamic collapse of a ship s hull girder in waves having a focus on the post ultimate strength behavior in their model the hydrodynamic problem was solved by making use of the nonlinear strip theory while the structural part was considered as two rigid bodies connected to each other by a nonlinear rotational spring the numerical model was validated against several experimental investigations that considered both structural and hydrodynamic similarities the model developed by iijima et al 2011 shows the capability of following a precomputed moment curvature behavior and computes the severity of the collapse under large single wave loads several similar investigations on the post collapse behavior of the ship s hull girder have been reported by xu et al 2011 iijima and fujikubo 2012 2015 and iijima and fujikubo 2018 it is worth mentioning that the recent studies considered the hull girder as two elastic beams connected by a nonlinear rotational spring and the hydrodynamic problem being solved by making use of the boundary element method however the structure is subjected only to low frequency loads and none of these investigations are taking into account the slamming induced whipping response other researchers investigated the behavior of very large floating structures vlfs in waves for example yoon and lee 2017 and iida and umazume 2020 as previously mentioned this research work aims to analyze the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the slamming induced whipping response hitherto to the authors knowledge there is no software capable of computing the nonlinear whipping response of ships moreover only a minimal number of publications are focused on this aspect derbanne et al 2016 presented a simplified method to investigate the dynamic hull girder response by considering the nonlinear effect of hull girder ultimate strength the numerical model is the well known single degree of freedom vibration model which can take different moment curvature relation curves and different hydrodynamic loading sequences from the hydrodynamic point of view the model deals with realistic loading scenarios including the still water bending moment the wave bending moment and a slamming load derbanne et al 2016 introduced the dynamic ultimate capacity factor as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point divided by the quasi static ultimate capacity it was shown that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is highly dependent on the nonlinear model of the hull girder behavior however it is always greater than unity meaning that the linear dynamic response of the hull girder can exceed the quasi static ultimate capacity without reaching the failure point in conclusion derbanne et al 2016 pointed out the necessity of using real loading sequences and showed that simple loading scenarios as pure slamming impacts on still water will overestimate the dynamic ultimate capacity factor yamada 2019 investigated the possibility of using a commercial 3d fem solver to simulate the dynamic elastic plastic whipping response of the hull girder of a large container ship due to slamming load the full fe model of a container ship has been subjected to a series of time domain simulations where the slamming load is applied to the fore end in addition to the slamming load the still water pressure has been considered but the wave loads are missing besides the model is not considered as a free floating body as in a realistic scenario but it is simply supported on the aft end also the slamming load is balanced either by using the inertia relief method or using an initial rotational velocity these aspects are making the method developed by yamada 2019 as being far from the real physical mechanism of the slamming induced whipping response therefore the proposed methodology will not yield correct information on the dynamic elastic plastic response of ships in light of the above we delve into the nonlinear whipping response using a broad range of ships numerical investigations are carried out using the methodology presented by the authors in the previous paper jagite et al 2020c within this method the nonlinear whipping response is computed by solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem a brief description of the method is presented in section 2 the main particulars of the considered ships are depicted in section 3 in section 4 the nonlinear whipping response i e using a nonlinear structural behavior is compared with the linear whipping response i e using a linear elastic structural model in order to derive the dynamic ultimate capacity factor as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point divided by the quasi static ultimate capacity at last concluding remarks are discussed in section 5 2 fully coupled hydroelastoplastic model the overall procedure for the hydroelastoplastic calculations was presented in jagite et al 2020c and here below we just briefly recall the basic principles it is important to mention that whipping is by nature always nonlinear from the hydrodynamic point of view the distinction between linear and nonlinear in this paper pertains to the structural model 2 1 structural model at first it is essential to mention that in real cases only a very limited extent of the structure collapses as previously shown in matsumoto et al 2016 jagite et al 2019b the collapse area associated with a weak frame in the hull girder can be concentrated at a node of the finite element beam model therefore the ship is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected via a nonlinear hinge as exhibited in fig 1 the total number of elements is n e l e m n 1 n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the number of elements for the first and second beam respectively each node has two degrees of freedom dof s for the vertical displacement w i and rotation θ i the nodes are defined at the neutral axis of the ship since the hull girder stiffness in axial direction is significantly bigger than the bending stiffness the nodal axial displacements are included in the fe model instead a global rigid body dof for the ship s surge motion is defined at the center of gravity of the ship the equation of motion for the structural problem can be written in the compact form as follows 1 m x t n 1 b x t n 1 c x t n 1 f t n 1 where the global matrices for mass m damping b and stiffness c contain the assembled mass damping and stiffness matrices for the first and the second beam respectively besides the coupling terms for the surge pitch motions are included in the global mass matrix m as described in jagite et al 2020c x is the vector of displacements and x x are the velocity and acceleration vectors f is the vector of external nodal forces the nonlinear hinge is modeled as two coincident nodes where the additional rotation due to the collapse is represented as the relative rotation between the two rotational dof s θ l associated to the aft part of the model and θ r associated to the fore part of the model in the numerical model the hinge s behavior is defined using a set of lagrange multipliers this aspect will be discussed later in this paper the nonlinear behavior of this hinge is described by the nonlinear relation between the internal bending moment and the relative rotation angle i e the well known moment curvature curve used to describe the ultimate strength of a ship section the hinge s behavior can be precalculated since the dynamic effects have a minimal influence on the ultimate strength of a ship section as shown in jagite et al 2019b and can be obtained either from i the analytical method known as smith method ii a nonlinear fe analysis nl fea using the 3d fem model of a slice of the hull girder a static arc length analysis procedure is preferred in order to capture the post collapse part of the characteristic when the nonlinear behavior is calculated with one of the above mentioned methods the raw output is always the relationship between the internal bending moment m i n t and the total rotation over a model s length l a typical moment versus total rotation angle is depicted in fig 2 a the total rotation angle θ includes a linear part associated to the extend l of the model and a nonlinear associated with the collapse area which can be considered as independent of l as previously described in jagite et al 2020c therefore in order to avoid the situation where the hull girder s linear elastic behavior is taken twice into account i e once in the adjacent beam elements and once in the hinge itself the linear part must be removed from the precomputed nonlinear behavior as fig 2 b bears out hence the modified nonlinear hinge behavior is represented by the relationship between the internal bending moment m i n t and the plastic rotation relative plastic rotation angle θ p the plastic rotation angle is computed as the difference between the total rotation angle and the linear rotation angle for more details see jagite et al 2020c in fig 2 the ultimate strength is noted as m u and represents the maximum point on the curve aside from that the failure point is noted as θ f the failure point can be defined as the relative plastic rotation angle obtained at the moment when the ultimate strength is reached 2 2 hydrodynamic model the exact coupling between the finite beam element of the structure and the 3d hydrodynamic model is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic boundary value problems bvp s for each shape function of the finite elements hence for each degree of freedom as proposed by 30 aside from that a supplementary bvp is defined for the global rigid body mode defined for the surge motion for an isolated finite element k the shape functions are illustrated in fig 3 the methodology for projecting the shape functions on the hydrodynamic mesh is presented in detail in jagite et al 2020c it is important to mention that the total number of bvp s defined is n m o d s 4 n e l e m 1 this means that in addition to the modes represented by each element s shape functions a global rigid body mode for surge motion is defined the hydrodynamic problem is considered within the usual assumptions of the potential flow and the complex bvp s are solved for a range of frequencies yielding the hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of added mass wave damping and wave excitation within the present research work the frequency domain seakeeping problem is solved by using a 3d bem based on the pulsating green s sources available in the commercial software hydrostar which is developed and maintained by bureau veritas keeping in with the desire of predicting the nonlinear structural response of a ship subjected to slamming loads it is necessary to perform the calculations in the time domain instead of solving directly the time domain hydrodynamic problem which can be extremely expensive one well known solution is the hybrid nonlinear time domain method this basically means that the time dependent diffraction force is calculated using the complex response amplitude operators rao s for the diffraction force calculated in the frequency domain the radiation force is calculated from the memory response functions and the history of velocities in addition the nonlinear loads due to slamming are computed using the modified logvinovich model mlm korobkin 2004 korobkin and malenica 2005 the slamming pressures are determined analytically over several two dimensional 2d sections defined on the fore extremity of the ship these 2d sections are created by cutting the 3d hydrodynamic mesh with several oblique planes the resulting 2d slamming pressures are firstly integrated over the 3d hydrodynamic mesh and later transferred to the nodes of the fe model for more details please refer to jagite 2020 thus the equation of motion in time domain resembles the usual equation with the addition of the convolution integral over the past history for the velocity as presented by 6 2 a m x t n 1 b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 f t n 1 q x x t n 1 where a represents the infinite frequency added mass matrix and k t represents the matrix of impulse response functions on the right hand side the force vector f is composed of the diffraction force f d i the force due to gravity acceleration f g and the force due to still water pressure f s w the vector q x x t n 1 represents the nonlinear slamming force which depends on the relative motion and the velocities of the fore extremity this simply means that the slamming force at instant t n 1 depends on the response at instant t n 1 and vice versa as a consequence the equation of motion presented in eq 2 describes a coupled nonlinear problem as previously mentioned in section 2 1 the nonlinear hinge is modeled as two coincident nodes and its behavior is defined using a set of lagrange multipliers the conditions that are to be imposed using a set of lagrange multipliers are i the linear surge motion in order to handle the horizontal motions of the ship ii the continuity of the vertical displacement field at the nonlinear hinge which can be seen as w l w r 0 iii the nonlinear behavior of the hinge which can be seen as θ l θ r θ d f m i n t and must follow the precomputed behavior the first condition enforces the linear surge motion obtained by performing inverse fourier transform on the linear frequency domain results the second condition specifies that the vertical displacement field along the ship is continuous hence the vertical displacement at the last node of the aft beam and the vertical displacement at the first node of the fore beam must coincide the third condition defines the discontinuity in the rotation field at the nonlinear hinge position to model the collapsing frame in the hull girder under extreme scenarios the discontinuity in the rotation field at time instant t n 1 depends on the internal bending moment at the nonlinear hinge position at the same instant t n 1 and vice versa this nonlinear relationship must follow the precomputed nonlinear hinge behavior defined in fig 2 as a consequence the total number of dof s increases with the number of lagrange multipliers defined the notation tilde has been adopted to differentiate the components whose size was increased furthermore the constraints to be imposed can be written in a matrix form as b l x h thus one could include the boundary condition matrix b l and its transpose in the enhanced stiffness matrix c as follows 3 c c b l t b l 0 x t n 1 x t n 1 λ t n 1 f t n 1 f t n 1 h t n 1 the vectors h and λ can be seen as 4 h t n 1 u x l i n t n 1 0 θ d b m d t n 1 t λ f x t n 1 s f d t n 1 b m d θ d t n 1 t where u x l i n is the linear surge motion obtained by performing inverse fourier transform on the linear frequency domain results f x represents the force necessary to handle the horizontal motions of the ship s f d represents the internal vertical shear force applied from the right node to the left node in order to enforce the continuity of the vertical displacement at the location of the nonlinear hinge b m d θ d t n 1 represents the internal vertical bending moment between the degrees of freedom denoted θ l and θ r and depends on the relative plastic rotation angle θ d b m d t n 1 for all other components where the notation tilde appears the size of those vectors or matrices was increased by adding zeros on the additional lines and or columns finally the nonlinear equation of motion for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem becomes 5 a m x t n 1 b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 f t n 1 q x x t n 1 2 3 numerical time integration within the present research work it was decided to employ the hilber hughes taylor hht scheme hilber et al 1977 for solving the 2nd order ordinary differential equation which describes the equation of motion according to hht scheme the discretized equation of motion presented in eq 5 can be written as 6 a m x t n 1 1 α b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 α b x t n 0 t n k t n τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 α f t n 1 q t n 1 α f t n q t n where α can vary between 1 2 0 the smaller the value of α the more damping is induced in the numerical solution hence a value of α 0 05 is used in order to include a slight amount of numerical damping as recommended for a transient fidelity structural response abaqus 2017 furthermore eq 6 is solved numerically by making use of newmark s equations newmark et al 1959 in order to write the vectors of accelerations and velocities as function of displacements then the displacement at time t n 1 at iteration i can be approximated by a linearized expression of the form x i t n 1 x i 1 t n 1 δ x the nonlinear problem is solved using newton raphson scheme to minimize the vector of residuals thus the equation of motion at iteration i at time t n 1 can be expressed in the following effective form 7 k e i δ x f e i where k e i is the effective stiffness matrix 8 k e i a m 1 β δ t 2 1 α γ β δ t b 1 2 k 0 c c and f e i is the effective force vector 9 f e i 1 α f i t n 1 q i t n 1 α f t n q t n a m

1 t n 1 γ δ x β δ t x i t n 1 x i 1 t n 1 δ x β δ t 2 the logical scheme for solving the coupled hydroelastoplastic problem is depicted in fig 4 at each time step two iterative loops are necessary to handle the nonlinearities on the one hand the inner iterations indicated with blue lines are for computation of the nonlinear loads i e slamming on the other hand the outer iterations indicated with red lines are for the nonlinear structural behavior the nonlinear structural problem is solved in such way that at each event when the internal bending moment exceeds the yield limit the discontinuity angle is gradually increased until the new solution θ d j b m d i s c j follows the precomputed behavior for more details on the nonlinear algorithm please refer to jagite et al 2020c the computation stops when the end time is reached or when the structural failure is reached the failure is reached when the relative plastic rotation angle becomes higher or equal to the failure point θ d θ f 3 ship database the newly developed hydroelastoplastic model is employed in the analysis of the nonlinear whipping response in head waves in the current research work it was decided to use fourteen container ships ranging from 160 m to 350 m the principal characteristics are presented in table 1 where l b p represents the length between perpendiculars b represents the molded breadth of the ship d and t are the construction depth and the draft respectively the cargo carrying capacity expressed in terms of teu twenty foot equivalent unit is denoted as c c the block coefficient of the ship is indicated as c b the wet natural frequencies for the first two vertical vibrational modes are shown on the 1 s t v b and 2 n d v b columns moreover the last two columns are showing the allowable still water bending moment in hogging at midship m s w and the ultimate hogging bending moment m u respectively from the data exhibited in table 1 it can be seen that with the increase in length as well as with the increase in cargo carrying capacity the frequencies of the eigenmodes decreases indicating that bigger ships are more flexible besides we can observe that an important loading component for container ships is represented by the still water bending moment for the hogging condition the still water bending moment is about 30 of the ultimate strength hence it is extremely important to consider realistic loading scenarios when analyzing the nonlinear whipping response 3 1 nonlinear hinge behavior this section presents the calculation of the nonlinear hinge behavior for all fourteen container ships as previously mentioned in section 2 1 two different methods can be used to determine the hinge s behavior 3 1 1 using smith method the ultimate capacity curves in hogging have been firstly computed using the simplified method based on the smith approach available in mars2000 software veritas 2019c the moment versus curvature curves are non dimensionalized in such a way that for each ship the non dimensional curvature χ is equal to one when the linear bending moment versus ultimate strength ratio is equal to unity as fig 5 b bears out on the one hand it is observed that smaller ships under 200 m have a higher failure point χ varying between 2 3 and 3 2 as shown in fig 5 a on the other hand the failure point for typical ulcs ranges between 1 2 and 1 4 with an exception for s 08 where the failure point is equal to two as depicted in fig 5 b as previously discussed the behavior of the nonlinear hinge should include only the plastic part since the linear elastic part of the stiffness is already included in the adjacent timoshenko beam elements jagite et al 2020c thus it is necessary to transform the moment versus curvature curves to moment versus plastic rotation angle at first the total elastic plastic rotation angle is obtained by multiplying the curvature shown in fig 6 a with the model length θ χ l where l is assumed to be equal to the distance between two reinforced frames the linear elastic rotation due to internal moment m i n t on extent l is given by θ l i n e a r m i n t l e i where e i is the bending stiffness therefore the plastic rotation angle can be calculated as the difference between the elastic plastic rotation angle and the linear elastic one shown in fig 6 b therefore the moment versus plastic rotation curves based on the smith approach are obtained as exhibited in fig 6 c 3 1 2 using nl fem method furthermore the nonlinear hinge behavior can be calculated using more advanced tools based on the nl fem in the current context it was decided to create eleven nl fem models each of them being extended over the one frame bay i e the distance between two reinforced frames ten of the models are for ships s01 s02 s05 s06 s07 s09 s10 s12 s13 and s14 having a cargo carrying capacity of 1600 1600 2100 2500 4500 5000 6500 9300 12000 and 14000 teu respectively during the analysis it was observed that bigger ships have a smaller failure point thus it was decided to create an additional model of a ulcs with the length between perpendiculars of around 380 m and with a cargo carrying capacity of 20000 teu this additional ship indicated as s new 1 is used to verify if the relationship between the failure point and the ship s length is the same even for modern ulcs for every ship a relatively fine mesh size is chosen the collapse area is modeled with an average mesh size of 100 mm while for the rest of the ship a mesh size of around 300 mm is adopted the material behavior is defined as bi linear elastic plastic including a strain hardening with a slope of 1 1000 moreover the initial geometric imperfections are generated as per best practice paik 2018 the hull girder ultimate strength analyses are performed under enforced loads bending moments using the arc length procedure this method allows the load to be automatically increased until the ultimate capacity is reached and automatically decreased during the collapse process abaqus 2017 the raw results obtained from the nl fem analyses are in terms of end rotation angles and internal bending moment at first the moment versus relative rotation curves are non dimensionalized and presented in fig 7 the non dimensionalization is done similarly as for the results obtained using the smith approach the non dimensional relative rotation angle θ equals one when the linear bending moment versus ultimate strength ratio is equal to unity it is important to mention that the failure point calculated by nl fem analysis for typical ulcs ranges between 1 1 and 1 25 while the values obtained for the ships under 250 meters varies between 1 5 and 1 8 furthermore the nonlinear behavior can be easily transformed by removing the linear relative rotation angle from the nonlinear one as presented in fig 8 in addition the moment versus plastic rotation angle curve for s12 obtained from nl fem analysis is compared in fig 9 with the one obtained using the simplified smith approach from this figure it can be observed that the failure point obtained using the simplified smith approach is significantly higher than the one obtained using the nl fem analysis to the authors opinion this difference in the failure point is related to the assumption that in the smith approach the nonlinear curvature is associated with the entire length between two reinforced frames while in the nl fem method the plastic strains are even more localized between two web frames as shown in matsumoto et al 2016 and jagite et al 2019b furthermore from figs 5 b and 7 it can be seen that there is a correlation between the failure point and the ship s length this aspect was also pointed out by 8 showing that the location of the failure point decreases with the increase in the ships length therefore the relationship between the plastic rotation angle at the ultimate strength denoted as θ f and the ships length is presented in fig 10 thus it is fair to say that the plastic rotation angle at the ultimate strength decreases when the length of the ship increases besides it is important to point out that for ultra large container ships over 250 meters the plastic rotation angle is relatively small 4 nonlinear whipping calculations the main objective of the present research work is to determine the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the maximum slamming induced whipping response on a broad range of ships subjected to either an equivalent design wave or a design sea state in the current investigation the irregular wave train height is gradually scaled until the nonlinear whipping response becomes equal to the ultimate capacity noted as m u if the wave signal is scaled a little bit more the structure collapses therefore the focus is not on the post collapse behavior but only on the occurrence or not of the collapse it is important to mention that the hull girder s collapse is reached when the relative plastic rotation angle becomes greater than the failure point as shown in fig 4 then for the same scaled irregular wave train the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are also calculated for the sake of comparison with the nonlinear response the nonlinear whipping response is computed using the software dyana2 developed by the authors for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem as presented in section 2 within the calculation of the nonlinear whipping responses the behavior of the nonlinear hinge can be either from the smith method or from the nl fem method therefore for the following numerical results the difference between smith behavior and nl fem behavior pertains to the characteristic behavior of the nonlinear hinge it should be noted that currently there is no data available neither model nor full scale experiments to validate the nonlinear whipping model however the structural part has been validated with analytic computations for the linear response and the nonlinear response has been validated against the commercial nl fem software abaqus besides the hydroelastic model has been validated by comparison with homer2 a hydro structure interaction tool developed and maintained by bureau veritas derbanne et al 2010 for the validations and verifications please refer to jagite 2020 furthermore the linear whipping response is calculated by assuming a linear elastic structural behavior this means that both the vertical displacement and the nodal rotations field are continuous at the nonlinear hinge s location aside from that the quasi static response under still water and wave induced low frequency loads is computed by disregarding the slamming loads as an illustration fig 11 presents the nonlinear whipping response using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach the linear whipping response and the quasi static one obtained for ship s04 considering the same irregular wave train thus the following values are calculated m w h i p n l m u representing the maximum nonlinear whipping response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained using the hydroelastoplastic model when the hull girder is subjected to nonlinear loads m w h i p l i n representing the maximum linear whipping response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained on a linear dynamic structural model when the hull girder is subjected to nonlinear loads m q s representing the maximum quasi static response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained when the hull girder is subjected to the usual quasi static loads still water wave induced low frequency bending moment moreover we define the dynamic ultimate capacity factor γ d u as the ratio between the maximum linear whipping response m w h i p l i n and the maximum nonlinear whipping response m w h i p n l the dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be seen as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point and it is calculated as follows 12 γ d u m w h i p l i n m w h i p n l it is worth mentioning that in the investigation reported by 8 a similar definition of the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is used thus we can directly compare the values of γ d u calculated by two different methods moreover this dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be used in the verification of the hull girder ultimate strength by writing the design equation as follows 13 m w h i p l i n γ d u m u going back to the literature according to 44 the design equation for the verification of the ultimate strength assessment including the effect of whipping can be written as follows 14 m q s γ d u d n v m w h i p l i n m q s m u where γ d u d n v is fixed to 0 9 and represents the factor reducing the effectiveness of whipping during collapse which can be expressed as follows 15 γ d u d n v m w h i p n l m q s m w h i p l i n m q s 4 1 equivalent design wave the nonlinear whipping response is firstly calculated by subjecting the hull girder to an edw of type response conditioned wave rcw veritas 2019a a typical edw of type rcw is defined as an irregular wave train containing several components leading to the mean of all possible responses on a uni directional sea state hence the analysis of the structural response is performed in a simple but realistic loading sequence composed of a constant component given by the still water bending moment a low frequency one given by the wave loading and a high frequency load component given by the response under impulsive loading i e slamming in the iterative algorithm employed for calculating the maximum nonlinear whipping response the wave height is gradually scaled and thus the still water component will remain constant while the dynamic components will increase nonlinearly once the maximum edw height is obtained the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are calculated the corresponding linear and nonlinear responses obtained for ship s12 using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach are exhibited in fig 12 around the instant t 0 the internal bending moment reaches the yield limit and the relative plastic rotation angle increases significantly resulting in permanent plastic deformations it should be noted that for the example shown in fig 12 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor γ d u is equal to 1 0018 the nonlinear structural response reduces the whipping effectiveness and thus the nonlinear whipping response is below the linear one the time variation of the relative plastic rotation angle between the aft and the fore beams is shown in fig 13 a while fig 13 b shows the capability of the presented model to follow the precomputed behavior describing the nonlinear relationship between the internal bending moment and the plastic rotation angle as previously discussed the nonlinear hinge model accounts for the permanent plastic deformation besides the elastic part is considered fully linear and the loading and the unloading path are identical even after the appearance of significant plastic deformations the loading and the unloading of the elastic path are shown in fig 13 b as vertical lines the above mentioned procedure is repeated for all the ships presented in table 1 it is important to mention that the hull girder is modeled with twelve elements for every ship while for the hydrodynamic mesh about 5000 panels are used the structural damping is set to about 2 of the critical damping of the first two eigenmodes the linear and nonlinear whipping responses are calculated for a forward speed of five knots as recommended in veritas 2019b moreover the edw s of type rcw are created to maximize the hogging bending moment at midship using the so called north atlantic scatter diagram the significant wave height h s and the significant wave period t p of the edw for the considered ships are depicted in table 2 the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic calculations are performed using a fixed time step of 0 05 s convergence studies on different modeling parameters have been performed and can be found in jagite 2020 furthermore it should be noted that when subjecting the hull girder to an equivalent design wave the computational time is only three seconds for each second in real time thus the developed methodology for solving the nonlinear hydroelastoplastic problem is efficient and allows for a fast evaluation of the nonlinear whipping response at first the nonlinear hinge behavior calculated using the simplified smith method is used to calculate the nonlinear whipping response then the more realistic nonlinear hinge behavior obtained from the nl fem method is used it should be noted that the nonlinear behavior calculated using the nl fem method is available only for ten out of fourteen considered ships due to the high computational time required the dynamic ultimate capacity factors calculated with eq 12 and the whipping effectiveness coefficient calculated with eq 15 are summarized in table 3 fig 14 and fig 15 from fig 14 a it can be observed that the dynamic ultimate capacity factors obtained using the nonlinear behavior computed using the smith approach are significantly higher than the ones obtained using the nonlinear behavior computed using the more advanced nl fem analyses this is expected since the failure points computed by the nl fem analyses are below the ones obtained by the simplified smith approach as depicted in fig 10 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is highly dependent on the failure point and it decreases with the decrease of the failure point as shown in fig 14 b moreover it can be observed that there is a linear dependency between the dynamic ultimate capacity factor and the failure point this linear dependency can be associated with the ratio between the kinetic energy given by the external forces and the energy dissipated to follow the precomputed behavior through plastic deformations more importantly we can observe that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is always greater than unity this basically means that the nonlinear whipping response calculated using the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic method is always smaller than the linear whipping response for ultra large container ships above 250 m the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is under 1 01 when the nonlinear behavior computed by nl fem approach is used or up to 1 015 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used as fig 14 a bears out however for smaller ships the dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be up to 1 025 when the nonlinear behavior computed by the nl fem method is used or up to 1 07 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used the results obtained on smaller ships are raising some questions regarding the capability of the simplified smith approach for the calculation of the elastoplastic behavior which is used to derive the nonlinear behavior of the hinge furthermore the whipping effectiveness is calculated using eq 15 and exhibited in fig 15 on the one hand it can be observed that for container ships above 250 m the whipping effectiveness is above 0 9 and increases when the ship length is increasing on the other hand for the ships under 250 m there is a significant difference in the results when different methods are used to define the nonlinear behavior curves more importantly it can be seen that the whipping effectiveness value recommended by 44 is not conservative besides the values obtained for all ulcs are above the fixed value of 0 9 it is further important to point out that when calculating the whipping effectiveness its value is highly dependent on the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response if the ratio m q s m u is close to unity then the dynamic components will be very small thus the ratio between the nonlinear whipping contribution to the linear whipping contribution might lead to smaller values of the whipping effectiveness as it can be seen in fig 15 a for ship s05 l b p 185 meters in addition the influence of the high frequency response over the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is investigated this aspect was previously analyzed by 8 showing that when the ratio between the usual quasi static bending moment m q s and the nonlinear whipping response m w h i p n l increases the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases in their paper the sum of still water and wave excitation was varied from 0 8 to 0 98 of the ultimate strength a similar approach is employed in this research work by adjusting the intensity of the slamming load different ratios between the whipping response and the usual quasi static response can be obtained it is worth mentioning that the same equivalent design waves are used for each ship however these waves are to be scaled with different factors until the maximum wave height that can be sustained without collapsing is obtained the numerical results are presented in fig 16 a when the nonlinear behavior computed using the simplified smith method is used and in fig 16 b when the nonlinear behavior calculated by nl fem analysis is used the results presented in figs 16 a and 16 b confirm the dependency between the quasi static ratio and the dynamic ultimate capacity factors moreover it can be seen that when the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response gets closer to unity the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases toward one as previously pointed out it is observed that the whipping effectiveness noted as γ d u d n v may reach some very small values when the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response gets closer to unity therefore the variation of whipping effectiveness calculated for different m q s m u ratios is presented in fig 17 illustrating the above mentioned behavior please note that for ulcs above 250 m when the m q s m u ratio varies from 0 8 to 0 95 the whipping effectiveness varies between 0 96 and 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior computed by nl fem approach is used and between 0 86 and 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior computed by smith approach is used 4 2 design sea state the most realistic loading sequence that one could use when designing of modern ships is a design sea state dss thus instead of using a single equivalent design wave that maximizes the vertical bending moment at midship a longer irregular sea state is considered when the ship encounters a significant wave the relative plastic rotation angle will increase and thus after several significant waves the plastic deformation will accumulate therefore the focus of the current investigation is to see how the memory effect due to the cumulative permanent plastic deformation affects the nonlinear whipping response however since the computational cost increases significantly when a design sea state is used instead of an equivalent design wave only some ships will be considered for computing the nonlinear whipping responses the first ship chosen is ship s12 with a length between perpendiculars of 330 m and cargo carrying capacity of 9300 teu the design sea state is defined using the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height of hs 16 8 meters and a significant wave period of tp 16 2 s it can be seen that three significant waves are encountered at the instant t 750 t 1300 and t 3400 s respectively using the hydroelastoplastic model the amplitude of the design sea state is gradually scaled until the nonlinear whipping response becomes equal to the ultimate strength i e m w h i p n l m u then the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are calculated for the same maximum design sea state the linear and nonlinear whipping responses obtained using the nonlinear behavior calculated with nl fem approach are shown in fig 18 the evolution of the relative plastic rotation angle is shown in fig 19 a it can be observed that at the instant t 750 s when the ship encounters the first significant wave the plastic rotation angle increases then the plastic rotation angle is maintained until t 1400 when a second significant wave is encountered and the relative plastic rotation angle is further increased finally at t 3400 s the plastic rotation angle almost reaches the failure point if the amplitude of the design sea state is increased a little bit more the failure point will be reached and the structure will collapse moreover the hardening behavior and the accumulation of plastic deformations can be seen in fig 19 b using the same design sea state the nonlinear whipping response is computed using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach on the one hand when using the nonlinear behavior computed by the nl fem approach the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is 1 0015 on the other hand when using the nonlinear behavior computed by the simplified smith approach the maximum value obtained is 1 0050 thus the values obtained on a design sea state are smaller than those obtained on an equivalent design wave 1 0018 and 1 0051 respectively this aspect was also pointed out by 8 showing that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases when more realistic loading sequences are used in addition the calculation of the nonlinear whipping response under the design sea state is performed for ships s02 s05 s10 and s13 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor and the whipping effectiveness are summarized in table 4 it can be observed that for all considered ships both the dynamic ultimate capacity factors and the whipping effectiveness obtained on design sea state are smaller than the ones obtained on equivalent design waves 4 3 results discussion the numerical results obtained using the newly developed hydroelastoplastic model are further compared with the ones obtained by 8 it is important to point out that in 8 the investigations of the dynamic ultimate strength are performed only on ulcs ranging from 264 to 378 m for these ships the failure point s location calculated as the non dimensionalized curvature ranges from 1 23 to 1 39 these values are very similar to the ones obtained on the ulcs considered in the present research work as shown in fig 5 b in the study reported by 8 the dynamic ultimate strength is calculated using a single dof system which can be expressed as 16 1 ω 0 2 χ t 2 η ω 0 χ t f χ t f t where f t represents the excitation term χ represents the curvature and f t represents the internal bending moment it should be mentioned that the nonlinear behavior of each ship represented by the relationship between the curvature and the internal bending moment was calculated using the simplified smith approach more importantly by using a single dof system the nonlinear curvature is uniformly distributed along the ship s length this represents a big limitation of the structural model presented in eq 16 since in reality the collapse of the hull girder is very localized using the model presented in eq 16 8 firstly calculated the dynamic ultimate capacity factor for a simple but unrealistic loading sequence composed of pure slamming impact on calm water by using the energy conservation besides the dynamic ultimate capacity factor was calculated for more realistic loading sequences as an equivalent design wave or design sea state the results obtained by 8 for the ships with the lowest and the highest failure point which are also the ones with the lowest and the highest dynamic ultimate capacity factor are summarized in table 5 the dynamic ultimate capacity factors from 8 table 5 and the ones obtained in the present research work see tables 3 and 4 are compared in fig 20 one of the conclusions from 8 was that too simple excitation sequences such as a pure slamming impact on calm water are overestimating the dynamic ultimate capacity factor this aspect is clearly visible in fig 20 moreover it can be observed that when the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a design sea state instead of an equivalent design wave the dynamic ultimate capacity factors are reduced more importantly the numerical results depicted in fig 20 are showing that there is a significant reduction of the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated by two different methods on the one hand in the newly developed hydroelastoplastic method the plastic deformations are very localized along the hull girder i e reduced at a node of the fe model on the other hand in the investigation reported by 8 the plastic deformations are considered uniformly distributed along the hull girder therefore it can be said that it is essential to use a realistic structural model instead of a single degree of freedom model 5 conclusions the paper firstly presents a new approach developed to compute the nonlinear whipping response using a fully coupled hydroelastoplastic model within the proposed method the structure is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected via a nonlinear hinge while the hydrodynamic part is modeled using the 3d boundary element method the exact coupling between the structural model and the hydrodynamic one is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic bvp s for each shape function of the finite elements after solving the complex bvp s for a range of frequencies the hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of added mass wave damping and wave excitation are determined the time domain simulation is then performed by making use of the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the diffracted incident wave loads in addition the radiation force is calculated from the memory response functions and the past history of the velocities the nonlinear pressures resulting from slamming are calculated on multiple 2d sections and later integrated over the 3d hydrodynamic mesh finally the hydroelastoplastic problem is solved in the time domain using numerical integration where different iterations are used to handle the nonlinearities the hydroelastoplastic model allows for a fast computation of the nonlinear whipping response i e considering the nonlinear structural behavior on realistic scenarios such as equivalent design waves or design sea states comparing to a strongly coupled cfd fem approach where both domains should be considered nonlinear the proposed approach s computational time is significantly reduced from days to minutes secondly this paper presents the numerical investigation of the nonlinear whipping response on a database of fourteen container ships ranging from 160 m to 350 m the nonlinear hinge s behavior is described by the nonlinear relationship between the internal bending moment and the relative plastic rotation angle which is derived from the well known moment curvature curve used to describe the ultimate strength of a ship section for the considered ships the nonlinear behavior is calculated using two different methods i the simplified smith approach where the nonlinear curvature is associated with the entire length between two reinforced frames ii the nl fem approach where the plastic area is very localized between two web frames when comparing the output of the two methods it is observed that the failure point defined as the relative plastic rotation angle at the moment when the internal bending moment is equal to the ultimate strength is significantly lower in the results obtained from the more advanced approach based on nl fem this aspect raises some questions regarding the usability of the simplified smith approach in computing the nonlinear behavior curves accurately two coefficients noted γ d u and γ d u d n v are derived in order to account for the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the whipping response the numerical results show that both coefficients are highly dependent on the ratio between the quasi static response to the total nonlinear whipping response and on the failure point the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated on equivalent design waves varies from 1 005 to 1 072 when the nonlinear behavior from the simplified smith approach is used and from 1 001 to 1 023 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used it should be mentioned that for ulcs above 250 m the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated varies from 1 005 to 1 013 when the nonlinear behavior from the simplified smith approach is used and from 1 001 to 1 010 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used the whipping effectiveness calculated on equivalent design waves varies from 0 42 to 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used and from 0 70 to 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used moreover for ulcs the whipping effectiveness varies from 0 89 to 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used and from 0 90 to 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used therefore it seems that the value γ d u d n v 0 9 introduced by 44 is not conservative in addition when the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a design sea state the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases while the whipping effectiveness increases this aspect was also pointed out by 8 thus it can be said that it is of paramount importance to use realistic loading sequences when analyzing the influence of nonlinear structural behavior over the slamming induced whipping response moreover it was shown the importance of using a realistic structural model the dynamic ultimate capacity factors obtained using the single dof structural model proposed by 8 are significantly bigger than the ones obtained from the newly developed method this difference can be explained by the fact that in the single dof model the plasticity is uniformly distributed along the hull girder while in the nonlinear hinge model the plasticity occurs only within one frame finally the above mentioned numerical results are summarized in fig 21 the outcome of this study provides useful information regarding the effects of nonlinear structural behavior on the slamming induced whipping response of ships for ultra large container ships the dynamic ultimate capacity factor defined as the ratio between the linear whipping response and the nonlinear whipping response varies from 1 001 to 1 013 therefore it can be concluded that the nonlinear structural behavior can be neglected in the analysis of the maximum hydroelastic response moreover the effectiveness of whipping varies from 0 89 to 0 99 which firstly shows that the fixed value of 0 9 recommended by 44 is not conservative thus the effectiveness of whipping should no be reduced credit authorship contribution statement george jagite conceptualization methodology software validation investigation formal analysis visualization writing original draft review editing

20268,slamming induced whipping is traditionally computed as the response of a linear elastic structural model however in order to investigate the consequence of whipping on the hull girder s collapse the hydro structure interaction must be performed in a fully coupled approach where the nonlinearities of both domains are considered therefore this paper presents a new approach developed for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem the structural part is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected with a nonlinear hinge described by the nonlinear relation between the internal bending moment and the relative rotation angle the hydrodynamic problem is solved using the 3d boundary element method and the exact coupling between the structural and the 3d hydrodynamic models is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic boundary value problem for each shape function of the finite element beam model the hydroelastoplastic response is calculated using a hybrid nonlinear time domain approach allowing for very fast computation of the nonlinear whipping response finally the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a broad range of ships and it is compared to the linear whipping response in order to derive the whipping effectiveness coefficients it is shown that the nonlinear structural behavior has a very small influence on the whipping response and thus the effectiveness of whipping should not be reduced keywords hydroelastoplasticity nonlinear whipping dynamic collapse ultra large container ships 1 introduction the modern world is driven by the need for safe environmentally friendly and economical ship designs in consequence the prediction of wave induced motions and loads is of paramount importance the classic seakeeping methods used for computing the hydrodynamic responses of a ship are based on the assumption that structural deformations are small and consequently the ship is considered as a rigid body this leads to the so called quasi static approach for evaluating the structural response where the effects of the structural dynamics ship vibrations are neglected this approach works well as far as the response of the structural natural modes is not dynamically amplified which is the case most often in practice but not always for the cases where the dynamic amplification of the structural response is important the full coupling of the hydrodynamic loading and the structural response is required as far as the global structural response is concerned two main physical phenomena are of concern springing and whipping the springing is a resonant phenomenon and represents the entertained hull vibrations induced by the continuous action of the wave loading while the whipping represents the transient hull vibrations induced by the impulsive hydrodynamic loading slamming green water etc due to its resonant character the springing response becomes significant only when the excitation frequencies are close to the frequencies of the structural natural modes contrary to springing the whipping is mainly driven by the nature of the impulsive loading which is usually independent of the structural natural frequencies this means that any floating body can be potentially affected if the ratio of the impulsive loading duration and the structural natural period is critical in the case of ultra large container ships ulcs the natural frequencies are usually low few seconds and at the same time the slamming loads are important large bow flare combined with the relatively high ship speed hence ulcs are prone to both springing and whipping types of hydroelastic responses only the whipping phenomenon is of concern in this paper the preliminary investigations by bishop and price 1979 fostered an understanding of the physical phenomena behind the hydroelasticity of ships since then several more or less sophisticated models were proposed where the hydroelastic problem is solved at different levels of complexity and accuracy one of the well established methods was proposed by tuitman and malenica 2009 and it solves the fully coupled hydroelastic problem by making use of the generalized modes approach the natural modes can be calculated either using a one dimensional 1d beam model or the full three dimensional 3d finite element method fem model of the ship structure after solving the general seakeeping problem in the frequency domain using a 3d boundary element method bem based on green s sources the time domain simulation is performed following the approach proposed by cummins 1962 aside from that several nonlinear effects are added such as the froude krylov correction and the slamming loads which are calculated using the generalized wagner model gwm wagner 1932 de lauzon et al 2015 the method allows for the computation of springing and whipping responses and was validated with both experimental and full scale results derbanne et al 2010 more recently kim et al 2013 developed a similar fully coupled hydroelastic method in their method the hydrodynamic problem is solved using a b spline 3d rankine panel method while the structural model can also be either a 1d or a 3d fem model the slamming loads are also determined using the gwm the coupling between the structural and the hydrodynamic model is made directly which allows direct access to the structural responses at any required position the method showed good results when compared with the model tests kim et al 2014 nevertheless the computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques have evolved significantly in the past decade seng 2012 developed a numerical method for computing the springing and slamming induced whipping responses of a ship using openfoam an open source cfd package weller et al 1998 the structural part was modeled as a classical non uniform timoshenko beam model and the transfer of the displacement and fluid forces was performed using the modal spaces the procedure developed by seng 2012 agreed satisfactorily with model tests and showed the potential to accurately predict the global hydroelastic responses using the so called field methods seng et al 2014 the prediction of extreme loads including wave induced vibrations using numerical solutions of the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations has also been reported by oberhagemann et al 2015 more recently several researchers investigated the hydroelastic response using fully coupled cfd fea finite element analysis for example lakshmynarayanana and temarel 2018 and seng et al 2018 takami and iijima 2019 investigated the combined global and local hydroelastic response in a large container ship based on two way coupled cfd and fea for the hydrodynamic part they adopted a commercial solver named star ccm while the structural part is modeled as a 3d finite element fe model and the fea solver of choice was the dynamic explicit solver implemented in ls dyna the two way coupling is performed in a staggered manner and shows a reasonable agreement with the experimental data however the cost of running a two way strongly coupled simulation is very high 30 h per physical 10 s in full scale on a modern workstation in the aforementioned methods and investigations as well as in the works reported in the extensive literature reviews by chen et al 2006 hirdaris and temarel 2009 and temarel et al 2016 ergin et al 2018 the structural behavior is always treated as linear and elastic however the real structural behavior is nonlinear elastic plastic this means that when a ship is subjected to an extreme loading scenario the hull girder might suffer from local buckling or plastic deformations comporting different than the linear elastic assumption moreover it should be mentioned that after the two accidents msc napoli and mol comfort branch 2008 classnk 2014 the importance of whipping on the extreme hull girder loads has received much attention but its consequences on the hull girder s collapse are still unclear the most common practice to evaluate the ultimate strength of a relatively flexible floating structure is to compare the maximum dynamic vertical bending moment vbm after a slamming event which is derived from hydroelastic calculations with the quasi static hull girder capacity where the quasi static hull girder ultimate strength is determined either by simplified methods such as the smith method or by some more advanced methods such as idealized structural unit method or nonlinear finite element method smith 1977 ueda and rashed 1984 paik et al 2008 some aspects regarding the current procedure remain unclear for example the influence of the dynamic effects associated with the whipping induced stresses or the capability of the current hydroelastic methods to accurately predict the extreme dynamic response on the basis of a linear elastic structural model the first aspect was previously investigated by the authors and it was found that the dynamic factors are having a minimal effect over the structural capacity the comprehensive analyses of the dynamic ultimate strength for stiffened panels can be found in jagite et al 2019a and jagite et al 2020b while the analyses of the dynamic hull girder ultimate strength are presented in jagite et al 2019b and jagite et al 2020a the second aspect represents the starting point of the research work presented in this paper aiming at analyzing the influence of the nonlinearities existing in the structural model over the slamming induced whipping response thus the hydroelastic problem transforms into a hydroelastoplastic problem in the hydroelastoplasticity of ships the structural behavior is nonlinear including material and geometric nonlinearities a preliminary investigation on the hydroelastoplastic response of a ship subjected to slamming induced whipping was reported by dow 1981 they developed a numerical model that considers the ship as 21 lumped masses connected by beam elements the lumped masses included the hydrodynamic added mass of the first elastic mode for the structural part only four of the total beam elements were enforced with a precomputed moment curvature behavior others kept a purely elastic behavior dow 1981 applied a short impulse load 0 05 s near the fore end of the ship which was supposed to represent the bottom impact slamming their preliminary results showed that the hull girder capacity was increased by about 70 95 when short impulsive loads were applied however dow 1981 acknowledged that the loading scenarios considered were not representing the reality and more realistic scenarios should be considered where the high frequency loads whipping are combined with the low frequency loads wave loads and with the still water component about 30 years later iijima et al 2011 investigated the dynamic collapse of a ship s hull girder in waves having a focus on the post ultimate strength behavior in their model the hydrodynamic problem was solved by making use of the nonlinear strip theory while the structural part was considered as two rigid bodies connected to each other by a nonlinear rotational spring the numerical model was validated against several experimental investigations that considered both structural and hydrodynamic similarities the model developed by iijima et al 2011 shows the capability of following a precomputed moment curvature behavior and computes the severity of the collapse under large single wave loads several similar investigations on the post collapse behavior of the ship s hull girder have been reported by xu et al 2011 iijima and fujikubo 2012 2015 and iijima and fujikubo 2018 it is worth mentioning that the recent studies considered the hull girder as two elastic beams connected by a nonlinear rotational spring and the hydrodynamic problem being solved by making use of the boundary element method however the structure is subjected only to low frequency loads and none of these investigations are taking into account the slamming induced whipping response other researchers investigated the behavior of very large floating structures vlfs in waves for example yoon and lee 2017 and iida and umazume 2020 as previously mentioned this research work aims to analyze the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the slamming induced whipping response hitherto to the authors knowledge there is no software capable of computing the nonlinear whipping response of ships moreover only a minimal number of publications are focused on this aspect derbanne et al 2016 presented a simplified method to investigate the dynamic hull girder response by considering the nonlinear effect of hull girder ultimate strength the numerical model is the well known single degree of freedom vibration model which can take different moment curvature relation curves and different hydrodynamic loading sequences from the hydrodynamic point of view the model deals with realistic loading scenarios including the still water bending moment the wave bending moment and a slamming load derbanne et al 2016 introduced the dynamic ultimate capacity factor as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point divided by the quasi static ultimate capacity it was shown that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is highly dependent on the nonlinear model of the hull girder behavior however it is always greater than unity meaning that the linear dynamic response of the hull girder can exceed the quasi static ultimate capacity without reaching the failure point in conclusion derbanne et al 2016 pointed out the necessity of using real loading sequences and showed that simple loading scenarios as pure slamming impacts on still water will overestimate the dynamic ultimate capacity factor yamada 2019 investigated the possibility of using a commercial 3d fem solver to simulate the dynamic elastic plastic whipping response of the hull girder of a large container ship due to slamming load the full fe model of a container ship has been subjected to a series of time domain simulations where the slamming load is applied to the fore end in addition to the slamming load the still water pressure has been considered but the wave loads are missing besides the model is not considered as a free floating body as in a realistic scenario but it is simply supported on the aft end also the slamming load is balanced either by using the inertia relief method or using an initial rotational velocity these aspects are making the method developed by yamada 2019 as being far from the real physical mechanism of the slamming induced whipping response therefore the proposed methodology will not yield correct information on the dynamic elastic plastic response of ships in light of the above we delve into the nonlinear whipping response using a broad range of ships numerical investigations are carried out using the methodology presented by the authors in the previous paper jagite et al 2020c within this method the nonlinear whipping response is computed by solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem a brief description of the method is presented in section 2 the main particulars of the considered ships are depicted in section 3 in section 4 the nonlinear whipping response i e using a nonlinear structural behavior is compared with the linear whipping response i e using a linear elastic structural model in order to derive the dynamic ultimate capacity factor as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point divided by the quasi static ultimate capacity at last concluding remarks are discussed in section 5 2 fully coupled hydroelastoplastic model the overall procedure for the hydroelastoplastic calculations was presented in jagite et al 2020c and here below we just briefly recall the basic principles it is important to mention that whipping is by nature always nonlinear from the hydrodynamic point of view the distinction between linear and nonlinear in this paper pertains to the structural model 2 1 structural model at first it is essential to mention that in real cases only a very limited extent of the structure collapses as previously shown in matsumoto et al 2016 jagite et al 2019b the collapse area associated with a weak frame in the hull girder can be concentrated at a node of the finite element beam model therefore the ship is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected via a nonlinear hinge as exhibited in fig 1 the total number of elements is n e l e m n 1 n 2 where n 1 and n 2 are the number of elements for the first and second beam respectively each node has two degrees of freedom dof s for the vertical displacement w i and rotation θ i the nodes are defined at the neutral axis of the ship since the hull girder stiffness in axial direction is significantly bigger than the bending stiffness the nodal axial displacements are included in the fe model instead a global rigid body dof for the ship s surge motion is defined at the center of gravity of the ship the equation of motion for the structural problem can be written in the compact form as follows 1 m x t n 1 b x t n 1 c x t n 1 f t n 1 where the global matrices for mass m damping b and stiffness c contain the assembled mass damping and stiffness matrices for the first and the second beam respectively besides the coupling terms for the surge pitch motions are included in the global mass matrix m as described in jagite et al 2020c x is the vector of displacements and x x are the velocity and acceleration vectors f is the vector of external nodal forces the nonlinear hinge is modeled as two coincident nodes where the additional rotation due to the collapse is represented as the relative rotation between the two rotational dof s θ l associated to the aft part of the model and θ r associated to the fore part of the model in the numerical model the hinge s behavior is defined using a set of lagrange multipliers this aspect will be discussed later in this paper the nonlinear behavior of this hinge is described by the nonlinear relation between the internal bending moment and the relative rotation angle i e the well known moment curvature curve used to describe the ultimate strength of a ship section the hinge s behavior can be precalculated since the dynamic effects have a minimal influence on the ultimate strength of a ship section as shown in jagite et al 2019b and can be obtained either from i the analytical method known as smith method ii a nonlinear fe analysis nl fea using the 3d fem model of a slice of the hull girder a static arc length analysis procedure is preferred in order to capture the post collapse part of the characteristic when the nonlinear behavior is calculated with one of the above mentioned methods the raw output is always the relationship between the internal bending moment m i n t and the total rotation over a model s length l a typical moment versus total rotation angle is depicted in fig 2 a the total rotation angle θ includes a linear part associated to the extend l of the model and a nonlinear associated with the collapse area which can be considered as independent of l as previously described in jagite et al 2020c therefore in order to avoid the situation where the hull girder s linear elastic behavior is taken twice into account i e once in the adjacent beam elements and once in the hinge itself the linear part must be removed from the precomputed nonlinear behavior as fig 2 b bears out hence the modified nonlinear hinge behavior is represented by the relationship between the internal bending moment m i n t and the plastic rotation relative plastic rotation angle θ p the plastic rotation angle is computed as the difference between the total rotation angle and the linear rotation angle for more details see jagite et al 2020c in fig 2 the ultimate strength is noted as m u and represents the maximum point on the curve aside from that the failure point is noted as θ f the failure point can be defined as the relative plastic rotation angle obtained at the moment when the ultimate strength is reached 2 2 hydrodynamic model the exact coupling between the finite beam element of the structure and the 3d hydrodynamic model is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic boundary value problems bvp s for each shape function of the finite elements hence for each degree of freedom as proposed by 30 aside from that a supplementary bvp is defined for the global rigid body mode defined for the surge motion for an isolated finite element k the shape functions are illustrated in fig 3 the methodology for projecting the shape functions on the hydrodynamic mesh is presented in detail in jagite et al 2020c it is important to mention that the total number of bvp s defined is n m o d s 4 n e l e m 1 this means that in addition to the modes represented by each element s shape functions a global rigid body mode for surge motion is defined the hydrodynamic problem is considered within the usual assumptions of the potential flow and the complex bvp s are solved for a range of frequencies yielding the hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of added mass wave damping and wave excitation within the present research work the frequency domain seakeeping problem is solved by using a 3d bem based on the pulsating green s sources available in the commercial software hydrostar which is developed and maintained by bureau veritas keeping in with the desire of predicting the nonlinear structural response of a ship subjected to slamming loads it is necessary to perform the calculations in the time domain instead of solving directly the time domain hydrodynamic problem which can be extremely expensive one well known solution is the hybrid nonlinear time domain method this basically means that the time dependent diffraction force is calculated using the complex response amplitude operators rao s for the diffraction force calculated in the frequency domain the radiation force is calculated from the memory response functions and the history of velocities in addition the nonlinear loads due to slamming are computed using the modified logvinovich model mlm korobkin 2004 korobkin and malenica 2005 the slamming pressures are determined analytically over several two dimensional 2d sections defined on the fore extremity of the ship these 2d sections are created by cutting the 3d hydrodynamic mesh with several oblique planes the resulting 2d slamming pressures are firstly integrated over the 3d hydrodynamic mesh and later transferred to the nodes of the fe model for more details please refer to jagite 2020 thus the equation of motion in time domain resembles the usual equation with the addition of the convolution integral over the past history for the velocity as presented by 6 2 a m x t n 1 b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 f t n 1 q x x t n 1 where a represents the infinite frequency added mass matrix and k t represents the matrix of impulse response functions on the right hand side the force vector f is composed of the diffraction force f d i the force due to gravity acceleration f g and the force due to still water pressure f s w the vector q x x t n 1 represents the nonlinear slamming force which depends on the relative motion and the velocities of the fore extremity this simply means that the slamming force at instant t n 1 depends on the response at instant t n 1 and vice versa as a consequence the equation of motion presented in eq 2 describes a coupled nonlinear problem as previously mentioned in section 2 1 the nonlinear hinge is modeled as two coincident nodes and its behavior is defined using a set of lagrange multipliers the conditions that are to be imposed using a set of lagrange multipliers are i the linear surge motion in order to handle the horizontal motions of the ship ii the continuity of the vertical displacement field at the nonlinear hinge which can be seen as w l w r 0 iii the nonlinear behavior of the hinge which can be seen as θ l θ r θ d f m i n t and must follow the precomputed behavior the first condition enforces the linear surge motion obtained by performing inverse fourier transform on the linear frequency domain results the second condition specifies that the vertical displacement field along the ship is continuous hence the vertical displacement at the last node of the aft beam and the vertical displacement at the first node of the fore beam must coincide the third condition defines the discontinuity in the rotation field at the nonlinear hinge position to model the collapsing frame in the hull girder under extreme scenarios the discontinuity in the rotation field at time instant t n 1 depends on the internal bending moment at the nonlinear hinge position at the same instant t n 1 and vice versa this nonlinear relationship must follow the precomputed nonlinear hinge behavior defined in fig 2 as a consequence the total number of dof s increases with the number of lagrange multipliers defined the notation tilde has been adopted to differentiate the components whose size was increased furthermore the constraints to be imposed can be written in a matrix form as b l x h thus one could include the boundary condition matrix b l and its transpose in the enhanced stiffness matrix c as follows 3 c c b l t b l 0 x t n 1 x t n 1 λ t n 1 f t n 1 f t n 1 h t n 1 the vectors h and λ can be seen as 4 h t n 1 u x l i n t n 1 0 θ d b m d t n 1 t λ f x t n 1 s f d t n 1 b m d θ d t n 1 t where u x l i n is the linear surge motion obtained by performing inverse fourier transform on the linear frequency domain results f x represents the force necessary to handle the horizontal motions of the ship s f d represents the internal vertical shear force applied from the right node to the left node in order to enforce the continuity of the vertical displacement at the location of the nonlinear hinge b m d θ d t n 1 represents the internal vertical bending moment between the degrees of freedom denoted θ l and θ r and depends on the relative plastic rotation angle θ d b m d t n 1 for all other components where the notation tilde appears the size of those vectors or matrices was increased by adding zeros on the additional lines and or columns finally the nonlinear equation of motion for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem becomes 5 a m x t n 1 b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 f t n 1 q x x t n 1 2 3 numerical time integration within the present research work it was decided to employ the hilber hughes taylor hht scheme hilber et al 1977 for solving the 2nd order ordinary differential equation which describes the equation of motion according to hht scheme the discretized equation of motion presented in eq 5 can be written as 6 a m x t n 1 1 α b x t n 1 0 t n 1 k t n 1 τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 α b x t n 0 t n k t n τ x τ d τ c c x t n 1 α f t n 1 q t n 1 α f t n q t n where α can vary between 1 2 0 the smaller the value of α the more damping is induced in the numerical solution hence a value of α 0 05 is used in order to include a slight amount of numerical damping as recommended for a transient fidelity structural response abaqus 2017 furthermore eq 6 is solved numerically by making use of newmark s equations newmark et al 1959 in order to write the vectors of accelerations and velocities as function of displacements then the displacement at time t n 1 at iteration i can be approximated by a linearized expression of the form x i t n 1 x i 1 t n 1 δ x the nonlinear problem is solved using newton raphson scheme to minimize the vector of residuals thus the equation of motion at iteration i at time t n 1 can be expressed in the following effective form 7

handle the nonlinearities on the one hand the inner iterations indicated with blue lines are for computation of the nonlinear loads i e slamming on the other hand the outer iterations indicated with red lines are for the nonlinear structural behavior the nonlinear structural problem is solved in such way that at each event when the internal bending moment exceeds the yield limit the discontinuity angle is gradually increased until the new solution θ d j b m d i s c j follows the precomputed behavior for more details on the nonlinear algorithm please refer to jagite et al 2020c the computation stops when the end time is reached or when the structural failure is reached the failure is reached when the relative plastic rotation angle becomes higher or equal to the failure point θ d θ f 3 ship database the newly developed hydroelastoplastic model is employed in the analysis of the nonlinear whipping response in head waves in the current research work it was decided to use fourteen container ships ranging from 160 m to 350 m the principal characteristics are presented in table 1 where l b p represents the length between perpendiculars b represents the molded breadth of the ship d and t are the construction depth and the draft respectively the cargo carrying capacity expressed in terms of teu twenty foot equivalent unit is denoted as c c the block coefficient of the ship is indicated as c b the wet natural frequencies for the first two vertical vibrational modes are shown on the 1 s t v b and 2 n d v b columns moreover the last two columns are showing the allowable still water bending moment in hogging at midship m s w and the ultimate hogging bending moment m u respectively from the data exhibited in table 1 it can be seen that with the increase in length as well as with the increase in cargo carrying capacity the frequencies of the eigenmodes decreases indicating that bigger ships are more flexible besides we can observe that an important loading component for container ships is represented by the still water bending moment for the hogging condition the still water bending moment is about 30 of the ultimate strength hence it is extremely important to consider realistic loading scenarios when analyzing the nonlinear whipping response 3 1 nonlinear hinge behavior this section presents the calculation of the nonlinear hinge behavior for all fourteen container ships as previously mentioned in section 2 1 two different methods can be used to determine the hinge s behavior 3 1 1 using smith method the ultimate capacity curves in hogging have been firstly computed using the simplified method based on the smith approach available in mars2000 software veritas 2019c the moment versus curvature curves are non dimensionalized in such a way that for each ship the non dimensional curvature χ is equal to one when the linear bending moment versus ultimate strength ratio is equal to unity as fig 5 b bears out on the one hand it is observed that smaller ships under 200 m have a higher failure point χ varying between 2 3 and 3 2 as shown in fig 5 a on the other hand the failure point for typical ulcs ranges between 1 2 and 1 4 with an exception for s 08 where the failure point is equal to two as depicted in fig 5 b as previously discussed the behavior of the nonlinear hinge should include only the plastic part since the linear elastic part of the stiffness is already included in the adjacent timoshenko beam elements jagite et al 2020c thus it is necessary to transform the moment versus curvature curves to moment versus plastic rotation angle at first the total elastic plastic rotation angle is obtained by multiplying the curvature shown in fig 6 a with the model length θ χ l where l is assumed to be equal to the distance between two reinforced frames the linear elastic rotation due to internal moment m i n t on extent l is given by θ l i n e a r m i n t l e i where e i is the bending stiffness therefore the plastic rotation angle can be calculated as the difference between the elastic plastic rotation angle and the linear elastic one shown in fig 6 b therefore the moment versus plastic rotation curves based on the smith approach are obtained as exhibited in fig 6 c 3 1 2 using nl fem method furthermore the nonlinear hinge behavior can be calculated using more advanced tools based on the nl fem in the current context it was decided to create eleven nl fem models each of them being extended over the one frame bay i e the distance between two reinforced frames ten of the models are for ships s01 s02 s05 s06 s07 s09 s10 s12 s13 and s14 having a cargo carrying capacity of 1600 1600 2100 2500 4500 5000 6500 9300 12000 and 14000 teu respectively during the analysis it was observed that bigger ships have a smaller failure point thus it was decided to create an additional model of a ulcs with the length between perpendiculars of around 380 m and with a cargo carrying capacity of 20000 teu this additional ship indicated as s new 1 is used to verify if the relationship between the failure point and the ship s length is the same even for modern ulcs for every ship a relatively fine mesh size is chosen the collapse area is modeled with an average mesh size of 100 mm while for the rest of the ship a mesh size of around 300 mm is adopted the material behavior is defined as bi linear elastic plastic including a strain hardening with a slope of 1 1000 moreover the initial geometric imperfections are generated as per best practice paik 2018 the hull girder ultimate strength analyses are performed under enforced loads bending moments using the arc length procedure this method allows the load to be automatically increased until the ultimate capacity is reached and automatically decreased during the collapse process abaqus 2017 the raw results obtained from the nl fem analyses are in terms of end rotation angles and internal bending moment at first the moment versus relative rotation curves are non dimensionalized and presented in fig 7 the non dimensionalization is done similarly as for the results obtained using the smith approach the non dimensional relative rotation angle θ equals one when the linear bending moment versus ultimate strength ratio is equal to unity it is important to mention that the failure point calculated by nl fem analysis for typical ulcs ranges between 1 1 and 1 25 while the values obtained for the ships under 250 meters varies between 1 5 and 1 8 furthermore the nonlinear behavior can be easily transformed by removing the linear relative rotation angle from the nonlinear one as presented in fig 8 in addition the moment versus plastic rotation angle curve for s12 obtained from nl fem analysis is compared in fig 9 with the one obtained using the simplified smith approach from this figure it can be observed that the failure point obtained using the simplified smith approach is significantly higher than the one obtained using the nl fem analysis to the authors opinion this difference in the failure point is related to the assumption that in the smith approach the nonlinear curvature is associated with the entire length between two reinforced frames while in the nl fem method the plastic strains are even more localized between two web frames as shown in matsumoto et al 2016 and jagite et al 2019b furthermore from figs 5 b and 7 it can be seen that there is a correlation between the failure point and the ship s length this aspect was also pointed out by 8 showing that the location of the failure point decreases with the increase in the ships length therefore the relationship between the plastic rotation angle at the ultimate strength denoted as θ f and the ships length is presented in fig 10 thus it is fair to say that the plastic rotation angle at the ultimate strength decreases when the length of the ship increases besides it is important to point out that for ultra large container ships over 250 meters the plastic rotation angle is relatively small 4 nonlinear whipping calculations the main objective of the present research work is to determine the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the maximum slamming induced whipping response on a broad range of ships subjected to either an equivalent design wave or a design sea state in the current investigation the irregular wave train height is gradually scaled until the nonlinear whipping response becomes equal to the ultimate capacity noted as m u if the wave signal is scaled a little bit more the structure collapses therefore the focus is not on the post collapse behavior but only on the occurrence or not of the collapse it is important to mention that the hull girder s collapse is reached when the relative plastic rotation angle becomes greater than the failure point as shown in fig 4 then for the same scaled irregular wave train the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are also calculated for the sake of comparison with the nonlinear response the nonlinear whipping response is computed using the software dyana2 developed by the authors for solving the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic problem as presented in section 2 within the calculation of the nonlinear whipping responses the behavior of the nonlinear hinge can be either from the smith method or from the nl fem method therefore for the following numerical results the difference between smith behavior and nl fem behavior pertains to the characteristic behavior of the nonlinear hinge it should be noted that currently there is no data available neither model nor full scale experiments to validate the nonlinear whipping model however the structural part has been validated with analytic computations for the linear response and the nonlinear response has been validated against the commercial nl fem software abaqus besides the hydroelastic model has been validated by comparison with homer2 a hydro structure interaction tool developed and maintained by bureau veritas derbanne et al 2010 for the validations and verifications please refer to jagite 2020 furthermore the linear whipping response is calculated by assuming a linear elastic structural behavior this means that both the vertical displacement and the nodal rotations field are continuous at the nonlinear hinge s location aside from that the quasi static response under still water and wave induced low frequency loads is computed by disregarding the slamming loads as an illustration fig 11 presents the nonlinear whipping response using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach the linear whipping response and the quasi static one obtained for ship s04 considering the same irregular wave train thus the following values are calculated m w h i p n l m u representing the maximum nonlinear whipping response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained using the hydroelastoplastic model when the hull girder is subjected to nonlinear loads m w h i p l i n representing the maximum linear whipping response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained on a linear dynamic structural model when the hull girder is subjected to nonlinear loads m q s representing the maximum quasi static response calculated as the internal bending moment obtained when the hull girder is subjected to the usual quasi static loads still water wave induced low frequency bending moment moreover we define the dynamic ultimate capacity factor γ d u as the ratio between the maximum linear whipping response m w h i p l i n and the maximum nonlinear whipping response m w h i p n l the dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be seen as the maximum allowable linear whipping response on a scenario where the nonlinear whipping response reaches the failure point and it is calculated as follows 12 γ d u m w h i p l i n m w h i p n l it is worth mentioning that in the investigation reported by 8 a similar definition of the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is used thus we can directly compare the values of γ d u calculated by two different methods moreover this dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be used in the verification of the hull girder ultimate strength by writing the design equation as follows 13 m w h i p l i n γ d u m u going back to the literature according to 44 the design equation for the verification of the ultimate strength assessment including the effect of whipping can be written as follows 14 m q s γ d u d n v m w h i p l i n m q s m u where γ d u d n v is fixed to 0 9 and represents the factor reducing the effectiveness of whipping during collapse which can be expressed as follows 15 γ d u d n v m w h i p n l m q s m w h i p l i n m q s 4 1 equivalent design wave the nonlinear whipping response is firstly calculated by subjecting the hull girder to an edw of type response conditioned wave rcw veritas 2019a a typical edw of type rcw is defined as an irregular wave train containing several components leading to the mean of all possible responses on a uni directional sea state hence the analysis of the structural response is performed in a simple but realistic loading sequence composed of a constant component given by the still water bending moment a low frequency one given by the wave loading and a high frequency load component given by the response under impulsive loading i e slamming in the iterative algorithm employed for calculating the maximum nonlinear whipping response the wave height is gradually scaled and thus the still water component will remain constant while the dynamic components will increase nonlinearly once the maximum edw height is obtained the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are calculated the corresponding linear and nonlinear responses obtained for ship s12 using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach are exhibited in fig 12 around the instant t 0 the internal bending moment reaches the yield limit and the relative plastic rotation angle increases significantly resulting in permanent plastic deformations it should be noted that for the example shown in fig 12 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor γ d u is equal to 1 0018 the nonlinear structural response reduces the whipping effectiveness and thus the nonlinear whipping response is below the linear one the time variation of the relative plastic rotation angle between the aft and the fore beams is shown in fig 13 a while fig 13 b shows the capability of the presented model to follow the precomputed behavior describing the nonlinear relationship between the internal bending moment and the plastic rotation angle as previously discussed the nonlinear hinge model accounts for the permanent plastic deformation besides the elastic part is considered fully linear and the loading and the unloading path are identical even after the appearance of significant plastic deformations the loading and the unloading of the elastic path are shown in fig 13 b as vertical lines the above mentioned procedure is repeated for all the ships presented in table 1 it is important to mention that the hull girder is modeled with twelve elements for every ship while for the hydrodynamic mesh about 5000 panels are used the structural damping is set to about 2 of the critical damping of the first two eigenmodes the linear and nonlinear whipping responses are calculated for a forward speed of five knots as recommended in veritas 2019b moreover the edw s of type rcw are created to maximize the hogging bending moment at midship using the so called north atlantic scatter diagram the significant wave height h s and the significant wave period t p of the edw for the considered ships are depicted in table 2 the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic calculations are performed using a fixed time step of 0 05 s convergence studies on different modeling parameters have been performed and can be found in jagite 2020 furthermore it should be noted that when subjecting the hull girder to an equivalent design wave the computational time is only three seconds for each second in real time thus the developed methodology for solving the nonlinear hydroelastoplastic problem is efficient and allows for a fast evaluation of the nonlinear whipping response at first the nonlinear hinge behavior calculated using the simplified smith method is used to calculate the nonlinear whipping response then the more realistic nonlinear hinge behavior obtained from the nl fem method is used it should be noted that the nonlinear behavior calculated using the nl fem method is available only for ten out of fourteen considered ships due to the high computational time required the dynamic ultimate capacity factors calculated with eq 12 and the whipping effectiveness coefficient calculated with eq 15 are summarized in table 3 fig 14 and fig 15 from fig 14 a it can be observed that the dynamic ultimate capacity factors obtained using the nonlinear behavior computed using the smith approach are significantly higher than the ones obtained using the nonlinear behavior computed using the more advanced nl fem analyses this is expected since the failure points computed by the nl fem analyses are below the ones obtained by the simplified smith approach as depicted in fig 10 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is highly dependent on the failure point and it decreases with the decrease of the failure point as shown in fig 14 b moreover it can be observed that there is a linear dependency between the dynamic ultimate capacity factor and the failure point this linear dependency can be associated with the ratio between the kinetic energy given by the external forces and the energy dissipated to follow the precomputed behavior through plastic deformations more importantly we can observe that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is always greater than unity this basically means that the nonlinear whipping response calculated using the fully coupled hydroelastoplastic method is always smaller than the linear whipping response for ultra large container ships above 250 m the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is under 1 01 when the nonlinear behavior computed by nl fem approach is used or up to 1 015 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used as fig 14 a bears out however for smaller ships the dynamic ultimate capacity factor can be up to 1 025 when the nonlinear behavior computed by the nl fem method is used or up to 1 07 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used the results obtained on smaller ships are raising some questions regarding the capability of the simplified smith approach for the calculation of the elastoplastic behavior which is used to derive the nonlinear behavior of the hinge furthermore the whipping effectiveness is calculated using eq 15 and exhibited in fig 15 on the one hand it can be observed that for container ships above 250 m the whipping effectiveness is above 0 9 and increases when the ship length is increasing on the other hand for the ships under 250 m there is a significant difference in the results when different methods are used to define the nonlinear behavior curves more importantly it can be seen that the whipping effectiveness value recommended by 44 is not conservative besides the values obtained for all ulcs are above the fixed value of 0 9 it is further important to point out that when calculating the whipping effectiveness its value is highly dependent on the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response if the ratio m q s m u is close to unity then the dynamic components will be very small thus the ratio between the nonlinear whipping contribution to the linear whipping contribution might lead to smaller values of the whipping effectiveness as it can be seen in fig 15 a for ship s05 l b p 185 meters in addition the influence of the high frequency response over the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is investigated this aspect was previously analyzed by 8 showing that when the ratio between the usual quasi static bending moment m q s and the nonlinear whipping response m w h i p n l increases the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases in their paper the sum of still water and wave excitation was varied from 0 8 to 0 98 of the ultimate strength a similar approach is employed in this research work by adjusting the intensity of the slamming load different ratios between the whipping response and the usual quasi static response can be obtained it is worth mentioning that the same equivalent design waves are used for each ship however these waves are to be scaled with different factors until the maximum wave height that can be sustained without collapsing is obtained the numerical results are presented in fig 16 a when the nonlinear behavior computed using the simplified smith method is used and in fig 16 b when the nonlinear behavior calculated by nl fem analysis is used the results presented in figs 16 a and 16 b confirm the dependency between the quasi static ratio and the dynamic ultimate capacity factors moreover it can be seen that when the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response gets closer to unity the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases toward one as previously pointed out it is observed that the whipping effectiveness noted as γ d u d n v may reach some very small values when the ratio between the quasi static response and the nonlinear whipping response gets closer to unity therefore the variation of whipping effectiveness calculated for different m q s m u ratios is presented in fig 17 illustrating the above mentioned behavior please note that for ulcs above 250 m when the m q s m u ratio varies from 0 8 to 0 95 the whipping effectiveness varies between 0 96 and 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior computed by nl fem approach is used and between 0 86 and 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior computed by smith approach is used 4 2 design sea state the most realistic loading sequence that one could use when designing of modern ships is a design sea state dss thus instead of using a single equivalent design wave that maximizes the vertical bending moment at midship a longer irregular sea state is considered when the ship encounters a significant wave the relative plastic rotation angle will increase and thus after several significant waves the plastic deformation will accumulate therefore the focus of the current investigation is to see how the memory effect due to the cumulative permanent plastic deformation affects the nonlinear whipping response however since the computational cost increases significantly when a design sea state is used instead of an equivalent design wave only some ships will be considered for computing the nonlinear whipping responses the first ship chosen is ship s12 with a length between perpendiculars of 330 m and cargo carrying capacity of 9300 teu the design sea state is defined using the jonswap spectrum with a significant wave height of hs 16 8 meters and a significant wave period of tp 16 2 s it can be seen that three significant waves are encountered at the instant t 750 t 1300 and t 3400 s respectively using the hydroelastoplastic model the amplitude of the design sea state is gradually scaled until the nonlinear whipping response becomes equal to the ultimate strength i e m w h i p n l m u then the linear whipping response and the quasi static response are calculated for the same maximum design sea state the linear and nonlinear whipping responses obtained using the nonlinear behavior calculated with nl fem approach are shown in fig 18 the evolution of the relative plastic rotation angle is shown in fig 19 a it can be observed that at the instant t 750 s when the ship encounters the first significant wave the plastic rotation angle increases then the plastic rotation angle is maintained until t 1400 when a second significant wave is encountered and the relative plastic rotation angle is further increased finally at t 3400 s the plastic rotation angle almost reaches the failure point if the amplitude of the design sea state is increased a little bit more the failure point will be reached and the structure will collapse moreover the hardening behavior and the accumulation of plastic deformations can be seen in fig 19 b using the same design sea state the nonlinear whipping response is computed using the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach on the one hand when using the nonlinear behavior computed by the nl fem approach the dynamic ultimate capacity factor is 1 0015 on the other hand when using the nonlinear behavior computed by the simplified smith approach the maximum value obtained is 1 0050 thus the values obtained on a design sea state are smaller than those obtained on an equivalent design wave 1 0018 and 1 0051 respectively this aspect was also pointed out by 8 showing that the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases when more realistic loading sequences are used in addition the calculation of the nonlinear whipping response under the design sea state is performed for ships s02 s05 s10 and s13 the dynamic ultimate capacity factor and the whipping effectiveness are summarized in table 4 it can be observed that for all considered ships both the dynamic ultimate capacity factors and the whipping effectiveness obtained on design sea state are smaller than the ones obtained on equivalent design waves 4 3 results discussion the numerical results obtained using the newly developed hydroelastoplastic model are further compared with the ones obtained by 8 it is important to point out that in 8 the investigations of the dynamic ultimate strength are performed only on ulcs ranging from 264 to 378 m for these ships the failure point s location calculated as the non dimensionalized curvature ranges from 1 23 to 1 39 these values are very similar to the ones obtained on the ulcs considered in the present research work as shown in fig 5 b in the study reported by 8 the dynamic ultimate strength is calculated using a single dof system which can be expressed as 16 1 ω 0 2 χ t 2 η ω 0 χ t f χ t f t where f t represents the excitation term χ represents the curvature and f t represents the internal bending moment it should be mentioned that the nonlinear behavior of each ship represented by the relationship between the curvature and the internal bending moment was calculated using the simplified smith approach more importantly by using a single dof system the nonlinear curvature is uniformly distributed along the ship s length this represents a big limitation of the structural model presented in eq 16 since in reality the collapse of the hull girder is very localized using the model presented in eq 16 8 firstly calculated the dynamic ultimate capacity factor for a simple but unrealistic loading sequence composed of pure slamming impact on calm water by using the energy conservation besides the dynamic ultimate capacity factor was calculated for more realistic loading sequences as an equivalent design wave or design sea state the results obtained by 8 for the ships with the lowest and the highest failure point which are also the ones with the lowest and the highest dynamic ultimate capacity factor are summarized in table 5 the dynamic ultimate capacity factors from 8 table 5 and the ones obtained in the present research work see tables 3 and 4 are compared in fig 20 one of the conclusions from 8 was that too simple excitation sequences such as a pure slamming impact on calm water are overestimating the dynamic ultimate capacity factor this aspect is clearly visible in fig 20 moreover it can be observed that when the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a design sea state instead of an equivalent design wave the dynamic ultimate capacity factors are reduced more importantly the numerical results depicted in fig 20 are showing that there is a significant reduction of the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated by two different methods on the one hand in the newly developed hydroelastoplastic method the plastic deformations are very localized along the hull girder i e reduced at a node of the fe model on the other hand in the investigation reported by 8 the plastic deformations are considered uniformly distributed along the hull girder therefore it can be said that it is essential to use a realistic structural model instead of a single degree of freedom model 5 conclusions the paper firstly presents a new approach developed to compute the nonlinear whipping response using a fully coupled hydroelastoplastic model within the proposed method the structure is modeled as two non uniform timoshenko beams connected via a nonlinear hinge while the hydrodynamic part is modeled using the 3d boundary element method the exact coupling between the structural model and the hydrodynamic one is achieved by constructing the hydrodynamic bvp s for each shape function of the finite elements after solving the complex bvp s for a range of frequencies the hydrodynamic coefficients in terms of added mass wave damping and wave excitation are determined the time domain simulation is then performed by making use of the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients to calculate the diffracted incident wave loads in addition the radiation force is calculated from the memory response functions and the past history of the velocities the nonlinear pressures resulting from slamming are calculated on multiple 2d sections and later integrated over the 3d hydrodynamic mesh finally the hydroelastoplastic problem is solved in the time domain using numerical integration where different iterations are used to handle the nonlinearities the hydroelastoplastic model allows for a fast computation of the nonlinear whipping response i e considering the nonlinear structural behavior on realistic scenarios such as equivalent design waves or design sea states comparing to a strongly coupled cfd fem approach where both domains should be considered nonlinear the proposed approach s computational time is significantly reduced from days to minutes secondly this paper presents the numerical investigation of the nonlinear whipping response on a database of fourteen container ships ranging from 160 m to 350 m the nonlinear hinge s behavior is described by the nonlinear relationship between the internal bending moment and the relative plastic rotation angle which is derived from the well known moment curvature curve used to describe the ultimate strength of a ship section for the considered ships the nonlinear behavior is calculated using two different methods i the simplified smith approach where the nonlinear curvature is associated with the entire length between two reinforced frames ii the nl fem approach where the plastic area is very localized between two web frames when comparing the output of the two methods it is observed that the failure point defined as the relative plastic rotation angle at the moment when the internal bending moment is equal to the ultimate strength is significantly lower in the results obtained from the more advanced approach based on nl fem this aspect raises some questions regarding the usability of the simplified smith approach in computing the nonlinear behavior curves accurately two coefficients noted γ d u and γ d u d n v are derived in order to account for the influence of the nonlinear structural behavior over the whipping response the numerical results show that both coefficients are highly dependent on the ratio between the quasi static response to the total nonlinear whipping response and on the failure point the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated on equivalent design waves varies from 1 005 to 1 072 when the nonlinear behavior from the simplified smith approach is used and from 1 001 to 1 023 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used it should be mentioned that for ulcs above 250 m the dynamic ultimate capacity factor calculated varies from 1 005 to 1 013 when the nonlinear behavior from the simplified smith approach is used and from 1 001 to 1 010 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used the whipping effectiveness calculated on equivalent design waves varies from 0 42 to 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used and from 0 70 to 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used moreover for ulcs the whipping effectiveness varies from 0 89 to 0 97 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the simplified smith approach is used and from 0 90 to 0 99 when the nonlinear behavior calculated by the nl fem approach is used therefore it seems that the value γ d u d n v 0 9 introduced by 44 is not conservative in addition when the nonlinear whipping response is calculated on a design sea state the dynamic ultimate capacity factor decreases while the whipping effectiveness increases this aspect was also pointed out by 8 thus it can be said that it is of paramount importance to use realistic loading sequences when analyzing the influence of nonlinear structural behavior over the slamming induced whipping response moreover it was shown the importance of using a realistic structural model the dynamic ultimate capacity factors obtained using the single dof structural model proposed by 8 are significantly bigger than the ones obtained from the newly developed method this difference can be explained by the fact that in the single dof model the plasticity is uniformly distributed along the hull girder while in the nonlinear hinge model the plasticity occurs only within one frame finally the above mentioned numerical results are summarized in fig 21 the outcome of this study provides useful information regarding the effects of nonlinear structural behavior on the slamming induced whipping response of ships for ultra large container ships the dynamic ultimate capacity factor defined as the ratio between the linear whipping response and the nonlinear whipping response varies from 1 001 to 1 013 therefore it can be concluded that the nonlinear structural behavior can be neglected in the analysis of the maximum hydroelastic response moreover the effectiveness of whipping varies from 0 89 to 0 99 which firstly shows that the fixed value of 0 9 recommended by 44 is not conservative thus the effectiveness of whipping should no be reduced credit authorship contribution statement george jagite conceptualization methodology software validation investigation formal analysis visualization writing original draft review editing

20269,a finite ocean depth is considered with the bottom possessing elasticity and subsequently the present investigation for an interface piercing structure focusses on the influence of porous parameters of the structure on attenuation of waves in both surface and interfacial modes for a two layer fluid flow further the influence of the elastic bottom is studied by using the dispersion relation to analyze the flexural gravity wave motion with the influence of the flexural wave motion factored into the solution the analytical results are graphically illustrated further a different linear algebraic technique is adopted and a comparison of the two methods supports our numerical finding the reflection coefficients for waves in surface and interfacial modes is examined along with their effects on the free surface and interface elevations and the wave loads on the structure consequently the appropriateness of various configurations of the structure on the scattering of surface waves is studied as per the findings an optimal width can be determined for a suitable configuration of the porous structure in order to build a breakwater with an acceptable performance of reflection and dissipation characteristics such an analysis is likely going to be immensely helpful for a variety of coastal systems in terms of reflection and dissipation of wave energy at continental shelves that is influenced by a stratified fluid which is being sculptured during this work as a two layer fluid for a matter of convenience the shear force and bottom deflection are discussed to examine how elastic parameters of the sea floor affect the scattering process it also aids in the analysis of the transformation of physical properties of water waves as well as the structure s effectiveness analyzing the results with respect to the sea floor helps to reduce the waveload on the structure which consequently protects the shore the analytical solution approximation findings are consistent with previous results from theoretical methods with an impermeable bottom this research presents a basic and elegant method for dealing with water wave encountering submerged porous structures and these results can be used as a reliable substitute technique for preliminary engineering analysis additionally an identical geometrical structure is also considered which contains a perforated front wall comparison of results for those two completely different structures points towards an additional effectiveness of the model msc 76b07 76b15 76b55 76s05 keywords oblique water wave propagation porous breakwater reflection coefficient surface mode interfacial mode 1 introduction the association of oblique surface gravity waves with a porous breakwater in a two layer fluid is an important subject of current research over the recent years a growing interest has been observed in studying the interaction of water waves with an immersed or a floating structure such as a barrier a breakwater or other any geometry for a homogeneous or two layer fluid wave absorbing systems having a definite efficiency in wave energy dissipation and alteration of the phase of reflected waves are usually recommended to be used as breakwaters in coastal areas shorelines and harbor regions a porous medium is considered important because it has a wide influence in coastal and marine engineering in reducing wave reflection and scour those can also be used as breakwaters to shield harbors inlets and beaches from the harsh wave effects resulting in a calmer water environment for mooring and maneuvering of vessels this offers sufficient rationale for constructing breakwater type porous structures to secure harbors to reduce coastal erosion and to protect various structures from wave action on and near the coast a number of researchers have analytically studied scattering by porous structures but those studies focussed primarily on a homogeneous fluid alone as a result there is sufficient scope in conducting our investigation on problems for a two layer fluid which presents a more realistic situation given that ocean water typically consists of several layers sollitt and cross 1972 were the ones instrumental in devising the first model of wave induced flow in a porous medium following that madsen 1983 and rojanakamthorn et al 1989 applied potential theory to solve scattering problems that involved porous structures in order to obtain reflection and transmission of linear shallow water waves due to a rectangular porous wave absorber mounted on a flat sea floor madsen 1983 used the linearized version of the governing equations as well as the flow resistance formula sulisz 1985 considered various rubble mound breakwaters representing most of the regular porous structures and hence in this context his result is considered significant he used boundary element method to numerically solve certain associated scattering problems yu and chwang 1994 investigated the propagation of water waves through a porous structure placed in a two layer fluid by using the virtual work theory established by sollitt and cross 1972 mendez and losada 2004 and then chang and liou 2004 devised two formidable methods which were found to be immensely helpful in solving the dispersion equations pertaining to a dissipative medium requejo et al 2002 faraci et al 2012 2015 and díaz carrasco et al 2020 derived a number of results related to porous structure scattering structure partitioning of incoming wave energy and the saturation regime of reflected energy flow as well as the function of perforated front and rear walls more research on different types of porous breakwaters sheds further light on this topic chwang 1983 while developing a porous wave maker theory used darcy s law to investigate the waves propagating through a porous system this work was subsequently extended by yu 1995 by taking into account the inertia effect das and bora 2014a b examined how a rectangular homogeneous porous structure was able to reflect and dampen waves when it was mounted on an elevated single step and multi step bottom of the sea bed with both cases considered separately porous blocks were found to be very effective in shengli s gudong and zhuangxi sea dike in terms of monitoring high wave attacks zhao et al 2017 likewise breakwaters with perforated walls were constructed in dieppe france belorgey et al 2003 and dalian chemical production terminal china huang et al 2011 in order to provide protection from wave action mehaute 1972 reported high wave energy damping because of the presence of a multi layered absorbent material and suggested the use of multiple damping materials for proper wave damping the above studies clearly demonstrate that the use of porous structures can definitely help in protecting offshore facilities by significantly reducing wave amplitude and hence wave action most of the investigations that have been carried out till date with respect to various issues related to porous structures involve mainly a homogeneous fluid a more practical scenario is probably the one in which water waves interact with a porous body in a stratified ocean differential temperature and salinity in coastal areas cause significant alteration in fluid density leading to the formation of different strata or layers as a result in practice ocean water can be considered as non homogeneous in both space and time to put it in another way ocean water is made up of different strata or density layers that have sharp interfaces because of the variance in density gradient instability is observed in the surfaces of the interfaces between different layers and therefore when an impulse gets into action wave like disturbances known as internal interfacial waves are frequently produced readers are referred to massel s monograph massel 2015 for a detailed explanation of interfacial waves and their implications behera and sahoo 2014 studied the influence of the breakwater porosity on the wave scattering and trapping in a two layer fluid barman and bora 2020 2021 discussed the interaction of water waves with porous bodies in a two layer fluid for the cases of impermeable and porous sea bottom respectively the sea bed was thought to be flat and rigid in the wave structure interaction problems as mentioned above however it is important to note that when gravity waves spread over the sea beds along the coast they undergo shear stress strain and pressure due to the permeable and elastic existence of the sea beds owing to the sea bed permeability elasticity and shear force which also slow down wave motion significant changes can be observed in wave characteristics along the coast due to the high waves during storms a mud hole in the gulf of mexico is found to be used as an emergency harbor where fishing boats often take shelter gade 1957 similar mud beds can be found all over the world for example on the inner shelf of the south central kerala coast in south west india see kurian et al 2009 narayana et al 2008 and the literature cited therein when mallard and dalrymple 1977 investigated wave propagation over a deformable bottom they noticed a major shift in the wave characteristics due to the elasticity of the sea bed dawson 1978 extended this work in examining the wave motion by taking into account the influence of soil inertia utilizing linear water wave theory mohapatra and sahoo 2011 investigated the impact of flexible nature of the sea bed on the propagation of the surface gravity waves lee and lan 2002 considered the combined effects of porosity and elasticity of the sea bed on the propagation of the surface gravity waves and found that in terms of pressure distribution the elastic effect outweighed the bed permeability tsai et al 1990 examined the response of a poroelastic sea bed to waves and modeled caisson motion using biot consolidation theory an analytical model was proposed by kumagai and foda 2002 for the response of a composite type breakwater and sea bed to sinusoidal standing waves the present work attempts to study the influence of a porous breakwater on water waves propagating in a two layer fluid over an elastic sea bottom while formulating the problem it is considered judicious to take into account the wave wave interaction utilization of small amplitude theory in water and the porous medium allows to solve the boundary value problems in both water and porous medium the whole fluid domain is split into a number of regions and the respective potentials are obtained by utilizing the specified boundary conditions and matching conditions across respective boundaries a linear system of algebraic equations is obtained the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated and studied for surface mode and interfacial mode by considering various values of porosity angle of incidence and some other geometrical parameters associated with depth on the basis of their approximate numerical solutions determined by analytical and linear algebraic approaches the obtained results of the reflection and transmission coefficients are compared hydrodynamic forces acting on both sides of the structure are also computed and analyzed so that various related issues may be addressed according to the authors knowledge no work on the interaction of flexural gravity waves with a porous body for a two layer fluid flow over an elastic sea bottom exists in the literature and subsequently the present work is likely to throw new light in this context in addition a perforated front wall is also introduced in the structure and its effect is compared with respect to the reflection and transmission coefficients and waveload 1 1 mathematical formulation an interface piercing porous breakwater is considered in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic sea bottom linear water wave theory and small amplitude bottom deflection in finite ocean water depth are taken into consideration to discuss the oblique surface wave interaction with the breakwater by assuming large length of the bottom the thin elastic plate theory can be employed for the elastic bottom as being considered extensively for problems on wave structure ice sheet interaction problems the elastic sea bottom is considered as a boundary only in this analysis and the fluid motion beneath it is not investigated the flexible nature of the elastic plate renders the condition at the bottom to a fifth order condition which is different from the usual neumann condition applicable for a rigid bottom the motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic and the fluid to be inviscid and incompressible one of two layers under the action of gravity the interface between the layers is taken to be linear the surface tension effect at the interface of the two layers is not accounted for since for such type of water wave problems the surface tension does not have any consequential contribution a right handed coordinate system is employed in such a way that z 0 represents the interface of the layers with the z axis pointing upwards further the mean free surface of the upper fluid layer of density ρ 1 is located at z d whereas the lower fluid layer of density ρ 2 is bounded below by an elastic bottom x with the mean depth z h based on the previous studies it can be inferred that the wave force acting on the shoreline is a recurring phenomenon and placing a porous structure is one of the ways to reduce the wave force on the shoreline the present study elaborates the importance of the porous structure standing upon a rigid foundation in protecting the shoreline the porous structure is used as a caisson type breakwater above a rock bottom foundation located in 0 x b we consider an incident wave obliquely incident at an inclination θ to the x axis on the structure subsequently velocity potentials φ j j 1 2 3 which denote the velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 respectively can be written as φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i k y y ω t with ω as angular wave frequency and k y k 1 1 sin θ as the y component of the wave number k 1 1 of the progressive wave propagating in the free surface mode further re is the real part of the quantity in and i 1 is the usual imaginary quantity the schematic diagram of the problem is depicted in fig 1 the variation of each potential φ j j 1 2 3 in the y direction is considered to be identical in order that all φ j along the vertical boundaries can be matched according to snell s law a rock foundation is assumed for the caisson type breakwater assuming this we consider an impermeable bottom for region 2 which is porous and consequently elastic bottom effect exists for regions 1 and 3 only furthermore the effect of the bottom underneath the rigid block is ignored in order that this specific arrangement is physically viable and can be used for practical problems justification is provided in appendix a in order that the problem can be clearly understood layer wise ϕ j x z are split in the following manner 1 1 ϕ j ψ j 1 0 z d ψ j 2 h z 0 for j 1 3 and ϕ 2 ψ 2 1 0 z d ψ 2 2 a z 0 for j 2 with the superscripts denoting the specific layer by taking into account all information the boundary value problems for ϕ j j 1 2 3 are found to satisfy modified helmholtz equation 1 2 x z 2 k y 2 ϕ j 0 where x z 2 2 x 2 2 z 2 is the two dimensional laplacian operator with the help of 1 1 eq 1 2 can be written as follows 1 3 x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 1 0 0 z d x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 2 0 h z 0 for j 1 3 1 4 x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 1 0 0 z d x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 2 0 a z 0 for j 2 for regions 1 and 3 the linearized mean free surface condition has the following form 1 5 ψ j 1 z k ψ j 1 0 on z d j 1 3 with k ω 2 g however the linearized mean free surface condition for region 2 differs since the region is porous and is given by 1 6 ψ 2 1 z k γ ψ 2 1 0 on z d where γ m i f denotes the complex porous impedance parameter with m and f respectively being the inertial coefficient and the linearized friction coefficient in appendix b the details are provided for equations in porous medium as found in dalrymple et al 1991 for more information on m and f the reader is referred to barman and bora 2021 further region 2 is assumed to have a porosity ε it is assumed that there exists no cavitation between the elastic bottom and the lower layer water surface we obtain the linearized boundary condition on the mean elastic bottom for ϕ j j 1 3 as 1 7 e i 4 z 4 ρ p ħ ω 2 ρ 2 g ϕ j z ρ 2 ω 2 ϕ j 0 on z h this can also be written explicitly as 1 8 e 5 ψ j 2 z 5 1 δ k ψ j 2 z k ψ j 2 0 where e e i ρ 2 g with e i being the flexural rigidity of the elastic plate where e is the young s modulus i ħ 3 12 1 ν and ν ħ and ρ p are respectively the poisson s ratio the thickness and the density of the elastic plate g is the usual gravitational constant and δ ρ p ħ ρ 2 due to the rigid foundation the impermeable bottom condition in region 2 yields 1 9 ψ 2 2 z 0 at z a let us denote by ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 the ratio of the densities of the two fluids subsequently the linearized conditions at z 0 take the following forms 1 10 ψ j 1 z ψ j 2 z for j 1 2 3 1 11 ρ ψ j 1 z k ψ j 1 ψ j 2 z k ψ j 2 for j 1 3 1 12 ρ ψ j 1 z k γ ψ j 1 ψ j 2 z k γ ψ j 2 for j 2 thereafter combining the potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 into ϕ j as given in 1 1 the matching conditions across the wall yield 1 13 ϕ 1 γ ϕ 2 at x 0 1 14 ϕ 1 x ε ϕ 2 x at x 0 1 15 ϕ 3 γ ϕ 2 at x b 1 16 ϕ 3 x ε ϕ 2 x at x b the above conditions arise due to the continuity of vertical velocity component and the pressure at x 0 and x b due to the rigid step the velocity potentials ψ 1 2 and ψ 3 2 satisfy the following boundary condition 1 17 ψ j 2 x 0 at x 0 for h z a for j 1 3 some additional constraints are required to be satisfied at the edges of the elastic bottom practically the rigid base of the structure is being constructed upon the bottom and that is why the clamped edge condition is justified to be assumed with respect to the bottom as an elastic plate furthermore the edge conditions are also helpful in view of stable creation of such structures under the physical considerations of our model it is assumed that the elastic plate edges satisfy the clamped edge boundary conditions at x z 0 h b h which are as follows 1 18 x ψ j 2 z 0 ψ j 2 z 0 for j 1 3 there exist some more standard edge conditions which can be applied separately at the edge e g the simply supported edge boundary conditions which are given by 1 19 2 x 2 ψ j 2 z 0 ψ j 2 z 0 it can be added here that some more complicated boundary conditions may be taken into account however in the present context such situation does not arise because of the simple physical condition considered here and therefore such boundary conditions are not required to be discussed the choice of such edge conditions can be found in more details in appendix a 2 scattering by the porous structure here the scattering of oblique ocean waves by the porous structure in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic bottom is formulated and solved analytically at the outset the velocity potentials associated with surface wave interaction under the considered situation are derived 2 1 approximation of the plane waves the velocity potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 j 1 2 3 satisfying the governing eqs 1 3 and 1 4 respectively subject to the respective boundary conditions 1 5 1 10 have the following forms 2 1 ϕ 1 ψ 1 1 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 1 k 1 z 0 z d ψ 1 2 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 2 k 1 z h z 0 for x 0 2 2 ϕ 2 ψ 2 1 exp i x q 2 i ˆ 2 1 k 2 z 0 z d ψ 2 2 exp i x q 2 i ˆ 2 2 k 2 z a z 0 for 0 x b 2 3 ϕ 3 ψ 3 1 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 1 k 1 z 0 z d ψ 3 2 exp i x

1 e k 1 4 1 δ k k 1 all k j s appearing above are computed from the dispersion relations which can be found as follows by using 1 11 and 1 12 2 6 d w k 1 k 1 2 1 ρ tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 1 k tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 2 ρ tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h 1 k f k 1 k 1 2 1 ρ tanh k 1 d k 1 k 1 tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 2 tanh k 1 h ρ tanh k 1 d 0 2 7 d p k 2 k 2 2 1 ρ tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a k 2 γ k tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a k 2 γ 2 ρ tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a 1 0 2 2 discussion on roots of the dispersion relations the cases ρ 1 and d 0 respectively in 2 6 and 2 7 yield the dispersion relation for a homogeneous fluid for a similar geometrical configuration it is obvious that k 1 0 is a root of eq 2 6 consideration of a very thin elastic plate with respect to the wavelength δ k 1 adopting euler bernoulli beam equation results in dispersion relation 2 6 having two positive real roots say k 1 1 and k 1 2 where 0 k 1 1 k 1 2 and these correspond to the propagating modes two pairs of complex conjugate roots say k 1 i p i q and k 1 i i p i q and these correspond to the non propagating modes and also an infinite number of purely imaginary roots given by k 1 n i t n for n 3 4 5 and real t n and these correspond to the evanescent modes the existence of exactly two positive zeros as also observed in chanda and bora 2020b 2021 saha and bora 2015 and maiti and mandal 2008 implies that there exist two wave modes wavenumbers which propagate at the free surface say sm and at the interface say im respectively along the positive x direction the study of the wave characteristics corresponding to x 0 is sufficient due to symmetry about x 0 the negative values of real and purely imaginary roots represent waves traveling in the negative direction in a newton raphson numerical solution procedure the roots are found by using matlab the initial choice is always considered to be crucial for finding the roots this does not always result in success it is important that suitable starting values are chosen this is particularly true when the wavenumbers of two different modes are close to each other or when they coincide now we examine the roots k 1 n h n 1 2 i against the flexural rigidity and structure width and subsequently present the results through two tables from table 1 one may observe that the wavenumbers in free surface mode sm attain increasing values corresponding to higher elastic parameter e h 4 of the bottom but no difference is observed for the interface mode im the strength of the evanescent modes faces a negligible decay when the elastic parameter increases however it is known that such waves have no role in changing the asymptotic behavior of the resultant reflected and transmitted waves the impact of flexural rigidity can be easily observed for the complex root k 1 i h the non dimensional modulus value of the complex root can be observed to reduce sharply and tend to 0 with the increase of flexural rigidity e h 4 physically the higher the flexural rigidity the stiffer the bottom and the harder for it to bend therefore higher flexural rigidity will render the bottom to a rigid one and as already observed by barman and bora 2020 wave scattering in a two layer fluid for an impermeable bottom results in two pairs of real roots moreover the stiffness depends not only on the flexural rigidity but also on the length of the plate and its end conditions as well while changing δ h we can observe from table 2 that a decreasing δ can result in an increase of the mode k 1 1 h whereas k 1 2 h remains unchanged as observed for e h 4 no difference is observed for evanescent modes while changing δ furthermore the complex root gets changed by a negligible amount due to the consideration of a thin elastic plate it is already mentioned that δ k is very small and moreover we can conclude that after some level δ h 0 1 reduction of δ will not affect our result to a large extent although the roots of the dispersion relation for water medium can be evaluated without much difficulty finding the roots of the dispersion relation in a porous medium is not considered to be very easy now taking γ 1 the dispersion equation of pure water region with a rigid bottom can be obtained the complication arises for dispersion relation 2 7 as it corresponds to the porous region and complex porous parameter γ barman and bora 2020 2021 explained the homotopy perturbation method by chang and liou 2004 and perturbation technique by mendez and losada 2004 for finding the roots in the porous region according to their algorithm it was shown that as the dissipation factor here γ which is 1 for plain water region changes from real to complex the corresponding dispersive roots of the water region also get converted to the roots of dispersion equation with complex parameter also the direct use of the newton raphson based algorithm on matlab can give us the roots but there may be some complication while finding the proper initial guess moreover when d p k 2 n 0 where denotes differentiation the newton raphson method also fails the eigenfunction expansion in the porous medium similarly fails at these k 2 n values it is found that a very negligible difference exists in the roots obtained by each method we follow the algorithm of chang and liou 2004 to obtain the roots in region 2 while finding the roots we observe that corresponding to γ 1 dispersion relation 2 7 has two pairs of real roots positive and negative these two modes correspond to progressive wave modes in the water region rigid bottom the other modes k 2 n n 3 4 are purely imaginary for f 0 the influence of f is to damp the wave motion by adding only an imaginary part to k 2 n for n 1 2 and real parts to the k 2 n n 2 furthermore implementing the chang and liou 2004 algorithm results in purely complex roots for complex γ as for 2 6 here also two propagating modes free surface and interface can be easily observed for a dimensionless water depth k h 1 the wavelength of this mode gets increased whereas the opposite is true for k h 1 in matlab 2019a we implement the newton raphson based algorithm to verify the complex roots while keeping the initial guess as the roots obtained by the chang and liou method and no difference is observed up to four decimal places it is to be noted that if ε 0 γ 0 then region 2 becomes a rigid block however for shallow water waves for both layers tanh k j d k j d for j 1 2 and tanh k 1 h k 1 h tanh k 2 a k 2 a which yield from 2 6 and 2 7 2 8 k 1 4 d h 1 ρ k 1 2 k d h ρ k d h k 2 k k 1 f k 1 k 1 2 d 1 ρ k h k k 2 h ρ d 0 2 9 k 2 4 d a 1 ρ k 2 2 k γ d a ρ k γ 2 d a k 2 γ 2 0 eq 2 8 is a polynomial of ninth degree of k 1 having two pairs of real roots four complex conjugate roots and one zero root while 2 9 consists of four symmetric roots which depend upon the parameter γ we use inbuilt roots function in matlab to easily obtain these polynomial roots in fig 2 a c e dimensionless real propagating modes are plotted corresponding to various parameters the real roots tend to 0 as h k 0 for shallow water waves the difference between the propagating modes is minimum and as the wave tends to be deeper the mode difference increases the interfacial mode increases monotonically over k h for phase velocity they maintain a steady state while varying h and the interfacial mode has a lower phase velocity as the time duration of gravity waves is t 0 20 s while varying k the similar characteristics in wavemodes can be observed as seen in fig 2 a phase velocity is also lower for the interfacial mode the free surface mode attains the maximum value for lower frequency and decreases over k h for varying ρ the interfacial mode blows out as ρ 1 further ρ 1 results in a single layer fluid propagation and that is why ρ 0 results in zero phase velocity for the interfacial mode further the free surface mode attains a steady state of phase velocity over varying ρ between the propagating modes the free surface one is found to be lower for all cases and it attains higher phase velocity fig 3 illustrates the behavior of the dispersion relationship with dimensionless depth and we examine if there exists any situation where the eigenfunction solution fails the plots show the complex wavenumber for the first five non dimensional modes k 2 n h n 1 5 for the values of f in the range 0 20 and a given value of k h for shallow water case k h 0 1886 fig 3 a shows the dimensionless wavenumbers in the porous medium as f varies from 0 to 20 for this case k 2 1 h and im k 2 n h first increase and then decrease with higher f but k 2 2 h rises sharply where increasing f causes higher oscillation no mode swapping appears for shallow water in fig 3 b f a value of k h 0 8602 2 0122 is used and the real parts in evanescent modes show a decreasing nature for increasing f in fig 3 a d the real part of the evanescent mode exceeds re k 2 1 h for higher f 11 which means that the plane wave approximation is not valid for large values of f for such k h for the values of k h 0 0 8602 the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h passes below the dimensionless evanescent curves whereas for k h 0 8646 2 0122 it passes above the non dimensional evanescent curves in fact the trajectory followed by each curve is the same as that followed by the other mode at the higher value of f if there is any intersection between two curves then it is referred to as mode swapping as k h increases towards deeper water conditions the curve corresponding to dimensionless k 2 1 moves further away from the evanescent modes in the intermediate area our main concern is to check for mode swapping from all the curves it is clear that the value k 1 n h oscillates about the vertical line re k 2 1 h k h for the values of k h 0 8620 and 0 8623 corresponding to intermediate water depth the curve of k 2 1 h versus f oscillates with that of k 2 3 h as shown in fig 4 a b in fig 4 a the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h intersects once at f 14 2749 and after f 15 055 it leaves a negligible distance with k 2 3 h in the form k 2 1 h k 2 3 h o 1 0 6 in fig 4 b corresponding to a f value of 17 6875 the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h makes a negligible distance of o 1 0 5 with k 2 3 h this is referred to as mode swapping e g craik 1986 as k h increases towards deeper water conditions the dimensionless k 2 n curve may not intersect other k 2 n modes the coalescence of the two modes implies that another new mode must be present in a similar way when double roots are obtained in the characteristic equation while solving an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients as defined by dalrymple et al 1991 the green s function technique should be used to overcome the situation for our choice of parameters along with the value of f 0 2 the mode swapping does not happen 2 3 method of solution by using the method of eigenfunction expansion the velocity potentials ϕ j x z for each subdomain j 1 2 3 can be written as 2 10 ϕ 1 n 1 2 e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z n i i i 1 r n e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z 2 11 ϕ 2 n 1 a n e i q 2 n x b n e i q 2 n x b i 2 n k 2 n z 2 12 ϕ 3 n i i i 1 t n e i q 1 n x b i 1 n k 1 n z where r n and t n n 1 2 are respectively the reflection and transmission coefficients in accordance with the realistic physical problems in wave structure interactions we take the contribution of the purely complex wavenumbers in regions 1 and 3 with k 1 n n i i i being complex conjugates having positive real parts it is assumed that the wavenumbers take distinct values in water and porous regions or otherwise the alternative approach as mentioned by behera and sahoo 2014 may be considered the eigenfunctions i 2 n k 2 n z in 2 5 are integrable in a d and they are orthogonal with respect to the following inner product 2 13 φ n ψ m a 0 φ n ψ m d z ρ 0 d φ n ψ m d z and this gives 2 14 i 2 n i 2 m 0 m n w n m n where w n 2 a k 2 n sinh 2 a k 2 n 4 k 2 n q n k

found to be not orthogonal in the usual way they form an orthogonal mode coupling relation as follows 2 15 φ n ψ m h 0 φ n ψ m d z ρ 0 d φ n ψ m d z e k φ n h ψ m h φ n h ψ m h which is similar to the one in the work of mohapatra and sahoo 2011 furthermore in the present study orthogonality of the eigenfunction i 2 n in the porous region is utilized to solve the boundary value problem now using the matching conditions 1 13 1 17 by considering n evanescent modes we get the following 2 16 n 1 2 i 1 n n i i i 1 n 2 r n i 1 n γ n 1 n 2 a n b n e i q 2 n b i 2 n for a z d 2 17 n 1 2 q 1 n i 1 n n i i

for h z a ε n 1 n 2 a n e i q 2 n b b n q 2 n i 2 n for a z d thereafter applying the orthogonality of the eigenfunction i 2 n eq 2 14 we get 2 20 n i i i 1 n 2 r n b ˆ n m γ a m b m e i q 2 m b a m n

23 consists of 4 n 8 linear equations with 4 n 12 unknowns where the unknown vector is 2 24 x r i r i i r 1 r 2 r n 2 a 1 a n 2 b 1 b n 2 t i t i i t 1 t n 2 t it leaves us with the requirement of four more conditions which can be obtained from the edge conditions eqs 1 17 1 18 subsequently it will yield a linear system of size 4 n 10 as follows 2 25 a x b determination of x allows us to discuss the reflection within the porous structure the computation of various quantities along with the relevant results and discussions take place in the next section r n t n n 1 2 respectively represent the reflection and transmission coefficients for both sm and im and they are evaluated by considering r s m r 1 r i m r 2 t s m t 1 t i m t 2 furthermore f f and f b the unit horizontal wave forces acting on the front and back faces respectively of the porous structure can be evaluated from the following f f i ω γ ρ 2 a 0 ϕ 2 0 z d z ρ 1 0 d ϕ 2 0 z d z f b i ω γ ρ 2 a 0 ϕ 2 b z d z ρ 1 0 d ϕ 2 b z d z f f and f b are respectively the non dimensional form of f f and f b and are given by 2 26 f f f f ρ 2 g a d and f b f b ρ 2 g a d assuming that the progressive waves in the surface and interfacial modes are of the forms ζ j re η j e i ω t for j 1 2 respectively the amplitude is obtained from the kinematic conditions in the open water as 2 27 η 1 i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z d 2 28 η 2 i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z 0 similarly the amplitude of bottom deflection ξ re ς e i ω t is given by the formula 2 29 ς i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z h the shear force s f on the elastic bottom is obtained by using the formula 2 30 s f e k h x 2 x 2 2 ν k y 2 ϕ j z at z h for j 1 3 2 4 linear algebraic approach depending on the boundary conditions in a boundary value problem the orthogonality of eigenfunctions may be an issue while trying to solve the problem by using eigenfunction expansion method therefore in addition to using the orthogonality of eigenfunctions the solution of eqs 2 16 2 19 can be approximated by applying the algebraic least squares ls method there are 4 n 12 unknowns in x where n is the number of evanescent modes in velocity potentials in order to apply the algebraic least squares method infinite number of discrete points are considered as follows z 1 1 z 1 2 in d 0 z 2 1 z 2 2 in 0 a and z 3 1 z 3 2 in a h this consideration leads to an over determined system ods consisting of an infinite number of equations and finite unknowns given by 2 31 a 1 x 1 b 1 where x 1 is the same unknown vector as x and a 1 is the coefficient matrix for numerical implementation of this algorithm we consider n 1 number of points in d 0 n 2 number of points in 0 a and n 3 number of points in a h which gives us the ods of size m 4 n 12 where m n 1 n 2 n 3 and 4 n 12 m by using the algebraic least squares method this ods can be solved to get the values of the unknowns furthermore minimization of the error gives 2 32 e r r b 1 a 1 x 1 2 b 1 2 where 2 is the euclidean norm the unique ls solution x 1 of eq 2 31 is miller 1973 2 33 x 1 a 1 a 1 1 a 1 b 1 where a 1 represents the conjugate transpose of a 1 further the unique solution exists provided a 1 has linearly independent columns 2 5 plane wave solution in the plane wave assumptions only the most progressive modes least damped of all regions are considered while employing the matching conditions the velocity potentials ϕ j for j 1 2 3 have the following forms 2 34 ϕ 1 n 1 2 e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z n i i i 1 2 r n e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z 2 35 ϕ 2 n 1 2 a n e i q 2 n x b n e i q 2 n x l i 2 n k 2 n z 2 36 ϕ 3 n i i i 1 2 t n e i q 1 n x b i 1 n k 1 n z applying a similar procedure we obtain a system of equations from which we can easily obtain the solution by employing any of the methods for shallow water approximation no evanescent modes are needed in order to match the solutions the system of equations remains the same as like in plane waves furthermore to obtain normal incidence solution l should be 0 from fig 5 a b it can be clearly observed that the consideration of different numbers of evanescent modes affects reflection and transmission coefficients shallow wave approximation also shows a similar pattern but the difference is easily visible 2 6 results and discussion the system of equations given by 2 26 is solved by using the in built program matlab r2019a it is to be noted that in order to utilize the algebraic approach and analytical approach the occurrence of ill conditioned matrices must be avoided in this context it is very important to choose the appropriate value of the parameters so as to avoid such an occurrence since a and a 1 are m n m n complex matrices and b b 1 ℂ therefore the solutions x x 1 ℂ so finding an appropriate algorithm to obtain the inverse may be one of the key aspects in numerical approach in both the methods we finally have to solve a large scale linear square system and hence we choose the in built function algorithm which uses lu factorization with partial pivoting proper care must be taken for ill conditioned systems as it may give some inaccurate solution to carry out the computation some parameter values are fixed as follows h a h 1 25 d h 1 m 1 ρ 0 97 e h 4 1 0 5 δ h 1 0 4 θ 30 k h 0 1 ν 0 3 along with values of f and ε in 0 25 2 and 0 3 0 9 respectively a detailed justification of consideration of these parameter values can be found in barman and bora 2021 at the outset we perform the convergence study of the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient against the non dimensional depth k h corresponding to different values of evanescent modes n an analytical approach is considered to find these values table 3 shows that the evanescent modes contribute significantly since zero evanescent mode n 0 produces a significant difference when compared with other propagating modes further when the number of evanescent modes increases a very good numerical convergence is attained for n 16 therefore table 3 suggests the consideration of the number of evanescent modes n 16 to be appropriate in all further computations convergence of n 1 n 2 the number of points in different intervals is verified by calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients in both propagating modes in table 4 values of r s m r i m t s m and t i m are calculated for different values of n 1 n 2 by the algebraic least squares method table 4 suggests that the convergence of the coefficients up to four decimal places are obtained after n 1 n 2 n 3 1900 consequently for calculation by this approach we consider n 1 n 2 n 3 1900 throughout this study unless otherwise stated before analyzing the effect of various parameters the key question that arises is whether these two approaches lead to a correct result or not moreover complications of badly scaled parameters is one of the drawbacks of linear algebraic procedure the numerical values of the reflection and transmission coefficients and e r r obtained by the present methods are compared for different values of k b in table 5 from which it is observed that the results match up to two decimal places this fact provides another check on the correctness of the present results the error given by relation 2 32 is also computed for these different approaches in table 5 however it is noticed that a significant difference in error is observed and for both the methods the error decreases as k b increases therefore the method giving an analytic solution based on the eigenfunction approach provides a better solution than the least squares method based on the concepts of linear algebra of over determined system of equations arising from the scattering of water waves by a porous structure therefore the analytic approach can be used in all numerical works here however this kind of comparison may add an extra support in checking the accuracy while obtaining numerical results in figs 6 a b 7 a b the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against non dimensional width k 1 1 b in sm and im corresponding to various values of friction and porosity respectively in fig 6 a b similar patterns can be observed for both propagating modes higher friction gives rise to higher reflection and lower transmission but t s m attains higher values for the lower values of f only in k 1 1 b 1 5 whereas the patterns are the opposite for k 1 1 b 1 5 consideration of different values of porosity ε brings a difference in the behavior of the reflection and transmission coefficients between two propagating modes we can observe that higher porosity leads to higher reflection and higher transmission for sm whereas lower reflection is observed for im however no major effect can be observed in t i m for different porosity values therefore higher reflection and lower transmission can be achieved by choosing appropriate porous parameters it is observed that after a specific width the reflection and transmission coefficients change sharply and remain almost constant the same trend follows for the cases of varying porosity and varying friction for both cases the convergence of reflection and transmission modes is attained after some structural width it is also observed that the propagating modes have an optimum for almost the same structural width an important observation is that a steady behavior is noticed for both the propagating modes corresponding to the structural width and subsequently it may be concluded that beyond a specific value an increase in the width of the structure cannot influence either reflection or transmission fig 8 a b shows the effect of porosity on the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient against θ in surface mode and interfacial mode respectively when the porosity is varied the reflection coefficient begins from the minimum value to the maximum value in both propagating modes an opposite behavior is observed for transmission coefficients with change in porosity a negligible difference in transmission coefficients for both s m and i m is observed moreover all transmission graphs tend to 0 with rising θ t s m for θ 5 and t i m for θ 25 however in the case of the reflection coefficients a significant difference is observed among all graphs and they obtain their maximum corresponding to the angle 90 but a change in porosity does not take into account the difference in the incident angle in order to obtain its optimum for the surface mode lower porosity values give rise to lower reflection but for the interfacial mode r i m initially shows the opposite nature and after attaining the minimum value they follow the similar behavior as s m subsequently a study of the wave pattern allows the design of efficient breakwaters with an appropriate selection of the width step height and friction factor of the structure so as to get maximum wave reflection which can help in protecting the offshore structures fig 9 a b shows waveloads f f and f b respectively versus k 1 1 b for various values of friction for the initial non dimensional width k 1 1 b 0 the wave forces on both walls x 0 and x b are the same and very much closer to 0 but when the structural width is increased f f increases and attains its maximum value fig 5b shows that wave force f b also increases and achieves its highest value but a sharp reduction is observed when the width is increased this may be attributed to a substantial amount of wave energy getting dissipated by the porous structure moreover the wave forces initially show the highest impact for the lower structural width and different values of γ do not introduce any difference in attaining optimum value of the waveload however it is observed that both the wave forces exhibit a steady behavior after a specific width f f is observed to have a higher impact corresponding to higher friction f but f b follows this pattern only for the initial width and after k 1 1 b 1 5 the pattern is altered moreover the steady waveload justifies that the energy dissipation is fixed up to a specific structural width beyond which the energy loss does not depend on the structural width fig 10 a b shows the free surface elevations η 1 h and interface elevation η 2 h versus the non dimensional distance x h for various values of friction with x denoting the horizontal distance measured from x 0 it shows that η 2 h becomes higher than η 1 h we can assume that this difference between the elevations of these two modes arises due to the resonating interaction between the free surface waves and interfacial waves the elevation reduces significantly due to the presence of the porous structure the oscillations in both propagating modes increase when the friction coefficient f takes higher values however for the interface a negligible difference in elevations is observed corresponding to different f non dimensional elevation with respect to x is plotted in fig 11 a b for various values of k h we can easily observe the phase shift that occurs in the elevations in both propagating modes due to the presence of the structure for the interface it is observed that the number of oscillations is higher corresponding to the same x distance on the free surface there is a continuous phase lag in the vertical displacement response for the free surface but in the interfacial mode it is highly dependent on the structure based on the outcome a suitable choice of parameters pertaining to a porous structure interacting with waves will allow the creation of a tranquility zone by reducing the waveload on the rigid wall and the porous structure the effect of flexural rigidity e of the elastic bottom is examined against different f in table 6 a difference is observed only for the lower values of e otherwise all the reflection and transmission coefficients converge to a fixed value in both propagating modes for higher e different rigidity e does not contribute to any major difference for reflection and transmission coefficients in interfacial modes it was also observed in table 1 that the change of flexural rigidity does not contribute any major difference in the dispersive roots in interfacial propagation this may be one of the reasons for such behavior of r i m and t i m furthermore the impact of the friction parameter as well as of the flexural rigidity upon the elastic bottom deflection are also plotted against the non dimensional distance in fig 12 a b it can be observed that the elastic bottom attains the lowest amplitude of deflection corresponding to the lowest value of f further ζ attains 0 value at both the edges of the elastic bottom plate which also satisfies the clamped edge conditions moreover a major reduction in the amplitude can be observed clearly for bottom deflection due to the structure deflection for various e maintains the same value which clearly shows that after some value of the elastic rigidity the bottom does not have any impact for such a wave interaction system fig 13 a b presents the shear force on the elastic bottom for different values of the friction and different values of structural length it is revealed that the shear achieves the lowest value near the edge 0 h further the forces exhibit an oscillatory behavior similar to the deflection pattern of the elastic bottom fig 13a shows the variation in the shear force acting on the elastic bottom for different values of the friction f for the interaction of the waves with the structure after x b h the amplitude of the shear force decreases corresponding to an increase in f lower f results in lower s f and the oscillation reduces to the one with increasing x furthermore fig 13b shows that for an increase in b h the width of the porous structure the amplitude of shear force on the elastic bottom decreases this fact can be understood clearly from the argument that a porous structure of larger width can cause greater dissipation of energy which is responsible for lesser shear force acting on the bottom the fact that an increase in the width b h of the porous breakwater gives rise to a greater reflection and dissipation of wave energy as observed in figs 6 a b 9b supports this observation 3 comparison between elastic and rigid bottom comparing our interaction method to a rigid sea bottom seems very interesting because it simplifies the study while keeping the formulation applicable to wave attenuation applications in view of this it would be very useful to equate the rigid sea bed with a stiff elastic sea bottom i e a case of increased stiffness in a similar way of the justification of our schematic model as shown in appendix a comparison of the impermeable bottom with an elastic bottom with increased stiffness can provide a fair validation of the euler bernoulli beam equations concept for the sea bed as those two should converge asymptotically the dispersion relation 2 6 does not directly give our desired dispersion relation for a rigid bottom but 2 7 will give us that for γ 1 see table 7 upon comparing with table 1 it can be observed that as the flexural rigidity increases the roots more or less become the same furthermore the complex root tends to 0 with rising rigidity in table 1 if we obtain the same wave interaction system for an impermeable bottom then the system of equations becomes of order 4 n 8 4 n 8 and the vanishing edge conditions also match due to the impermeability of the bottom the advantage is that by using the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions in both regions and using the similar orthogonality of eigenfunction i 2 n we solve the system it can be seen from the graphs in 14 a b that the reflection and transmission coefficients converge to one for both forms of bottom characteristics elastic and rigid for narrower width structures minor variations can be seen we may conclude that the bottom characteristics correspond to a thin long elastic plate with a very high flexural stiffness and it is more difficult to bend it as a result we come to the realization that the stiff elastic sea bottom behaves asymptotically like a rigid bottom this will provide a fair level of model validity for the bottom fig 15 a demonstrates that the reflection coefficient is generally larger for higher friction coefficients maxima occur at the same initial angle and minima occur at slightly different angles of incidence as f changes similar characteristics of the reflection curve in the free surface mode are observed in fig 5 of losada et al 1993 for incident angle θ for comparing with single layer model we consider ρ 0 99 d h 1 25 and some other parameters as ε 0 45 h a h 0 25 d h 1 which result in similar graphs as can be found in a single layer fluid small difference can be observed due to the density differences in two layers for the small upper layer portion and frequency differences furthermore the dimensionless vertical force coefficient f f is plotted in fig 15 b showing a favorable comparison between the present theory and fig 7 of losada et al 1993 the result demonstrates that an increase of the porosity induces a reduction of the vertical force the characteristics as well as graphs are same here with the one layer case 4 validation validation of such wave interaction system is very much difficult due to the lack of literature in this direction the most straightforward way to establish validation is to compare our results when the bed s thickness as well as elasticity are excluded from the equation when the values of both elastic parameters e and δ are taken as 0 then the bottom configuration can be turned into a rigid one according to chanda and bora 2020a although that depends on the schematic configuration as well as on the physical considerations of the model but a similar procedure is used in this article so that bottom boundary condition can be converted to the one used by behera and sahoo 2014 the complete utility of the model is assessed by comparing two separate cases full wave solution and long wave approximation to form a correct relation by translating our model to that of behera and sahoo 2014 we use e 0 δ 0 to transform the elastic bottom to an impermeable one and also the following parameter values d h a 2 5 m t 8 s g 9 81 m s 2 ε 0 5 f 0 5 fig 16 a b shows the plots of the reflection and transmission coefficients versus k 1 1 b and study of both the works indicate a high level of consensus of behera and sahoo s work behera and sahoo 2014 with the current work this means that the current model is reasonably accurate and can be applied to a variety of coastal and offshore infrastructure issues 5 breakwater with a perforated front wall within the same bathymetry as in fig 1 a perforated front wall is considered at x 0 now combining the potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 into ϕ j for j 1 2 the matching conditions at x 0 yield as in isaacson et al 2000 5 1 ϕ 1 x ε ϕ 2 x for a z d 5 2 ϕ 1 x i k 1 1 g ϕ 1 γ ϕ 2 for a z d with g ε p k 1 1 b p f p i m p as the porous effect parameter where the quantities with the subscript p except for b p denote various parameters associated with the perforated front wall and b p refers to the thickness of the front wall as particular cases g 0 for a solid wall and g when the perforated wall is entirely transparent it is to be noted that although the thickness of the perforated wall is considered as zero when the wave interaction with the whole breakwater is considered the thickness of the wall is taken into account for the flow within the perforated wall the velocity potentials take similar forms like 2 10 2 12 now applying the conditions 5 1 and 5 2 to the potentials and using a similar procedure as carried out earlier the following equations arise 5 3 n i i i 1 n 2 r n q 1 n b n m ε a m b m e i q 2 m l q 2 m a m n 1 2 q 1 n b n m 5 4 n i i i 1 n 2 r n q 1 n k 1 1 g b ˆ n m k 1 1 g γ a m b m e i q 2 m l a m n 1 2 q 1 n k 1 1 g b ˆ n m where b ˆ n m a 0 i 1 n i 2 m d z ρ 0 d i 1 n i 2 m d z now solving the system of equations consisting of eqs 5 3 5 4 2 28 and 2 29 and the clamped edge conditions the required unknown coefficients can be obtained in fig 17 a b the impact of the perforated wall on the reflection and transmission coefficients is examined against the non dimensional structure width it can be observed that due to the presence of the thin perforated wall the reflection and transmission coefficients do not vary much for either of the propagating modes further the impact of waveloads is observed to be the lowest for the porous structure with a perforated wall in general we can clearly observe a major impact of the perforated wall on both waveloads practically it can be assumed that the perforated wall is instrumental in retarding the wave motion due to its inertial resistance associated with the increase in the energy dissipation within the structure as a result it can be concluded that in order to protect the shoreline adding a perforated front wall to a structure will lead to lesser waveloads due to better dissipating properties in this direction in order to construct a porous structure insertion of a perforated front will be more effective 6 conclusion this article attempts to throw light on the interaction of oblique water waves with a porous structure in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic bottom the linear interface piercing structure is placed on a rigid bottom which follows the elastic bottom additionally the problem is also considered by attaching a perforated front wall to the porous structure the associated scattering problems are solved by utilizing linear water wave theory and eigenfunction expansion method by considering the contribution of complex conjugate wavenumbers the effect of the elastic bottom is also accounted for while finding the potentials thereafter a number of results are obtained and analyzed with respect to various parameters another method known as the linear algebraic approach is adopted to provide an additional mean to support the accuracy of our evaluated results less amount of waveload is observed on the back face of the porous region and less elevation is observed in the water region following the structure due to the wave dissipation by the structure it also allows one to find the optimum width for a suitable structural configuration possessing both reflective and dissipative characteristics in order to attain higher wave reflection and lower transmission for a porous breakwater moderate value of the angle of incidence is helpful choosing the height width and porous parameter of the structure appropriately the following can be achieved i maximum wave reflection and minimum transmission ii maximum dissipation of energy iii minimum elevation in the confined zone moreover the characteristics of the bottom also affect the waveload as well as the reflection and transmission coefficients the shear force and bottom deflection are analyzed for various elastic parameters a suitable agreement in shear force is observed while placing such a structure on the bottom with elastic characteristics when the porous structure is considered with a perforated front wall one can observe the following i the percolative property of the front wall adds more efficiency to the breakwater in producing lower waveload on both faces of the structure compared to the case without any front wall ii no major difference exists with respect to the reflection and transmission coefficients in both cases by matching a current outcome to an available result an excellent consensus is reached confirming the utility of the current model and that the inquiry can go forward to sum it up the study of water wave interaction with such type of structures allows one to clearly understand the effect of the porous structures that can create a tranquility zone it is concluded that the consideration of a porous structure with suitable geometrical configuration along with appropriate characteristics of the bottom is a very important aspect to be taken into account in order to provide safety to the coastal

revision appendix a practical validation of the physical model it is important to visually justify the schematic model before the very crude mathematical model is solved to physically test our schematic model we refer to some works as well as add legitimate reasoning the primary aim of our proposed study is to develop an elastic bottom to replace the conventional flat and rigid bottom a fluid base surface encases the lower surface in our work when it comes to describing soil mechanics there are primarily two kinds of methods continuum approach and modeling approach the soil medium is idealized by winkler 1867 as a series of equal but mutually distinct closely spaced isolated linearly elastic springs based on this principle we choose a thin elastic plate to represent the sea bed the plate s diameter is insignificant in relation to the wavelength of the normal incident waves propagating horizontally as a result structural slenderness is a reasonable expectation the forced hydroelastic oscillations of a circular plate lying on an elastic base were studied by kondratov and his colleagues kondratov et al 2018 to explain the soil pile relationship in the ocean bayat et al 2017 suggested the winkler theory in which the pile was modeled as beam components bee 2013 used beam on elastic base buckling theory to investigate the effect of the sea floor on the buckling load of an undersea pipeline to reflect the sea floor as a simplified elastic support the winkler foundation was selected due to the physical complexities inherent in soil dynamics a more complex elastic base model is not warranted despite its simplicity hetenyi 1946 claimed that the winkler principle could much more reliably reflect the conditions in soil foundations than more complicated models in which the structure is seen as a continuous isotropic elastic body the thin elastic plate principle which has been extensively considered for problems on wave structure ice sheet interface problems can be used for the elastic sea bottom by considering a significant length of the bottom when deciding on the euler bernoulli beam principle the edge conditions are critical the work on a crude model for sea bed modeling may reflect the use of an arbitrary edge condition for example where a slab is lying on a beam and all building components behave independently an unrestrained plate state can be considered it is totally immobile due to the clamped end on one side it maintains an orthogonal relationship with the boundary the edges of the breakwater would be rigid as a scour protection is created on the bed to create the breakwater ensuring the structure s stability wave reflection by a rigid wall in a channel of finite width and depth along with semi infinite duration with elastic bed was studied by mohapatra and soares 2016 and they used the free edge boundary state when using clamped edge conditions the modeling seems to be mechanically meaningful in our situation the clamped edge elastic plate bottom with rigid side walls was used by askari and daneshmand 2010 and zhou and cheung 2001 in the pasternak foundation hasheminejad and mohammadi 2017 considered an elastic bottom plate with clamped edge action the dynamic action of an elastic plate lying on a winkler elastic base and in contact with fluid with certain boundary conditions was studied by ali et al 2014 clamped edge situations can be mechanically feasible when point loads can be modeled at the end of operation only the thin bottom surface has been included in this study the underneath thick section has been left out apart from the above evidence this form of elastic model adoption is prevalent in soil mechanics and ocean wave propagation an abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep ocean floor that is the flattest smoothest and least visited regions on earth if we consider the sea floor structure carefully abyssal plains are important geologic features of oceanic basins and no matter how large they are we can only perceive the sea beds as the bottom zone in terms of ocean engineering huge floating oil storage vessels boats and aircraft for example can resist localized vibrations and large capacity oil containers in the petrochemical industry can survive earthquakes thanks to the free vibration properties of the fluid structure relationship for a homogeneous fluid mohapatra and sahoo 2011 and mohapatra and soares 2016 came to the same conclusion several attempts have been made to study the elastic ocean bed or ice covered sea floor in a two layer fluid by saha and bora 2015 and chanda and bora 2020b 2021 recently khuntia and mohapatra 2020 mohapatra 2017 das and mohapatra 2019 2020 sarangi and mohapatra 2018 sarkar et al 2021 and others have worked on wave interaction issues based on similar bottom characteristics when investigating the impact of porous breakwater on wave interaction our primary focus is on a crude porous model lying on the base if the base is subjected to a partly spread surface loading the springs would not be disturbed outside the loaded field according to the winkler idealization given this constructing a porous system that extends past the filled plate would have little effect on the sea floor when we look at the construction of different marine structures such as traditional rubble mound breakwaters caisson style on rock foundations vertical breakwaters and so on we can see that the base is often designed to be rigid by obstructing the movement of sand ions the foundation configuration prevents erosion of the ground and sea bed on the sea bed a rigid rock foundation namely a caisson foundation can be usually observed bridges piers dams and other buildings that require underwater protection often use caisson foundations the construction loads are carried by the caisson foundations at their lower ends vertical breakwaters for example have a thin stone bedding structure while vertical composite breakwaters have a high rubble foundation to prevent erosion the stone armor between the breakwater base and bed is often solid scour defence must be established before making the choice of any breakwater constructing toe defence in concrete filled jute bags has been observed in practice a sheet of loose or silty sand or mud may also be seen on top of a strong hard bottom assuming this we consider porous region 2 to have an impermeable bottom and the elastic bottom effect is limited to regions 1 and 3 only as a result when studying the ocean bottom surface only we can use the euler bernoulli beam equation to model the elastic base surface as a thin elastic plate lying on such a winkler basis and scientifically acceptable and justified edge conditions appendix b equation in porous medium small amplitude wave motion in three dimensions is considered within an undeformable porous medium it is assumed that the porous structure is homogeneous and isotropic uniform properties of the material in all directions the fluid motion follows the continuity equation and the equation of motion in terms of the seepage fluid velocity u fluid density ρ and dynamic pressure p which are given by b 1 u 0 b 2 u t p ρ resistance forces the resistance forces in eq b 2 are evaluated by combining known steady and unsteady stress relationships under steady state flow conditions the pressure drop through the porous medium is specified by ward 1964 as b 3 p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u where v k is the kinematic viscosity k p is the intrinsic permeability ε is the porosity and c f is a dimensionless turbulent resistance coefficient of the medium it is hypothesized by sollitt and cross 1972 that unsteadiness may be accounted for by introducing an additional term which evaluates the added resistance caused by the virtual mass of discrete grains within the medium the resistance force due to the virtual mass is equal to the product of the displaced fluid mass the virtual mass coefficient and the acceleration in the approach velocity the resulting force is distributed over the fluid mass within the pore so that the force per unit mass of fluid simply becomes b 4 1 ε ε c m u t combining eqs b 3 and b 4 and replacing the resistance force in eq b 2 by them we get b 5 u t p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u 1 ε ε c m u t m u t p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u where m 1 c m 1 ε ε it is worth mentioning that m 1 accounts for two different cases namely m 1 i e the absence of any structure and c m 0 i e the presence of an inviscid fluid now linearization of eq b 5 is necessary in order to find an analytical solution and hence the dissipative stress term is replaced by a linear stress term in u by the following form b 6 v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u f ω u combination of eqs b 5 and b 6 leads to b 7 m u t p ρ f ω u 0 in order to evaluate f lorentz principle of equivalent work is applied which states that the average rate of energy dissipation should be identical whether evaluated using the true non linear resistance law or its linearized equivalent the porous bed is assumed to be very thin under our consideration and therefore the variation of the pressure across its thickness may be approximated as linear since the resistance terms of the above relation represent friction force per unit mass acting at a point in the flow field the following equality energy dissipation holds b 8 v ε d v t t t f ω u ρ u d t v ε d v t t t v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u ρ u d t where v is the volume of the flow field and t is the wave period now assuming f to be constant throughout the flow field the following expression for f can be written b 9 f 1 ω v d v t t t ε 2 v k u 2 k p c f ε k p ε u 3 d t v d v t t t ε u 2 d t 
20269,a finite ocean depth is considered with the bottom possessing elasticity and subsequently the present investigation for an interface piercing structure focusses on the influence of porous parameters of the structure on attenuation of waves in both surface and interfacial modes for a two layer fluid flow further the influence of the elastic bottom is studied by using the dispersion relation to analyze the flexural gravity wave motion with the influence of the flexural wave motion factored into the solution the analytical results are graphically illustrated further a different linear algebraic technique is adopted and a comparison of the two methods supports our numerical finding the reflection coefficients for waves in surface and interfacial modes is examined along with their effects on the free surface and interface elevations and the wave loads on the structure consequently the appropriateness of various configurations of the structure on the scattering of surface waves is studied as per the findings an optimal width can be determined for a suitable configuration of the porous structure in order to build a breakwater with an acceptable performance of reflection and dissipation characteristics such an analysis is likely going to be immensely helpful for a variety of coastal systems in terms of reflection and dissipation of wave energy at continental shelves that is influenced by a stratified fluid which is being sculptured during this work as a two layer fluid for a matter of convenience the shear force and bottom deflection are discussed to examine how elastic parameters of the sea floor affect the scattering process it also aids in the analysis of the transformation of physical properties of water waves as well as the structure s effectiveness analyzing the results with respect to the sea floor helps to reduce the waveload on the structure which consequently protects the shore the analytical solution approximation findings are consistent with previous results from theoretical methods with an impermeable bottom this research presents a basic and elegant method for dealing with water wave encountering submerged porous structures and these results can be used as a reliable substitute technique for preliminary engineering analysis additionally an identical geometrical structure is also considered which contains a perforated front wall comparison of results for those two completely different structures points towards an additional effectiveness of the model msc 76b07 76b15 76b55 76s05 keywords oblique water wave propagation porous breakwater reflection coefficient surface mode interfacial mode 1 introduction the association of oblique surface gravity waves with a porous breakwater in a two layer fluid is an important subject of current research over the recent years a growing interest has been observed in studying the interaction of water waves with an immersed or a floating structure such as a barrier a breakwater or other any geometry for a homogeneous or two layer fluid wave absorbing systems having a definite efficiency in wave energy dissipation and alteration of the phase of reflected waves are usually recommended to be used as breakwaters in coastal areas shorelines and harbor regions a porous medium is considered important because it has a wide influence in coastal and marine engineering in reducing wave reflection and scour those can also be used as breakwaters to shield harbors inlets and beaches from the harsh wave effects resulting in a calmer water environment for mooring and maneuvering of vessels this offers sufficient rationale for constructing breakwater type porous structures to secure harbors to reduce coastal erosion and to protect various structures from wave action on and near the coast a number of researchers have analytically studied scattering by porous structures but those studies focussed primarily on a homogeneous fluid alone as a result there is sufficient scope in conducting our investigation on problems for a two layer fluid which presents a more realistic situation given that ocean water typically consists of several layers sollitt and cross 1972 were the ones instrumental in devising the first model of wave induced flow in a porous medium following that madsen 1983 and rojanakamthorn et al 1989 applied potential theory to solve scattering problems that involved porous structures in order to obtain reflection and transmission of linear shallow water waves due to a rectangular porous wave absorber mounted on a flat sea floor madsen 1983 used the linearized version of the governing equations as well as the flow resistance formula sulisz 1985 considered various rubble mound breakwaters representing most of the regular porous structures and hence in this context his result is considered significant he used boundary element method to numerically solve certain associated scattering problems yu and chwang 1994 investigated the propagation of water waves through a porous structure placed in a two layer fluid by using the virtual work theory established by sollitt and cross 1972 mendez and losada 2004 and then chang and liou 2004 devised two formidable methods which were found to be immensely helpful in solving the dispersion equations pertaining to a dissipative medium requejo et al 2002 faraci et al 2012 2015 and díaz carrasco et al 2020 derived a number of results related to porous structure scattering structure partitioning of incoming wave energy and the saturation regime of reflected energy flow as well as the function of perforated front and rear walls more research on different types of porous breakwaters sheds further light on this topic chwang 1983 while developing a porous wave maker theory used darcy s law to investigate the waves propagating through a porous system this work was subsequently extended by yu 1995 by taking into account the inertia effect das and bora 2014a b examined how a rectangular homogeneous porous structure was able to reflect and dampen waves when it was mounted on an elevated single step and multi step bottom of the sea bed with both cases considered separately porous blocks were found to be very effective in shengli s gudong and zhuangxi sea dike in terms of monitoring high wave attacks zhao et al 2017 likewise breakwaters with perforated walls were constructed in dieppe france belorgey et al 2003 and dalian chemical production terminal china huang et al 2011 in order to provide protection from wave action mehaute 1972 reported high wave energy damping because of the presence of a multi layered absorbent material and suggested the use of multiple damping materials for proper wave damping the above studies clearly demonstrate that the use of porous structures can definitely help in protecting offshore facilities by significantly reducing wave amplitude and hence wave action most of the investigations that have been carried out till date with respect to various issues related to porous structures involve mainly a homogeneous fluid a more practical scenario is probably the one in which water waves interact with a porous body in a stratified ocean differential temperature and salinity in coastal areas cause significant alteration in fluid density leading to the formation of different strata or layers as a result in practice ocean water can be considered as non homogeneous in both space and time to put it in another way ocean water is made up of different strata or density layers that have sharp interfaces because of the variance in density gradient instability is observed in the surfaces of the interfaces between different layers and therefore when an impulse gets into action wave like disturbances known as internal interfacial waves are frequently produced readers are referred to massel s monograph massel 2015 for a detailed explanation of interfacial waves and their implications behera and sahoo 2014 studied the influence of the breakwater porosity on the wave scattering and trapping in a two layer fluid barman and bora 2020 2021 discussed the interaction of water waves with porous bodies in a two layer fluid for the cases of impermeable and porous sea bottom respectively the sea bed was thought to be flat and rigid in the wave structure interaction problems as mentioned above however it is important to note that when gravity waves spread over the sea beds along the coast they undergo shear stress strain and pressure due to the permeable and elastic existence of the sea beds owing to the sea bed permeability elasticity and shear force which also slow down wave motion significant changes can be observed in wave characteristics along the coast due to the high waves during storms a mud hole in the gulf of mexico is found to be used as an emergency harbor where fishing boats often take shelter gade 1957 similar mud beds can be found all over the world for example on the inner shelf of the south central kerala coast in south west india see kurian et al 2009 narayana et al 2008 and the literature cited therein when mallard and dalrymple 1977 investigated wave propagation over a deformable bottom they noticed a major shift in the wave characteristics due to the elasticity of the sea bed dawson 1978 extended this work in examining the wave motion by taking into account the influence of soil inertia utilizing linear water wave theory mohapatra and sahoo 2011 investigated the impact of flexible nature of the sea bed on the propagation of the surface gravity waves lee and lan 2002 considered the combined effects of porosity and elasticity of the sea bed on the propagation of the surface gravity waves and found that in terms of pressure distribution the elastic effect outweighed the bed permeability tsai et al 1990 examined the response of a poroelastic sea bed to waves and modeled caisson motion using biot consolidation theory an analytical model was proposed by kumagai and foda 2002 for the response of a composite type breakwater and sea bed to sinusoidal standing waves the present work attempts to study the influence of a porous breakwater on water waves propagating in a two layer fluid over an elastic sea bottom while formulating the problem it is considered judicious to take into account the wave wave interaction utilization of small amplitude theory in water and the porous medium allows to solve the boundary value problems in both water and porous medium the whole fluid domain is split into a number of regions and the respective potentials are obtained by utilizing the specified boundary conditions and matching conditions across respective boundaries a linear system of algebraic equations is obtained the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated and studied for surface mode and interfacial mode by considering various values of porosity angle of incidence and some other geometrical parameters associated with depth on the basis of their approximate numerical solutions determined by analytical and linear algebraic approaches the obtained results of the reflection and transmission coefficients are compared hydrodynamic forces acting on both sides of the structure are also computed and analyzed so that various related issues may be addressed according to the authors knowledge no work on the interaction of flexural gravity waves with a porous body for a two layer fluid flow over an elastic sea bottom exists in the literature and subsequently the present work is likely to throw new light in this context in addition a perforated front wall is also introduced in the structure and its effect is compared with respect to the reflection and transmission coefficients and waveload 1 1 mathematical formulation an interface piercing porous breakwater is considered in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic sea bottom linear water wave theory and small amplitude bottom deflection in finite ocean water depth are taken into consideration to discuss the oblique surface wave interaction with the breakwater by assuming large length of the bottom the thin elastic plate theory can be employed for the elastic bottom as being considered extensively for problems on wave structure ice sheet interaction problems the elastic sea bottom is considered as a boundary only in this analysis and the fluid motion beneath it is not investigated the flexible nature of the elastic plate renders the condition at the bottom to a fifth order condition which is different from the usual neumann condition applicable for a rigid bottom the motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic and the fluid to be inviscid and incompressible one of two layers under the action of gravity the interface between the layers is taken to be linear the surface tension effect at the interface of the two layers is not accounted for since for such type of water wave problems the surface tension does not have any consequential contribution a right handed coordinate system is employed in such a way that z 0 represents the interface of the layers with the z axis pointing upwards further the mean free surface of the upper fluid layer of density ρ 1 is located at z d whereas the lower fluid layer of density ρ 2 is bounded below by an elastic bottom x with the mean depth z h based on the previous studies it can be inferred that the wave force acting on the shoreline is a recurring phenomenon and placing a porous structure is one of the ways to reduce the wave force on the shoreline the present study elaborates the importance of the porous structure standing upon a rigid foundation in protecting the shoreline the porous structure is used as a caisson type breakwater above a rock bottom foundation located in 0 x b we consider an incident wave obliquely incident at an inclination θ to the x axis on the structure subsequently velocity potentials φ j j 1 2 3 which denote the velocity potentials in regions 1 2 and 3 respectively can be written as φ j x y z t re ϕ j x z e i k y y ω t with ω as angular wave frequency and k y k 1 1 sin θ as the y component of the wave number k 1 1 of the progressive wave propagating in the free surface mode further re is the real part of the quantity in and i 1 is the usual imaginary quantity the schematic diagram of the problem is depicted in fig 1 the variation of each potential φ j j 1 2 3 in the y direction is considered to be identical in order that all φ j along the vertical boundaries can be matched according to snell s law a rock foundation is assumed for the caisson type breakwater assuming this we consider an impermeable bottom for region 2 which is porous and consequently elastic bottom effect exists for regions 1 and 3 only furthermore the effect of the bottom underneath the rigid block is ignored in order that this specific arrangement is physically viable and can be used for practical problems justification is provided in appendix a in order that the problem can be clearly understood layer wise ϕ j x z are split in the following manner 1 1 ϕ j ψ j 1 0 z d ψ j 2 h z 0 for j 1 3 and ϕ 2 ψ 2 1 0 z d ψ 2 2 a z 0 for j 2 with the superscripts denoting the specific layer by taking into account all information the boundary value problems for ϕ j j 1 2 3 are found to satisfy modified helmholtz equation 1 2 x z 2 k y 2 ϕ j 0 where x z 2 2 x 2 2 z 2 is the two dimensional laplacian operator with the help of 1 1 eq 1 2 can be written as follows 1 3 x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 1 0 0 z d x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 2 0 h z 0 for j 1 3 1 4 x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 1 0 0 z d x z 2 k y 2 ψ j 2 0 a z 0 for j 2 for regions 1 and 3 the linearized mean free surface condition has the following form 1 5 ψ j 1 z k ψ j 1 0 on z d j 1 3 with k ω 2 g however the linearized mean free surface condition for region 2 differs since the region is porous and is given by 1 6 ψ 2 1 z k γ ψ 2 1 0 on z d where γ m i f denotes the complex porous impedance parameter with m and f respectively being the inertial coefficient and the linearized friction coefficient in appendix b the details are provided for equations in porous medium as found in dalrymple et al 1991 for more information on m and f the reader is referred to barman and bora 2021 further region 2 is assumed to have a porosity ε it is assumed that there exists no cavitation between the elastic bottom and the lower layer water surface we obtain the linearized boundary condition on the mean elastic bottom for ϕ j j 1 3 as 1 7 e i 4 z 4 ρ p ħ ω 2 ρ 2 g ϕ j z ρ 2 ω 2 ϕ j 0 on z h this can also be written explicitly as 1 8 e 5 ψ j 2 z 5 1 δ k ψ j 2 z k ψ j 2 0 where e e i ρ 2 g with e i being the flexural rigidity of the elastic plate where e is the young s modulus i ħ 3 12 1 ν and ν ħ and ρ p are respectively the poisson s ratio the thickness and the density of the elastic plate g is the usual gravitational constant and δ ρ p ħ ρ 2 due to the rigid foundation the impermeable bottom condition in region 2 yields 1 9 ψ 2 2 z 0 at z a let us denote by ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 the ratio of the densities of the two fluids subsequently the linearized conditions at z 0 take the following forms 1 10 ψ j 1 z ψ j 2 z for j 1 2 3 1 11 ρ ψ j 1 z k ψ j 1 ψ j 2 z k ψ j 2 for j 1 3 1 12 ρ ψ j 1 z k γ ψ j 1 ψ j 2 z k γ ψ j 2 for j 2 thereafter combining the potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 into ϕ j as given in 1 1 the matching conditions across the wall yield 1 13 ϕ 1 γ ϕ 2 at x 0 1 14 ϕ 1 x ε ϕ 2 x at x 0 1 15 ϕ 3 γ ϕ 2 at x b 1 16 ϕ 3 x ε ϕ 2 x at x b the above conditions arise due to the continuity of vertical velocity component and the pressure at x 0 and x b due to the rigid step the velocity potentials ψ 1 2 and ψ 3 2 satisfy the following boundary condition 1 17 ψ j 2 x 0 at x 0 for h z a for j 1 3 some additional constraints are required to be satisfied at the edges of the elastic bottom practically the rigid base of the structure is being constructed upon the bottom and that is why the clamped edge condition is justified to be assumed with respect to the bottom as an elastic plate furthermore the edge conditions are also helpful in view of stable creation of such structures under the physical considerations of our model it is assumed that the elastic plate edges satisfy the clamped edge boundary conditions at x z 0 h b h which are as follows 1 18 x ψ j 2 z 0 ψ j 2 z 0 for j 1 3 there exist some more standard edge conditions which can be applied separately at the edge e g the simply supported edge boundary conditions which are given by 1 19 2 x 2 ψ j 2 z 0 ψ j 2 z 0 it can be added here that some more complicated boundary conditions may be taken into account however in the present context such situation does not arise because of the simple physical condition considered here and therefore such boundary conditions are not required to be discussed the choice of such edge conditions can be found in more details in appendix a 2 scattering by the porous structure here the scattering of oblique ocean waves by the porous structure in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic bottom is formulated and solved analytically at the outset the velocity potentials associated with surface wave interaction under the considered situation are derived 2 1 approximation of the plane waves the velocity potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 j 1 2 3 satisfying the governing eqs 1 3 and 1 4 respectively subject to the respective boundary conditions 1 5 1 10 have the following forms 2 1 ϕ 1 ψ 1 1 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 1 k 1 z 0 z d ψ 1 2 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 2 k 1 z h z 0 for x 0 2 2 ϕ 2 ψ 2 1 exp i x q 2 i ˆ 2 1 k 2 z 0 z d ψ 2 2 exp i x q 2 i ˆ 2 2 k 2 z a z 0 for 0 x b 2 3 ϕ 3 ψ 3 1 exp i x q 1 i ˆ 1 1 k 1 z 0 z d ψ 3 2 exp i x

1 e k 1 4 1 δ k k 1 all k j s appearing above are computed from the dispersion relations which can be found as follows by using 1 11 and 1 12 2 6 d w k 1 k 1 2 1 ρ tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 1 k tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 2 ρ tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h 1 k f k 1 k 1 2 1 ρ tanh k 1 d k 1 k 1 tanh k 1 d tanh k 1 h k 2 tanh k 1 h ρ tanh k 1 d 0 2 7 d p k 2 k 2 2 1 ρ tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a k 2 γ k tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a k 2 γ 2 ρ tanh k 2 d tanh k 2 a 1 0 2 2 discussion on roots of the dispersion relations the cases ρ 1 and d 0 respectively in 2 6 and 2 7 yield the dispersion relation for a homogeneous fluid for a similar geometrical configuration it is obvious that k 1 0 is a root of eq 2 6 consideration of a very thin elastic plate with respect to the wavelength δ k 1 adopting euler bernoulli beam equation results in dispersion relation 2 6 having two positive real roots say k 1 1 and k 1 2 where 0 k 1 1 k 1 2 and these correspond to the propagating modes two pairs of complex conjugate roots say k 1 i p i q and k 1 i i p i q and these correspond to the non propagating modes and also an infinite number of purely imaginary roots given by k 1 n i t n for n 3 4 5 and real t n and these correspond to the evanescent modes the existence of exactly two positive zeros as also observed in chanda and bora 2020b 2021 saha and bora 2015 and maiti and mandal 2008 implies that there exist two wave modes wavenumbers which propagate at the free surface say sm and at the interface say im respectively along the positive x direction the study of the wave characteristics corresponding to x 0 is sufficient due to symmetry about x 0 the negative values of real and purely imaginary roots represent waves traveling in the negative direction in a newton raphson numerical solution procedure the roots are found by using matlab the initial choice is always considered to be crucial for finding the roots this does not always result in success it is important that suitable starting values are chosen this is particularly true when the wavenumbers of two different modes are close to each other or when they coincide now we examine the roots k 1 n h n 1 2 i against the flexural rigidity and structure width and subsequently present the results through two tables from table 1 one may observe that the wavenumbers in free surface mode sm attain increasing values corresponding to higher elastic parameter e h 4 of the bottom but no difference is observed for the interface mode im the strength of the evanescent modes faces a negligible decay when the elastic parameter increases however it is known that such waves have no role in changing the asymptotic behavior of the resultant reflected and transmitted waves the impact of flexural rigidity can be easily observed for the complex root k 1 i h the non dimensional modulus value of the complex root can be observed to reduce sharply and tend to 0 with the increase of flexural rigidity e h 4 physically the higher the flexural rigidity the stiffer the bottom and the harder for it to bend therefore higher flexural rigidity will render the bottom to a rigid one and as already observed by barman and bora 2020 wave scattering in a two layer fluid for an impermeable bottom results in two pairs of real roots moreover the stiffness depends not only on the flexural rigidity but also on the length of the plate and its end conditions as well while changing δ h we can observe from table 2 that a decreasing δ can result in an increase of the mode k 1 1 h whereas k 1 2 h remains unchanged as observed for e h 4 no difference is observed for evanescent modes while changing δ furthermore the complex root gets changed by a negligible amount due to the consideration of a thin elastic plate it is already mentioned that δ k is very small and moreover we can conclude that after some level δ h 0 1 reduction of δ will not affect our result to a large extent although the roots of the dispersion relation for water medium can be evaluated without much difficulty finding the roots of the dispersion relation in a porous medium is not considered to be very easy now taking γ 1 the dispersion equation of pure water region with a rigid bottom can be obtained the complication arises for dispersion relation 2 7 as it corresponds to the porous region and complex porous parameter γ barman and bora 2020 2021 explained the homotopy perturbation method by chang and liou 2004 and perturbation technique by mendez and losada 2004 for finding the roots in the porous region according to their algorithm it was shown that as the dissipation factor here γ which is 1 for plain water region changes from real to complex the corresponding dispersive roots of the water region also get converted to the roots of dispersion equation with complex parameter also the direct use of the newton raphson based algorithm on matlab can give us the roots but there may be some complication while finding the proper initial guess moreover when d p k 2 n 0 where denotes differentiation the newton raphson method also fails the eigenfunction expansion in the porous medium similarly fails at these k 2 n values it is found that a very negligible difference exists in the roots obtained by each method we follow the algorithm of chang and liou 2004 to obtain the roots in region 2 while finding the roots we observe that corresponding to γ 1 dispersion relation 2 7 has two pairs of real roots positive and negative these two modes correspond to progressive wave modes in the water region rigid bottom the other modes k 2 n n 3 4 are purely imaginary for f 0 the influence of f is to damp the wave motion by adding only an imaginary part to k 2 n for n 1 2 and real parts to the k 2 n n 2 furthermore implementing the chang and liou 2004 algorithm results in purely complex roots for complex γ as for 2 6 here also two propagating modes free surface and interface can be easily observed for a dimensionless water depth k h 1 the wavelength of this mode gets increased whereas the opposite is true for k h 1 in matlab 2019a we implement the newton raphson based algorithm to verify the complex roots while keeping the initial guess as the roots obtained by the chang and liou method and no difference is observed up to four decimal places it is to be noted that if ε 0 γ 0 then region 2 becomes a rigid block however for shallow water waves for both layers tanh k j d k j d for j 1 2 and tanh k 1 h k 1 h tanh k 2 a k 2 a which yield from 2 6 and 2 7 2 8 k 1 4 d h 1 ρ k 1 2 k d h ρ k d h k 2 k k 1 f k 1 k 1 2 d 1 ρ k h k k 2 h ρ d 0 2 9 k 2 4 d a 1 ρ k 2 2 k γ d a ρ k γ 2 d a k 2 γ 2 0 eq 2 8 is a polynomial of ninth degree of k 1 having two pairs of real roots four complex conjugate roots and one zero root while 2 9 consists of four symmetric roots which depend upon the parameter γ we use inbuilt roots function in matlab to easily obtain these polynomial roots in fig 2 a c e dimensionless real propagating modes are plotted corresponding to various parameters the real roots tend to 0 as h k 0 for shallow water waves the difference between the propagating modes is minimum and as the wave tends to be deeper the mode difference increases the interfacial mode increases monotonically over k h for phase velocity they maintain a steady state while varying h and the interfacial mode has a lower phase velocity as the time duration of gravity waves is t 0 20 s while varying k the similar characteristics in wavemodes can be observed as seen in fig 2 a phase velocity is also lower for the interfacial mode the free surface mode attains the maximum value for lower frequency and decreases over k h for varying ρ the interfacial mode blows out as ρ 1 further ρ 1 results in a single layer fluid propagation and that is why ρ 0 results in zero phase velocity for the interfacial mode further the free surface mode attains a steady state of phase velocity over varying ρ between the propagating modes the free surface one is found to be lower for all cases and it attains higher phase velocity fig 3 illustrates the behavior of the dispersion relationship with dimensionless depth and we examine if there exists any situation where the eigenfunction solution fails the plots show the complex wavenumber for the first five non dimensional modes k 2 n h n 1 5 for the values of f in the range 0 20 and a given value of k h for shallow water case k h 0 1886 fig 3 a shows the dimensionless wavenumbers in the porous medium as f varies from 0 to 20 for this case k 2 1 h and im k 2 n h first increase and then decrease with higher f but k 2 2 h rises sharply where increasing f causes higher oscillation no mode swapping appears for shallow water in fig 3 b f a value of k h 0 8602 2 0122 is used and the real parts in evanescent modes show a decreasing nature for increasing f in fig 3 a d the real part of the evanescent mode exceeds re k 2 1 h for higher f 11 which means that the plane wave approximation is not valid for large values of f for such k h for the values of k h 0 0 8602 the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h passes below the dimensionless evanescent curves whereas for k h 0 8646 2 0122 it passes above the non dimensional evanescent curves in fact the trajectory followed by each curve is the same as that followed by the other mode at the higher value of f if there is any intersection between two curves then it is referred to as mode swapping as k h increases towards deeper water conditions the curve corresponding to dimensionless k 2 1 moves further away from the evanescent modes in the intermediate area our main concern is to check for mode swapping from all the curves it is clear that the value k 1 n h oscillates about the vertical line re k 2 1 h k h for the values of k h 0 8620 and 0 8623 corresponding to intermediate water depth the curve of k 2 1 h versus f oscillates with that of k 2 3 h as shown in fig 4 a b in fig 4 a the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h intersects once at f 14 2749 and after f 15 055 it leaves a negligible distance with k 2 3 h in the form k 2 1 h k 2 3 h o 1 0 6 in fig 4 b corresponding to a f value of 17 6875 the curve corresponding to k 2 1 h makes a negligible distance of o 1 0 5 with k 2 3 h this is referred to as mode swapping e g craik 1986 as k h increases towards deeper water conditions the dimensionless k 2 n curve may not intersect other k 2 n modes the coalescence of the two modes implies that another new mode must be present in a similar way when double roots are obtained in the characteristic equation while solving an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients as defined by dalrymple et al 1991 the green s function technique should be used to overcome the situation for our choice of parameters along with the value of f 0 2 the mode swapping does not happen 2 3 method of solution by using the method of eigenfunction expansion the velocity potentials ϕ j x z for each subdomain j 1 2 3 can be written as 2 10 ϕ 1 n 1 2 e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z n i i i 1 r n e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z 2 11 ϕ 2 n 1 a n e i q 2 n x b n e i q 2 n x b i 2 n k 2 n z 2 12 ϕ 3 n i i i 1 t n e i q 1 n x b i 1 n k 1 n z where r n and t n n 1 2 are respectively the reflection and transmission coefficients in accordance with the realistic physical problems in wave structure interactions we take the contribution of the purely complex wavenumbers in regions 1 and 3 with k 1 n n i i i being complex conjugates having positive real parts it is assumed that the wavenumbers take distinct values in water and porous regions or otherwise the alternative approach as mentioned by behera and sahoo 2014 may be considered the eigenfunctions i 2 n k 2 n z in 2 5 are integrable in a d and they are orthogonal with respect to the following inner product 2 13 φ n ψ m a 0 φ n ψ m d z ρ 0 d φ n ψ m d z and this gives 2 14 i 2 n i 2 m 0 m n w n m n where w n 2 a k 2 n sinh 2 a k 2 n 4 k 2 n q n k

found to be not orthogonal in the usual way they form an orthogonal mode coupling relation as follows 2 15 φ n ψ m h 0 φ n ψ m d z ρ 0 d φ n ψ m d z e k φ n h ψ m h φ n h ψ m h which is similar to the one in the work of mohapatra and sahoo 2011 furthermore in the present study orthogonality of the eigenfunction i 2 n in the porous region is utilized to solve the boundary value problem now using the matching conditions 1 13 1 17 by considering n evanescent modes we get the following 2 16 n 1 2 i 1 n n i i i 1 n 2 r n i 1 n γ n 1 n 2 a n b n e i q 2 n b i 2 n for a z d 2 17 n 1 2 q 1 n i 1 n n i i

for h z a ε n 1 n 2 a n e i q 2 n b b n q 2 n i 2 n for a z d thereafter applying the orthogonality of the eigenfunction i 2 n eq 2 14 we get 2 20 n i i i 1 n 2 r n b ˆ n m γ a m b m e i q 2 m b a m n

23 consists of 4 n 8 linear equations with 4 n 12 unknowns where the unknown vector is 2 24 x r i r i i r 1 r 2 r n 2 a 1 a n 2 b 1 b n 2 t i t i i t 1 t n 2 t it leaves us with the requirement of four more conditions which can be obtained from the edge conditions eqs 1 17 1 18 subsequently it will yield a linear system of size 4 n 10 as follows 2 25 a x b determination of x allows us to discuss the reflection within the porous structure the computation of various quantities along with the relevant results and discussions take place in the next section r n t n n 1 2 respectively represent the reflection and transmission coefficients for both sm and im and they are evaluated by considering r s m r 1 r i m r 2 t s m t 1 t i m t 2 furthermore f f and f b the unit horizontal wave forces acting on the front and back faces respectively of the porous structure can be evaluated from the following f f i ω γ ρ 2 a 0 ϕ 2 0 z d z ρ 1 0 d ϕ 2 0 z d z f b i ω γ ρ 2 a 0 ϕ 2 b z d z ρ 1 0 d ϕ 2 b z d z f f and f b are respectively the non dimensional form of f f and f b and are given by 2 26 f f f f ρ 2 g a d and f b f b ρ 2 g a d assuming that the progressive waves in the surface and interfacial modes are of the forms ζ j re η j e i ω t for j 1 2 respectively the amplitude is obtained from the kinematic conditions in the open water as 2 27 η 1 i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z d 2 28 η 2 i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z 0 similarly the amplitude of bottom deflection ξ re ς e i ω t is given by the formula 2 29 ς i ω ϕ j z for j 1 3 at z h the shear force s f on the elastic bottom is obtained by using the formula 2 30 s f e k h x 2 x 2 2 ν k y 2 ϕ j z at z h for j 1 3 2 4 linear algebraic approach depending on the boundary conditions in a boundary value problem the orthogonality of eigenfunctions may be an issue while trying to solve the problem by using eigenfunction expansion method therefore in addition to using the orthogonality of eigenfunctions the solution of eqs 2 16 2 19 can be approximated by applying the algebraic least squares ls method there are 4 n 12 unknowns in x where n is the number of evanescent modes in velocity potentials in order to apply the algebraic least squares method infinite number of discrete points are considered as follows z 1 1 z 1 2 in d 0 z 2 1 z 2 2 in 0 a and z 3 1 z 3 2 in a h this consideration leads to an over determined system ods consisting of an infinite number of equations and finite unknowns given by 2 31 a 1 x 1 b 1 where x 1 is the same unknown vector as x and a 1 is the coefficient matrix for numerical implementation of this algorithm we consider n 1 number of points in d 0 n 2 number of points in 0 a and n 3 number of points in a h which gives us the ods of size m 4 n 12 where m n 1 n 2 n 3 and 4 n 12 m by using the algebraic least squares method this ods can be solved to get the values of the unknowns furthermore minimization of the error gives 2 32 e r r b 1 a 1 x 1 2 b 1 2 where 2 is the euclidean norm the unique ls solution x 1 of eq 2 31 is miller 1973 2 33 x 1 a 1 a 1 1 a 1 b 1 where a 1 represents the conjugate transpose of a 1 further the unique solution exists provided a 1 has linearly independent columns 2 5 plane wave solution in the plane wave assumptions only the most progressive modes least damped of all regions are considered while employing the matching conditions the velocity potentials ϕ j for j 1 2 3 have the following forms 2 34 ϕ 1 n 1 2 e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z n i i i 1 2 r n e i q 1 n x i 1 n k 1 n z 2 35 ϕ 2 n 1 2 a n e i q 2 n x b n e i q 2 n x l i 2 n k 2 n z 2 36 ϕ 3 n i i i 1 2 t n e i q 1 n x b i 1 n k 1 n z applying a similar procedure we obtain a system of equations from which we can easily obtain the solution by employing any of the methods for shallow water approximation no evanescent modes are needed in order to match the solutions the system of equations remains the same as like in plane waves furthermore to obtain normal incidence solution l should be 0 from fig 5 a b it can be clearly observed that the consideration of different numbers of evanescent modes affects reflection and transmission coefficients shallow wave approximation also shows a similar pattern but the difference is easily visible 2 6 results and discussion the system of equations given by 2 26 is solved by using the in built program matlab r2019a it is to be noted that in order to utilize the algebraic approach and analytical approach the occurrence of ill conditioned matrices must be avoided in this context it is very important to choose the appropriate value of the parameters so as to avoid such an occurrence since a and a 1 are m n m n complex matrices and b b 1 ℂ therefore the solutions x x 1 ℂ so finding an appropriate algorithm to obtain the inverse may be one of the key aspects in numerical approach in both the methods we finally have to solve a large scale linear square system and hence we choose the in built function algorithm which uses lu factorization with partial pivoting proper care must be taken for ill conditioned systems as it may give some inaccurate solution to carry out the computation some parameter values are fixed as follows h a h 1 25 d h 1 m 1 ρ 0 97 e h 4 1 0 5 δ h 1 0 4 θ 30 k h 0 1 ν 0 3 along with values of f and ε in 0 25 2 and 0 3 0 9 respectively a detailed justification of consideration of these parameter values can be found in barman and bora 2021 at the outset we perform the convergence study of the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient against the non dimensional depth k h corresponding to different values of evanescent modes n an analytical approach is considered to find these values table 3 shows that the evanescent modes contribute significantly since zero evanescent mode n 0 produces a significant difference when compared with other propagating modes further when the number of evanescent modes increases a very good numerical convergence is attained for n 16 therefore table 3 suggests the consideration of the number of evanescent modes n 16 to be appropriate in all further computations convergence of n 1 n 2 the number of points in different intervals is verified by calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients in both propagating modes in table 4 values of r s m r i m t s m and t i m are calculated for different values of n 1 n 2 by the algebraic least squares method table 4 suggests that the convergence of the coefficients up to four decimal places are obtained after n 1 n 2 n 3 1900 consequently for calculation by this approach we consider n 1 n 2 n 3 1900 throughout this study unless otherwise stated before analyzing the effect of various parameters the key question that arises is whether these two approaches lead to a correct result or not moreover complications of badly scaled parameters is one of the drawbacks of linear algebraic procedure the numerical values of the reflection and transmission coefficients and e r r obtained by the present methods are compared for different values of k b in table 5 from which it is observed that the results match up to two decimal places this fact provides another check on the correctness of the present results the error given by relation 2 32 is also computed for these different approaches in table 5 however it is noticed that a significant difference in error is observed and for both the methods the error decreases as k b increases therefore the method giving an analytic solution based on the eigenfunction approach provides a better solution than the least squares method based on the concepts of linear algebra of over determined system of equations arising from the scattering of water waves by a porous structure therefore the analytic approach can be used in all numerical works here however this kind of comparison may add an extra support in checking the accuracy while obtaining numerical results in figs 6 a b 7 a b the reflection and transmission coefficients are plotted against non dimensional width k 1 1 b in sm and im corresponding to various values of friction and porosity respectively in fig 6 a b similar patterns can be observed for both propagating modes higher friction gives rise to higher reflection and lower transmission but t s m attains higher values for the lower values of f only in k 1 1 b 1 5 whereas the patterns are the opposite for k 1 1 b 1 5 consideration of different values of porosity ε brings a difference in the behavior of the reflection and transmission coefficients between two propagating modes we can observe that higher porosity leads to higher reflection and higher transmission for sm whereas lower reflection is observed for im however no major effect can be observed in t i m for different porosity values therefore higher reflection and lower transmission can be achieved by choosing appropriate porous parameters it is observed that after a specific width the reflection and transmission coefficients change sharply and remain almost constant the same trend follows for the cases of varying porosity and varying friction for both cases the convergence of reflection and transmission modes is attained after some structural width it is also observed that the propagating modes have an optimum for almost the same structural width an important observation is that a steady behavior is noticed for both the propagating modes corresponding to the structural width and subsequently it may be concluded that beyond a specific value an increase in the width of the structure cannot influence either reflection or transmission fig 8 a b shows the effect of porosity on the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient against θ in surface mode and interfacial mode respectively when the porosity is varied the reflection coefficient begins from the minimum value to the maximum value in both propagating modes an opposite behavior is observed for transmission coefficients with change in porosity a negligible difference in transmission coefficients for both s m and i m is observed moreover all transmission graphs tend to 0 with rising θ t s m for θ 5 and t i m for θ 25 however in the case of the reflection coefficients a significant difference is observed among all graphs and they obtain their maximum corresponding to the angle 90 but a change in porosity does not take into account the difference in the incident angle in order to obtain its optimum for the surface mode lower porosity values give rise to lower reflection but for the interfacial mode r i m initially shows the opposite nature and after attaining the minimum value they follow the similar behavior as s m subsequently a study of the wave pattern allows the design of efficient breakwaters with an appropriate selection of the width step height and friction factor of the structure so as to get maximum wave reflection which can help in protecting the offshore structures fig 9 a b shows waveloads f f and f b respectively versus k 1 1 b for various values of friction for the initial non dimensional width k 1 1 b 0 the wave forces on both walls x 0 and x b are the same and very much closer to 0 but when the structural width is increased f f increases and attains its maximum value fig 5b shows that wave force f b also increases and achieves its highest value but a sharp reduction is observed when the width is increased this may be attributed to a substantial amount of wave energy getting dissipated by the porous structure moreover the wave forces initially show the highest impact for the lower structural width and different values of γ do not introduce any difference in attaining optimum value of the waveload however it is observed that both the wave forces exhibit a steady behavior after a specific width f f is observed to have a higher impact corresponding to higher friction f but f b follows this pattern only for the initial width and after k 1 1 b 1 5 the pattern is altered moreover the steady waveload justifies that the energy dissipation is fixed up to a specific structural width beyond which the energy loss does not depend on the structural width fig 10 a b shows the free surface elevations η 1 h and interface elevation η 2 h versus the non dimensional distance x h for various values of friction with x denoting the horizontal distance measured from x 0 it shows that η 2 h becomes higher than η 1 h we can assume that this difference between the elevations of these two modes arises due to the resonating interaction between the free surface waves and interfacial waves the elevation reduces significantly due to the presence of the porous structure the oscillations in both propagating modes increase when the friction coefficient f takes higher values however for the interface a negligible difference in elevations is observed corresponding to different f non dimensional elevation with respect to x is plotted in fig 11 a b for various values of k h we can easily observe the phase shift that occurs in the elevations in both propagating modes due to the presence of the structure for the interface it is observed that the number of oscillations is higher corresponding to the same x distance on the free surface there is a continuous phase lag in the vertical displacement response for the free surface but in the interfacial mode it is highly dependent on the structure based on the outcome a suitable choice of parameters pertaining to a porous structure interacting with waves will allow the creation of a tranquility zone by reducing the waveload on the rigid wall and the porous structure the effect of flexural rigidity e of the elastic bottom is examined against different f in table 6 a difference is observed only for the lower values of e otherwise all the reflection and transmission coefficients converge to a fixed value in both propagating modes for higher e different rigidity e does not contribute to any major difference for reflection and transmission coefficients in interfacial modes it was also observed in table 1 that the change of flexural rigidity does not contribute any major difference in the dispersive roots in interfacial propagation this may be one of the reasons for such behavior of r i m and t i m furthermore the impact of the friction parameter as well as of the flexural rigidity upon the elastic bottom deflection are also plotted against the non dimensional distance in fig 12 a b it can be observed that the elastic bottom attains the lowest amplitude of deflection corresponding to the lowest value of f further ζ attains 0 value at both the edges of the elastic bottom plate which also satisfies the clamped edge conditions moreover a major reduction in the amplitude can be observed clearly for bottom deflection due to the structure deflection for various e maintains the same value which clearly shows that after some value of the elastic rigidity the bottom does not have any impact for such a wave interaction system fig 13 a b presents the shear force on the elastic bottom for different values of the friction and different values of structural length it is revealed that the shear achieves the lowest value near the edge 0 h further the forces exhibit an oscillatory behavior similar to the deflection pattern of the elastic bottom fig 13a shows the variation in the shear force acting on the elastic bottom for different values of the friction f for the interaction of the waves with the structure after x b h the amplitude of the shear force decreases corresponding to an increase in f lower f results in lower s f and the oscillation reduces to the one with increasing x furthermore fig 13b shows that for an increase in b h the width of the porous structure the amplitude of shear force on the elastic bottom decreases this fact can be understood clearly from the argument that a porous structure of larger width can cause greater dissipation of energy which is responsible for lesser shear force acting on the bottom the fact that an increase in the width b h of the porous breakwater gives rise to a greater reflection and dissipation of wave energy as observed in figs 6 a b 9b supports this observation 3 comparison between elastic and rigid bottom comparing our interaction method to a rigid sea bottom seems very interesting because it simplifies the study while keeping the formulation applicable to wave attenuation applications in view of this it would be very useful to equate the rigid sea bed with a stiff elastic sea bottom i e a case of increased stiffness in a similar way of the justification of our schematic model as shown in appendix a comparison of the impermeable bottom with an elastic bottom with increased stiffness can provide a fair validation of the euler bernoulli beam equations concept for the sea bed as those two should converge asymptotically the dispersion relation 2 6 does not directly give our desired dispersion relation for a rigid bottom but 2 7 will give us that for γ 1 see table 7 upon comparing with table 1 it can be observed that as the flexural rigidity increases the roots more or less become the same furthermore the complex root tends to 0 with rising rigidity in table 1 if we obtain the same wave interaction system for an impermeable bottom then the system of equations becomes of order 4 n 8 4 n 8 and the vanishing edge conditions also match due to the impermeability of the bottom the advantage is that by using the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions in both regions and using the similar orthogonality of eigenfunction i 2 n we solve the system it can be seen from the graphs in 14 a b that the reflection and transmission coefficients converge to one for both forms of bottom characteristics elastic and rigid for narrower width structures minor variations can be seen we may conclude that the bottom characteristics correspond to a thin long elastic plate with a very high flexural stiffness and it is more difficult to bend it as a result we come to the realization that the stiff elastic sea bottom behaves asymptotically like a rigid bottom this will provide a fair level of model validity for the bottom fig 15 a demonstrates that the reflection coefficient is generally larger for higher friction coefficients maxima occur at the same initial angle and minima occur at slightly different angles of incidence as f changes similar characteristics of the reflection curve in the free surface mode are observed in fig 5 of losada et al 1993 for incident angle θ for comparing with single layer model we consider ρ 0 99 d h 1 25 and some other parameters as ε 0 45 h a h 0 25 d h 1 which result in similar graphs as can be found in a single layer fluid small difference can be observed due to the density differences in two layers for the small upper layer portion and frequency differences furthermore the dimensionless vertical force coefficient f f is plotted in fig 15 b showing a favorable comparison between the present theory and fig 7 of losada et al 1993 the result demonstrates that an increase of the porosity induces a reduction of the vertical force the characteristics as well as graphs are same here with the one layer case 4 validation validation of such wave interaction system is very much difficult due to the lack of literature in this direction the most straightforward way to establish validation is to compare our results when the bed s thickness as well as elasticity are excluded from the equation when the values of both elastic parameters e and δ are taken as 0 then the bottom configuration can be turned into a rigid one according to chanda and bora 2020a although that depends on the schematic configuration as well as on the physical considerations of the model but a similar procedure is used in this article so that bottom boundary condition can be converted to the one used by behera and sahoo 2014 the complete utility of the model is assessed by comparing two separate cases full wave solution and long wave approximation to form a correct relation by translating our model to that of behera and sahoo 2014 we use e 0 δ 0 to transform the elastic bottom to an impermeable one and also the following parameter values d h a 2 5 m t 8 s g 9 81 m s 2 ε 0 5 f 0 5 fig 16 a b shows the plots of the reflection and transmission coefficients versus k 1 1 b and study of both the works indicate a high level of consensus of behera and sahoo s work behera and sahoo 2014 with the current work this means that the current model is reasonably accurate and can be applied to a variety of coastal and offshore infrastructure issues 5 breakwater with a perforated front wall within the same bathymetry as in fig 1 a perforated front wall is considered at x 0 now combining the potentials ψ j 1 and ψ j 2 into ϕ j for j 1 2 the matching conditions at x 0 yield as in isaacson et al 2000 5 1 ϕ 1 x ε ϕ 2 x for a z d 5 2 ϕ 1 x i k 1 1 g ϕ 1 γ ϕ 2 for a z d with g ε p k 1 1 b p f p i m p as the porous effect parameter where the quantities with the subscript p except for b p denote various parameters associated with the perforated front wall and b p refers to the thickness of the front wall as particular cases g 0 for a solid wall and g when the perforated wall is entirely transparent it is to be noted that although the thickness of the perforated wall is considered as zero when the wave interaction with the whole breakwater is considered the thickness of the wall is taken into account for the flow within the perforated wall the velocity potentials take similar forms like 2 10 2 12 now applying the conditions 5 1 and 5 2 to the potentials and using a similar procedure as carried out earlier the following equations arise 5 3 n i i i 1 n 2 r n q 1 n b n m ε a m b m e i q 2 m l q 2 m a m n 1 2 q 1 n b n m 5 4 n i i i 1 n 2 r n q 1 n k 1 1 g b ˆ n m k 1 1 g γ a m b m e i q 2 m l a m n 1 2 q 1 n k 1 1 g b ˆ n m where b ˆ n m a 0 i 1 n i 2 m d z ρ 0 d i 1 n i 2 m d z now solving the system of equations consisting of eqs 5 3 5 4 2 28 and 2 29 and the clamped edge conditions the required unknown coefficients can be obtained in fig 17 a b the impact of the perforated wall on the reflection and transmission coefficients is examined against the non dimensional structure width it can be observed that due to the presence of the thin perforated wall the reflection and transmission coefficients do not vary much for either of the propagating modes further the impact of waveloads is observed to be the lowest for the porous structure with a perforated wall in general we can clearly observe a major impact of the perforated wall on both waveloads practically it can be assumed that the perforated wall is instrumental in retarding the wave motion due to its inertial resistance associated with the increase in the energy dissipation within the structure as a result it can be concluded that in order to protect the shoreline adding a perforated front wall to a structure will lead to lesser waveloads due to better dissipating properties in this direction in order to construct a porous structure insertion of a perforated front will be more effective 6 conclusion this article attempts to throw light on the interaction of oblique water waves with a porous structure in a two layer fluid flowing over an elastic bottom the linear interface piercing structure is placed on a rigid bottom which follows the elastic bottom additionally the problem is also considered by attaching a perforated front wall to the porous structure the associated scattering problems are solved by utilizing linear water wave theory and eigenfunction expansion method by considering the contribution of complex conjugate wavenumbers the effect of the elastic bottom is also accounted for while finding the potentials thereafter a number of results are obtained and analyzed with respect to various parameters another method known as the linear algebraic approach is adopted to provide an additional mean to support the accuracy of our evaluated results less amount of waveload is observed on the back face of the porous region and less elevation is observed in the water region following the structure due to the wave dissipation by the structure it also allows one to find the optimum width for a suitable structural configuration possessing both reflective and dissipative characteristics in order to attain higher wave reflection and lower transmission for a porous breakwater moderate value of the angle of incidence is helpful choosing the height width and porous parameter of the structure appropriately the following can be achieved i maximum wave reflection and minimum transmission ii maximum dissipation of energy iii minimum elevation in the confined zone moreover the characteristics of the bottom also affect the waveload as well as the reflection and transmission coefficients the shear force and bottom deflection are analyzed for various elastic parameters a suitable agreement in shear force is observed while placing such a structure on the bottom with elastic characteristics when the porous structure is considered with a perforated front wall one can observe the following i the percolative property of the front wall adds more efficiency to the breakwater in producing lower waveload on both faces of the structure compared to the case without any front wall ii no major difference exists with respect to the reflection and transmission coefficients in both cases by matching a current outcome to an available result an excellent consensus is reached confirming the utility of the current model and that the inquiry can go forward to sum it up the study of water wave interaction with such type of structures allows one to clearly understand the effect of the porous structures that can create a tranquility zone it is concluded that the consideration of a porous structure with suitable geometrical configuration along with appropriate characteristics of the bottom is a very important aspect to be taken into account in order to provide safety to the coastal

revision appendix a practical validation of the physical model it is important to visually justify the schematic model before the very crude mathematical model is solved to physically test our schematic model we refer to some works as well as add legitimate reasoning the primary aim of our proposed study is to develop an elastic bottom to replace the conventional flat and rigid bottom a fluid base surface encases the lower surface in our work when it comes to describing soil mechanics there are primarily two kinds of methods continuum approach and modeling approach the soil medium is idealized by winkler 1867 as a series of equal but mutually distinct closely spaced isolated linearly elastic springs based on this principle we choose a thin elastic plate to represent the sea bed the plate s diameter is insignificant in relation to the wavelength of the normal incident waves propagating horizontally as a result structural slenderness is a reasonable expectation the forced hydroelastic oscillations of a circular plate lying on an elastic base were studied by kondratov and his colleagues kondratov et al 2018 to explain the soil pile relationship in the ocean bayat et al 2017 suggested the winkler theory in which the pile was modeled as beam components bee 2013 used beam on elastic base buckling theory to investigate the effect of the sea floor on the buckling load of an undersea pipeline to reflect the sea floor as a simplified elastic support the winkler foundation was selected due to the physical complexities inherent in soil dynamics a more complex elastic base model is not warranted despite its simplicity hetenyi 1946 claimed that the winkler principle could much more reliably reflect the conditions in soil foundations than more complicated models in which the structure is seen as a continuous isotropic elastic body the thin elastic plate principle which has been extensively considered for problems on wave structure ice sheet interface problems can be used for the elastic sea bottom by considering a significant length of the bottom when deciding on the euler bernoulli beam principle the edge conditions are critical the work on a crude model for sea bed modeling may reflect the use of an arbitrary edge condition for example where a slab is lying on a beam and all building components behave independently an unrestrained plate state can be considered it is totally immobile due to the clamped end on one side it maintains an orthogonal relationship with the boundary the edges of the breakwater would be rigid as a scour protection is created on the bed to create the breakwater ensuring the structure s stability wave reflection by a rigid wall in a channel of finite width and depth along with semi infinite duration with elastic bed was studied by mohapatra and soares 2016 and they used the free edge boundary state when using clamped edge conditions the modeling seems to be mechanically meaningful in our situation the clamped edge elastic plate bottom with rigid side walls was used by askari and daneshmand 2010 and zhou and cheung 2001 in the pasternak foundation hasheminejad and mohammadi 2017 considered an elastic bottom plate with clamped edge action the dynamic action of an elastic plate lying on a winkler elastic base and in contact with fluid with certain boundary conditions was studied by ali et al 2014 clamped edge situations can be mechanically feasible when point loads can be modeled at the end of operation only the thin bottom surface has been included in this study the underneath thick section has been left out apart from the above evidence this form of elastic model adoption is prevalent in soil mechanics and ocean wave propagation an abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep ocean floor that is the flattest smoothest and least visited regions on earth if we consider the sea floor structure carefully abyssal plains are important geologic features of oceanic basins and no matter how large they are we can only perceive the sea beds as the bottom zone in terms of ocean engineering huge floating oil storage vessels boats and aircraft for example can resist localized vibrations and large capacity oil containers in the petrochemical industry can survive earthquakes thanks to the free vibration properties of the fluid structure relationship for a homogeneous fluid mohapatra and sahoo 2011 and mohapatra and soares 2016 came to the same conclusion several attempts have been made to study the elastic ocean bed or ice covered sea floor in a two layer fluid by saha and bora 2015 and chanda and bora 2020b 2021 recently khuntia and mohapatra 2020 mohapatra 2017 das and mohapatra 2019 2020 sarangi and mohapatra 2018 sarkar et al 2021 and others have worked on wave interaction issues based on similar bottom characteristics when investigating the impact of porous breakwater on wave interaction our primary focus is on a crude porous model lying on the base if the base is subjected to a partly spread surface loading the springs would not be disturbed outside the loaded field according to the winkler idealization given this constructing a porous system that extends past the filled plate would have little effect on the sea floor when we look at the construction of different marine structures such as traditional rubble mound breakwaters caisson style on rock foundations vertical breakwaters and so on we can see that the base is often designed to be rigid by obstructing the movement of sand ions the foundation configuration prevents erosion of the ground and sea bed on the sea bed a rigid rock foundation namely a caisson foundation can be usually observed bridges piers dams and other buildings that require underwater protection often use caisson foundations the construction loads are carried by the caisson foundations at their lower ends vertical breakwaters for example have a thin stone bedding structure while vertical composite breakwaters have a high rubble foundation to prevent erosion the stone armor between the breakwater base and bed is often solid scour defence must be established before making the choice of any breakwater constructing toe defence in concrete filled jute bags has been observed in practice a sheet of loose or silty sand or mud may also be seen on top of a strong hard bottom assuming this we consider porous region 2 to have an impermeable bottom and the elastic bottom effect is limited to regions 1 and 3 only as a result when studying the ocean bottom surface only we can use the euler bernoulli beam equation to model the elastic base surface as a thin elastic plate lying on such a winkler basis and scientifically acceptable and justified edge conditions appendix b equation in porous medium small amplitude wave motion in three dimensions is considered within an undeformable porous medium it is assumed that the porous structure is homogeneous and isotropic uniform properties of the material in all directions the fluid motion follows the continuity equation and the equation of motion in terms of the seepage fluid velocity u fluid density ρ and dynamic pressure p which are given by b 1 u 0 b 2 u t p ρ resistance forces the resistance forces in eq b 2 are evaluated by combining known steady and unsteady stress relationships under steady state flow conditions the pressure drop through the porous medium is specified by ward 1964 as b 3 p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u where v k is the kinematic viscosity k p is the intrinsic permeability ε is the porosity and c f is a dimensionless turbulent resistance coefficient of the medium it is hypothesized by sollitt and cross 1972 that unsteadiness may be accounted for by introducing an additional term which evaluates the added resistance caused by the virtual mass of discrete grains within the medium the resistance force due to the virtual mass is equal to the product of the displaced fluid mass the virtual mass coefficient and the acceleration in the approach velocity the resulting force is distributed over the fluid mass within the pore so that the force per unit mass of fluid simply becomes b 4 1 ε ε c m u t combining eqs b 3 and b 4 and replacing the resistance force in eq b 2 by them we get b 5 u t p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u 1 ε ε c m u t m u t p ρ v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u where m 1 c m 1 ε ε it is worth mentioning that m 1 accounts for two different cases namely m 1 i e the absence of any structure and c m 0 i e the presence of an inviscid fluid now linearization of eq b 5 is necessary in order to find an analytical solution and hence the dissipative stress term is replaced by a linear stress term in u by the following form b 6 v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u f ω u combination of eqs b 5 and b 6 leads to b 7 m u t p ρ f ω u 0 in order to evaluate f lorentz principle of equivalent work is applied which states that the average rate of energy dissipation should be identical whether evaluated using the true non linear resistance law or its linearized equivalent the porous bed is assumed to be very thin under our consideration and therefore the variation of the pressure across its thickness may be approximated as linear since the resistance terms of the above relation represent friction force per unit mass acting at a point in the flow field the following equality energy dissipation holds b 8 v ε d v t t t f ω u ρ u d t v ε d v t t t v k k p ε u c f k p ε 2 u u ρ u d t where v is the volume of the flow field and t is the wave period now assuming f to be constant throughout the flow field the following expression for f can be written b 9 f 1 ω v d v t t t ε 2 v k u 2 k p c f ε k p ε u 3 d t v d v t t t ε u 2 d t
