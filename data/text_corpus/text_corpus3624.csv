18120,the cause of phytoplankton blooms has been extensively discussed and largely attributed to favorable external conditions such as nitrogen phosphorus resources ph and temperature here from the standpoint of hormesis response we propose that phytoplankton blooms are initiated by stimulatory effects of low concentrations of herbicides as environmental contaminants spread over estuaries and lakes the experimental results revealed general stimulations by herbicides on microcystis aeruginosa and selenastrum capricornutum with the maximum stimulation in the 30 60 range depending on the agent and experiment in parallel with enhancing stimulation the ratio of hp high potential form to lp low potential form of cytochrome b 559 rhl was observed decreasing while intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were observed increasing we propose that the ros originated from the thermodynamic transformation of cytochrome b 559 enhancing the stimulatory response furthermore the results also proved that thermodynamic states of cytochrome b 559 could be modulated by nitric oxide thus affecting cellular equilibrium of oxidative stress os and correspondingly causing the inhibitory effect of higher concentrations of herbicides on phytoplankton this suggests that hormesis substantially derives from equilibrium shifting of os moreover it is reasonable to infer that phytoplankton blooms would be motivated by herbicides or other environmental pollutants this study provides a new thought into global phytoplankton blooms from a contaminant perspective graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal blooms environmental residual herbicides low dose stimulation photoinhibition oxidative stress 1 introduction the hazard of phytoplankton blooms and controlling of them have been crucial issues of freshwater and coastal environment several key factors including nitrogen and phosphorus resources blomqvist et al 1994 smith 1983 xie et al 2003 ph an and jones 2000 and temperature george et al 2015 green and aller 1998 yamamoto and nakahara 2005 have been proposed to account for the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms however these factors were thought to be external conditions that catalyzed the bloom development rather than primary or initial ones causing corresponding control measures to fall short of expectation several studies have now documented the stimulatory effects of low level levels below no observed effect concentrations or environmental residual concentrations environmental contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pentachlorophenol and pesticides on cyanobacteria and algae which were thought to contributed to phytoplankton blooms cedergreen et al 2007 morais et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 zhu et al 2012 this phenomenon is called hormesis a distinctly beneficial effect of low dose toxic substances to organisms hormesis is a dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition calabrese and baldwin 2003 it has been observed in properly designed studies and is broadly generalizable as being independent of chemical physical agent biological model and endpoint measured calabrese and baldwin 2002 calabrese and blain 2011 carere and claudio 2014 however to date mechanisms of hormesis have been elusive due to the complexity that integrates the ranges and intensities of stimulation with testing compounds and with organisms the present hypothetical mechanisms include oxidative stress os overcompensation stimulation receptor mediated mechanisms and signaling mediated mechanisms arumugam et al 2006 calabrese 2013 2015 carere and claudio 2014 the most noteworthy one is the cellular adaptation to os as it has been used to address the stimulatory mechanism of compounds or severe environmental conditions on a variety of types of organisms including human and animal cells plants bacteria and cyanobacteria belz et al 2011 chobot and hadacek 2009 hoffmann et al 2013 ludovico and burhans 2014 luna et al 2014 mittler 2017 ristow and schmeisser 2011 semchyshyn 2014 in particular the differentiation of cells from human mouse and drosophila was enhanced by increasing reactive oxygen species ros whereas lowering cellular ros slowed the rate of differentiation hamanaka et al 2013 juntilla et al 2010 owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 although the cellular adaptation to equilibrium shifting of os is crucial to physiology a widely applicable mechanism of os involving ros and reactive nitrogen species rns for hormesis has not been clarified herbicides a type of pollutants generally detected in soil and aquatic environment are drawing research interests due to their potential hazard to organisms it is especially interesting that sulfonylurea imidazole and organophosphorus herbicides have been demonstrated to favor algal and cyanobacterial proliferation in the laboratory cedergreen 2008 cedergreen et al 2007 which was considered to be a main factor in inducing algae blooms sun et al 2013 some studies attributed stimulative effects of herbicides including organophosphorus and substituted ureas herbicides on algae to phosphorus utilization and reactive oxygen species ros qiu et al 2013 subramanian sampoornam 1994 valiente et al 2012 zhou et al 2004 field observations demonstrated that microcystis wesenbergii bloomed a few days after application of organophosphorus herbicides around the lake for several times li et al 2010 indicating possible connections between algae blooming and the use of herbicides in the present study we investigated the hormesis effects of two widely used herbicides triazine and substituted ureas on green algae and cyanobacteria in an effort to clarify the regulatory role of ros and rns in hormesis effect of herbicides on phytoplankton blooms triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides can inhibit photosynthesis of plants and phytoplankton by blocking electron transfers within photosystem ii psii as detailed in fig 1 electrons produced from oxidation of water molecules are transferred from primary electron donor p680 to a primary electron acceptor pheophytin pheo after which a plastoquinone qa accepts electrons and then transfers them to a second plastoquinone qb proceeding with normal photosynthesis broser et al 2011 hankamer et al 2001 triazine and substituted ureas herbicides can depress the electron transfer from qa to qb thus causing photosynthesis inhibition and acceptor side photoinhibition asp broser et al 2011 pospisil et al 2006 asp is characterized as the degradation of the d1 polypeptide by highly reactive singlet o2 formed allakhverdiev carpentier 1997 durrant et al 1990 miyao et al 1995 cytochrome b 559 cyt b 559 an integral part of the psii reaction center that possesses a spectrum of midpoint redox potentials high potential form of cyt b 559 hp cyt b 559 and low potential form of cyt b 559 lp cyt b 559 et al can alleviate photoinhibition through electron donation and acceptation within psii pospíšil 2011 pospisil et al 2006 pospíšil and tiwari 2010 stewart and brudvig 1998 numerous studies have addressed that cyt b 559 can exchange electrons with inherent p680 pheo and qa davis and tai 1986 roncel et al 2001 accompanied by oxygen reduction pospíšil 2011 pospíšil and tiwari 2010 and superoxide generation causing oxidation or reduction of heme iron within cyt b 559 barber and de 1993 buser et al 1992 mor et al 1997 ortega et al 1989 sinha et al 2010 in this sense cyt b 559 serves to protect psii from photoinhibition and creates extra ros simultaneously as mentioned before equilibrium shifting of os involving ros generates direct impacts on physiological processes of cells it is therefore necessary to investigate the vital roles of cyt b 559 in hormesis produced by herbicides and corresponding os equilibrium shifting for further understanding of hormesis moreover cyt b 559 could also be modulated by nitric oxide no shi et al 2011 a widely existed signal molecule that was reported to affect the structure and functions of cty b559 mello et al 2012 taken together the objective of the present work is to clarify the stimulatory mechanism underlying phytoplankton blooms by the following steps 1 to verify the hormesis effects of herbicides on phytoplankton 2 to determine the content of cyt b 559 in different thermodynamic states and the level of intracellular ros and no under the effect of herbicides 3 to clarify the regulatory process of cyt b 559 with regards to ros and no and reveal an underlying mechanism of hormesis in this system 4 to propose a new possible cause for phytoplankton blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the test compounds were triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides seven species in total which were purchased from sigma aldrich co llc shanghai china the detailed information is listed in table 1 cyanophyta microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa and chlorophyta selenastrum capricornutum s capricornutum were obtained from institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china and underwent experiments the microalgae were cultured at 22 c bg 11 culture medium under a light intensity of 2500 lux with 12 h bright 12 h dark ros assay kit and no fluorescent probes were purchased from beyotime institute of biotechnology haimen china 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 toxicity tests on triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides to m aeruginosa and s capricornutum at 96 h m aeruginosa and s capricornutum were cultured to exponential phase and added respectively into sterile 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing standard bg 11 culture medium and different doses of herbicides ensuring the concentrations of cells were 2 0 105 cells ml and total volumes were 30 ml a wide range of herbicide doses was set by equal space between logarithm covering residual concentration detected in the aquatic environment so as to determine proliferating responses to a real word concentrations of herbicides and the scales and intensities of hormesis for example herbicide concentrations detected were from 3 3 10 9 to 2 0 10 8 mol l for diuron in rivers in some countries caquet et al 2013 kaonga et al 2015 we set a wider range from 5 00 10 10 to 5 00 10 7 mol l in the experiments to cover detected concentrations control groups containing no herbicides were set all the strains were cultured for 96 h at 22 c under a light intensity of 2500 lux with 12 h bright 12 h dark and shaking twice a day followed by the determination of cell densities based on previous researches duan et al 2018 reynolds 2007 and microscopic examinations long term culturing made m aeruginosa and s capricornutum to be unicellular throughout the experiments hence flow cytometry bd accuri c6 usa was employed to determine cell densities 200 μl cell solution was collected from each flask experimental groups and control groups included and filtered by 200 mesh sieves followed by the assessment of cell densities by flow cytometry assessment methods can be seen in supplementary fig 1 all the tests were conducted in triplicates the inhibitory rate eq 1 was used to represent the toxic effects of herbicides on algae 1 i i 1 s i s 0 100 where i i is the inhibitory rate of herbicides in the concentration of i on algae s i is algal density after culturing under herbicides in the concentration of i for 96 h and s 0 is the algal density of control group the dose response relationship between herbicides and algae can be plotted according to herbicide concentration and corresponding inhibitory rate 2 2 2 measurement of different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 the preparation of thylakoid membranes and isolation of psii membrane fragments from m aeruginosa and s capricornutum were performed as described in berthold et al 1981 robinson et al 1980 tang et al 1994 the psii membranes were suspended in 1 0 m tris ph 9 1 and incubated in light at 10 c for 2 h after which the pellets were suspended by 3 ml solution a 10 mm mes ph 6 5 0 4 m sucrose 4 mm mgcl2 and 10 mm nacl and stored at 80 c different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 were calculated by reduced minus oxidized difference in absorbance spectra at 559 nm on a multiskan go spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific finland according to the methods described in gadjieva et al 1999 2 mm potassium ferricyanide and 8 mm hydroquinone em 280 mv were sequentially added to the cuvette to achieve the reduction of cyt b 559 and the two absorbance values were obtained a0 and a1 after each addition next 5 mm sodium ascorbate em 60 mv was added to reduce ip and lp forms absorbance a2 followed by 10 mm sodium dithionite to reduce cyt b 559 quantitatively absorbance a3 the total amount of cyt b 559 was obtained from a3 minus a0 the amount of hp form was obtained by a1 minus a0 and lp form was calculated by a2 minus hp forms namely a 2 a 1 a 0 2 2 3 measurement of intracellular ros intracellular ros were detected with 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da beyotime according to the manufacturers manual first 1 5 ml algal solution was centrifuged at 5000 g 4 c for 5 min the cell deposit was suspended by 200 μl dcfh da probes 10 μmol l and incubated at 25 c for 20 min after washing off the residual probes the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm the inspected algal number was fixed at 104 cells we used relative fluorescence intensity rfi to represent ros content of experimental groups relative to the control group eq 2 2 rfi i fi i fi o 100 where rfii is relative fluorescence intensity of groups under the effect of herbicides in the concentration of i group i fii is the geometric mean fluorescence of group i fi0 is geometric mean fluorescence of the control group 2 2 4 measurement of intracellular no the intracellular no was measured by daf fm da probes cells that had undergone centrifugation were suspended by 200 μldaf fm da probes 5 μmol l and incubated at 25 c for 20 min after loading the probes the cells were washed by pbs buffer and measured by flow cytometry with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm the inspected algal number was fixed at 104 cells similarly rfi eq 2 was used to demonstrate the relative content of intracellular no 2 2 5 the effect of exogenous no on the transformation of different forms of cyt b 559 no gas was bubbled into psii membrane solution suspended in solution a extracted from normal m aeruginosa after which different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 was measured and the relationship between the ratio of hp cyt b 559 to lp cyt b 559 rhl and bubbling duration was obtained fig 3 a fluorescence standard curve of no standard samples was obtained by using total nitric oxide assay kit according to the manufacturers manual fig 3b no gas 99 99 1 0 ml s was bubbled into 3 0 ml solution a with different bubbling duration after which the fluorescence was measured by the same methods combining with fluorescence standard curve of no standard samples the relationship between no concentration and bubbling duration was acquired fig 3c 2 2 6 raman spectroscopy raman spectra of cyt b 559 were obtained by a confocal raman microscope with a ccd detector labram system dilor lille france using a 782 nm excitation line from a helium neon laser the samples were placed into capillary tubes and examined with an exposure time of 40 s the laser power was maintained at 10 mw at samples spectra were recorded between 1700 and 1200 cm 1 at a resolution of 2 0 cm 1 2 2 7 statistical analyses statistics and analysis were conducted using origin 9 software linear regression and one way anova followed by tukey multiple comparison tests were performed if necessary error bars represent sem and p values are indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 results 3 1 the effect of triazine and substituted ureas herbicides on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum at 96 h in the present study the effect of seven herbicides on cyanobacteria m aeruginosa and on green algae s capricornutum at 96 h were evaluated the dose response relationship of monuron on m aeruginosa and on s capricornutum are shown in fig 2a 1 and fig 2a 2 respectively other results detailed in supplementary fig 2 and supplementary fig 3 in which the fitted curves were plotted by previous methods deng et al 2012 generally herbicides generates low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition on the proliferation of m aeruginosa and s capricornutum illustrating with fig 2a 1 with the concentration lg c m clg for short of monuron increases from 8 56 to 7 55 the stimulation ratio rises from 3 31 to 29 57 but a further increase in monuron results in weakening stimulation followed by enhancing inhibition with maximum inhibition up to 75 10 that is to say monuron generates marked hormesis effect on m aeruginosa and on s capricornutum other test results showed hormesis effects supplementary fig 2 and 3 without exception among which the maximum stimulation reached up to 51 72 the effect of fenuron on m aeruginosa it is worth noticing that stimulatory concentrations of herbicides are generally close to environment concentrations guzzella et al 2006 sousa et al 2016 for example residual concentration clg for diuron in kerdavid and billiers river in france was 8 85 to 8 48 caquet et al 2013 which covered the maximum stimulatory dose 8 74 clg in the present study as illustrated in supplementary fig 2 in particular stimulatory concentration ranges of triazine herbicides for instance 9 38 to 7 66 clg for simetryn in supplementary fig 2 are in good agreement with those detected in lake taihu na et al 2006 where triazine herbicides were 10 01 to 8 54 clg and dense cyanobacterial blooms formed regularly in summer 3 2 the relative content of hp cty b559 and lp cyt b 559 since the mechanism of tested herbicides is to block electron transfer causing photoinhibition in psii broser et al 2011 we measured different thermodynamic forms cyt b 559 that was reported to relieve photoinhibition barber and de 1993 nedbal et al 1992 tiwari and pospíšil 2009 the effect of monuron on the ratio of hp high potential form to lp low potential form of cyt b 559 rhl in m aeruginosa and s capricornutum are shown in fig 2b 1 and fig 2b 2 green lines respectively other results are detailed in supplementary fig 4 and supplementary fig 5 on the whole rhl first decreased and then rose with concentration take fig 2b 1 for example when exposed to the lowest concentration of monuron clg 8 56 hp form of cyt b 559 dominates compared with lp form with rhl of 1 98 a value close to control group green dotted line which was consistent with previous researches guerrero et al 2014 ortega et al 2010 with the concentration of monuron increasing to 7 55 clg rhl drops to 0 40 but the further rise in monuron leads to a recovery of rhl to 2 33 clg 5 04 it is noteworthy that the drop in rhl is closely accompanied by the enhancing stimulation on proliferation whereas the recovery of rhl coincides with substantial inhibition 3 3 the content of intracellular ros when participating in the cyclic electron transfer to protect psii from photoinhibition cyt b 559 was proposed to generate ros including o2 and h2o2 barber and de 1993 pospíšil 2011 pospisil et al 2006 therefore we measured the content of intercellular ros in the presence of different concentrations of herbicides fig 2c 1 and fig 2c 2 display the impacts of monuron on relative fluorescence intensity rfi of m aeruginosa samples and of s capricornutum samples respectively red lines and other results are detailed in supplementary fig 6 and fig 7 in all cases rfi first rose to some extent above the control red dotted lines represent control groups and then gradually fell below the control as can be seen from fig 2c 1 with the rise in the concentration of monuron to 7 55 clg rfi increases from 103 09 to 165 59 after which rfi declines down to 59 78 with the concentration of monuron it is evident that the expansion of ros is in parallel with the stimulatory effect on proliferation whereas the fall in ros is in parallel with enhancing the inhibitory response 3 4 the content of intracellular no several lines of evidence have addressed the stimulatory effect of no on plants beligni and lamattina 2000 kopyra and gwóźdź 2003 and a variety of signal transfer processes involving antioxidation a h mackerness et al 2001 wink et al 1993 the contents of intracellular no were measured in the present study the rfi obtained are shown in fig 2d 1 m aeruginosa samples and fig 2d 2 s capricornutum samples other results are detailed in supplementary fig 8 and supplementary fig 9 generally rfi showed a downtrend with herbicide concentration in figs 2d 1 for example rfi declines moderately from 8 56 to 7 30 clg followed by a marked drop down to 57 24 indicating that intercellular no content was going downward with increasing concentration of herbicides in particular the decline of no mainly reflected in inhibitory stage clg 7 30 mirroring the correlation between intracellular no and inhibition on proliferation 3 5 the effect of exogenous no on rhl of cyt b 559 the effect of no on the thermodynamic transformation of cyt b 559 was determined for further understanding of antioxidation since cyt b 559 is a conservative compound closely associated with psii in all oxygenic photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria experiments were only performed on cyt b 559 isolated form one of the two taxa m aeruginosa as described in section 2 2 5 as demonstrated in fig 3a one way anova analysis reveals that rhl increases significantly within the first 10 s of bubbling time and keeps stable later indicating that cyt b 559 underwent a continuous transformation from lp form to hp form with exogenous no addition within the first 10 s next no concentration in the sample was measured when rhl first achieved the highest point 10 s according to fig 3c no concentration is about 7 73 10 6 mol l after 10 s bubbling of no gas in other words as low as 7 73 10 6 mol l no solution can maximize the transformation of cyt b 559 from lp form to hp form to investigate conformational changes of cyt b 559 caused by no raman shift of cyt b 559 was obtained by raman spectroscopy as described in methods before and after 10 s bubbling of no gas into psii membranes suspended solution the results are shown in fig 3d the band at 1450 cm 1 assigned to bending vibration of ch2 appears in the spectra of the sample untreated with no gas and decreases in the sample treated with no gas indicating the changes in the conformation of cyt b 559 the amide i bands located at α helix at 1652 cm 1 bandekar and krimm 1980 decrease after treating with no gas and the band at 1281 cm 1 assigned to amide iii at α helix also markedly decreases and shifts to 1283 cm 1 the changes in amide i and amide iii demonstrate the reduction of α helix in subunits of cyt b 559 under the influence of no gas as the histidine residue his is located in α helix fig 3e it is inferred that the reduction of α helix leads to orientational changes of the histidine imidazole ring which causes the transformation of cyt b 559 from lp form to hp form babcock et al 1985 moreover the decrease in and shift to 1657 cm 1 of band at 1655 cm 1 were said to reflect the changes of stretching vibration of co on the peptides holt and cotton 1989 which may suggest the formation of hydrogen bond between the imidazole group of his and the α subunit fig 3e a typical characteristic of hp form of cyt b 559 berthomieu et al 1992 roncel et al 2001 as co is a potential hydrogen bond acceptor valentine et al 1979 4 discussion the experimental results demonstrate that triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides show striking hormesis effects on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum which are in agreement with previous observations cedergreen 2008 cedergreen et al 2007 valiente et al 2012 for convenience the phases in which herbicides produce increasing stimulation on algae and cyanobacteria are named stage i and that in which the stimulation decreases followed by gradual enhancement of inhibition are named stage ii for instance stage i of the effect of monuron to m aeruginosa is the phase of concentration clg between 8 56 and 7 55 and stage ii is that of concentration clg between 7 55 and 5 04 as marked in fig 2a 1 4 1 the rising level of ros derived from the reduction of lp cyt b 559 substantially causes the stimulation in stage i we investigated the role of cyt b 559 might play in stimulatory response produced by herbicides in stage i the results demonstrate a decline of rhl in stage i fig 2b 1 and 2b 2 namely an increase in the amount of lp and a decrease in hp form of cyt b 559 simultaneously this suggests that increasing concentration of herbicides can cause the transformation of cyt b 559 from hp to lp a similar process occurred under certain negative conditions iwasaki et al 1995 styring et al 1990 eq 3 since lp cyt b 559 is capable of accepting electrons from acceptor sides matsuda and butler 1983 mizusawa et al 1997 on grounds of its sole oxidized state of heme iron fe 3 there is a strong possibility that this transformation from hp to lp is a self regulated activity to alleviate asp by formed lp cyt b 559 alleviating asp was achieved by accepting overloaded electrons from pheo or qa the more likely electron donor is pheo barber and de 1993 poulson et al 1995 in view of its stronger reducibility em 610 mv ph 7 and closer edge to edge distance from cyt b 559 guskov et al 2009 pospíšil 2011 compared with qa after accepting an electron from pheo lp cyt b 559 fe3 converts to lp cyt b 559 fe2 eq 4 3 hp cyt b 559 fe 2 asp lp cyt b 559 fe 3 4 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 pheo lp cyt b 559 fe 2 pheo in parallel with the transformation a moderate rise in intracellular ros was observed fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 in stage i indicating a likely correlation between ros production and functioning of cyt b 559 in alleviating asp it was predicted that the generation of ros correlated with re oxidation of lp cyt b 559 fe2 eq 5 pospíšil 2009 2011 pospisil et al 2006 we propose that this process is the primary cause of the rise in intracellular ros in stage i 5 lp cyt b 559 fe 2 o 2 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 o 2 taken together we hypothesize that to alleviate asp caused by herbicides hp cyt b 559 fe2 transforms into lp cyt b 559 fe3 in some way eq 3 lp cyt b 559 fe3 generated accepts electrons from pheo and lp cyt b 559 fe2 is formed eq 4 which is followed closely by the production of ros and restoration of lp cyt b 559 fe3 eq 5 from an overall perspective overloaded electrons within psii caused by herbicides is transferred to molecular oxygen to form ros by means of the protective mechanism of cyt b 559 as illustrated by green arrowed lines in fig 4 a the vital function of ros as well as os caused by them is of significance concerning signal transmission aging and cell death traditionally ros were thought to be toxic to aerobic metabolism which damage dna protein and nucleic acid that is why most organisms have formed a spectrum of ros scavenging mechanisms nevertheless recent studies revealed that ros are necessary for the progression of several basic biological processes mittler 2017 one example is that hormone abscisic acid aba led to the closure of stomata of plant guard cells in a dry environment by elevating ros level but if ros production was suppressed aba induced closure of stomata was inhibited song et al 2014 ros have been extensively reported to regulate development differentiation stress signaling and lifespan heidler et al 2010 lauri et al 2014 mignolet spruyt et al 2016 mittler et al 2004 2011 more importantly a volume of research has confirmed that a moderate rise in ros resulted in the progress of plant growth and beneficial gene expressions as well as an extension of cells lifespan ludovico and burhans 2014 semchyshyn 2014 for example yokoo et al revealed that 20 μm and 60 μm achieved the cellular longevity up to 160 and 120 of population doubling levels respectively and suggested that this might be achieved by the slowdown of age dependent shortening of telomeric dna yokoo et al 2004 the present study is in good agreement with these observations as indicated in fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 when intracellular ros gradually increase to some extent the stimulatory effect on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum is enhanced almost simultaneously therefore we propose that a moderate increase in intracellular ros substantially accounts for the stimulatory effect 4 2 the decrease in ros modulated by no causes the inhibitory effects in stage ii this section aims to address the inhibitory response in stage ii as shown in fig 2a 1 and 2a 2 with further increases in herbicide concentration stimulatory effects weaken followed by enhancing inhibition up to above 80 at the same time data show a marked rise in rhl fig 2b 1 and 2b 2 and decline in intracellular ros down to below control groups fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 in stage ii indicating once again the potential correlation between the effects on proliferation the thermodynamic transformation of cyt b 559 and intracellular ros level as discussed previously it was hypothesized that stimulatory response in stage i primarily stemmed from the transformation of cyt b 559 from hp form to lp form however lp form retransferred to hp form in stage ii a process which we suggest modulated by no eq 6 as discussed in results 6 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 no hp cyt b 559 fe 3 hp form of cyt b 559 possesses strong oxidation ability with midpoint redox potential ranging from 310 to 400 mv ph 7 presumably oxidizing o2 into o2 eq 7 as the midpoint potential of o2 o2 is 160 mv ph 7 pospíšil 2011 consequently intracellular ros decreased in stage ii in this sense no acted as ros scavenger by regulating the conversion of cyt b 559 a mechanism can be illustrated by red arrowed lines in fig 4a 7 hp cyt b 559 fe 3 o 2 hp cyt b 559 fe 2 o 2 it is necessary to emphasize that the basal level of intercellular ros is vital to maintaining normal function heidler et al 2010 lauri et al 2014 mignolet spruyt et al 2016 mittler et al 2004 2011 pei et al 2000 and that numerous studies have addressed the negative effect of decreasing ros a phillip et al 2011 diebold and chandel 2016 manish et al 2014 schieber and chandel 2014 in particular juntilla and owusu ansah demonstrated that reduction in intracellular ros resulted in suppressive effects on differentiation juntilla et al 2010 owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 while the differentiation process was restored after adding exogenous ros h2o2 hamanaka et al 2013 in the present study as intracellular ros gradually declines below the control group the inhibition enhances considerably figs 2c 1 and 2c 2 we hypothesize that inhibition on proliferation is ascribed to cell dysfunction originated from the cascade reaction of decreasing ros 4 3 hormesis substantially derives from equilibrium shifting of os as discussed above we propose that the stimulatory effects on proliferation stem from a certain rising in ros while strong inhibition is ascribed to the decline of intracellular ros in other words hormesis is a consequence of an equilibrium shifting of oxidative stress the left hand panel of fig 4b data from mittler 2017 illustrates the relationship between cellular progress and intracellular ros level excessively low levels of ros cannot sustain normal signal transfer schieber and chandel 2014 tormos et al 2011 causing depression on the cellular processes left yellow part of the curve increasing and maintaining a basal level of ros is necessary for the functioning of cells furthermore a moderate increase in ros above basal level as discussed previously can activate beneficial signal pathways to accelerate cellular processes including proliferation and cellular longevity et al ludovico and burhans 2014 semchyshyn 2014 yokoo et al 2004 middle green part of the curve with further increasing of ros a threshold is reached above which ros becomes maladaptive and induces unmanageable oxidative stress reactions that damage macromolecule and cellular structure hekimilapointe wen 2011 right yellow part of the curve the right hand panel of fig 4b illustrates the effects of herbicides on the proliferation of cyanobacterial cells and on intracellular ros level simplified from fig 2c 1 low concentration of herbicides can cause ros to increase but not to reach the toxic level so as to accelerate the cellular processes including stimulating proliferation a case similar to some cancer cells poillet perez et al 2015 the high concentration of herbicides results in a drop in ros and simultaneous inhibition on proliferation compared with control in respect that excessively low levels of ros exert negative effects on the cellular processes to sum up we propose that it is the redox traits of cyt b 559 that regulate hormesis effects of herbicides on cyanobacteria fundamentally the immediate cause for hormesis is cellular equilibrium shifting of os 4 4 low level environmental contaminants are proposed to be the underlying cause of phytoplankton blooms we had intended to explore the evidence supporting the advantages of cyanobacteria in initial bloom formation over algae from the aspect of hormesis however the scales and intensities of stimulatory responses of herbicides were virtually the same for m aeruginosa and s capricornutum indicating low level of herbicides could cause not only cyanobacterial blooms but green algal blooms further relative indexes including transformations of cyt b 559 levels of no and ros showed marginal differences between the two taxa inferring that they might possess similar response mechanisms with regards to hormesis this assertion can be supported by the conservation in structure and essential function of cyt b 559 in cyanobacteria and algae roncel et al 2001 pospíšil 2011 we propose that once triazine and substituted ureas herbicides were introduced cyt b 559 in cyanobacteria and algae relieved photoinhibition by thermodynamic transformations resulting in double edged responses regarding herbicide doses which played a vital role in phytoplankton blooms forming apart from triazine and substituted ureas herbicides other environmental contaminants and subsequent degradation products were also observed to stimulate phytoplankton growth for instance pentachlorophenol and a glyphosate pesticide were found to stimulate the growth of m aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations but inhibit cell growth at high concentrations morais et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 the production and release of microcystins as well as cell growth of m aeruginosa were observed rising after the introduction of amoxicillin at environmentally relevant concentrations liu et al 2012 in this sense there is a strong possibility that low level anthropogenic pollutants that are generally overlooked in traditional environmental evaluation have profound impacts on algal blooms and aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions seven triazine and substituted ureas herbicides exhibited hormesis effects on microcystis aeruginosa and selenastrum capricornutum among which the stimulatory concentration ranges of herbicides generally coincided with those detected in natural waters it is inferred that herbicides residual in water environment are like to be a contributory factor to phytoplankton blooms there is a need for consideration about low dose environment contaminants in terms of their environmental risks moreover we proposed that the stimulatory response of algae derived from the moderate expansion of intracellular ros a byproduct of cytochrome b 559 in alleviating photoinhibition caused by herbicides the present study also discussed the dual

18120,the cause of phytoplankton blooms has been extensively discussed and largely attributed to favorable external conditions such as nitrogen phosphorus resources ph and temperature here from the standpoint of hormesis response we propose that phytoplankton blooms are initiated by stimulatory effects of low concentrations of herbicides as environmental contaminants spread over estuaries and lakes the experimental results revealed general stimulations by herbicides on microcystis aeruginosa and selenastrum capricornutum with the maximum stimulation in the 30 60 range depending on the agent and experiment in parallel with enhancing stimulation the ratio of hp high potential form to lp low potential form of cytochrome b 559 rhl was observed decreasing while intracellular reactive oxygen species ros were observed increasing we propose that the ros originated from the thermodynamic transformation of cytochrome b 559 enhancing the stimulatory response furthermore the results also proved that thermodynamic states of cytochrome b 559 could be modulated by nitric oxide thus affecting cellular equilibrium of oxidative stress os and correspondingly causing the inhibitory effect of higher concentrations of herbicides on phytoplankton this suggests that hormesis substantially derives from equilibrium shifting of os moreover it is reasonable to infer that phytoplankton blooms would be motivated by herbicides or other environmental pollutants this study provides a new thought into global phytoplankton blooms from a contaminant perspective graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal blooms environmental residual herbicides low dose stimulation photoinhibition oxidative stress 1 introduction the hazard of phytoplankton blooms and controlling of them have been crucial issues of freshwater and coastal environment several key factors including nitrogen and phosphorus resources blomqvist et al 1994 smith 1983 xie et al 2003 ph an and jones 2000 and temperature george et al 2015 green and aller 1998 yamamoto and nakahara 2005 have been proposed to account for the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms however these factors were thought to be external conditions that catalyzed the bloom development rather than primary or initial ones causing corresponding control measures to fall short of expectation several studies have now documented the stimulatory effects of low level levels below no observed effect concentrations or environmental residual concentrations environmental contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pentachlorophenol and pesticides on cyanobacteria and algae which were thought to contributed to phytoplankton blooms cedergreen et al 2007 morais et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 zhu et al 2012 this phenomenon is called hormesis a distinctly beneficial effect of low dose toxic substances to organisms hormesis is a dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition calabrese and baldwin 2003 it has been observed in properly designed studies and is broadly generalizable as being independent of chemical physical agent biological model and endpoint measured calabrese and baldwin 2002 calabrese and blain 2011 carere and claudio 2014 however to date mechanisms of hormesis have been elusive due to the complexity that integrates the ranges and intensities of stimulation with testing compounds and with organisms the present hypothetical mechanisms include oxidative stress os overcompensation stimulation receptor mediated mechanisms and signaling mediated mechanisms arumugam et al 2006 calabrese 2013 2015 carere and claudio 2014 the most noteworthy one is the cellular adaptation to os as it has been used to address the stimulatory mechanism of compounds or severe environmental conditions on a variety of types of organisms including human and animal cells plants bacteria and cyanobacteria belz et al 2011 chobot and hadacek 2009 hoffmann et al 2013 ludovico and burhans 2014 luna et al 2014 mittler 2017 ristow and schmeisser 2011 semchyshyn 2014 in particular the differentiation of cells from human mouse and drosophila was enhanced by increasing reactive oxygen species ros whereas lowering cellular ros slowed the rate of differentiation hamanaka et al 2013 juntilla et al 2010 owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 although the cellular adaptation to equilibrium shifting of os is crucial to physiology a widely applicable mechanism of os involving ros and reactive nitrogen species rns for hormesis has not been clarified herbicides a type of pollutants generally detected in soil and aquatic environment are drawing research interests due to their potential hazard to organisms it is especially interesting that sulfonylurea imidazole and organophosphorus herbicides have been demonstrated to favor algal and cyanobacterial proliferation in the laboratory cedergreen 2008 cedergreen et al 2007 which was considered to be a main factor in inducing algae blooms sun et al 2013 some studies attributed stimulative effects of herbicides including organophosphorus and substituted ureas herbicides on algae to phosphorus utilization and reactive oxygen species ros qiu et al 2013 subramanian sampoornam 1994 valiente et al 2012 zhou et al 2004 field observations demonstrated that microcystis wesenbergii bloomed a few days after application of organophosphorus herbicides around the lake for several times li et al 2010 indicating possible connections between algae blooming and the use of herbicides in the present study we investigated the hormesis effects of two widely used herbicides triazine and substituted ureas on green algae and cyanobacteria in an effort to clarify the regulatory role of ros and rns in hormesis effect of herbicides on phytoplankton blooms triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides can inhibit photosynthesis of plants and phytoplankton by blocking electron transfers within photosystem ii psii as detailed in fig 1 electrons produced from oxidation of water molecules are transferred from primary electron donor p680 to a primary electron acceptor pheophytin pheo after which a plastoquinone qa accepts electrons and then transfers them to a second plastoquinone qb proceeding with normal photosynthesis broser et al 2011 hankamer et al 2001 triazine and substituted ureas herbicides can depress the electron transfer from qa to qb thus causing photosynthesis inhibition and acceptor side photoinhibition asp broser et al 2011 pospisil et al 2006 asp is characterized as the degradation of the d1 polypeptide by highly reactive singlet o2 formed allakhverdiev carpentier 1997 durrant et al 1990 miyao et al 1995 cytochrome b 559 cyt b 559 an integral part of the psii reaction center that possesses a spectrum of midpoint redox potentials high potential form of cyt b 559 hp cyt b 559 and low potential form of cyt b 559 lp cyt b 559 et al can alleviate photoinhibition through electron donation and acceptation within psii pospíšil 2011 pospisil et al 2006 pospíšil and tiwari 2010 stewart and brudvig 1998 numerous studies have addressed that cyt b 559 can exchange electrons with inherent p680 pheo and qa davis and tai 1986 roncel et al 2001 accompanied by oxygen reduction pospíšil 2011 pospíšil and tiwari 2010 and superoxide generation causing oxidation or reduction of heme iron within cyt b 559 barber and de 1993 buser et al 1992 mor et al 1997 ortega et al 1989 sinha et al 2010 in this sense cyt b 559 serves to protect psii from photoinhibition and creates extra ros simultaneously as mentioned before equilibrium shifting of os involving ros generates direct impacts on physiological processes of cells it is therefore necessary to investigate the vital roles of cyt b 559 in hormesis produced by herbicides and corresponding os equilibrium shifting for further understanding of hormesis moreover cyt b 559 could also be modulated by nitric oxide no shi et al 2011 a widely existed signal molecule that was reported to affect the structure and functions of cty b559 mello et al 2012 taken together the objective of the present work is to clarify the stimulatory mechanism underlying phytoplankton blooms by the following steps 1 to verify the hormesis effects of herbicides on phytoplankton 2 to determine the content of cyt b 559 in different thermodynamic states and the level of intracellular ros and no under the effect of herbicides 3 to clarify the regulatory process of cyt b 559 with regards to ros and no and reveal an underlying mechanism of hormesis in this system 4 to propose a new possible cause for phytoplankton blooms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the test compounds were triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides seven species in total which were purchased from sigma aldrich co llc shanghai china the detailed information is listed in table 1 cyanophyta microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa and chlorophyta selenastrum capricornutum s capricornutum were obtained from institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china and underwent experiments the microalgae were cultured at 22 c bg 11 culture medium under a light intensity of 2500 lux with 12 h bright 12 h dark ros assay kit and no fluorescent probes were purchased from beyotime institute of biotechnology haimen china 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 toxicity tests on triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides to m aeruginosa and s capricornutum at 96 h m aeruginosa and s capricornutum were cultured to exponential phase and added respectively into sterile 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing standard bg 11 culture medium and different doses of herbicides ensuring the concentrations of cells were 2 0 105 cells ml and total volumes were 30 ml a wide range of herbicide doses was set by equal space between logarithm covering residual concentration detected in the aquatic environment so as to determine proliferating responses to a real word concentrations of herbicides and the scales and intensities of hormesis for example herbicide concentrations detected were from 3 3 10 9 to 2 0 10 8 mol l for diuron in rivers in some countries caquet et al 2013 kaonga et al 2015 we set a wider range from 5 00 10 10 to 5 00 10 7 mol l in the experiments to cover detected concentrations control groups containing no herbicides were set all the strains were cultured for 96 h at 22 c under a light intensity of 2500 lux with 12 h bright 12 h dark and shaking twice a day followed by the determination of cell densities based on previous researches duan et al 2018 reynolds 2007 and microscopic examinations long term culturing made m aeruginosa and s capricornutum to be unicellular throughout the experiments hence flow cytometry bd accuri c6 usa was employed to determine cell densities 200 μl cell solution was collected from each flask experimental groups and control groups included and filtered by 200 mesh sieves followed by the assessment of cell densities by flow cytometry assessment methods can be seen in supplementary fig 1 all the tests were conducted in triplicates the inhibitory rate eq 1 was used to represent the toxic effects of herbicides on algae 1 i i 1 s i s 0 100 where i i is the inhibitory rate of herbicides in the concentration of i on algae s i is algal density after culturing under herbicides in the concentration of i for 96 h and s 0 is the algal density of control group the dose response relationship between herbicides and algae can be plotted according to herbicide concentration and corresponding inhibitory rate 2 2 2 measurement of different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 the preparation of thylakoid membranes and isolation of psii membrane fragments from m aeruginosa and s capricornutum were performed as described in berthold et al 1981 robinson et al 1980 tang et al 1994 the psii membranes were suspended in 1 0 m tris ph 9 1 and incubated in light at 10 c for 2 h after which the pellets were suspended by 3 ml solution a 10 mm mes ph 6 5 0 4 m sucrose 4 mm mgcl2 and 10 mm nacl and stored at 80 c different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 were calculated by reduced minus oxidized difference in absorbance spectra at 559 nm on a multiskan go spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific finland according to the methods described in gadjieva et al 1999 2 mm potassium ferricyanide and 8 mm hydroquinone em 280 mv were sequentially added to the cuvette to achieve the reduction of cyt b 559 and the two absorbance values were obtained a0 and a1 after each addition next 5 mm sodium ascorbate em 60 mv was added to reduce ip and lp forms absorbance a2 followed by 10 mm sodium dithionite to reduce cyt b 559 quantitatively absorbance a3 the total amount of cyt b 559 was obtained from a3 minus a0 the amount of hp form was obtained by a1 minus a0 and lp form was calculated by a2 minus hp forms namely a 2 a 1 a 0 2 2 3 measurement of intracellular ros intracellular ros were detected with 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da beyotime according to the manufacturers manual first 1 5 ml algal solution was centrifuged at 5000 g 4 c for 5 min the cell deposit was suspended by 200 μl dcfh da probes 10 μmol l and incubated at 25 c for 20 min after washing off the residual probes the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm the inspected algal number was fixed at 104 cells we used relative fluorescence intensity rfi to represent ros content of experimental groups relative to the control group eq 2 2 rfi i fi i fi o 100 where rfii is relative fluorescence intensity of groups under the effect of herbicides in the concentration of i group i fii is the geometric mean fluorescence of group i fi0 is geometric mean fluorescence of the control group 2 2 4 measurement of intracellular no the intracellular no was measured by daf fm da probes cells that had undergone centrifugation were suspended by 200 μldaf fm da probes 5 μmol l and incubated at 25 c for 20 min after loading the probes the cells were washed by pbs buffer and measured by flow cytometry with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm the inspected algal number was fixed at 104 cells similarly rfi eq 2 was used to demonstrate the relative content of intracellular no 2 2 5 the effect of exogenous no on the transformation of different forms of cyt b 559 no gas was bubbled into psii membrane solution suspended in solution a extracted from normal m aeruginosa after which different thermodynamic forms of cyt b 559 was measured and the relationship between the ratio of hp cyt b 559 to lp cyt b 559 rhl and bubbling duration was obtained fig 3 a fluorescence standard curve of no standard samples was obtained by using total nitric oxide assay kit according to the manufacturers manual fig 3b no gas 99 99 1 0 ml s was bubbled into 3 0 ml solution a with different bubbling duration after which the fluorescence was measured by the same methods combining with fluorescence standard curve of no standard samples the relationship between no concentration and bubbling duration was acquired fig 3c 2 2 6 raman spectroscopy raman spectra of cyt b 559 were obtained by a confocal raman microscope with a ccd detector labram system dilor lille france using a 782 nm excitation line from a helium neon laser the samples were placed into capillary tubes and examined with an exposure time of 40 s the laser power was maintained at 10 mw at samples spectra were recorded between 1700 and 1200 cm 1 at a resolution of 2 0 cm 1 2 2 7 statistical analyses statistics and analysis were conducted using origin 9 software linear regression and one way anova followed by tukey multiple comparison tests were performed if necessary error bars represent sem and p values are indicated as follows p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 results 3 1 the effect of triazine and substituted ureas herbicides on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum at 96 h in the present study the effect of seven herbicides on cyanobacteria m aeruginosa and on green algae s capricornutum at 96 h were evaluated the dose response relationship of monuron on m aeruginosa and on s capricornutum are shown in fig 2a 1 and fig 2a 2 respectively other results detailed in supplementary fig 2 and supplementary fig 3 in which the fitted curves were plotted by previous methods deng et al 2012 generally herbicides generates low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition on the proliferation of m aeruginosa and s capricornutum illustrating with fig 2a 1 with the concentration lg c m clg for short of monuron increases from 8 56 to 7 55 the stimulation ratio rises from 3 31 to 29 57 but a further increase in monuron results in weakening stimulation followed by enhancing inhibition with maximum inhibition up to 75 10 that is to say monuron generates marked hormesis effect on m aeruginosa and on s capricornutum other test results showed hormesis effects supplementary fig 2 and 3 without exception among which the maximum stimulation reached up to 51 72 the effect of fenuron on m aeruginosa it is worth noticing that stimulatory concentrations of herbicides are generally close to environment concentrations guzzella et al 2006 sousa et al 2016 for example residual concentration clg for diuron in kerdavid and billiers river in france was 8 85 to 8 48 caquet et al 2013 which covered the maximum stimulatory dose 8 74 clg in the present study as illustrated in supplementary fig 2 in particular stimulatory concentration ranges of triazine herbicides for instance 9 38 to 7 66 clg for simetryn in supplementary fig 2 are in good agreement with those detected in lake taihu na et al 2006 where triazine herbicides were 10 01 to 8 54 clg and dense cyanobacterial blooms formed regularly in summer 3 2 the relative content of hp cty b559 and lp cyt b 559 since the mechanism of tested herbicides is to block electron transfer causing photoinhibition in psii broser et al 2011 we measured different thermodynamic forms cyt b 559 that was reported to relieve photoinhibition barber and de 1993 nedbal et al 1992 tiwari and pospíšil 2009 the effect of monuron on the ratio of hp high potential form to lp low potential form of cyt b 559 rhl in m aeruginosa and s capricornutum are shown in fig 2b 1 and fig 2b 2 green lines respectively other results are detailed in supplementary fig 4 and supplementary fig 5 on the whole rhl first decreased and then rose with concentration take fig 2b 1 for example when exposed to the lowest concentration of monuron clg 8 56 hp form of cyt b 559 dominates compared with lp form with rhl of 1 98 a value close to control group green dotted line which was consistent with previous researches guerrero et al 2014 ortega et al 2010 with the concentration of monuron increasing to 7 55 clg rhl drops to 0 40 but the further rise in monuron leads to a recovery of rhl to 2 33 clg 5 04 it is noteworthy that the drop in rhl is closely accompanied by the enhancing stimulation on proliferation whereas the recovery of rhl coincides with substantial inhibition 3 3 the content of intracellular ros when participating in the cyclic electron transfer to protect psii from photoinhibition cyt b 559 was proposed to generate ros including o2 and h2o2 barber and de 1993 pospíšil 2011 pospisil et al 2006 therefore we measured the content of intercellular ros in the presence of different concentrations of herbicides fig 2c 1 and fig 2c 2 display the impacts of monuron on relative fluorescence intensity rfi of m aeruginosa samples and of s capricornutum samples respectively red lines and other results are detailed in supplementary fig 6 and fig 7 in all cases rfi first rose to some extent above the control red dotted lines represent control groups and then gradually fell below the control as can be seen from fig 2c 1 with the rise in the concentration of monuron to 7 55 clg rfi increases from 103 09 to 165 59 after which rfi declines down to 59 78 with the concentration of monuron it is evident that the expansion of ros is in parallel with the stimulatory effect on proliferation whereas the fall in ros is in parallel with enhancing the inhibitory response 3 4 the content of intracellular no several lines of evidence have addressed the stimulatory effect of no on plants beligni and lamattina 2000 kopyra and gwóźdź 2003 and a variety of signal transfer processes involving antioxidation a h mackerness et al 2001 wink et al 1993 the contents of intracellular no were measured in the present study the rfi obtained are shown in fig 2d 1 m aeruginosa samples and fig 2d 2 s capricornutum samples other results are detailed in supplementary fig 8 and supplementary fig 9 generally rfi showed a downtrend with herbicide concentration in figs 2d 1 for example rfi declines moderately from 8 56 to 7 30 clg followed by a marked drop down to 57 24 indicating that intercellular no content was going downward with increasing concentration of herbicides in particular the decline of no mainly reflected in inhibitory stage clg 7 30 mirroring the correlation between intracellular no and inhibition on proliferation 3 5 the effect of exogenous no on rhl of cyt b 559 the effect of no on the thermodynamic transformation of cyt b 559 was determined for further understanding of antioxidation since cyt b 559 is a conservative compound closely associated with psii in all oxygenic photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria experiments were only performed on cyt b 559 isolated form one of the two taxa m aeruginosa as described in section 2 2 5 as demonstrated in fig 3a one way anova analysis reveals that rhl increases significantly within the first 10 s of bubbling time and keeps stable later indicating that cyt b 559 underwent a continuous transformation from lp form to hp form with exogenous no addition within the first 10 s next no concentration in the sample was measured when rhl first achieved the highest point 10 s according to fig 3c no concentration is about 7 73 10 6 mol l after 10 s bubbling of no gas in other words as low as 7 73 10 6 mol l no solution can maximize the transformation of cyt b 559 from lp form to hp form to investigate conformational changes of cyt b 559 caused by no raman shift of cyt b 559 was obtained by raman spectroscopy as described in methods before and after 10 s bubbling of no gas into psii membranes suspended solution the results are shown in fig 3d the band at 1450 cm 1 assigned to bending vibration of ch2 appears in the spectra of the sample untreated with no gas and decreases in the sample treated with no gas indicating the changes in the conformation of cyt b 559 the amide i bands located at α helix at 1652 cm 1 bandekar and krimm 1980 decrease after treating with no gas and the band at 1281 cm 1 assigned to amide iii at α helix also markedly decreases and shifts to 1283 cm 1 the changes in amide i and amide iii demonstrate the reduction of α helix in subunits of cyt b 559 under the influence of no gas as the histidine residue his is located in α helix fig 3e it is inferred that the reduction of α helix leads to orientational changes of the histidine imidazole ring which causes the transformation of cyt b 559 from lp form to hp form babcock et al 1985 moreover the decrease in and shift to 1657 cm 1 of band at 1655 cm 1 were said to reflect the changes of stretching vibration of co on the peptides holt and cotton 1989 which may suggest the formation of hydrogen bond between the imidazole group of his and the α subunit fig 3e a typical characteristic of hp form of cyt b 559 berthomieu et al 1992 roncel et al 2001 as co is a potential hydrogen bond acceptor valentine et al 1979 4 discussion the experimental results demonstrate that triazine herbicides and substituted ureas herbicides show striking hormesis effects on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum which are in agreement with previous observations cedergreen 2008 cedergreen et al 2007 valiente et al 2012 for convenience the phases in which herbicides produce increasing stimulation on algae and cyanobacteria are named stage i and that in which the stimulation decreases followed by gradual enhancement of inhibition are named stage ii for instance stage i of the effect of monuron to m aeruginosa is the phase of concentration clg between 8 56 and 7 55 and stage ii is that of concentration clg between 7 55 and 5 04 as marked in fig 2a 1 4 1 the rising level of ros derived from the reduction of lp cyt b 559 substantially causes the stimulation in stage i we investigated the role of cyt b 559 might play in stimulatory response produced by herbicides in stage i the results demonstrate a decline of rhl in stage i fig 2b 1 and 2b 2 namely an increase in the amount of lp and a decrease in hp form of cyt b 559 simultaneously this suggests that increasing concentration of herbicides can cause the transformation of cyt b 559 from hp to lp a similar process occurred under certain negative conditions iwasaki et al 1995 styring et al 1990 eq 3 since lp cyt b 559 is capable of accepting electrons from acceptor sides matsuda and butler 1983 mizusawa et al 1997 on grounds of its sole oxidized state of heme iron fe 3 there is a strong possibility that this transformation from hp to lp is a self regulated activity to alleviate asp by formed lp cyt b 559 alleviating asp was achieved by accepting overloaded electrons from pheo or qa the more likely electron donor is pheo barber and de 1993 poulson et al 1995 in view of its stronger reducibility em 610 mv ph 7 and closer edge to edge distance from cyt b 559 guskov et al 2009 pospíšil 2011 compared with qa after accepting an electron from pheo lp cyt b 559 fe3 converts to lp cyt b 559 fe2 eq 4 3 hp cyt b 559 fe 2 asp lp cyt b 559 fe 3 4 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 pheo lp cyt b 559 fe 2 pheo in parallel with the transformation a moderate rise in intracellular ros was observed fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 in stage i indicating a likely correlation between ros production and functioning of cyt b 559 in alleviating asp it was predicted that the generation of ros correlated with re oxidation of lp cyt b 559 fe2 eq 5 pospíšil 2009 2011 pospisil et al 2006 we propose that this process is the primary cause of the rise in intracellular ros in stage i 5 lp cyt b 559 fe 2 o 2 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 o 2 taken together we hypothesize that to alleviate asp caused by herbicides hp cyt b 559 fe2 transforms into lp cyt b 559 fe3 in some way eq 3 lp cyt b 559 fe3 generated accepts electrons from pheo and lp cyt b 559 fe2 is formed eq 4 which is followed closely by the production of ros and restoration of lp cyt b 559 fe3 eq 5 from an overall perspective overloaded electrons within psii caused by herbicides is transferred to molecular oxygen to form ros by means of the protective mechanism of cyt b 559 as illustrated by green arrowed lines in fig 4 a the vital function of ros as well as os caused by them is of significance concerning signal transmission aging and cell death traditionally ros were thought to be toxic to aerobic metabolism which damage dna protein and nucleic acid that is why most organisms have formed a spectrum of ros scavenging mechanisms nevertheless recent studies revealed that ros are necessary for the progression of several basic biological processes mittler 2017 one example is that hormone abscisic acid aba led to the closure of stomata of plant guard cells in a dry environment by elevating ros level but if ros production was suppressed aba induced closure of stomata was inhibited song et al 2014 ros have been extensively reported to regulate development differentiation stress signaling and lifespan heidler et al 2010 lauri et al 2014 mignolet spruyt et al 2016 mittler et al 2004 2011 more importantly a volume of research has confirmed that a moderate rise in ros resulted in the progress of plant growth and beneficial gene expressions as well as an extension of cells lifespan ludovico and burhans 2014 semchyshyn 2014 for example yokoo et al revealed that 20 μm and 60 μm achieved the cellular longevity up to 160 and 120 of population doubling levels respectively and suggested that this might be achieved by the slowdown of age dependent shortening of telomeric dna yokoo et al 2004 the present study is in good agreement with these observations as indicated in fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 when intracellular ros gradually increase to some extent the stimulatory effect on m aeruginosa and s capricornutum is enhanced almost simultaneously therefore we propose that a moderate increase in intracellular ros substantially accounts for the stimulatory effect 4 2 the decrease in ros modulated by no causes the inhibitory effects in stage ii this section aims to address the inhibitory response in stage ii as shown in fig 2a 1 and 2a 2 with further increases in herbicide concentration stimulatory effects weaken followed by enhancing inhibition up to above 80 at the same time data show a marked rise in rhl fig 2b 1 and 2b 2 and decline in intracellular ros down to below control groups fig 2c 1 and 2c 2 in stage ii indicating once again the potential correlation between the effects on proliferation the thermodynamic transformation of cyt b 559 and intracellular ros level as discussed previously it was hypothesized that stimulatory response in stage i primarily stemmed from the transformation of cyt b 559 from hp form to lp form however lp form retransferred to hp form in stage ii a process which we suggest modulated by no eq 6 as discussed in results 6 lp cyt b 559 fe 3 no hp cyt b 559 fe 3 hp form of cyt b 559 possesses strong oxidation ability with midpoint redox potential ranging from 310 to 400 mv ph 7 presumably oxidizing o2 into o2 eq 7 as the midpoint potential of o2 o2 is 160 mv ph 7 pospíšil 2011 consequently intracellular ros decreased in stage ii in this sense no acted as ros scavenger by regulating the conversion of cyt b 559 a mechanism can be illustrated by red arrowed lines in fig 4a 7 hp cyt b 559 fe 3 o 2 hp cyt b 559 fe 2 o 2 it is necessary to emphasize that the basal level of intercellular ros is vital to maintaining normal function heidler et al 2010 lauri et al 2014 mignolet spruyt et al 2016 mittler et al 2004 2011 pei et al 2000 and that numerous studies have addressed the negative effect of decreasing ros a phillip et al 2011 diebold and chandel 2016 manish et al 2014 schieber and chandel 2014 in particular juntilla and owusu ansah demonstrated that reduction in intracellular ros resulted in suppressive effects on differentiation juntilla et al 2010 owusu ansah and banerjee 2009 while the differentiation process was restored after adding exogenous ros h2o2 hamanaka et al 2013 in the present study as intracellular ros gradually declines below the control group the inhibition enhances considerably figs 2c 1 and 2c 2 we hypothesize that inhibition on proliferation is ascribed to cell dysfunction originated from the cascade reaction of decreasing ros 4 3 hormesis substantially derives from equilibrium shifting of os as discussed above we propose that the stimulatory effects on proliferation stem from a certain rising in ros while strong inhibition is ascribed to the decline of intracellular ros in other words hormesis is a consequence of an equilibrium shifting of oxidative stress the left hand panel of fig 4b data from mittler 2017 illustrates the relationship between cellular progress and intracellular ros level excessively low levels of ros cannot sustain normal signal transfer schieber and chandel 2014 tormos et al 2011 causing depression on the cellular processes left yellow part of the curve increasing and maintaining a basal level of ros is necessary for the functioning of cells furthermore a moderate increase in ros above basal level as discussed previously can activate beneficial signal pathways to accelerate cellular processes including proliferation and cellular longevity et al ludovico and burhans 2014 semchyshyn 2014 yokoo et al 2004 middle green part of the curve with further increasing of ros a threshold is reached above which ros becomes maladaptive and induces unmanageable oxidative stress reactions that damage macromolecule and cellular structure hekimilapointe wen 2011 right yellow part of the curve the right hand panel of fig 4b illustrates the effects of herbicides on the proliferation of cyanobacterial cells and on intracellular ros level simplified from fig 2c 1 low concentration of herbicides can cause ros to increase but not to reach the toxic level so as to accelerate the cellular processes including stimulating proliferation a case similar to some cancer cells poillet perez et al 2015 the high concentration of herbicides results in a drop in ros and simultaneous inhibition on proliferation compared with control in respect that excessively low levels of ros exert negative effects on the cellular processes to sum up we propose that it is the redox traits of cyt b 559 that regulate hormesis effects of herbicides on cyanobacteria fundamentally the immediate cause for hormesis is cellular equilibrium shifting of os 4 4 low level environmental contaminants are proposed to be the underlying cause of phytoplankton blooms we had intended to explore the evidence supporting the advantages of cyanobacteria in initial bloom formation over algae from the aspect of hormesis however the scales and intensities of stimulatory responses of herbicides were virtually the same for m aeruginosa and s capricornutum indicating low level of herbicides could cause not only cyanobacterial blooms but green algal blooms further relative indexes including transformations of cyt b 559 levels of no and ros showed marginal differences between the two taxa inferring that they might possess similar response mechanisms with regards to hormesis this assertion can be supported by the conservation in structure and essential function of cyt b 559 in cyanobacteria and algae roncel et al 2001 pospíšil 2011 we propose that once triazine and substituted ureas herbicides were introduced cyt b 559 in cyanobacteria and algae relieved photoinhibition by thermodynamic transformations resulting in double edged responses regarding herbicide doses which played a vital role in phytoplankton blooms forming apart from triazine and substituted ureas herbicides other environmental contaminants and subsequent degradation products were also observed to stimulate phytoplankton growth for instance pentachlorophenol and a glyphosate pesticide were found to stimulate the growth of m aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations but inhibit cell growth at high concentrations morais et al 2014 qiu et al 2013 the production and release of microcystins as well as cell growth of m aeruginosa were observed rising after the introduction of amoxicillin at environmentally relevant concentrations liu et al 2012 in this sense there is a strong possibility that low level anthropogenic pollutants that are generally overlooked in traditional environmental evaluation have profound impacts on algal blooms and aquatic ecosystems 5 conclusions seven triazine and substituted ureas herbicides exhibited hormesis effects on microcystis aeruginosa and selenastrum capricornutum among which the stimulatory concentration ranges of herbicides generally coincided with those detected in natural waters it is inferred that herbicides residual in water environment are like to be a contributory factor to phytoplankton blooms there is a need for consideration about low dose environment contaminants in terms of their environmental risks moreover we proposed that the stimulatory response of algae derived from the moderate expansion of intracellular ros a byproduct of cytochrome b 559 in alleviating photoinhibition caused by herbicides the present study also discussed the dual character of ros and provide insight into physiology function of ros data availability data that support the findings of the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable

18121,while flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi one of the most popular cdi variants possesses a number of advantages over conventional fixed electrode cdi e g large salt adsorption capacity high flow efficiency and convenient management of the electrodes challenges remain in constructing and operating an fcdi system such that it can operate continuously here we achieve effective continuous removal of salt from a brackish feed stream using flowing carbon electrodes which are regenerated in a closed loop manner by using our previously introduced integrated fcdi mf strategy the performance of the fcdi mf system is characterized over a two week period of operation with key factors influencing the desalination performance identified results show that the fcdi mf system is capable of continuously desalinating brackish water 2 g l 1 to portable levels 0 5 g l 1 whilst sustaining an extraordinary water recovery rate 92 and relatively low energy consumption 0 5 kwh m 3 no obvious deterioration in performance or membrane fouling was observed during the 14 day operation while the carbon particles used in the flow electrode exhibited only a minor increase in oxygen containing groups over the 14 days of operation a significant reduction in particle size was observed likely as a consequence of the high frequency collisions and associated friction between particles that occurred in the fcdi mf system further studies regarding flowable electrode optimization cell configuration design and process modelling are needed in order to realize the scale up and practical

electrodes which can store ions in the electrical double layers edl formed on the electrode surface upon applying an electric field thereby lowering the salinity of the treated stream bian et al 2016 porada et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b however salt removal is limited by the effective surface area of the static electrodes when the electrodes are completely saturated with ions they are either short circuited or the polarity reversed to induce the release of ions back into bulk solution thereby producing a waste brine stream and enabling the regeneration of the electrodes thus classical cdi can only function in an intermittent manner porada et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b flow electrode capacitive desalination fcdi a relatively recent advance in cdi architecture provides the possibility of avoiding some of the limitations of fixed electrode cdi instead of utilizing stationary electrodes carbon suspensions generally composed of active materials conductive additives and aqueous organic

circuited closed cycle scc operation fcdi exhibits high desalting efficiency and the possibility of continuous operation rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the flow efficiency of fcdi can reach 100 as the desalinated stream and the brine stream are generated in different chambers recent studies indicate that fcdi is capable of achieving multiple purposes ranging from brackish sea water desalination to valuable products recovery including ammonia phosphate and uranium bian et al 2019 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b 2019b despite the advantages presented above we are not aware of any full scale applications of fcdi with the difficulty in translation to practice a result of a number of challenges including i high electrical resistance of the flow electrodes at least compared to the low resistance of highly conducting solid fixed electrodes ii energy consumption associated with the pumping of the flow electrodes and iii lack of efficient electrode regeneration and brine separation methods dixit et al 2019 the majority of fcdi studies to date have focused on the first two aspects by optimizing the pore structure mass loading morphology and surface chemistry of the

electrolyte concentration yang et al 2016a the electronic and ionic transport properties of the flow electrodes can be significantly improved leading to better desalting efficiency additionally the developments of innovative cell configurations operational modes and sustainable electrode flow behavior point toward the possibility of low maintenance and low energy operation of fcdi based systems cho et al 2017 ma et al 2020a yang et al 2016b 2019 in contrast to the progress in performance enhancement of small scale laboratory fcdi devices as a consequence of several years substantial research there has been surprisingly very limited progress made towards stable and real continuous operation of fcdi devices the first attempt at continuous operation of fcdi was achieved by adding components such as using extra cell unit or inserting additional iem to form additional brine chamber in a single unit leading to simultaneous salt removal electrode regeneration and brine separation gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 doornbusch et al 2016 described a fully continuous desalination process based on the incorporation of the flow electrode mixing reservoir with a brine overflow tube which facilitated regeneration of the carbon electrodes via gravity sedimentation more recently zhang et al 2019c demonstrated that continuous operation could be achieved by coupling a microfiltration mf module into an fcdi system with the following processes occurring simultaneously i ion transport across the iems and temporary electro adsorption in the respective charged flow electrodes ii flow electrode regeneration and brine production through charge neutralization in a shared reservoir iii brine separation via an mf module immersed in the shared reservoir and iv electrolyte replenishment to maintain the volume and carbon content of the flow electrode stable further investigation revealed that the integrated fcdi mf system was capable of desalting brackish water to a potable level 0 5 g l 1 with extremely high water recovery rates 90 and thermodynamic energy efficiency 30 achieved while these studies provide proof of concept of approaches via which continuous operation might be achieved doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2015 zhang et al 2019c the knowledge and experience on long term performance of fcdi brackish water treatment is still very limited while the flow electrode is at the heart of the proposed coupled fcdi process for salt removal issues such as the stability and integrity of the carbon particle electrodes after prolonged operation and the associated long term performance of fcdi systems require further evaluation in this study we systematically investigated the long term performance of an fcdi system that was operated continuously for more than 14 days the major objective was to determine whether any variations in flow electrode properties occurred and if so to assess the effects of these changes on fcdi performance over extended run times the performance of the integrated fcdi system was evaluated using a range of established metrics including salt removal rate electrical energy consumption productivity water recovery rate wr

electric and pumping energy consumptions and thermodynamic energy efficiency tee are provided in si text 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance over a range of operating conditions balancing the productivity water recovery rate and energy consumption is an essential task prior the large scale employment of a desalination process in this section the desalting performance of the fcdi mf system was thoroughly evaluated over a wide range of operating conditions with an initial salt concentration of 2 g l 1 fig 2 results showing the steady state cell voltage and effluent salinity as a function of current density and productivity wr 92 are presented in fig 2a b at a fixed productivity a positive linear relationship between current density and cell voltage was observed before a certain limiting current density was reached fig 2a while the effluent salinity decreased accordingly with increase in current density fig 2b while fcdi is capable of reducing the effluent salinity to a potable level 0 5 g l 1 it is not wise to remove salt to extremely low concentrations using charge current densities higher than certain limiting values as this leads to a dramatic increase of the operating voltage fig 2a for instance the effluent salt concentration only reduced slightly from 0 4 to 0 2 g l 1 with the current density rising from 18 2 to 22 7 a m 2 at a of productivity 22 1 l m 2 h 1 while the cell voltage showed a dramatic increase from 0 6 to 1 1 v fig 2a b on the basis of these results the relationship between electrical energy consumption and concentration reduction can be obtained as expected it can be seen that an increase in either the treatment efficiency i e larger concentration reduction or the productivity i e larger feed flowrate results in an increase in the overall electrical energy consumption fig 2c we further investigated the influence of wr on fcdi salt removal efficiency and specific electric energy consumption secelectric the feed flowrate was controlled at 0 81 ml min 1 resulting in a productivity of 22 1 l m 2 h 1 while the brine discharge rate varied from 0 04 to 0 81 ml min 1 providing wr values from 50 to 95 as shown in fig 2d although an increase in wr resulted in slightly higher secelectric its influence is much weaker than that induced by change in productivity or concentration reduction based on our previous observations a lower brine discharge rate higher wr facilitates salt accumulation within the flow electrode leading to higher steady state brine concentration on one hand a slightly reduced flow electrode resistance is to be expected in view of the enhanced conductivity of higher saline electrolytes on the other hand a higher concentration difference between the flow electrode and the dilute stream induces an increase in polarization resistance the trade off is that the whole cell internal resistance remains relatively stable when changing wr as such similar cell voltages and secelectric were achieved for different wr scenarios in addition to the technical performance of a desalination process it is important that consideration also be given to economic aspects while energy consumption is directly related to operational cost the productivity and water recovery rate determine the plant size infrastructure cost as well as operating and maintenance costs including costs associated with brine disposal and spacer and iem replacement wang and lin 2019 ideally energy consumption should be minimized whereas productivity and wr should be maximized in reality however there will be a trade off between these performance indicators the ultimate goal of the current preliminary tests however was to ensure that both a satisfactory effluent water quality 0 5 g l 1 the vertical dotted line and a reasonable secelectric 0 6 kwh m 3 the horizontal dotted line could be achieved with these limits serving as the boundary in determining appropriate operating parameters as defined by the shaded sections in fig 2c and 2d as shown in fig 2c only two scenarios with productivities of 12 0 and 22 1 l m 2 h 1 fall into this area for a wr of 92 however considering the demand for lower capital cost in practical applications a productivity of 22 1 l m 2 h 1 at a current density of 18 2 a m 2 would seem most appropriate with regard to the selection of wr at this productivity several scenarios fall into the target area with the possible values of wr ranging from 50 to 92 as a higher wr is generally required for any desalination process as this results in generation of less brine a wr of 92 would appear to be the optimum choice in the current tests 3 2 long term evaluation of fcdi performance for brackish water treatment a long term continuous experiment was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of continuous use of the fcdi mf integrated system based on the optimized parameters obtained in section 3 1 the initial salt concentrations in the feed water and flow electrode electrolyte were controlled at 2 0 g l 1 while the feed stream flowrate and brine discharge rate were set at 0 81 and 0 07 ml min 1 respectively resulting in a fixed wr of 92 at a constant current density of 18 2 a m 2 the fcdi system exhibited an initial build up over about 3 days of electrolyte brine stream salinity from 2 to 20 g l 1 due to ion migration from the feed spacer chamber to the electrode chambers fig 3 a meanwhile the effluent dilute stream salinity dropped rapidly to a minimum value 0 26 g l 1 and then gradually increased to a fairly stable value 0 39 g l 1 with this behavior associated with ion back diffusion leakage from the electrode chamber furthermore the cell voltage exhibited a decline in accord with the reduced internal resistance of the fcdi cell si fig s4 however the system reached a steady state with marginal fluctuations for all monitored parameters i e dilute stream concentration brine concentration and cell voltage after approximately 3 days of operation the salt rejection rate stabilized at 80 5 while the brine stream reached a uniform concentration of 10 times that of the feed stream these results indicate that the feed steam can be successfully separated into a dilute stream the light shaded section in fig 3a and a brine stream the dark shaded section in fig 3a in a continuous manner the dashed line represents the theoretical variation of brine salinity c b as a function of time with this theoretical predicted behaviour obtained based on salt mass balance analysis within the flow electrode si fig s3 1 v f e d c b d t q d c f c d q b c f q b c b with c b obtained by solving the above equation details of the solution approach are provided in si text2 i e 2 c b q d q b c f c d 1 e q b v f e t c f where initial c b is equal to c f and v f e represents the total volume of the flow electrode 130 ml that is recycled in the fcdi apparatus it can observed from eq 2 that c b will gradually increase and reach a steady value q d q b c f q d c d q b as run time increases note that the theoretical variation of c b blue dashed line in fig 3a matches perfectly with the experimental results solid symbols indicating that the temporarily electrosorbed ions can be completely desorbed by simply mixing and neutralizing the exhausted flowable particles within the shared reservoir while it is reported that fixed electrodes may suffer from performance deterioration due to ion accumulation as a result of insufficient electrode regeneration during prolonged cycling cohen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a this side effect can be largely avoided as the carbon particles used here exhibited outstanding reversible charging discharging properties salt rejection rate current efficiency specific electric energy consumptions water recovery rate and energy efficiency are several critical indicators that are generally used to evaluate the performance of fcdi as shown in fig 3b the average salt rejection rate was 85 1 on day 1 decreased slightly to 80 9 in day 4 and remained stable for the rest of the operation time as for current efficiency although a high value of 94 8 was achieved on the first day it showed a gradual decrease and reached a stable value of 90 0 in the following days with this decrease partially attributable to the ion back diffusion leakage from the more concentrated flow electrode to the spacer chamber interestingly the specific electrical energy consumption showed an opposite trend with values decreasing from 0 56 kwh m 3 on day 1 to 0 50 0 52 and 0 53 kwh m 3 on days 4 9 and 14 respectively based on the definition of scc fcdi thermodynamic energy efficiency tee and wr provided in si text 1 it is pleasing to find that a high wr of 92 and tee of 16 2 can be achieved in this long term experiment a detailed comparison of the results obtained in the current study with the performance of fcdi systems documented elsewhere is provided in si table s2 as expected the asrr enrs and productivity values obtained in this study were comparable to previously reported values whereas other indicators such as wr and tee were considerably better than those documented in previous fcdi systems doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 ma et al 2020a rommerskirchen et al 2015 yang et al 2016b 2017 2019 3 3 evaluation of pressure drops in mf module and flow channels the pressure drops across the fcdi flow channels and the mf membrane were monitored in order to evaluate the pumping energy requirements no obvious variations of the pressure drop across the mf membrane were observed fig 4a and si fig s5 indicating that membrane fouling was minor over the extended operation note that most of the carbon particles have a diameter 20 100 times larger than that of the microfiltration membrane pore size 0 45 μm as such the carbon layer formed on the membrane surface is relatively loose and of high porosity would not be expected to influence brine permeation and can be easily removed via thorough flushing or backwash zhang et al 2011 the pressure drop across the fcdi flow channel however was found to almost double from 5 8 to 10 8 kpa after 14 days of prolonged cycling fig 4 a with this effect possibly a result of flow channel clogging and or increase in flow electrode viscosity while clogging did not appear to be significant in most scenarios si fig s6 the viscosity of the flow electrode carbon slurry did appear to increase with time fig 4b shows the viscosities of the flow electrodes samples as a function of shear rate before and after prolonged use with both samples demonstrating shear thinning pseudoplastic behavior campos et al 2013 the viscosity of the suspensions can be analyzed using the ostwald de waele power law model hatzell et al 2015 3 η κ γ n 1 where η is the viscosity κ is the consistency index γ represents the shear rate and n represents the shear thinning index a summary of rheological parameters of the flow electrode samples before and after use is shown in table 1 the consistency index κ increased dramatically indicating that the flow electrode became more viscous the reduction in flowability of the suspensions was likely due at least partially to the elevation of electrolyte salinity fig 3a and table 1 when the fcdi attained steady state indeed such a behavior has been suggested by previous investigators oncsik et al 2014 porada et al 2014 and confirmed by our results shown in si fig s7 and table s3 at higher electrolyte salinities repulsion between individual particles will be decreased as the electrical field associated with the electrical double layer is increasingly screened by the mobile ions in the electrolyte with the changes in electrostatic interactions between particles aggregates will form leading to reduced flowability of the suspensions as a result no doubt of the increased flow electrode viscosity the total specific pumping energy consumptions secpumping for flow electrode recycling and brine discharge increased by 83 3 from 0 06 to 0 11 kwh m 3 after prolonged operation fig 4a as calculated using eq s 13 the ratio of the secpumping to the sectotal increased from 9 7 to 17 9 3 4 characterizations of carbon electrodes before and after use it has been reported that fixed carbon electrodes may suffer from potential of zero charge shift pore structure collapse surface area reduction resistance increase and lifespan shortening after prolonged cycling as a consequence of faradaic reactions that will inevitably occur choi 2014 zhang et al 2018a 2019a while we have demonstrated that a stable desalting performance can be achieved using flowable carbon electrodes over prolonged operation the durability of these particle electrodes remains an open question in this section an array of characterizations including sem size distributions bet xps and zeta potential were carried out in order to quantify any changes occurring in the flow electrode carbon particles before and after use as can be seen from the sem photos shown in fig 5 a c the sizes of the pristine carbon samples day 0 were much larger than those of the used samples at days 4 and 14 further measurements of the particle size using the malvern mastersizer provided more accurate results fig 5d the pristine carbon particles possessed a d90 i e 90 of the particles exhibited sizes smaller than this value and d50 i e 50 of the particles exhibited sizes smaller than this value of 87 6 and 25 8 μm respectively compared to d90 and d50 values of the particles that had been recycled reused for 14 days of 33 6 and 12 9 μm respectively this significant reduction in particle size was most likely attributable to i the friction between the carbon particles and the liquid electrolyte flow channels pipes and iems ii high frequency collisions between the flowing particles iii mechanical rolling squeezing and abrasion of the carbon electrodes on passing through the peristaltic pump tubes tang et al 2018 the mechanical strength of carbon particles is generally recognized to be relatively poor cai et al 2004 zhou et al 2008 with the particles unable to withstand the severe friction and collisions associated with operation of the integrated fcdi mf systems leading to particle breakage attrition and size reduction the possibility that carbon oxidation might also contribute to particle size reduction was investigated by circulating the carbon slurry in the system without external current supply as shown in si fig s8 similar results were achieved indicating that mechanical friction and collisions were the primary contributors to carbon particle size reduction with the decrease of particle size the settle ability of the used carbon particles declined accordingly si fig s9 as observed from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 5e all the carbon samples exhibit a typical type i isotherm according to the bddt brunauer deming deming and teller classification do duong 1998 with this result indicating that mesopores and micropores were the main contributors to n2 adsorption the presence of a hysteresis loop at higher relative pressure confirmed the presence of mesoporous structures while the uptake of nitrogen at lower relative pressure signified the presence of microporous structures the textural parameters of all carbon samples i e bet surface area total micro meso pore volume and average pore diameter calculated from n2 adsorption isotherms are listed in table 2 as expected virgin carbon particles possessed the largest bet surface area and total pore volume of 1100 cm2 g 1 which decreased to 991 cm2 g 1 10 0 and 937 cm3 g 1 14 8 after use for 4 days and 14 days respectively in contrast the ratio of meso and total pore volumes increased slightly it has been documented that this phenomenon can result from the introduction of oxygen surface groups via carbon oxidation additionally the break up of the carbon particles may contribute to the above mentioned variations xps spectra of the c 1s and o 1s electrons for the carbon samples were performed to probe the changes of elemental content before and after use as shown in fig 6 a the overall profile of the c 1s electrons can be deconvoluted into several gaussian components with the largest peak at 284 5 ev assigned to the sp2 configuration cc and the satellite peaks appearing at 285 4 286 1287 5 and 288 7 ev confirmed to be c c c o co and o co respectively for the o 1s xps spectra fig 6b two components are deconvoluted which are ascribed to c o 532 4 ev and co 534 0 ev no obvious variation of either the composition or content of functional groups were observed for these carbon samples on extended particle use the carbon and oxygen atomic percentages were 96 5 and 3 5 at day 0 which only slightly changed to 94 9 and 4 7 at day 14 si table s4 demonstrating that only a small quantity of oxygen containing functional groups was introduced after 14 days of successive cycling as shown by fig 6c the zeta potential of the carbon particles shifted slightly in the negative direction after exposure to long term cycling such observations in agreement with the xps results presented above indicate that the surface of the carbon particles was only slightly modified on extended use with the minor changes observed unlikely to have a significant influence on ion electrosorption although a number of studies have reported the inevitable occurrence of carbon oxidation in typical cdi systems zhang et al 2018a it appears unlikely to be a significant cause for concern in our current fcdi system on one hand the steady state cell potential was 0 64 v slightly lower than the cell potential required i e 0 80 v to induce severe carbon oxidation bayram and ayranci 2011 on the other hand while the carbon particle electrodes likely experience mild oxidation during their brief passage through the positively charged chamber they will have an identical chance to undergo reduction during their transit through the negatively charged chamber while results from the current study demonstrated the robustness of the fcdi system for continuous operation over two weeks these experiments have been conducted using synthetic brackish water in a bench scale fcdi device with limited treatment capacity 10 l d 1 further efforts should be given to i investigation of the treatment of real brackish waters and development of effective control strategies with regard to the potential fouling scaling of the spacers

and high water recovery 92 furthermore the fcdi system used here achieved a high thermodynamic energy efficiency of 16 2 several times higher than conventional fixed electrode cdi 5 and fcdi systems documented elsewhere no obvious performance deterioration or membrane fouling was observed on extended operation xps and zeta potential tests revealed that minor oxidation of the carbon electrodes occurred after long term cycling the size of the carbon particles was found to be significantly reduced with their d50 size decreased from 25 8 μm at day 0 12 9 μm at day 14 most likely as a result of both the severe friction occurring in the flowing system and collisions between the particles and flow channels the knowledge and experience from current study will provide insightful guidance towards

18121,while flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi one of the most popular cdi variants possesses a number of advantages over conventional fixed electrode cdi e g large salt adsorption capacity high flow efficiency and convenient management of the electrodes challenges remain in constructing and operating an fcdi system such that it can operate continuously here we achieve effective continuous removal of salt from a brackish feed stream using flowing carbon electrodes which are regenerated in a closed loop manner by using our previously introduced integrated fcdi mf strategy the performance of the fcdi mf system is characterized over a two week period of operation with key factors influencing the desalination performance identified results show that the fcdi mf system is capable of continuously desalinating brackish water 2 g l 1 to portable levels 0 5 g l 1 whilst sustaining an extraordinary water recovery rate 92 and relatively low energy consumption 0 5 kwh m 3 no obvious deterioration in performance or membrane fouling was observed during the 14 day operation while the carbon particles used in the flow electrode exhibited only a minor increase in oxygen containing groups over the 14 days of operation a significant reduction in particle size was observed likely as a consequence of the high frequency collisions and associated friction between particles that occurred in the fcdi mf system further studies regarding flowable electrode optimization cell configuration design and process modelling are needed in order to realize the scale up and practical

and cost effective brackish water desalination suss et al 2015 tan et al 2018 2019 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a a typical cdi system involves the use of two oppositely placed porous carbon electrodes which can store ions in the electrical double layers edl formed on the electrode surface upon applying an electric field thereby lowering the salinity of the treated stream bian et al 2016 porada et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b however salt removal is limited by the effective surface area of the static electrodes when the electrodes are completely saturated with ions they are either short circuited or the polarity reversed to induce the release of ions back into bulk solution thereby producing a waste brine stream and enabling the regeneration of the electrodes thus classical cdi can only function in an intermittent manner porada et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b flow electrode capacitive desalination fcdi a relatively recent advance in cdi architecture provides the possibility of avoiding some of the limitations of fixed electrode cdi instead of utilizing stationary electrodes carbon suspensions generally composed of active materials conductive additives and aqueous organic electrolyte are applied as electrodes in the fcdi cell hatzell et al 2014 jeon et al 2013 ma et al 2020b by continuously replenishing the electrode chamber with regenerated carbon slurry through short circuited closed cycle scc operation fcdi exhibits high desalting efficiency and the possibility of continuous operation rommerskirchen et al 2018 yang et al 2017 meanwhile the flow efficiency of fcdi can reach 100 as the desalinated stream and the brine stream are generated in different chambers recent studies indicate that fcdi is capable of achieving multiple purposes ranging from brackish sea water desalination to valuable products recovery including ammonia phosphate and uranium bian et al 2019 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b 2019b despite the advantages presented above we are not aware of any full scale applications of fcdi with the difficulty in translation to practice a result of a number of challenges including i high electrical resistance of the flow electrodes at least compared to the low resistance of highly conducting solid fixed electrodes ii energy consumption associated with the pumping of the flow electrodes and iii lack of efficient electrode regeneration and brine separation methods dixit et al 2019 the majority of fcdi studies to date have focused on the first two aspects by optimizing the pore structure mass loading morphology and surface chemistry of the active materials hatzell et al 2015 introducing proper conductive additives e g redox couples carbon black and carbon nanotubes cho et al 2019 liang et al 2017 ma et al 2016 and using elevated electrolyte concentration yang et al 2016a the electronic and ionic transport properties of the flow electrodes can be significantly improved leading to better desalting efficiency additionally the developments of innovative cell configurations operational modes and sustainable electrode flow behavior point toward the possibility of low maintenance and low energy operation of fcdi based systems cho et al 2017 ma et al 2020a yang et al 2016b 2019 in contrast to the progress in performance enhancement of small scale laboratory fcdi devices as a consequence of several years substantial research there has been surprisingly very limited progress made towards stable and real continuous operation of fcdi devices the first attempt at continuous operation of fcdi was achieved by adding components such as using extra cell unit or inserting additional iem to form additional brine chamber in a single unit leading to simultaneous salt removal electrode regeneration and brine separation gendel et al 2014 rommerskirchen et al 2015 doornbusch et al 2016 described a fully continuous desalination process based on the incorporation of the flow electrode mixing reservoir with a brine overflow tube which facilitated regeneration of the carbon electrodes via gravity sedimentation more recently zhang et al 2019c demonstrated that continuous operation could be achieved by coupling a microfiltration mf module into an fcdi system with the following processes occurring simultaneously i ion transport across the iems and temporary electro adsorption in the respective charged flow electrodes ii flow electrode regeneration and brine production through charge neutralization in a shared reservoir iii brine separation via an mf module immersed in the shared reservoir and iv electrolyte replenishment to maintain the volume and carbon content of the flow electrode stable further investigation revealed that the integrated fcdi mf system was capable of desalting brackish water to a potable level 0 5 g l 1 with extremely high water recovery rates 90 and thermodynamic energy efficiency 30 achieved while these studies provide proof of concept of approaches via which continuous operation might be achieved doornbusch et al 2016 rommerskirchen et al 2015 zhang et al 2019c the knowledge and experience on long term performance of fcdi brackish water treatment is still very limited while the flow electrode is at the heart of the proposed coupled fcdi process for salt removal issues such as the stability and integrity of the carbon particle electrodes after prolonged operation and the associated long term performance of fcdi systems require further evaluation in this study we systematically investigated the long term performance of an fcdi system that was operated continuously for more than 14 days the major objective was to determine whether any variations in flow electrode properties occurred and if so to assess the effects of these changes on fcdi performance over extended run times the performance of the integrated fcdi system was evaluated using a range of established metrics including salt removal rate electrical energy consumption productivity water recovery rate wr

fei nova usa at an accelerating voltage of 20 kv to characterize the chemical composition of the carbon materials xps escalab250xi thermo scientific uk tests were conducted with al kα radiation 1486

electric and pumping energy consumptions and thermodynamic energy efficiency tee are provided in si text 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 desalination performance over a range of operating conditions balancing the productivity water recovery rate and energy consumption is an essential task prior the large scale employment of a desalination process in this section the desalting performance of the fcdi mf system was thoroughly evaluated over a wide range of operating conditions with an initial salt concentration of 2 g l 1 fig 2 results showing the steady state cell voltage and effluent salinity as a function of current density and productivity wr 92 are presented in fig 2a b at a fixed productivity a positive linear relationship between current density and cell voltage was observed before a certain limiting current density was reached fig 2a while the effluent salinity decreased accordingly with increase in current density fig 2b while fcdi is capable of reducing the effluent salinity to a potable level 0 5 g l 1 it is not wise to remove salt to extremely low concentrations using charge current densities higher than certain limiting values as this leads to a dramatic increase of the operating voltage fig 2a for instance the effluent salt concentration only reduced slightly from 0 4 to 0 2 g l 1 with the current density rising from 18 2 to 22 7 a m 2 at a of productivity 22 1 l m 2 h 1 while the cell voltage showed a dramatic increase from 0 6 to 1 1 v fig 2a b on the basis of these results the relationship between electrical energy consumption and concentration reduction can be obtained as expected it can be seen that an increase in either the treatment efficiency i e larger concentration reduction or the productivity i e larger feed flowrate results in an increase in the overall electrical energy consumption fig 2c we further investigated the influence of wr on fcdi salt removal efficiency and specific electric energy consumption secelectric the feed flowrate was controlled at 0 81 ml min 1 resulting in a productivity of 22 1 l m 2 h 1 while the brine discharge rate varied from 0 04 to 0 81 ml min 1 providing wr values from 50 to 95 as shown in fig 2d although an increase in wr resulted in slightly higher secelectric its influence is much weaker than that induced by change in productivity or concentration reduction based on our previous observations a lower brine discharge rate higher wr facilitates salt accumulation within the flow electrode leading to higher steady state brine concentration on one hand a slightly reduced flow electrode resistance is to be expected in view of the enhanced conductivity of higher saline electrolytes on the other hand a higher concentration difference between the flow electrode and the dilute stream induces an increase in polarization resistance the trade off is that the whole cell internal resistance remains relatively stable when changing wr as such similar cell voltages and secelectric were achieved for different wr scenarios in addition to the technical performance of a desalination process it is important that consideration also be given to economic aspects while energy consumption is directly related to operational cost the productivity and water recovery rate determine the plant size infrastructure cost as well as operating and maintenance costs including costs associated with brine disposal and spacer and iem replacement wang and lin 2019 ideally energy consumption should be minimized whereas productivity and wr should be maximized in reality however there will be a trade off between these performance indicators the ultimate goal of the current preliminary tests however was to ensure that both a satisfactory effluent water quality 0 5 g l 1 the vertical dotted line and a reasonable secelectric 0 6 kwh m 3 the horizontal dotted line could be achieved with these limits serving as the boundary in determining appropriate operating parameters as defined by the shaded sections in fig 2c and 2d as shown in fig 2c only two scenarios with productivities of 12 0 and 22 1 l m 2 h 1 fall into this area for a wr of 92 however considering the demand for lower capital cost in practical applications a productivity of 22 1 l m 2 h 1 at a current density of 18 2 a m 2 would seem most appropriate with regard to the selection of wr at this productivity several scenarios fall into the target area with the possible values of wr ranging from 50 to 92 as a higher wr is generally required for any desalination process as this results in generation of less brine a wr of 92 would appear to be the optimum choice in the current tests 3 2 long term evaluation of fcdi performance for brackish water treatment a long term continuous experiment was carried out to evaluate the feasibility of continuous use of the fcdi mf integrated system based on the optimized parameters obtained in section 3 1 the initial salt concentrations in the feed water and flow electrode electrolyte were controlled at 2 0 g l 1 while the feed stream flowrate and brine discharge rate were set at 0 81 and 0 07 ml min 1 respectively resulting in a fixed wr of 92 at a constant current density of 18 2 a m 2 the fcdi system exhibited an initial build up over about 3 days of electrolyte brine stream salinity from 2 to 20 g l 1 due to ion migration from the feed spacer chamber to the electrode chambers fig 3 a meanwhile the effluent dilute stream salinity dropped rapidly to a minimum value 0 26 g l 1 and then gradually increased to a fairly stable value 0 39 g l 1 with this behavior associated with ion back diffusion leakage from the electrode chamber furthermore the cell voltage exhibited a decline in accord with the reduced internal resistance of the fcdi cell si fig s4 however the system reached a steady state with marginal fluctuations for all monitored parameters i e dilute stream concentration brine concentration and cell voltage after approximately 3 days of operation the salt rejection rate stabilized at 80 5 while the brine stream reached a uniform concentration of 10 times that of the feed stream these results indicate that the feed steam can be successfully separated into a dilute stream the light shaded section in fig 3a and a brine stream the dark shaded section in fig 3a in a continuous manner the dashed line represents the theoretical variation of brine salinity c b as a function of time with this theoretical predicted behaviour obtained based on salt mass balance analysis within the flow electrode si fig s3 1 v f e d c b d t q d c f c d q b c f q b c b with c b obtained by solving the above equation details of the solution approach are provided in si text2 i e 2 c b q d q b c f c d 1 e q b v f e t c f where initial c b is equal to c f and v f e represents the total volume of the flow electrode 130 ml that is recycled in the fcdi apparatus it can observed from eq 2 that c b will gradually increase and reach a steady value q d q b c f q d c d q b as run time increases note that the theoretical variation of c b blue dashed line in fig 3a matches perfectly with the experimental results solid symbols indicating that the temporarily electrosorbed ions can be completely desorbed by simply mixing and neutralizing the exhausted flowable particles within the shared reservoir while it is reported that fixed electrodes may suffer from performance deterioration due to ion accumulation as a result of insufficient electrode regeneration during prolonged cycling cohen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a this side effect can be largely avoided as the carbon particles used here exhibited outstanding reversible charging discharging properties salt rejection rate current efficiency specific electric energy consumptions water recovery rate and energy efficiency are several critical indicators that are generally used to evaluate the performance of fcdi as shown in fig 3b the average salt rejection rate was 85 1 on day 1 decreased slightly to 80 9 in day 4 and remained stable for the rest of the operation time as for current efficiency although a high value of 94 8 was achieved on the first day it showed a gradual decrease and reached a stable value of 90 0 in the following days with this decrease partially attributable to the ion back diffusion leakage from the more concentrated flow electrode to the spacer chamber interestingly the specific electrical energy consumption showed an opposite trend with values decreasing from 0 56 kwh m 3 on day 1 to 0 50 0 52 and 0 53 kwh m 3 on days 4 9 and 14 respectively based on the definition of scc fcdi thermodynamic energy efficiency tee and wr provided in si text 1 it is pleasing to find that a high wr of 92 and tee of 16 2 can be achieved in this long term experiment a detailed comparison of the results obtained in the current study with the performance of fcdi systems documented elsewhere is provided in si table s2 as expected the asrr enrs and productivity values obtained in this study were comparable to previously reported values whereas other indicators such as wr and tee were considerably better than those documented in previous fcdi systems doornbusch et al 2016 gendel et al 2014 hatzell et al 2015 he et al 2018 ma et al 2020a rommerskirchen et al 2015 yang et al 2016b 2017 2019 3 3 evaluation of pressure drops in mf module and flow channels the pressure drops across the fcdi flow channels and the mf membrane were monitored in order to evaluate the pumping energy requirements no obvious variations of the pressure drop across the mf membrane were observed fig 4a and si fig s5 indicating that membrane fouling was minor over the extended operation note that most of the carbon particles have a diameter 20 100 times larger than that of the microfiltration membrane pore size 0 45 μm as such the carbon layer formed on the membrane surface is relatively loose and of high porosity would not be expected to influence brine permeation and can be easily removed via thorough flushing or backwash zhang et al 2011 the pressure drop across the fcdi flow channel however was found to almost double from 5 8 to 10 8 kpa after 14 days of prolonged cycling fig 4 a with this effect possibly a result of flow channel clogging and or increase in flow electrode viscosity while clogging did not appear to be significant in most scenarios si fig s6 the viscosity of the flow electrode carbon slurry did appear to increase with time fig 4b shows the viscosities of the flow electrodes samples as a function of shear rate before and after prolonged use with both samples demonstrating shear thinning pseudoplastic behavior campos et al 2013 the viscosity of the suspensions can be analyzed using the ostwald de waele power law model hatzell et al 2015 3 η κ γ n 1 where η is the viscosity κ is the consistency index γ represents the shear rate and n represents the shear thinning index a summary of rheological parameters of the flow electrode samples before and after use is shown in table 1 the consistency index κ increased dramatically indicating that the flow electrode became more viscous the reduction in flowability of the suspensions was likely due at least partially to the elevation of electrolyte salinity fig 3a and table 1 when the fcdi attained steady state indeed such a behavior has been suggested by previous investigators oncsik et al 2014 porada et al 2014 and confirmed by our results shown in si fig s7 and table s3 at higher electrolyte salinities repulsion between individual particles will be decreased as the electrical field associated with the electrical double layer is increasingly screened by the mobile ions in the electrolyte with the changes in electrostatic interactions between particles aggregates will form leading to reduced flowability of the suspensions as a result no doubt of the increased flow electrode viscosity the total specific pumping energy consumptions secpumping for flow electrode recycling and brine discharge increased by 83 3 from 0 06 to 0 11 kwh m 3 after prolonged operation fig 4a as calculated using eq s 13 the ratio of the secpumping to the sectotal increased from 9 7 to 17 9 3 4 characterizations of carbon electrodes before and after use it has been reported that fixed carbon electrodes may suffer from potential of zero charge shift pore structure collapse surface area reduction resistance increase and lifespan shortening after prolonged cycling as a consequence of faradaic reactions that will inevitably occur choi 2014 zhang et al 2018a 2019a while we have demonstrated that a stable desalting performance can be achieved using flowable carbon electrodes over prolonged operation the durability of these particle electrodes remains an open question in this section an array of characterizations including sem size distributions bet xps and zeta potential were carried out in order to quantify any changes occurring in the flow electrode carbon particles before and after use as can be seen from the sem photos shown in fig 5 a c the sizes of the pristine carbon samples day 0 were much larger than those of the used samples at days 4 and 14 further measurements of the particle size using the malvern mastersizer provided more accurate results fig 5d the pristine carbon particles possessed a d90 i e 90 of the particles exhibited sizes smaller than this value and d50 i e 50 of the particles exhibited sizes smaller than this value of 87 6 and 25 8 μm respectively compared to d90 and d50 values of the particles that had been recycled reused for 14 days of 33 6 and 12 9 μm respectively this significant reduction in particle size was most likely attributable to i the friction between the carbon particles and the liquid electrolyte flow channels pipes and iems ii high frequency collisions between the flowing particles iii mechanical rolling squeezing and abrasion of the carbon electrodes on passing through the peristaltic pump tubes tang et al 2018 the mechanical strength of carbon particles is generally recognized to be relatively poor cai et al 2004 zhou et al 2008 with the particles unable to withstand the severe friction and collisions associated with operation of the integrated fcdi mf systems leading to particle breakage attrition and size reduction the possibility that carbon oxidation might also contribute to particle size reduction was investigated by circulating the carbon slurry in the system without external current supply as shown in si fig s8 similar results were achieved indicating that mechanical friction and collisions were the primary contributors to carbon particle size reduction with the decrease of particle size the settle ability of the used carbon particles declined accordingly si fig s9 as observed from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 5e all the carbon samples exhibit a typical type i isotherm according to the bddt brunauer deming deming and teller classification do duong 1998 with this result indicating that mesopores and micropores were the main contributors to n2 adsorption the presence of a hysteresis loop at higher relative pressure confirmed the presence of mesoporous structures while the uptake of nitrogen at lower relative pressure signified the presence of microporous structures the textural parameters of all carbon samples i e bet surface area total micro meso pore volume and average pore diameter calculated from n2 adsorption isotherms are listed in table 2 as expected virgin carbon particles possessed the largest bet surface area and total pore volume of 1100 cm2 g 1 which decreased to 991 cm2 g 1 10 0 and 937 cm3 g 1 14 8 after use for 4 days and 14 days respectively in contrast the ratio of meso and total pore volumes increased slightly it has been documented that this phenomenon can result from the introduction of oxygen surface groups via carbon oxidation additionally the break up of the carbon particles may contribute to the above mentioned variations xps spectra of the c 1s and o 1s electrons for the carbon samples were performed to probe the changes of elemental content before and after use as shown in fig 6 a the overall profile of the c 1s electrons can be deconvoluted into several gaussian components with the largest peak at 284 5 ev assigned to the sp2 configuration cc and the satellite peaks appearing at 285 4 286 1287 5 and 288 7 ev confirmed to be c c c o co and o co respectively for the o 1s xps spectra fig 6b two components are deconvoluted which are ascribed to c o 532 4 ev and co 534 0 ev no obvious variation of either the composition or content of functional groups were observed for these carbon samples on extended particle use the carbon and oxygen atomic percentages were 96 5 and 3 5 at day 0 which only slightly changed to 94 9 and 4 7 at day 14 si table s4 demonstrating that only a small quantity of oxygen containing functional groups was introduced after 14 days of successive cycling as shown by fig 6c the zeta potential of the carbon particles shifted slightly in the negative direction after exposure to long term cycling such observations in agreement with the xps results presented above indicate that the surface of the carbon particles was only slightly modified on extended use with the minor changes observed unlikely to have a significant influence on ion electrosorption although a number of studies have reported the inevitable occurrence of carbon oxidation in typical cdi systems zhang et al 2018a it appears unlikely to be a significant cause for concern in our current fcdi system on one hand the steady state cell potential was 0 64 v slightly lower than the cell potential required i e 0 80 v to induce severe carbon oxidation bayram and ayranci 2011 on the other hand while the carbon particle electrodes likely experience mild oxidation during their brief passage through the positively charged chamber they will have an identical chance to undergo reduction during their transit through the negatively charged chamber while results from the current study demonstrated the robustness of the fcdi system for continuous operation over two weeks these experiments have been conducted using synthetic brackish water in a bench scale fcdi device with limited treatment capacity 10 l d 1 further efforts should be given to i investigation of the treatment of real brackish waters and development of effective control strategies with regard to the potential fouling scaling of the spacers membranes and electrodes ii preparation of inexpensive electrodes of high adsorption capacity and stability and selection of iems with low resistance and low water permeability iii multi scale modelling of the hydrodynamics and charge discharge properties of the flowable electrodes iv scale up of the fcdi system 10 m3 d 1 and implementation of field tests at much longer time scales 6 months 4 conclusions results of this study show that fcdi can be continuously and stably operated for two weeks whilst still sustaining a high desalinating efficiency 80 low energy consumption 0 5 kwh m 3 and high water recovery 92 furthermore the fcdi system used here achieved a high thermodynamic energy efficiency of 16 2 several times higher than conventional fixed electrode cdi 5 and fcdi systems documented elsewhere no obvious performance deterioration or membrane fouling was observed on extended operation xps and zeta potential tests revealed that minor oxidation of the carbon electrodes occurred after long term cycling the size of the carbon particles was found to be significantly reduced with their d50 size decreased from 25 8 μm at day 0 12 9 μm at day 14 most likely as a result of both the severe friction occurring in the flowing system and collisions between the particles and flow channels the knowledge and experience from current study will provide insightful guidance towards real application of fcdi technology such that energy efficient brackish water desalination can be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18122,recent findings have demonstrated that activated sludge morphology significantly impacts oxygen transfer efficiency ote in the activated sludge process in this study we developed a mechanistic understanding of this impact mixed liquor samples collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp were blended with a bulking activated sludge from a bench scale reactor bsr cultured on synthetic wastewater to manipulate various morphological parameters such as the settled sludge volume sv the sludge volume index svi and the specific filament length sfl the filaments that were present in the blended sludges consisted largely of type 0041 and type 021n which are commonly found in wwtps that treat domestic wastewater variations in sludge morphology as quantified by settled sludge volume after 30 min sv30 svi and sfl systematically affected the mixed liquor apparent viscosity μapp which consequently impacted ote an increase in the sfl from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 resulted in a 41 4 increase in apparent viscosity and a 24 6 decrease in volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla a new parameter named the ultimate settleability svult was developed by curve fitting the sv versus time data and found to relate with μapp through an expanded form of the einstein equation for the viscosity therefore svult is a corollary for the particle volume fraction that incorporates effects of both the sludge morphology and mass concentration on μapp theoretical derivation revealed that an increase in svult resulted in an increase in μapp which reduced oxygen transfer by increasing the air bubble size and reducing refreshment of the liquid at the gas liquid interface the kla was found to be inversely proportional to μapp 0 75 through fitting the experimental data with the theoretical model using a variance based global sensitivity analysis three operating parameters that have the most impact on oxygen transfer were identified the power input

transfer efficiency 1 introduction oxygen transfer efficiency ote is of paramount significance in the operation of activated sludge wastewater treatment processes air delivery to sustain microbial respiration is closely associated with the overall energy demand and subsequent sustainability of the process jenkins and wanner 2014 a comprehensive survey of wastewater treatment facilities in the usa has shown that 50 or more of the total energy demand associated with wastewater treatment is utilized for air delivery pabi et al 2013 this equates to approximately 0 3 of the total energy consumption in the usa bauer et al 2014 the issue of excessive energy consumption in wastewater treatment processes is not limited to the usa for example it has been reported that 20 of the total municipal energy consumption in germany is associated with wastewater treatment aeration sommer et al 2017 an increase in energy demand of up to 20 will occur over the next 20 years as the level of treatment required at these facilities increases usepa 2006 enhancements to the oxygen transfer process will immediately reduce the process energy demand not only will energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission be reduced but operations and maintenance costs associated with air delivery will decrease a significant body of work has been performed to elucidate major factors affecting the process ote amaral et al 2019 for example the solids retention time srt of an activated sludge process has been shown to impact ote short srts tend to reduce ote as compared to long ones rosso et al 2008 garrido baserba et al 2017 the reduction in ote is thought to be related to the presence of soluble organic compounds which can block the active surface area available for oxygen transfer reduce the liquid surface tension or increase the viscosity of the fixed liquid monolayer at the gas liquid interface therefore restrict oxygen transfer rosso et al 2006 long srts tend to exhibit enhanced ote which is thought to be associated with the degradation of soluble organic compounds including surfactants leu et al 2012 li 2016 mixed liquor biomass concentrations are negatively correlated to ote durán et al 2016 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 generally for mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mlss in excess of 5 000 mg l 1 the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is significantly reduced which is often expressed as a reduced alpha α value wagner et al 2002 krampe and krauth 2003 henkel 2010 here the α value is a lumped parameter that is used to account for many different phenomena that can potentially impact mass transfer many different empirical relationships have been developed to describe the kla and α as a function of the mlss ratkovich et al 2013 the impacts of mlss on oxygen mass transfer are thought to be associated with the apparent viscosity μapp which results in increased bubble coalescence increased bubble diameter and reduced bubble specific surface area schwarz et al 2006 cecconi et al 2020 also reported that the ote of a granular activated sludge system with a mlss of 10 g l 1 was 28 less than that of a regular activated sludge system with a mlss of 3 g l 1 3 2 primarily due to the high mlss of the granular activated sludge system which induces non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor and forces bubble coalescence however because of the diversity of available empirical relationships and the variability observed in the reported α values it is likely that the mlss alone is not the only factor affecting mass transfer floc size has been shown to affect oxygen mass transfer larger diameter flocs like those seen in granular activated sludge systems tend to increase mass transfer resistances for example it was demonstrated that for granular sludge the controlling mass transfer resistance exists at the liquid solid interface not the gas liquid interface as is typical for activated sludge processes this external mass transfer resistance was caused by the large particle size which reduces the active surface area over which mass transfer can occur wilén et al 2004a 2004b these resistances could only be overcome through an increase in the bulk solution dissolved oxygen do concentration wilén et al 2004a 2004b physical fouling and aging of fine bubble diffusers also impacts air delivery and the ote fouling consists of two separate mechanisms 1 plugging of diffuser pores with particulate matter or the formation of scale and 2 the formation of a biofilm on and within the diffuser campbell and boyle 1989 the plugging of pores with particulate contaminants in the gas or liquid phase can reduce the diffuser flux and increase the dynamic wet pressure dwp required to achieve the desired air delivery rate which can cause an overall loss in air delivery capacity and increase system operating air pressure that increases energy requirements rosso et al 2008 however the ote might increase marginally as the small pore openings result in smaller bubbles that enhance mass transfer but this impact appears to be offset by the associated increase in dwp the formation of biofilms on and within the diffuser has the opposite effect of increasing bubble size by causing channeling within and above the diffuser body and increasing airflow to larger orifices increasing bubble diameters and significantly reducing ote wagner and von hoessle 2004 garrido baserba et al 2016 diffuser aging can result in the loss of elasticity of the diffuser membrane and induce material creep which has the result of enlarging orifice openings generating larger diameter bubbles and reducing the ote kaliman et al 2008 in all the work that has been performed to date little attention has been paid to the impacts of the sludge morphology on the ote recently we have found that filamentous organisms increase the mixed liquor μapp significantly impeding oxygen transfer liu et al 2018 campbell et al 2019a 2019b the goal of this study is to develop mechanistic relationships between sludge morphology as described by the settled sludge volume sv the specific filament length sfl and the oxygen transfer these relationships shall be tested using activated sludge from a full scale wwtp treating domestic waste blended with bulking sludge from a bsr to manipulate morphological parameters and validate those intrinsic factors that impact the kla and ote 2 theoretical background oxygen transfer in an activated sludge reactor can be described based on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla this coefficient defines the rate at which oxygen moves across the active boundary layer present within the system oxygen mass transfer is a phenomenon that has many influencing factors including air bubble diameter gas hold up fraction mixing intensity etc assessing kla is critical to ascertain the overall effectives of the oxygen mass transfer process for the activated sludge process aeration tanks are three phase systems with solids microbial aggregates suspended in a bulk liquid solution and air is injected into the bottom of the aeration tank where it forms bubbles and rises through the bulk solution oxygen must transfer from the gas phase across the gas liquid interface to the bulk liquid and then from the bulk liquid into the microbial floc blanch and clark 1997 when operated at typical do conditions i e 2 0 mg l 1 the predominant resistances to mass transfer occur at the liquid side of the gas liquid interface due to the marginal solubility of oxygen in water at steady state conditions the volumetric gas flowrate of air entering the reactor is approximately equal to the volumetric gas flow rate of air leaving the systems at any given time the number of bubbles entering the reactor i e bubble flux can be determined by equation 1 1 n b q g v b where nb is the bubble flux s 1 qg is the volumetric gas flowrate m3 s 1 and vb is the volume of a single bubble m3 for small bubbles with diameters less than 2 0 mm it can be assumed that the bubbles are spherical with minimal surface undulations mcginnis and little 2002 the volume of each bubble can be calculated in the following fashion using equation 2 2 v b 4 3 π r b 3 π d b 3 6 where rb is the bubble radius m and db is the bubble diameter m the bubble diameter can be described based on kolmogorov s theory of isotropic turbulence the bubbles are constantly bombarded with turbulent eddies resulting in break up and coalescence of the bubbles as they rise through the bulk solution the liquid surface tension tends to resist break up whereas the shear force acting on the bubble tends to mediate its size hinze 1955 the resultant bubble diameter is proportional to the equilibrium of these two forces furthermore the bubble diameter is proportional to the ratio of bulk solution dynamic viscosity e g apparent viscosity to the dispersed phase dynamic viscosity e g the gas viscosity shown in equation 3 calderbank 1967 3 d b a σ 0 6

w vr is the reactor volume m3 ρl is the bulk liquid density kg m3 μapp is the apparent viscosity of the suspension pa s and μg is the gas viscosity pa s the gas holdup fraction describes the relative volume of the gas within the system and is a function of the bubble residence time the bubble flux and the reactor volume the bubble residence time is impacted by the convective motion of the bulk solution in the reactor and the terminal rise velocity of the bubble the terminal rise velocity can be described in terms of a summation of external forces acting on a bubble as it rises through the liquid phase including the bubble buoyant force the weight of the bubble and the drag force induced by the liquid as the bubble moves through it shown in equation 4 4 v b 4 d b g 1 ρ g ρ l 3 c d where v b is the terminal bubble rise velocity m s 1 ρg is the gas density kg m 3 cd is the bubble drag coefficient g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 the bubble drag coefficient is typically 0 44 for the turbulent flow regime crittenden et al 2012 equation 4 is applicable for bubbles in tap water that have a diameter less than 2 6 mm mcginnis and little 2002 the bubble residence time tr b s can then be determined as a function of the reactor depth above the bubble release point which is expressed as a fraction of the total reactor height and bubble rise velocity 5 t r b 5 6 h r v b 5 h r 3 c d 12 d b 0 5 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 where hr is the reactor height m the gas holdup fraction ϕ can then be calculated as the ratio of the total dispersed gas phase volume σvb to the total volume of the reactor here it is assumed that the total volume of the dispersed phase is insignificant when compared to the volume of the reactor 6 φ v b v r v b v b v r q g t r b v r the specific surface area across which mass transfer can occur within the system can then be described in terms of the gas holdup fraction and the bubble diameter calderbank 1958 7 a 6 φ d b substituting for the gas holdup fraction and the bubble diameter yields the following relationship 8a a 6 q g t r b v r d b 8b a 6 d b q g a r h r 5 h r 3 c d 12 d b 0 5 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 8c a 5 3 c d 2 1 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 1 d b

where ar is the reactor surface area and usg is the superficial gas velocity m s 1 u s g q g a r the mass transfer coefficient can be described based on the higbie penetration theory interpreted

of oxygen in water m2 s 1 kawase and moo young 1990 penetration theory describes the non steady state diffusion of low solubility gases such as oxygen into a mobile packet of liquid moving across the bubble surface as the bubble rises through the bulk solution higbie 1935 as can be seen in equation 9 there are two basic components that affect the liquid side mass transfer coefficient first there is the contribution of the diffusivity of the gas into the bulk liquid phase the second component is related to the intensity of exposure between the bubble and the discrete liquid packet that moves along the surface of the bubble the exposure intensity is affected by the mixing energy that is input into the reactor and the apparent viscosity of the liquid both of which impact the size of the liquid packet and the packet velocity relative to the bubble clearly a higher mixing intensity reduces the packet size and increases its relative velocity decreasing the exposure between air bubbles and liquid packets resulting in rapid refreshment of the bubble surface however increasing apparent viscosity causes a dissipation of momentum energy increasing the liquid packet size and reducing its mobility which results in an increase in exposure between air bubbles and liquid packets a subsequent reduction in the liquid packet refreshment reduces the rate of mass transfer combining the relationship for the specific surface area for the bubbles with the mass transfer coefficient yields the following equation for oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient 10a k l a 4 d o 2 π p v r 0

disregarded 3 materials and methods 3 1 activated sludge cultures two activated sludge samples were used for this study one of them was collected from the southwood ii swii wwtp located near rolla missouri usa the swii wwtp consists of a long srt 20 d activated sludge process with a preanoxic selector which receives effluent from household septic tanks the mixed liquor contained a negligible quantity of filamentous organisms the second sludge sample was collected from a laboratory complete mix 31 5 l bsr with a srt of 40 days as described previously campbell et al 2019a mixing was achieved with a six blade rushton turbine to achieve a root mean square rms velocity gradient g of 250 s 1 which is reflective of the upper end of the typical range of mixing intensity utilized in full scale reactors grady et al 2011 air was introduced into the reactor by a 0 61 m long pentair aquatic ecosystems bio weave diffuser hose air flow into the reactor was measured with a 2 4 l m 1 variable area rotameter cole parmer and adjusted multiple times daily to maintain a do of 2 mg l 1 synthetic wastewater was continuously fed at 63 lpd liter per day which consisted of organic carbon glucose c6h12o6 and ammonia nitrogen ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 dosed at concentrations of 180 4 9 2 mg cod l 1 and 42 4 1 71 mg n l 1 respectively trace elements and buffers were also added as previously described campbell et al 2019a this bsr sludge was a typical bulking sludge and contained a significant amount of filamentous organisms the two sludges were blended at varying ratios to obtain samples with varying morphological and operational parameters the goal in blending swii and bsr activated sludges was to maintain a constant mlss for all blended samples to assure that settleability was the only morphological parameter that varied the bsr sludge sample was initially diluted with the reactor effluent due to a higher initial mlss the diluted bsr samples were then mixed with swii mixed liquor at the following ratios to assure a reasonable range of settleabilities for analyses 5 1 bsr swii 1 1 1 2 5 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 morphological parameters of interest included sv at different time intervals sludge volume index svi sfl the filamentous index and μapp the sv and the svi were determined according to standard method 2710 b and c respectively apha et al 2000 mixed liquor samples were placed in a 1 0 l settleometer vessel the sv was recorded at 5 minute intervals for the first 30 min of the test and at 15 minute intervals for the second 30 min of the test the sv at 30 min sv30 was reported and utilized in analysis primarily because it is currently utilized in the industry to assess the operational performance of an activated sludge process the svi was calculated by taking the sv30 and normalizing it via the mlss of the sample a new parameter the ultimate settleability svult was calculated using the time series sv data for each activated sludge mixture here the times series data was fit to least squares regression to an exponential decay function having the form 11 s v s v u l t a e b t where svult a and b are constants 3 2 filament length analysis the sfl was determined via a microscopy combined with the image processing protocol we previously developed campbell et al 2019b briefly three 100 μl aliquots of mixed liquor were randomly sampled from each reactor and carefully placed on a glass slide to minimize the disruption of the native floc filament matrix images of mixed liquor samples were captured randomly from the slide using an olympus ckx41 inverted microscope fitted with a 10x phase contrast objective lenses and lumenera infinity 2 ccd camera images were saved at a resolution of 1392 1040 pixels in a 16 bit raw image format a minimum of 70 images were captured to assure that a statistically significant sample minimum of 625 floc was present contreras et al 2004 jarvis et al 2005 astm 2015 captured images were also analyzed utilizing the imagej software platform rasband 1997 2015 the image analysis protocol generally consisted of two discrete steps first the background was subtracted from the image next a series of morphological operations were performed on the images with the aim of creating an 8 bit binary image from which the projected area of the filaments could be extracted the projected filament areas were then statistically analyzed using microsoft excel the sfl was expressed on a per gram of biomass basis the statistical significance of the automatic thresholding protocol was determined by comparison with manually thresholded images 3 3 filament organism identification the identification of specific filamentous organisms present in the blended mixed liquor samples was performed in accordance with procedures established by jenkins et al 2004 a series of staining procedures was utilized in concert with the morphological assessment of filaments to facilitate a dichotomous identification of specific filaments staining procedures included the gram and nessier staining protocols thin smears of samples were prepared on the microscope slide and allowed to thoroughly air dry the samples were not heat fixed stained samples were examined under direct illumination at 800x magnification sulfur oxidation testing was performed utilizing a sodium sulfite solution sulfur deposits were identified at 800x magnification using a phase contrast microscope cell shape and size was determined using microscopy in concert with image analysis images were captured as described above the images were analyzed utilizing the imagej software package rasband 1997 2015 a series of 10 discrete random measurements of the cell geometries were collected manually and averaged to obtain a representative measurement for the sample the prevailing cell shape square rectangular oval barrel discoid etc was noted the filamentous index fi of each sample was also determined organisms were viewed at 100x and 800x magnification each sample was ranked on a scale of 0 6 based on the filament abundance a sample received a 0 value if no filaments were observed a sample received a 6 for excessive filament growth characterized by more filaments than floc and or filaments that were in high abundance in the bulk solution 3 4 viscosity measurement the μapp of activated sludge cultures was determined utilizing a parallel plate rheometer anton paar mcr 302 the rheometer plates had a diameter of 49 875 mm and were sandblasted the bottom plate was fixed and the top plate was allowed to rotate a plate gap of 1 5 times the maximum particle diameter was utilized to minimize the potential for wall effects and the formation of secondary flows the temperature of the sample was maintained at 20 0 c a shear rate of 150 s 1 was applied to the sample for a duration of 15 s the shear rate was then linearly decreased in a continuous fashion from 150 s 1 to 1 0 s 1 the resulting torque was utilized to determine the μapp of the mixed liquor the μapp was reported for a shear rate of 150 s 1 correspondent to the mixing intensity targeted during the experiment a detailed discussion of the viscosity measure has been previously provided campbell et al 2019b 3 5 dynamic our otr testing dynamic oxygen uptake rate our and oxygen transfer rate otr testing was performed on the blended mixed liquor samples the blended mixed liquor sample was placed into a reactor and aerated in the absence of influent substrate for 3 h prior to testing this pre test aeration was performed to assure that no residual substrate or internal storage components were present during the our otr testing that might otherwise impact the oxygen uptake measurement during the test the pre test aeration period also allowed the mixed liquor to reach a steady state prior to the commencement of testing once the pre test aeration period was complete the air delivery system was shut off and the do concentration was measured with respect to time the rate of change of the do was the oxygen uptake rate for the microbial community 12 d c d t o u r once the do reached a significantly low concentration i e 0 2 mg l 1 the air delivery system was turned on and the do was monitored with respect to time care was taken to obtain adequate sampling during the initial ascension portion of the do time curve and to allow the system to reach a quasi steady state condition at the end of the test the rate of change of the do was then calculated which is indicative of the otr reduced by the our 13 d c d t o t r o u r k l a c s a t c o u r where c s a t is the saturation do concentration in water mg l 1 which was adjusted for the reactor temperature and site barometric pressure equation 13 was fit to the data utilizing a least squares regression approach by adjusting both the k l a and c sat parameters two cycles of testing were performed without the substrate and with the substrate in this manner the endogenous our was directly determined and the maximum specific substrate utilization rate can be estimated by subtracting the endogenous our from the total our when substrates were present for this experiment a six position gang stirrer produced by phipps and bird was utilized to run tests concurrently each reactor had an average cross section of 11 6 cm 11 6 cm with an operating liquid depth of 14 6 cm resulting in a working reactor volume of 2 0 l the reactors were mixed with flat bladed turbines operated at a rotational speed of 112 rpm giving a root mean square velocity g of 150 s 1 which was indicative of the mixing intensities typically observed in full scale activated sludge systems grady et al 2011 air was introduced via a fine bubble diffuser installed at the bottom of each reactor and measured with a 2 4 l m 1 variable area rotameter cole parmer air flow was maintained at 0 47 l m 1 for each sample during the reaeration period of each test the do was measured with one ysi model 58 do meters fitted with a model 5829 polarographic probe installed in each reactor the meter probes were calibrated to accommodate for local barometric pressures and to assure that the probe response times were adequate to sample the data without bias according to the asce ewri 2 06 measurement of oxygen in clean water standard 2006 ammonia nitrogen was added as a substrate at a concentration of 12 5 mg l 1 in excess of the ammonia half velocity constant assuring steady zero order reaction kinetics for the duration of the testing with the substrate 4 results and discussion 4 1 activated sludge sample characteristics the dichotomous classification of filamentous organisms in the bsr sample as detailed in table s1 resulted in the identification of two distinct filamentous organisms jenkins et al 2004 the first was a long thick smoothly curved filament that extended from floc structures this filamentous organism was identified as type 0041 which tends to proliferate in long srt and low food to microbe ratio processes jenkins et al 2004 the second filament was long thin and smoothly curved this filamentous organism was identified as type 021n which tends to proliferate in processes with readily biodegradable substrates jenkins et al 2004 the operating conditions in the bsr promoted conditions for both filamentous organisms to grow the glucose utilized as an organic carbon source in the synthetic wastewater is readily biodegradable furthermore the operating srt was 40 d which corresponded to a f m of approximately 0 1 d 1 when these filamentous organisms were mixed with the swii samples they were representative of typical organisms seen in full scale wwtps for example a survey of wwtps demonstrated that type 0041 and 021n were ranked 3 and 4 respectively as the dominant filamentous organisms causing bulking in the united states jenkins et al 2004 the selection of these ubiquitous organisms and their relative predominance was likely a result of environmental and operating conditions selected for this experiment which are not dissimilar to those present at other wwtps as a consequence the observed results contained herein should reasonably describe the performance of full scale municipal treatment facilities a summary of results can be found in table 1 the raw swii sample had a mlss of 1 237 mg l 1 and demonstrated good settleability the resultant svi was 80 9 ml g 1 the sfl was determined to be 9 6 106 μm g 1 the μapp was 1 28 10 3 pa s and the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was 0 00431 s 1 the raw bsr sample had a mixed liquor of 2 132 mg l 1 with poor settleability resulting in an svi of 436 ml g 1 the sfl was determined to be 9 6 107 μm g 1 which was an order of magnitude greater than that of the swii sample the μapp and volumetric mass transfer coefficient were determined to be 3 27 10 3 pa s and 0 00212 s 1 respectively the bsr compared with the swii sample had approximately 200 the mlss and 300 the μapp resulting in approximately 50 the kla of the swii sample which highlighted the significant difference between the two raw sludges fig 1 a and fig 1g illustrate the morphological differences between the two native samples fig 1b through fig 1f are for blended sludge samples with different mixture ratios the swii sample consisted predominantly of floc forming organisms with a typical fi of 1 representative of very few randomly spaced filaments jenkins et al 2004 conversely the bsr had a mix of floc forming and filamentous organisms with bridging of discrete floc by filaments the filament concentrations of the bsr sample were excessive and indicative of a fi of 6 mixtures of the swii bsr samples had relatively constant mlss the goal was to target the existing swii concentration to minimize the potential deleterious impacts of biomass mlss on oxygen transfer the influence of the mlss on different parameters can be significant for example the role of the mixed liquor concentration in determining the μapp can be seen in fig 2 plotting the sv30 versus the μapp a linear increase in μapp can be observed across all swii bsr mixtures however the undiluted bsr sample significantly deviated from this linear system response here a 60 increase in the mlss resulted in an 80 7 increase in the μapp when the μapp data is normalized based on the mlss concentration the linear system response returns the blended samples demonstrated increasing sv30 svi sfl fi and μapp with increasing proportions of bsr mixed liquor added to the sample for example data in table 1 demonstrates that the addition of bsr sludge to the swii sludge at a mixture of 20 1 swii bsr resulted in an increase of the sv30 from 100 ml l 1 associated with the native swii mixed liquor to 175 ml l 1 the resulting 20 1 mixture had a svi of 130 ml g 1 further additions of bsr mixed liquor resulted in additional increases in both sv30 and svi at the 10 1 mixture ratio the svi exceeded the svi limit 150 ml g 1 associated with practical biomass liquid separation the svi measurement appeared to plateau above the mixture ratio of 2 5 1 with marginal increases observed in the sv30 values this plateau was likely associated with the morphology of the filaments present within the mixed liquor in spite of increasing sfl filament bridging of the floc matrix was significant enough that additional filaments did not result in noticeable differences in the settleability that was measured at the upper region of the mixture ratio range the observed fi conformed with the accepted protocol sludges with fi values of 3 or less common abundance or less were found to have reasonable settleabilities whereas the fi values of greater than 3 very common to excessive abundance demonstrated hindered settling 4 2 influence of morphology on the apparent viscosity fig 2a and c shows the impacts of the settleability and the sfl on the μapp when considering only the blended samples a generally linear 24 6 increase in the μapp was observed as the sfl increased from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 this system response highlights the impacts associated with the sludge morphology as described by the sv30 and sfl parameters when considering both the sludge morphology and the mlss impacts a non linear system response occurs this non linear response appears to be inversely proportional to the mlss concentrations once the μapp is normalized by the mlss the linear system response returns as illustrated by fig 2b and d this clearly demonstrates the influence of both the floc morphology and the mlss on the mixed liquor μapp filamentous organisms tend to increase the effective hydrodynamic radii of the sludge particles causing an increase in the apparent viscosity which reduces the oxygen mass transfer it must be noted that both the sv30 and sfl parameters are indicative of the hydrodynamic radius of the suspended particles within the mixed liquor the sfl may not completely encapsulate the true hydrodynamic radius as filament overlap resulting in enmeshment of the filaments that is difficult to detect with microscopic imaging the settleability may be more representative of the hydrodynamic radius of the particles however the sv30 is not indicative of the ultimate hydrodynamic radius the sv decreases over time until an ultimate settleability is achieved for example henkel demonstrated that there is a significant difference between raw activated sludge that has settled for 30 min and fixed activated sludge that is allowed to settle for 48 h henkel 2010 the disparity of the difference was increasingly noticeable with an increasing mlss concentration the long term settling data is more indicative of the ultimate settleability and the actual hydrodynamic radius of the particles in suspension however the use of toxic fixation agents and the extended duration of the test make the long term settling tests impractical to perform within the scope of this study fixed activated sludge samples were not prepared however the time series settling data for each activated sludge mixture was projected to estimate the svult using equation 11 as shown in fig 3 a the resultant relationship between the μapp and the svult shown in fig 3b appears to be reasonable demonstrating a coefficient of determination r2 0 9950 at small svult values the μapp approaches the viscosity of the aqueous solution with increasing svult an initial linear increase in the μapp is observed this initial linear relationship between μapp and the svult fit the theoretical plot based on the einstein equation which is shown as the dashed line in fig 3b using svult as the particle volume fraction above a critical svult a deviation from the linear system response occurs as the suspended particles tend to interact and dissipate momentum energy within the system here the particles tend to disrupt the flow field in the fluid resulting in a dissipation of momentum energy and an increased apparent viscosity measurement the observed results can be fit to an expanded einstein equation for viscosity of suspension which accounts for the system behavior at higher volume fractions of particles wagner and woutersen 1994 the expanded einstein equation takes the form 14 μ a p p μ 0 1 k 1 φ k 2 φ 2 where μ o is the viscosity of the pure aqueous solution 0 001 pa s and ϕ is the suspended particle volume fraction the k1 and k2 terms are proportionality constants that are a function of the type of particle that is present in the solution the k1 term is often referred to as the intrinsic viscosity of the dispersion which is the limiting viscosity within the dispersion as the volume fraction of particles approaches zero and is indicative of the particle contribution to the apparent viscosity hiemenz and rajagopalan 1997 for example for hard spheres that are sufficiently larger than the solution molecules the intrinsic viscosity is k1 2 5 macosko 1994 here the svult expressed as l l 1 is utilized as a surrogate for the volume fraction as illustrated in fig 3b a regression analysis of the μ app svult data was performed using equation 13 the analysis included the native bsr results which had a disparate mlss concentration it was determined that k1 2 33 and k2 1 16 r2 0 9950 the k1 is slightly less than the theoretical value of 2 5 for hard spheres however it has been demonstrated that for prolate particles having a high aspect ratio k1 may be as low as 2 0 jeffery and filon 1922 this deviation arises from the propensity of the prolate particles to align with the flow field macosko 1994 the experimentally derived k2 term is less than the value obtained for monodisperse and polydisperse hard spheres hard sphere particles are inherently rigid whereas the filaments and flocs are easily deformed by the flow field and particle to particle interactions it might be useful to consider the k2 term from the perspective of long chain high molecular weight polymer dispersions from the perspective the k2 term is equal to 15 k 2 k h k 1 2 where kh is the huggins coefficient the huggins coefficient for this system was determined to be 0 21 through curve fitting typically huggins coefficients less than 0 5 are indicative of good solvents that will tend to increase the excluded volume of the particle in suspension muthukumar and freed 1977 this finding is significant as mlss has been generally the only consideration in the assessment of activated sludge rheological properties ratkovich et al 2013 here it is clearly demonstrated that the svult is a reasonable descriptor of the μapp with an 86 reduction in the svult corresponding to a 62 concurrent decrease in the μapp when considering all samples the sv30 and svult are generally simple values to obtain in this study the svult is primarily a function of the sludge morphology but it also encapsulates the mlss concentration making it a useful predictor of μapp across a wide variety of conditions furthermore this finding demonstrates that even at low mixed liquor concentrations dramatic changes to the μapp can be observed with morphological changes to the activated sludge culture 4 3 influence of morphological parameters on oxygen transfer fig 4 shows the relationship between kla and svult sfl and μapp respectively it is obvious that the svult fig 4a describes the oxygen transfer performance better than the sfl fig 4b as described in further detail below the kla svult experimental data is well described by the derived and fitted model r2 0 9534 for the kla sfl data there is a deviation from the linear relationship observed in fig 4b r2 0 8495 it is likely that the two dimensional nature of the acquired images results in the loss of data pertaining to the hydrodynamic radius of the floc filament nature as a consequence there is increased scatter in the data it is anticipated that the fundamental impact of the svult on the kla is related to the μapp of the mixed liquor within the scope of this study the kla is utilized to characterize oxygen mass transfer as there is no easy way to directly quantify the gas film resistance however because the gas film resistance is significantly small compared to the liquid side resistances due to the marginal solubility of oxygen in water it can be ignored in this instance the volumetric mass transfer coefficient is approximately equal to the liquid side volumetric transfer coefficient blanch and clark 1997 fitting equation 10 to the experimental data yields proportionality constants b and c of 0 33 and 500 respectively fig 4c shows the curve fitting results r2 0 9850 equation 16 is developed through substitution of the proportionality constant into equation 10 16 k l a k l a 500 d o 2 0 5 g 0 5 p v r 0 85 ρ l 0 3 σ 0 9 μ g 0 5 μ a p p 0 75 u s g here the mass transfer coefficient is inversely proportional to the μapp raised to the three quarters power clearly changes in the μapp of the mixed liquor will significantly impact the kla value within the scope of this study the filaments increased the hydrodynamic radii of particles in suspension as evidenced by the increase in the svult with increasing sfl that is seen in table 1 this increase in the svult resulted an increase in the μapp as demonstrated in fig 3b the corresponding impact on the measured kla values was significant resulting in a 24 6 decrease associated with a 41 4 increase in μapp a variance based global sensitivity analysis was then performed to identify those operational parameters that had the most impact on the calculated results with the intent of simplifying the model described by equation 16 the sobol method was implemented in which a decomposition of model output variance is utilized to describe variances of the input parameters and interactions between parameters iooss and lemaître 2014 zhang et al 2015 seven input parameters associated with equation 16 were identified including 1 d o 2 2 p vr 3 ρl 4 σ 5 μg 6 μapp 7 and usg values of each parameter associated with the typical operating ranges for an activated sludge process were identified and are listed in table s2 a matlab implementation of the sobol method was utilized to identify the sobol indicies cannavó 2012 an indices threshold of 0 05 was utilized to identify the parameters that have significance to the output variance in the model as can be seen in fig 5 the three parameters having the most influence on the model variability were p vr μapp and usg based on these findings it can be understood that the model output is relatively invariant with respect to changes in the remaining parameters these parameters were subsequently grouped simplifying the model further as detailed in equation 17 the p vr and usg terms are related in that the reactor power input is a function of both the work performed by the mixer and the air bubbles rising through the mixed liquor with respect to time because of the universal nature of the significant parameters it is expected that equation 17 should be extensible to a wide variety of reactor configurations and operational conditions with the exception of mechanically aerated processes however this application limitation should not be significant as the general industry trend is to move away from mechanical aeration in favor of more efficient fine bubble diffused aeration 17 k l a k l a 0 00261 p v r 0 85 u s g μ a p p 0 75 the observed kla results can be viewed as a corollary for the system ote these results clearly demonstrate the impacts of the sludge morphology on the ote equation 17 also incorporates the impact of the mlss on the oxygen transfer vis à vis the kla value when considering that the mixed liquor μapp is impacted by the mlss and the sludge morphology the findings are applicable to real world operations as the experiment was performed in a controlled setting with activate sludge cultured on domestic waste the filaments observed have been identified as common organisms causing bulking at municipal wwtps in the united states equation 18 was developed by incorporating equation 13 into equation 17 directly linking kla and svult the model prediction is plotted in fig 4a the model prediction fits the experimental data well r2 0 9534 18 k l a k l a 2 61 10 3 p v r 0 85 u s g 1 02 10 3 2 38 10 3 s v u l t 1 18 10 3 s v u l t 2 0 75 these findings add to the currently available body of knowledge and provide additional clarity regarding the potential causes for reported variations in alpha values between experiments and facilities for example it has been identified that mlss is directly related to process alpha values henkel 2010 krampe and krauth 2003 wagner et al 2002 it has been further identified that μapp is likely a better parameter to describe changes in system alpha values krampe and krauth 2003 however a great deal of variance is present in the data provided in literature amaral et al 2019 the presence of filamentous organisms in an activated sludge culture is a continuum with a marginal concentration required to provide large stable floc sezgin et al 1978 it is hypothesized that much of the variance observed in the available alpha value data may be related to the variation in the specific filament length and or floc morphology this may never be known as information regarding sludge morphology is seldom incorporated in reports regarding these experiments it must be noted that this study was limited to two activated sludges that were blended to manipulate the morphology additional testing using activated sludge samples from different wwtps will be necessary to further validate the model activated sludge morphology does not only vary geographically but can also vary seasonally as operating conditions change long term testing at different facilities will be required to capture seasonal changes that may occur it is also important that when ote or α value results are reported the sludge morphology is also detailed so that reasonable comparisons can be made between seemingly disparate results these findings have other practical implications for example the nature of the reduction in ote in submerged membrane bioreactor mbr systems operating at high mlss has been elusive and requires further study schwarz et al 2006 this was precisely due to the use of the mlss only as a descriptor of the ote which neglected the activated sludge morphology and its role in ote the findings of this study should help to provide insight regarding the need for identification and optimization of activated sludge morphology to affect improvements in oxygen transfer 5 conclusions blended activated sludge samples consisting of mixed liquor from a domestic wwtp with low filament density and a bench scale reactor with high filament density were utilized to assess the impacts of activated sludge morphology on the apparent viscosity and oxygen mass transfer coefficient parameters measured within the scope of the experiment included the sv30 svi μapp and kla key findings include typical measures of activated sludge morphology were found to correlate quite well with the activated sludge apparent viscosity μapp for example an increase in the sfl from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 resulted in a 41 4 increase in the μapp the effects of mixed liquor suspended solids can also be addressed by expressing μapp per unit of mlss a new parameter svult which is estimated from available time series settleability data was developed and found to incorporate the effects of activated sludge morphology and mlss concentration on μapp this parameter was correlated to an expanded form of the einstein equation for viscosity of dispersions a descriptive equation was derived for the kla which was a function of system operating parameters a global sensitivity analysis revealed that p vr usg and μapp parameters had the most influence on the kla value the equation was calibrated to available data revealing that the kla is inversely proportional to μapp 0 75 a 41 4 increase in the μapp resulted in a 24 6 decrease in the

18122,recent findings have demonstrated that activated sludge morphology significantly impacts oxygen transfer efficiency ote in the activated sludge process in this study we developed a mechanistic understanding of this impact mixed liquor samples collected from a domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp were blended with a bulking activated sludge from a bench scale reactor bsr cultured on synthetic wastewater to manipulate various morphological parameters such as the settled sludge volume sv the sludge volume index svi and the specific filament length sfl the filaments that were present in the blended sludges consisted largely of type 0041 and type 021n which are commonly found in wwtps that treat domestic wastewater variations in sludge morphology as quantified by settled sludge volume after 30 min sv30 svi and sfl systematically affected the mixed liquor apparent viscosity μapp which consequently impacted ote an increase in the sfl from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 resulted in a 41 4 increase in apparent viscosity and a 24 6 decrease in volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla a new parameter named the ultimate settleability svult was developed by curve fitting the sv versus time data and found to relate with μapp through an expanded form of the einstein equation for the viscosity therefore svult is a corollary for the particle volume fraction that incorporates effects of both the sludge morphology and mass concentration on μapp theoretical derivation revealed that an increase in svult resulted in an increase in μapp which reduced oxygen transfer by increasing the air bubble size and reducing refreshment of the liquid at the gas liquid interface the kla was found to be inversely proportional to μapp 0 75 through fitting the experimental data with the theoretical model using a variance based global sensitivity analysis three operating parameters that have the most impact on oxygen transfer were identified the power input per unit volume the superficial gas flowrate and the μapp graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge morphology filamentous organisms ultimate settleability apparent viscosity oxygen transfer efficiency 1 introduction oxygen transfer efficiency ote is of paramount significance in the operation of activated sludge wastewater treatment processes air delivery to sustain microbial respiration is closely associated with the overall energy demand and subsequent sustainability of the process jenkins and wanner 2014 a comprehensive survey of wastewater treatment facilities in the usa has shown that 50 or more of the total energy demand associated with wastewater treatment is utilized for air delivery pabi et al 2013 this equates to approximately 0 3 of the total energy consumption in the usa bauer et al 2014 the issue of excessive energy consumption in wastewater treatment processes is not limited to the usa for example it has been reported that 20 of the total municipal energy consumption in germany is associated with wastewater treatment aeration sommer et al 2017 an increase in energy demand of up to 20 will occur over the next 20 years as the level of treatment required at these facilities increases usepa 2006 enhancements to the oxygen transfer process will immediately reduce the process energy demand not only will energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission be reduced but operations and maintenance costs associated with air delivery will decrease a significant body of work has been performed to elucidate major factors affecting the process ote amaral et al 2019 for example the solids retention time srt of an activated sludge process has been shown to impact ote short srts tend to reduce ote as compared to long ones rosso et al 2008 garrido baserba et al 2017 the reduction in ote is thought to be related to the presence of soluble organic compounds which can block the active surface area available for oxygen transfer reduce the liquid surface tension or increase the viscosity of the fixed liquid monolayer at the gas liquid interface therefore restrict oxygen transfer rosso et al 2006 long srts tend to exhibit enhanced ote which is thought to be associated with the degradation of soluble organic compounds including surfactants leu et al 2012 li 2016 mixed liquor biomass concentrations are negatively correlated to ote durán et al 2016 baquero rodríguez et al 2018 generally for mixed liquor suspended solids concentration mlss in excess of 5 000 mg l 1 the oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla is significantly reduced which is often expressed as a reduced alpha α value wagner et al 2002 krampe and krauth 2003 henkel 2010 here the α value is a lumped parameter that is used to account for many different phenomena that can potentially impact mass transfer many different empirical relationships have been developed to describe the kla and α as a function of the mlss ratkovich et al 2013 the impacts of mlss on oxygen mass transfer are thought to be associated with the apparent viscosity μapp which results in increased bubble coalescence increased bubble diameter and reduced bubble specific surface area schwarz et al 2006 cecconi et al 2020 also reported that the ote of a granular activated sludge system with a mlss of 10 g l 1 was 28 less than that of a regular activated sludge system with a mlss of 3 g l 1 3 2 primarily due to the high mlss of the granular activated sludge system which induces non newtonian nature of the mixed liquor and forces bubble coalescence however because of the diversity of available empirical relationships and the variability observed in the reported α values it is likely that the mlss alone is not the only factor affecting mass transfer floc size has been shown to affect oxygen mass transfer larger diameter flocs like those seen in granular activated sludge systems tend to increase mass transfer resistances for example it was demonstrated that for granular sludge the controlling mass transfer resistance exists at the liquid solid interface not the gas liquid interface as is typical for activated sludge processes this external mass transfer resistance was caused by the large particle size which reduces the active surface area over which mass transfer can occur wilén et al 2004a 2004b these resistances could only be overcome through an increase in the bulk solution dissolved oxygen do concentration wilén et al 2004a 2004b physical fouling and aging of fine bubble diffusers also impacts air delivery and the ote fouling consists of two separate mechanisms 1 plugging of diffuser pores with particulate matter or the formation of scale and 2 the formation of a biofilm on and within the diffuser campbell and boyle 1989 the plugging of pores with particulate contaminants in the gas or liquid phase can reduce the diffuser flux and increase the dynamic wet pressure dwp required to achieve the desired air delivery rate which can cause an overall loss in air delivery capacity and increase system operating air pressure that increases energy requirements rosso et al 2008 however the ote might increase marginally as the small pore openings result in smaller bubbles that enhance mass transfer but this impact appears to be offset by the associated increase in dwp the formation of biofilms on and within the diffuser has the opposite effect of increasing bubble size by causing channeling within and above the diffuser body and increasing airflow to larger orifices increasing bubble diameters and significantly reducing ote wagner and von hoessle 2004 garrido baserba et al 2016 diffuser aging can result in the loss of elasticity of the diffuser membrane and induce material creep which has the result of enlarging orifice openings generating larger diameter bubbles and reducing the ote kaliman et al 2008 in all the work that has been performed to date little attention has been paid to the impacts of the sludge morphology on the ote recently we have found that filamentous organisms increase the mixed liquor μapp significantly impeding oxygen transfer liu et al 2018 campbell et al 2019a 2019b the goal of this study is to develop mechanistic relationships between sludge morphology as described by the settled sludge volume sv the specific filament length sfl and the oxygen transfer these relationships shall be tested using activated sludge from a full scale wwtp treating domestic waste blended with bulking sludge from a bsr to manipulate morphological parameters and validate those intrinsic factors that impact the kla and ote 2 theoretical background oxygen transfer in an activated sludge reactor can be described based on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla this coefficient defines the rate at which oxygen moves across the active boundary layer present within the system oxygen mass transfer is a phenomenon that has many influencing factors including air bubble diameter gas hold up fraction mixing intensity etc assessing kla is critical to ascertain the overall effectives of the oxygen mass transfer process for the activated sludge process aeration tanks are three phase systems with solids microbial aggregates suspended in a bulk liquid solution and air is injected into the bottom of the aeration tank where it forms bubbles and rises through the bulk solution oxygen must transfer from the gas phase across the gas liquid interface to the bulk liquid and then from the bulk liquid into the microbial floc blanch and clark 1997 when operated at typical do conditions i e 2 0 mg l 1 the predominant resistances to mass transfer occur at the liquid side of the gas liquid interface due to the marginal solubility of oxygen in water at steady state conditions the volumetric gas flowrate of air entering the reactor is approximately equal to the volumetric gas flow rate of air leaving the systems at any given time the number of bubbles entering the reactor i e bubble flux can be determined by equation 1 1 n b q g v b where nb is the bubble flux s 1 qg is the volumetric gas flowrate m3 s 1 and vb is the volume of a single bubble m3 for small bubbles with diameters less than 2 0 mm it can be assumed that the bubbles are spherical with minimal surface undulations mcginnis and little 2002 the volume of each bubble can be calculated in the following fashion using equation 2 2 v b 4 3 π r b 3 π d b 3 6 where rb is the bubble radius m and db is the bubble diameter m the bubble diameter can be described based on kolmogorov s theory of isotropic turbulence the bubbles are constantly bombarded with turbulent eddies resulting in break up and coalescence of the bubbles as they rise through the bulk solution the liquid surface tension tends to resist break up whereas the shear force acting on the bubble tends to mediate its size hinze 1955 the resultant bubble diameter is proportional to the equilibrium of these two forces furthermore the bubble diameter is proportional to the ratio of bulk solution dynamic viscosity e g apparent viscosity to the dispersed phase dynamic viscosity e g the gas viscosity shown in equation 3 calderbank 1967 3 d b a σ 0 6 p v r 0 4 ρ l 0 2 μ a p p μ g b where a and b are constants of proportionality σ is the bulk liquid surface tension n m 1 p is the power input into the reactor by the impeller and or diffused aeration w vr is the reactor volume m3 ρl is the bulk liquid density kg m3 μapp is the apparent viscosity of the suspension pa s and μg is the gas viscosity pa s the gas holdup fraction describes the relative volume of the gas within the system and is a function of the bubble residence time the bubble flux and the reactor volume the bubble residence time is impacted by the convective motion of the bulk solution in the reactor and the terminal rise velocity of the bubble the terminal rise velocity can be described in terms of a summation of external forces acting on a bubble as it rises through the liquid phase including the bubble buoyant force the weight of the bubble and the drag force induced by the liquid as the bubble moves through it shown in equation 4 4 v b 4 d b g 1 ρ g ρ l 3 c d where v b is the terminal bubble rise velocity m s 1 ρg is the gas density kg m 3 cd is the bubble drag coefficient g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 the bubble drag coefficient is typically 0 44 for the turbulent flow regime crittenden et al 2012 equation 4 is applicable for bubbles in tap water that have a diameter less than 2 6 mm mcginnis and little 2002 the bubble residence time tr b s can then be determined as a function of the reactor depth above the bubble release point which is expressed as a fraction of the total reactor height and bubble rise velocity 5 t r b 5 6 h r v b 5 h r 3 c d 12 d b 0 5 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 where hr is the reactor height m the gas holdup fraction ϕ can then be calculated as the ratio of the total dispersed gas phase volume σvb to the total volume of the reactor here it is assumed that the total volume of the dispersed phase is insignificant when compared to the volume of the reactor 6 φ v b v r v b v b v r q g t r b v r the specific surface area across which mass transfer can occur within the system can then be described in terms of the gas holdup fraction and the bubble diameter calderbank 1958 7 a 6 φ d b substituting for the gas holdup fraction and the bubble diameter yields the following relationship 8a a 6 q g t r b v r d b 8b a 6 d b q g a r h r 5 h r 3 c d 12 d b 0 5 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 8c a 5 3 c d 2 1 g 0 5 1 ρ g ρ l 0 5 1 d b

where ar is the reactor surface area and usg is the superficial gas velocity m s 1 u s g q g a r the mass transfer coefficient can be described based on the higbie penetration theory interpreted through the lens of the isotropic turbulence theory the following relationship results 9 k l 4 d o 2 π p v r 0 25 1 μ 0 25 where kl is the mass transfer coefficient m s 1 and d o 2 is the diffusivity of oxygen in water m2 s 1 kawase and moo young 1990 penetration theory describes the non steady state diffusion of low solubility gases such as oxygen into a mobile packet of liquid moving across the bubble surface as the bubble rises through the bulk solution higbie 1935 as can be seen in equation 9 there are two basic components that affect the liquid side mass transfer coefficient first there is the contribution of the diffusivity of the gas into the bulk liquid phase the second component is related to the intensity of exposure between the bubble and the discrete liquid packet that moves along the surface of the bubble the exposure intensity is affected by the mixing energy that is input into the reactor and the apparent viscosity of the liquid both of which impact the size of the liquid packet and the packet velocity relative to the bubble clearly a higher mixing intensity reduces the packet size and increases its relative velocity decreasing the exposure between air bubbles and liquid packets resulting in rapid refreshment of the bubble surface however increasing apparent viscosity causes a dissipation of momentum energy increasing the liquid packet size and reducing its mobility which results in an increase in exposure between air bubbles and liquid packets a subsequent reduction in the liquid packet refreshment reduces the rate of mass transfer combining the relationship for the specific surface area for the bubbles with the mass transfer coefficient yields the following equation for oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient 10a k l a 4 d o 2 π p v r 0

disregarded 3 materials and methods 3 1 activated sludge cultures two activated sludge samples were used for this study one of them was collected from the southwood ii swii wwtp located near rolla missouri usa the swii wwtp consists of a long srt 20 d activated sludge process with a preanoxic selector which receives effluent from household septic tanks the mixed liquor contained a negligible quantity of filamentous organisms the second sludge sample was collected from a laboratory complete mix 31 5 l bsr with a srt of 40 days as described previously campbell et al 2019a mixing was achieved with a six blade rushton turbine to achieve a root mean square rms velocity gradient g of 250 s 1 which is reflective of the upper end of the typical range of mixing intensity utilized in full scale reactors grady et al 2011 air was introduced into the reactor by a 0 61 m long pentair aquatic ecosystems bio weave diffuser hose air flow into the reactor was measured with a 2 4 l m 1 variable area rotameter cole parmer and adjusted multiple times daily to maintain a do of 2 mg l 1 synthetic wastewater was continuously fed at 63 lpd liter per day which consisted of organic carbon glucose c6h12o6 and ammonia nitrogen ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 dosed at concentrations of 180 4 9 2 mg cod l 1 and 42 4 1 71 mg n l 1 respectively trace elements and buffers were also added as previously described campbell et al 2019a this bsr sludge was a typical bulking sludge and contained a significant amount of filamentous organisms the two sludges were blended at varying ratios to obtain samples with varying morphological and operational parameters the goal in blending swii and bsr activated sludges was to maintain a constant mlss for all blended samples to assure that settleability was the only morphological parameter that varied the bsr sludge sample was initially diluted with the reactor effluent due to a higher initial mlss the diluted bsr samples were then mixed with swii mixed liquor at the following ratios to assure a reasonable range of settleabilities for analyses 5 1 bsr swii 1 1 1 2 5 1 5 1 10 and 1 20 morphological parameters of interest included sv at different time intervals sludge volume index svi sfl the filamentous index and μapp the sv and the svi were determined according to standard method 2710 b and c respectively apha et al 2000 mixed liquor samples were placed in a 1 0 l settleometer vessel the sv was recorded at 5 minute intervals for the first 30 min of the test and at 15 minute intervals for the second 30 min of the test the sv at 30 min sv30 was reported and utilized in analysis primarily because it is currently utilized in the industry to assess the operational performance of an activated sludge process the svi was calculated by taking the sv30 and normalizing it via the mlss of the sample a new parameter the ultimate settleability svult was calculated using the time series sv data for each activated sludge mixture here the times series data was fit to least squares regression to an exponential decay function having the form 11 s v s v u l t a e b t where svult a and b are constants 3 2 filament length analysis the sfl was determined via a microscopy combined with the image processing protocol we previously developed campbell et al 2019b briefly three 100 μl aliquots of mixed liquor were randomly sampled from each reactor and carefully placed on a glass slide to minimize the disruption of the native floc filament matrix images of mixed liquor samples were captured randomly from the slide using an olympus ckx41 inverted microscope fitted with a 10x phase contrast objective lenses and lumenera infinity 2 ccd camera images were saved at a resolution of 1392 1040 pixels in a 16 bit raw image format a minimum of 70 images were captured to assure that a statistically significant sample minimum of 625 floc was present contreras et al 2004 jarvis et al 2005 astm 2015 captured images were also analyzed utilizing the imagej software platform rasband 1997 2015 the image analysis protocol generally consisted of two discrete steps first the background was subtracted from the image next a series of morphological operations were performed on the images with the aim of creating an 8 bit binary image from which the projected area of the filaments could be extracted the projected filament areas were then statistically analyzed using microsoft excel the sfl was expressed on a per gram of biomass basis the statistical significance of the automatic thresholding protocol was determined by comparison with manually thresholded images 3 3 filament organism identification the identification of specific filamentous organisms present in the blended mixed liquor samples was performed in accordance with procedures established by jenkins et al 2004 a series of staining procedures was utilized in concert with the morphological assessment of filaments to facilitate a dichotomous identification of specific filaments staining procedures included the gram and nessier staining protocols thin smears of samples were prepared on the microscope slide and allowed to thoroughly air dry the samples were not heat fixed stained samples were examined under direct illumination at 800x magnification sulfur oxidation testing was performed utilizing a sodium sulfite solution sulfur deposits were identified at 800x magnification using a phase contrast microscope cell shape and size was determined using microscopy in concert with image analysis images were captured as described above the images were analyzed utilizing the imagej software package rasband 1997 2015 a series of 10 discrete random measurements of the cell geometries were collected manually and averaged to obtain a representative measurement for the sample the prevailing cell shape square rectangular oval barrel discoid etc was noted the filamentous index fi of each sample was also determined organisms were viewed at 100x and 800x magnification each sample was ranked on a scale of 0 6 based on the filament abundance a sample received a 0 value if no filaments were observed a sample received a 6 for excessive filament growth characterized by more filaments than floc and or filaments that were in high abundance in the bulk solution 3 4 viscosity measurement the μapp of activated sludge cultures was determined utilizing a parallel plate rheometer anton paar mcr 302 the rheometer plates had a diameter of 49 875 mm and were sandblasted the bottom plate was fixed and the top plate was allowed to rotate a plate gap of 1 5 times the maximum particle diameter was utilized to minimize the potential for wall effects and the formation of secondary flows the temperature of the sample was maintained at 20 0 c a shear rate of 150 s 1 was applied to the sample for a duration of 15 s the shear rate was then linearly decreased in a continuous fashion from 150 s 1 to 1 0 s 1 the resulting torque was utilized to determine the μapp of the mixed liquor the μapp was reported for a shear rate of 150 s 1 correspondent to the mixing intensity targeted during the experiment a detailed discussion of the viscosity measure has been previously provided campbell et al 2019b 3 5 dynamic our otr testing dynamic oxygen uptake rate our and oxygen transfer rate otr testing was performed on the blended mixed liquor samples the blended mixed liquor sample was placed into a reactor and aerated in the absence of influent substrate for 3 h prior to testing this pre test aeration was performed to assure that no residual substrate or internal storage components were present during the our otr testing that might otherwise impact the oxygen uptake measurement during the test the pre test aeration period also allowed the mixed liquor to reach a steady state prior to the commencement of testing once the pre test aeration period was complete the air delivery system was shut off and the do concentration was measured with respect to time the rate of change of the do was the oxygen uptake rate for the microbial community 12 d c d t o u r once the do reached a significantly low concentration i e 0 2 mg l 1 the air delivery system was turned on and the do was monitored with respect to time care was taken to obtain adequate sampling during the initial ascension portion of the do time curve and to allow the system to reach a quasi steady state condition at the end of the test the rate of change of the do was then calculated which is indicative of the otr reduced by the our 13 d c d t o t r o u r k l

a least squares regression approach by adjusting both the k l a and c sat parameters two cycles of testing were performed without the substrate and with the substrate in this manner the endogenous our was directly determined and the maximum specific substrate utilization rate can be estimated by subtracting the endogenous our from the total our when substrates were present for this experiment a six position gang stirrer produced by phipps and bird was utilized to run tests concurrently each reactor had an average cross section of 11 6 cm 11 6 cm with an operating liquid depth of 14 6 cm resulting in a working reactor volume of 2 0 l the reactors were mixed with flat bladed turbines operated at a rotational speed of 112 rpm giving a root mean square velocity g of 150 s 1 which was indicative of the mixing intensities typically observed in full scale activated sludge systems grady et al 2011 air was introduced via a fine bubble diffuser installed at the bottom of each reactor and measured with a 2 4 l m 1 variable area rotameter cole parmer air flow was maintained at 0 47 l m 1 for each sample during the reaeration period of each test the do was measured with one ysi model 58 do meters fitted with a model 5829 polarographic probe installed in each reactor the meter probes were calibrated to accommodate for local barometric pressures and to assure that the probe response times were adequate to sample the data without bias according to the asce ewri 2 06 measurement of oxygen in clean water standard 2006 ammonia nitrogen was added as a substrate at a concentration of 12 5 mg l 1 in excess of the ammonia half velocity constant assuring steady zero order reaction kinetics for the duration of the testing with the substrate 4 results and discussion 4 1 activated sludge sample characteristics the dichotomous classification of filamentous organisms in the bsr sample as detailed in table s1 resulted in the identification of two distinct filamentous organisms jenkins et al 2004 the first was a long thick smoothly curved filament that extended from floc structures this filamentous organism was identified as type 0041 which tends to proliferate in long srt and low food to microbe ratio processes jenkins et al 2004 the second filament was long thin and smoothly curved this filamentous organism was identified as type 021n which tends to proliferate in processes with readily biodegradable substrates jenkins et al 2004 the operating conditions in the bsr promoted conditions for both filamentous organisms to grow the glucose utilized as an organic carbon source in the synthetic wastewater is readily biodegradable furthermore the operating srt was 40 d which corresponded to a f m of approximately 0 1 d 1 when these filamentous organisms were mixed with the swii samples they were representative of typical organisms seen in full scale wwtps for example a survey of wwtps demonstrated that type 0041 and 021n were ranked 3 and 4 respectively as the dominant filamentous organisms causing bulking in the united states jenkins et al 2004 the selection of these ubiquitous organisms and their relative predominance was likely a result of environmental and operating conditions selected for this experiment which are not dissimilar to those present at other wwtps as a consequence the observed results contained herein should reasonably describe the performance of full scale municipal treatment facilities a summary of results can be found in table 1 the raw swii sample had a mlss of 1 237 mg l 1 and demonstrated good settleability the resultant svi was 80 9 ml g 1 the sfl was determined to be 9 6 106 μm g 1 the μapp was 1 28 10 3 pa s and the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was 0 00431 s 1 the raw bsr sample had a mixed liquor of 2 132 mg l 1 with poor settleability resulting in an svi of 436 ml g 1 the sfl was determined to be 9 6 107 μm g 1 which was an order of magnitude greater than that of the swii sample the μapp and volumetric mass transfer coefficient were determined to be 3 27 10 3 pa s and 0 00212 s 1 respectively the bsr compared with the swii sample had approximately 200 the mlss and 300 the μapp resulting in approximately 50 the kla of the swii sample which highlighted the significant difference between the two raw sludges fig 1 a and fig 1g illustrate the morphological differences between the two native samples fig 1b through fig 1f are for blended sludge samples with different mixture ratios the swii sample consisted predominantly of floc forming organisms with a typical fi of 1 representative of very few randomly spaced filaments jenkins et al 2004 conversely the bsr had a mix of floc forming and filamentous organisms with bridging of discrete floc by filaments the filament concentrations of the bsr sample were excessive and indicative of a fi of 6 mixtures of the swii bsr samples had relatively constant mlss the goal was to target the existing swii concentration to minimize the potential deleterious impacts of biomass mlss on oxygen transfer the influence of the mlss on different parameters can be significant for example the role of the mixed liquor concentration in determining the μapp can be seen in fig 2 plotting the sv30 versus the μapp a linear increase in μapp can be observed across all swii bsr mixtures however the undiluted bsr sample significantly deviated from this linear system response here a 60 increase in the mlss resulted in an 80 7 increase in the μapp when the μapp data is normalized based on the mlss concentration the linear system response returns the blended samples demonstrated increasing sv30 svi sfl fi and μapp with increasing proportions of bsr mixed liquor added to the sample for example data in table 1 demonstrates that the addition of bsr sludge to the swii sludge at a mixture of 20 1 swii bsr resulted in an increase of the sv30 from 100 ml l 1 associated with the native swii mixed liquor to 175 ml l 1 the resulting 20 1 mixture had a svi of 130 ml g 1 further additions of bsr mixed liquor resulted in additional increases in both sv30 and svi at the 10 1 mixture ratio the svi exceeded the svi limit 150 ml g 1 associated with practical biomass liquid separation the svi measurement appeared to plateau above the mixture ratio of 2 5 1 with marginal increases observed in the sv30 values this plateau was likely associated with the morphology of the filaments present within the mixed liquor in spite of increasing sfl filament bridging of the floc matrix was significant enough that additional filaments did not result in noticeable differences in the settleability that was measured at the upper region of the mixture ratio range the observed fi conformed with the accepted protocol sludges with fi values of 3 or less common abundance or less were found to have reasonable settleabilities whereas the fi values of greater than 3 very common to excessive abundance demonstrated hindered settling 4 2 influence of morphology on the apparent viscosity fig 2a and c shows the impacts of the settleability and the sfl on the μapp when considering only the blended samples a generally linear 24 6 increase in the μapp was observed as the sfl increased from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 this system response highlights the impacts associated with the sludge morphology as described by the sv30 and sfl parameters when considering both the sludge morphology and the mlss impacts a non linear system response occurs this non linear response appears to be inversely proportional to the mlss concentrations once the μapp is normalized by the mlss the linear system response returns as illustrated by fig 2b and d this clearly demonstrates the influence of both the floc morphology and the mlss on the mixed liquor μapp filamentous organisms tend to increase the effective hydrodynamic radii of the sludge particles causing an increase in the apparent viscosity which reduces the oxygen mass transfer it must be noted that both the sv30 and sfl parameters are indicative of the hydrodynamic radius of the suspended particles within the mixed liquor the sfl may not completely encapsulate the true hydrodynamic radius as filament overlap resulting in enmeshment of the filaments that is difficult to detect with microscopic imaging the settleability may be more representative of the hydrodynamic radius of the particles however the sv30 is not indicative of the ultimate hydrodynamic radius the sv decreases over time until an ultimate settleability is achieved for example henkel demonstrated that there is a significant difference between raw activated sludge that has settled for 30 min and fixed activated sludge that is allowed to settle for 48 h henkel 2010 the disparity of the difference was increasingly noticeable with an increasing mlss concentration the long term settling data is more indicative of the ultimate settleability and the actual hydrodynamic radius of the particles in suspension however the use of toxic fixation agents and the extended duration of the test make the long term settling tests impractical to perform within the scope of this study fixed activated sludge samples were not prepared however the time series settling data for each activated sludge mixture was projected to estimate the svult using equation 11 as shown in fig 3 a the resultant relationship between the μapp and the svult shown in fig 3b appears to be reasonable demonstrating a coefficient of determination r2 0 9950 at small svult values the μapp approaches the viscosity of the aqueous solution with increasing svult an initial linear increase in the μapp is observed this initial linear relationship between μapp and the svult fit the theoretical plot based on the einstein equation which is shown as the dashed line in fig 3b using svult as the particle volume fraction above a critical svult a deviation from the linear system response occurs as the suspended particles tend to interact and dissipate momentum energy within the system here the particles tend to disrupt the flow field in the fluid resulting in a dissipation of momentum energy and an increased apparent viscosity measurement the observed results can be fit to an expanded einstein equation for viscosity of suspension which accounts for the system behavior at higher volume fractions of particles wagner and woutersen 1994 the expanded einstein equation takes the form 14 μ a p p μ 0 1 k 1 φ k 2 φ 2 where μ o is the viscosity of the pure aqueous solution 0 001 pa s and ϕ is the suspended particle volume fraction the k1 and k2 terms are proportionality constants that are a function of the type of particle that is present in the solution the k1 term is often referred to as the intrinsic viscosity of the dispersion which is the limiting viscosity within the dispersion as the volume fraction of particles approaches zero and is indicative of the particle contribution to the apparent viscosity hiemenz and rajagopalan 1997 for example for hard spheres that are sufficiently larger than the solution molecules the intrinsic viscosity is k1 2 5 macosko 1994 here the svult expressed as l l 1 is utilized as a surrogate for the volume fraction as illustrated in fig 3b a regression analysis of the μ app svult data was performed using equation 13 the analysis included the native bsr results which had a disparate mlss concentration it was determined that k1 2 33 and k2 1 16 r2 0 9950 the k1 is slightly less than the theoretical value of 2 5 for hard spheres however it has been demonstrated that for prolate particles having a high aspect ratio k1 may be as low as 2 0 jeffery and filon 1922 this deviation arises from the propensity of the prolate particles to align with the flow field macosko 1994 the experimentally derived k2 term is less than the value obtained for monodisperse and polydisperse hard spheres hard sphere particles are inherently rigid whereas the filaments and flocs are easily deformed by the flow field and particle to particle interactions it might be useful to consider the k2 term from the perspective of long chain high molecular weight polymer dispersions from the perspective the k2 term is equal to 15 k 2 k h k 1 2 where kh is the huggins coefficient the huggins coefficient for this system was determined to be 0 21 through curve fitting typically huggins coefficients less than 0 5 are indicative of good solvents that will tend to increase the excluded volume of the particle in suspension muthukumar and freed 1977 this finding is significant as mlss has been generally the only consideration in the assessment of activated sludge rheological properties ratkovich et al 2013 here it is clearly demonstrated that the svult is a reasonable descriptor of the μapp with an 86 reduction in the svult corresponding to a 62 concurrent decrease in the μapp when considering all samples the sv30 and svult are generally simple values to obtain in this study the svult is primarily a function of the sludge morphology but it also encapsulates the mlss concentration making it a useful predictor of μapp across a wide variety of conditions furthermore this finding demonstrates that even at low mixed liquor concentrations dramatic changes to the μapp can be observed with morphological changes to the activated sludge culture 4 3 influence of morphological parameters on oxygen transfer fig 4 shows the relationship between kla and svult sfl and μapp respectively it is obvious that the svult fig 4a describes the oxygen transfer performance better than the sfl fig 4b as described in further detail below the kla svult experimental data is well described by the derived and fitted model r2 0 9534 for the kla sfl data there is a deviation from the linear relationship observed in fig 4b r2 0 8495 it is likely that the two dimensional nature of the acquired images results in the loss of data pertaining to the hydrodynamic radius of the floc filament nature as a consequence there is increased scatter in the data it is anticipated that the fundamental impact of the svult on the kla is related to the μapp of the mixed liquor within the scope of this study the kla is utilized to characterize oxygen mass transfer as there is no easy way to directly quantify the gas film resistance however because the gas film resistance is significantly small compared to the liquid side resistances due to the marginal solubility of oxygen in water it can be ignored in this instance the volumetric mass transfer coefficient is approximately equal to the liquid side volumetric transfer coefficient blanch and clark 1997 fitting equation 10 to the experimental data yields proportionality constants b and c of 0 33 and 500 respectively fig 4c shows the curve fitting results r2 0 9850 equation 16 is developed through substitution of the proportionality constant into equation 10 16 k l a k l a 500 d o 2 0 5 g 0 5 p v r 0 85 ρ l 0 3 σ 0 9 μ g 0 5 μ a p p 0 75 u s g here the mass transfer coefficient is inversely proportional to the μapp raised to the three quarters power clearly changes in the μapp of the mixed liquor will significantly impact the kla value within the scope of this study the filaments increased the hydrodynamic radii of particles in suspension as evidenced by the increase in the svult with increasing sfl that is seen in table 1 this increase in the svult resulted an increase in the μapp as demonstrated in fig 3b the corresponding impact on the measured kla values was significant resulting in a 24 6 decrease associated with a 41 4 increase in μapp a variance based global sensitivity analysis was then performed to identify those operational parameters that had the most impact on the calculated results with the intent of simplifying the model described by equation 16 the sobol method was implemented in which a decomposition of model output variance is utilized to describe variances of the input parameters and interactions between parameters iooss and lemaître 2014 zhang et al 2015 seven input parameters associated with equation 16 were identified including 1 d o 2 2 p vr 3 ρl 4 σ 5 μg 6 μapp 7 and usg values of each parameter associated with the typical operating ranges for an activated sludge process were identified and are listed in table s2 a matlab implementation of the sobol method was utilized to identify the sobol indicies cannavó 2012 an indices threshold of 0 05 was utilized to identify the parameters that have significance to the output variance in the model as can be seen in fig 5 the three parameters having the most influence on the model variability were p vr μapp and usg based on these findings it can be understood that the model output is relatively invariant with respect to changes in the remaining parameters these parameters were subsequently grouped simplifying the model further as detailed in equation 17 the p vr and usg terms are related in that the reactor power input is a function of both the work performed by the mixer and the air bubbles rising through the mixed liquor with respect to time because of the universal nature of the significant parameters it is expected that equation 17 should be extensible to a wide variety of reactor configurations and operational conditions with the exception of mechanically aerated processes however this application limitation should not be significant as the general industry trend is to move away from mechanical aeration in favor of more efficient fine bubble diffused aeration 17 k l a k l a 0 00261 p v r 0 85 u s g μ a p p 0 75 the observed kla results can be viewed as a corollary for the system ote these results clearly demonstrate the impacts of the sludge morphology on the ote equation 17 also incorporates the impact of the mlss on the oxygen transfer vis à vis the kla value when considering that the mixed liquor μapp is impacted by the mlss and the sludge morphology the findings are applicable to real world operations as the experiment was performed in a controlled setting with activate sludge cultured on domestic waste the filaments observed have been identified as common organisms causing bulking at municipal wwtps in the united states equation 18 was developed by incorporating equation 13 into equation 17 directly linking kla and svult the model prediction is plotted in fig 4a the model prediction fits the experimental data well r2 0 9534 18 k l a k l a 2 61 10 3 p v r 0 85 u s g 1 02 10 3 2 38 10 3 s v u l t 1 18 10 3 s v u l t 2 0 75 these findings add to the currently available body of knowledge and provide additional clarity regarding the potential causes for reported variations in alpha values between experiments and facilities for example it has been identified that mlss is directly related to process alpha values henkel 2010 krampe and krauth 2003 wagner et al 2002 it has been further identified that μapp is likely a better parameter to describe changes in system alpha values krampe and krauth 2003 however a great deal of variance is present in the data provided in literature amaral et al 2019 the presence of filamentous organisms in an activated sludge culture is a continuum with a marginal concentration required to provide large stable floc sezgin et al 1978 it is hypothesized that much of the variance observed in the available alpha value data may be related to the variation in the specific filament length and or floc morphology this may never be known as information regarding sludge morphology is seldom incorporated in reports regarding these experiments it must be noted that this study was limited to two activated sludges that were blended to manipulate the morphology additional testing using activated sludge samples from different wwtps will be necessary to further validate the model activated sludge morphology does not only vary geographically but can also vary seasonally as operating conditions change long term testing at different facilities will be required to capture seasonal changes that may occur it is also important that when ote or α value results are reported the sludge morphology is also detailed so that reasonable comparisons can be made between seemingly disparate results these findings have other practical implications for example the nature of the reduction in ote in submerged membrane bioreactor mbr systems operating at high mlss has been elusive and requires further study schwarz et al 2006 this was precisely due to the use of the mlss only as a descriptor of the ote which neglected the activated sludge morphology and its role in ote the findings of this study should help to provide insight regarding the need for identification and optimization of activated sludge morphology to affect improvements in oxygen transfer 5 conclusions blended activated sludge samples consisting of mixed liquor from a domestic wwtp with low filament density and a bench scale reactor with high filament density were utilized to assess the impacts of activated sludge morphology on the apparent viscosity and oxygen mass transfer coefficient parameters measured within the scope of the experiment included the sv30 svi μapp and kla key findings include typical measures of activated sludge morphology were found to correlate quite well with the activated sludge apparent viscosity μapp for example an increase in the sfl from 9 61 106 μm g 1 to 6 88 107 μm g 1 resulted in a 41 4 increase in the μapp the effects of mixed liquor suspended solids can also be addressed by expressing μapp per unit of mlss a new parameter svult which is estimated from available time series settleability data was developed and found to incorporate the effects of activated sludge morphology and mlss concentration on μapp this parameter was correlated to an expanded form of the einstein equation for viscosity of dispersions a descriptive equation was derived for the kla which was a function of system operating parameters a global sensitivity analysis revealed that p vr usg and μapp parameters had the most influence on the kla value the equation was calibrated to available data revealing that the kla is inversely proportional to μapp 0 75 a 41 4 increase in the μapp resulted in a 24 6 decrease in the

18123,a process of denitrification filter dnf coupled with ultrafiltration uf and ozonation dnf uf o3 has been widely applied to advanced nitrogen removal for wastewater reclamation despite of the effective removal of nitrogen by dnf the influence of dnf stage on the operation of uf was still unclear in this study a laboratory filtration system was used to investigate the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent and the fouling control of ozonation the membrane fouling potential was proved to be increased significantly after dnf stage and alleviated with ozonation treatment with the help of uv vis fluorescence spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and molecular weight mw analysis the change of dom component characteristics was proved to be in accordance with the change of fouling potential the water samples were further fractionated into six hydrophobic hydrophilic acidic basic neutral fractions among which hydrophobic acids hoa and hydrophobic neutrals hon dominated the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent detailed study of each fraction revealed that higher mw components in hoa and hon played a crucial role in the fouling of uf membrane the dominant component of membrane fouling could be degraded and removed by ozonation and therefore significant fouling alleviation was achieved these results indicated that in the process of wastewater reclamation besides conventional water quality indexes more detailed water features should also be taken into consideration to optimize the whole process moreover the control effects by ozonation could be monitored simply according to the change of specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence intensity as surrogates in engineering applications according to these results a modified dnf o3 uf process with o3 dosage of 3 mg l was proposed simply by reversing the sequence of uf and o3 with no more infrastructure this modified dnf o3 uf process was expected to enlarge the produce capacity of reclaimed water with much lower electricity costs and chemical consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification effluent membrane fouling potential ozonation control mechanism component characteristics 1 introduction wastewater reclamation is an important strategy to solve water scarcity and ensure sustainable development reclaimed water has been applied extensively in landscape utilization replenishment of landscape water with reclaimed water demands higher water quality than simple discharge including low concentration of suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp to ensure sensory pleasure and water safety ao et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2017b to meet the standard of landscape use the denitrification filter dnf followed by ultrafiltration uf and ozonation has a broad application in wastewater reclamation plants wwrps in china for advanced nitrogen removal and better water quality in the case of beijing the process of dnf uf o3 has been applied in 6 large scale wwrps with the total capacity of 2 380 000 m3 d including the wwrp of gaobeidian one of the largest wwrp in the world 1 000 000 m3 d the schematic diagram of the conventional treatment process was shown in fig 1 a although the denitrification filter removes nitrogen significantly the changes of dissolved organic matters dom during denitrification process including soluble microbial products smps and the excess carbon source such as methanol etc may impact the fouling potential of subsequent ultrafiltration in the practical operation of uf membrane fouling which increases energy consumption and affects the stability of the whole process is one of the most crucial problem ma et al 2019 yoo 2018 however studies about the influences of dnf process on uf membrane fouling are still limited and further exploration is rather in need according to previous literatures which focused on the fouling of membrane bioreactor mbr integrated with anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process denitrification process might cause fouling deterioration kim and nakhla 2010 lee et al 2014 rosenberger et al 2006 few previous studies focused on the effect of denitrification process on membrane fouling jang et al 2006 concluded that the effluent of denitrification showed higher membrane fouling rates than that of nitrification due to the smaller floc size increased smps and floc deterioration with increased hydrophobicity ma et al 2006 reported that anoxic oxic phase showed lower permeability of membrane than only oxic phase because of the smaller flocs lee et al 2014 reported that anoxic mbr had some drawbacks on the fouling control compared to aerobic mbr the fouling problem of anoxic process was attributed to the smaller floc size lower porosity in biofilm as well as higher cake layer resistance at low concentration of dissolved oxygen during denitrification jin et al 2006 kang et al 2003 kim and nakhla 2009 wang et al 2018 nevertheless the mechanism of membrane fouling in dnf uf process which is supposed to be quite different from that in mbr has not been reported due to the filtration capability of dnf dom in the effluent of dnf rather than flocs could be the primary foulant however since it is difficult to separate natural organic matters nom polysaccharides and protein from each other zhu et al 2010 fouling mechanism of effluent of dnf is rather complicated and remains to be explored resin fractionation has been widely used to identify the components of dom in secondary effluent shen et al 2012 tang et al 2013 2014 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and acidity basicity were considered as key physicochemical properties that influence fouling xiao et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2012 according to literatures different hydrophobic hydrophilic and acidic basic components fractionated from the same water sample had different fouling potential and the key factor that lead to membrane fouling was diverse in different influent and membrane systems kim and dempsey 2008 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 therefore in order to understand the fouling mechanism and improve the operation performance it is crucial to identify the critical fraction in dom that dominates the membrane fouling of dnf uf process in order to control membrane fouling recent researches have investigated a variety of pretreatments including coagulation fan et al 2018 song et al 2019 adsorption kimura and oki 2017 ion exchange filloux et al 2016 metcalfe et al 2016 oxidation benito et al 2017 jeong et al 2014 tian et al 2018 and so on among these processes ozonation was proved to be a promising option to alleviate membrane fouling wang et al 2017a yu et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 owing to its prominent advantage of altering the composition and chemical properties of dom especially molecular weight mw distribution hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and functional groups jin et al 2016 2019 sun et al 2019 in this study we explored the uf membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent by a laboratory filtration system with a single hollow fiber membrane furthermore we investigated the control effect and mechanism of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential as well as dom component characteristics of dnf effluent based on the research results a new dnf o3 uf process fig 1b was proposed which was modified from the conventional process of dnf uf o3 simply by reversing the sequence of uf and o3 with no further infrastructure and operating costs this study helps glean valuable insight into the dnf o3 uf process in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water the feed water used in this study were the influent domestic secondary effluent and effluent of dnf collected from the wwrp of

dead end filtration the ultrafiltration membrane supplied by originwater in this study was the same as that in the wwrp in fig 1 which has a nominal pore diameter of 0 02 μm at the conditions of this study the pure water permeability of the module was 0 18 m h with the transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 2 bar the maximum tmp was fixed at 3 bar and the filtration time was selected as monitoring parameter when the tmp reached 3 bar the pump was stopped at once a constant flow pump was set to maintain the flow rate at 1 5 ml min corresponding to working flux of 0 18 m h while a pressure sensor was used to monitor the tmp during filtration to show the degree of membrane fouling the flow rate of the filtrate was monitored by an electronic balance in real time the filtration experiment was conducted indoors and the temperature was about 25 c each filtration experiment in this study has been repeated 3 times 2 3 fractionation procedure water samples were fractionated into six components

treatment by dnf o3 uf process tn cod and doc concentrations of the dnf influent and effluent were shown in table 1 tn was significantly removed by dnf and the tn concentration of effluent was stably below 10 mg l as an indicator of organic pollutants the cod concentrations of the two water samples showed little difference in the two months of monitoring while the doc concentration of dnf effluent was twice that of the influent which was often ignored by the wwrt fig 3 showed the change in tmp during ultrafiltration tested in laboratory in our filtration system shorter filtration time for tmp to reach 3 bar corresponded to higher membrane fouling potential as for the same cod concentration of 9 mg l the tmp of dnf effluent rapidly increased to 3 bar only after 54 min filtration while the tmp of dnf influent took 155 min to reach 2 4 bar fig 3 a when then doc concentration was set as 4 mg l the filtration time of influent was about 1 8 times the effluent fig 3 b according to these results the effluent of dnf showed higher fouling potential than the influent whether at the same cod or doc concentration indicating membrane fouling deterioration during the conventional dnf uf o3 process despite of the effective removal of tn the application of dnf process aggravated the fouling of subsequent uf membrane and thus dnf uf o3 process needs to be improved a modified dnf o3 uf process was explored to use ozonation treatment for reduction of membrane fouling the fouling control of dnf effluent with ozonation was shown in fig 4 the control sample without ozonation showed the fastest fouling rate with the tmp gradually increased to 3 bar after 80 min filtration however membrane fouling was effectively alleviated for the water samples with ozonation and the alleviation performance was more significant with increased o3 dosage the filtration time for tmp at 3 bar extended to 90 128 159 211 297 min with o3 dosage of 0 1 0 25 1 1 5 and 2 mg o3 mg c respectively notably the filtration time was prolonged by 3 75 times compared with original dnf effluent with 2 mg o3 mg c treatment demonstrating the effective alleviation performance of membrane fouling by ozonation these results indicated that uf membrane fouling could be controlled with a low o3 dosage in the previous study it was found that during the ozonation of reclaimed water the residual ozone could be detected only if the ozone dosage was higher than the instantaneous ozone demand iod of reclaimed water xi et al 2017 typically the iod of reclaimed water was in the range from 2 to 6 mg l and therefore the risk of membrane damage caused by o3 could be avoided with low dosage of ozone tang et al 2017 in brief uf membrane fouling potential of reclaimed water was increased after dnf stage and then reduced effectively by ozonation treatment during dnf o3 uf process 3 2 the change of dom component characteristics of reclaimed water during the treatment by dnf o3 uf process fluorescence eem analysis of influent and effluent with different ozone dosage was shown in fig 5 compared with the influent of dnf fig 5 a the dnf effluent fig 5 b showed higher fluorescence intensity especially in region iii iv and v which suggested the changes in fluorescent components of dom during dnf process however the fluorescence intensity of effluent reduced significantly with increased ozone dosage fig 5 b h and no fluorescence could be observed with 1 5 and 2 mg o3 mg c treatment the fluorescent intensity and proportion of five regions in eem spectra of dnf effluent by ozonation with different o3 dosages were shown in fig s1 and the results suggested balanced degradation of different dom components in water samples by ozone the decrease of intensity suggested the depletion or variation of fluorescent chromophores in dnf effluent after ozonation treatment the change of fluorescence intensity of reclaimed water increased after dnf stage and then decreased after ozonation treatment was in accordance with the change of membrane fouling potential during dnf o3 uf process therefore the change of fouling performance was probably due to the change of dom components which could be characterized by fluorescence eem analysis however cod or doc concentration could not precisely represent the fouling potential due to the different fouling properties of water samples at the same cod doc value as revealed in fig 3 therefore in order to clarify the mechanism of membrane fouling it is of great importance to study the specific fractions and component characteristics of reclaimed water during the treatment by dnf o3 uf process hpsec uv results revealed that the abundance of chromophores in all mw fractions decreased gradually when the o3 dosage increased fig s2 to further quantify the changes of different mw components with ozonation treatment hpsec chromatograms were deconvoluted into a series of gaussian peaks by peakffit based on the reported protocol wang et al 2017c the fitting gaussian peaks were divided into three parts f1 f2 and f3 which represented high 4000 da medium 2000 4000 da and low 2000 da mw components in water samples respectively the peakfit results were shown as fig s3 all three mw components were efficiently degraded to different extent by ozonation treatment fig 6 specifically f1 component was removed by 71 9 with the dosage of 2 mg o3 mg c while the degradation of other two components were both nearly 55 the different removal performances suggested that o3 preferentially reacted with high mw component compared with lower mw components these results indicated that ozonation could effectively change the mw distribution of dnf effluent thus affecting the fouling potential as shown in fig 7 different doc and uv254 distributions of the six components fractionated from the influent effluent and pre ozonized effluent with 2 mg o3 mg c of dnf were observed the doc proportions of hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions in dnf influent which were 43 9 and 56 1 respectively were quite close hin and hon were the two dominant fractions in the influent and accounted for approximately 40 and 30 of doc respectively different from influent hydrophobic fractions of dnf effluent were the dominant components the proportion of hon further increased to 37 1 which is much higher than other fractions similarly the proportion of hoa also increased significantly from 8 in influent to 20 8 after dnf process however hydrophobic fractions especially hon and hoa decreased significantly after ozonation treatment accounting for only 25 7 and 7 3 respectively quite differently the proportion of hob and hib fractions in reclaimed water remained nearly constant at approximately 5 during the treatment by dnf o3 uf process the uv254 value and contribution of three water samples were rather different as shown in fig 7 b uv254 value increased greatly after denitrification stage and dropped by half after ozonation treatment which was also in accordance with the change of membrane fouling potential during dnf o3 uf process specifically uv254 value of hydrophobic fractions changed significantly during the treatment while the absorption of hydrophilic components was nearly invariable doc and uv254 distributions of the six components fractionated from the effluent treated with 0 25 mg o3 mg c were shown in fig s4 and similar variation trends were observed based on the results discussed above it is inferred that the change of hydrophobic fractions played a dominant role in the change of membrane fouling potential during dnf o3 uf process fig 8 showed the change of tmp during ultrafiltration of six fractions in reclaimed water during dnf o3 uf process among the six fractions of both influent and effluent hoa exhibited the strongest fouling potential which was similar to what kim and dempsey 2012 found in uf membrane fouling using effluent organic matter however the fouling performances of each component fractionated from dnf influent and effluent were rather different besides hoa hin in influent also contributed to membrane fouling to some extent fig 8 a while the other four fractions displayed almost no fouling potential when filtrated separately notably the filtration time of hoa in effluent shortened significantly compared with that in influent suggesting fouling potential of hoa increased during dnf process fig 8 b the tmp of hon reached 3 bar after 243 min filtration which indicated hon was another fouling fraction in effluent these results revealed that the increase of hydrophobic fractions especially hoa and hon played a dominant role in the increase of membrane fouling after dnf stage moreover the filtration time prolongation of 3 5 times was achieved with 2 mg o3 mg c ozonation treatment when the doc concentration of effluent was 9 mg l fig 8 c similar with that of 4 mg l fig 4 after ozonation treatment each fraction showed almost no membrane fouling potential when filtrated separately the membrane fouling of effluent treated with 2 mg o3 mg c was probably due to interactions among substances lin et al 2014 tang et al 2009 these results demonstrated that hoa and hon which dominated membrane fouling were converted into hydrophilic fractions by ozonation treatment jin et al 2016 thus alleviating the fouling of uf membrane apparent molecular weight amw distributions of the denitrification filter dnf influent effluent and effluent treated with 2 mg o3 mg c were shown in fig s5 the abundance of dom chromophore in dnf effluent was higher than that in dnf influent and decreased significantly after ozonation treatment with 2 mg o3 mg c correspondingly the chromophore abundances of all six fractions increased after denitrification and decreased after ozonation and the amw distributions were shown in fig s6 it is worth to mention that the chromophores of hoa and hia were more abundant than the other fractions which was in accordance with the uv254 value in fig 7 b fingerprint graph was plotted based on the previous method tang et al 2014 and modified in determining procedure to better understand the changes of component characteristics of reclaimed water during dnf o3 uf process fingerprint graphs of the six components fractionated from all three water samples were shown in fig 9 for all samples low mw components f3 accounted for the largest ratio the ratio of high and medium mw components f1 and f2 significantly increased after denitrification stage especially in hoa and hon fig 9 b therefore it is speculated that the increase of higher mw components in hoa and hon could aggravate the membrane fouling of these two fractions in dnf effluent moreover the ratio of f1and f2 reduced notably with ozonation treatment of 2 mg o3 mg c and the f1 ratio of each fraction was lower than that of influent these results indicated that high mw components in hoa and hon played an important role in membrane fouling of reclaimed water during dnf o3 uf process the fouling control mechanism was also revealed by the experimental results that these dominant components could be effectively degraded and removed by ozonation and therefore significant fouling alleviation was achieved 3 3 foulant layer properties of six different fractions scanning electron microscopy sem images in fig s7 showed the membrane surfaces fouled by different fractions of dnf effluent the pristine hollow fiber uf membrane presented a homogeneous surface with abundant evenly distributed pores and the average pore size was 0 02 μm fig 10 a after the fouling experiments the membrane surfaces exhibited diverse morphology as for the membrane fouled by dnf effluent before fractionation the surface was completely covered by bulk foulants with smooth fouling layer and the original surface pores could not be observed as for the six components fractionated from dnf effluent the surface of fouled membranes exhibited significant differences due to their component characteristics fouling layers of hydrophobic fractions in fig s7 showed similar morphology with the effluent the membrane surface fouled by hoa was almost the same with that of dnf effluent thick and smooth surface with no pores could be recognized which could further support the severe fouling performance of this component fig 8 b the amplified sem image of foulants from hoa was shown in fig 10 b and distinct organic fouling could be further observed hon membrane exhibited obvious organic fouling structures but pores could still be observed fig 10 c which was in accordance with the fouling capacity fig 8 b the other four fractions showed almost no fouling potential in filtration experiment and fouled membranes presented little foulants and widespread pores like pristine membrane fig s7 however even though there were just a few clusters and coupling foulants on the surface of hob membrane apparent organic fouling structures of clusters and plenty of pores could still be observed in fig 10 d quite differently membranes fouled by three hydrophilic fractions presented totally different surface morphology with some regular crystal scaling fig s7 therefore the foulant layer properties of six different fractions were determined by their fouling potential and component characteristics specifically the coverage of foulants was closely related to the fouling potential and the surface morphology of fouled membrane was strongly associated with the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of each fraction 3 4 surrogates for the influence of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential of denitrification filter effluent membrane fouling caused by dnf effluent was significantly alleviated with ozonation treatment and the alleviation of fouling was more noteworthy as the o3 dosage increased the fluorescence intensities and uv254 values of water samples were reduced effectively after ozonation and the decrease was more significant with increased o3 dosage as well fig 11 showed how the fluorescence intensity and specific uv absorbance suva reduction after the ozonation correlated with the tmp at 80 min during the filtration tmp of water samples at 80 min was selected as indicator because the tmp of control sample without ozonation increased to 3 bar after 80 min filtration both fluorescence intensity fig 11 a and suva fig 11 b reduction presented good linear relationships with tmp at 80min of the samples treated by ozone these results indicated that the organic matters which showed fluorescence and uv254 properties were crucial components that contributed to membrane fouling therefore the reductions of fluorescence intensity and suva can be surrogates for the influence of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent according to these results in the practical operation of dnf o3 uf process the dosage of ozone could be controlled by monitoring the change of suva or fluorescence for the alleviation of membrane fouling the ozone dosage of conventional dnf uf o3 in the wwrp of gaobeidian was 3 mg l corresponding with 0 25 mg o3 mg c as for the modified dnf o3 uf process the filtration time for the tmp to reach 3 bar was 1 6 times that of conventional process with the ozone dosage of 0 25 mg o3 mg c fig 4 therefore the actual operation time of ultrafiltration modules in gaobeidian would be effectively extended and the produce capacity of reclaimed water at the same time would increase by 1 27 times due to the significant increase of capacity and decrease of the backwash frequency the costs of electricity and chemicals consumption were reduced to 0 047 and 0 029 m3 corresponding to 0 79 and 0 62 times respectively based on the scale of wwrp gaobeidian 5 558 750 per year of operational cost would be saved the detailed calculation process could be found in supplementary materials to further improve the produce capacity or reduce the costs ozone dosage in dnf o3 uf process could be adjusted simply according to the reduction of the two surrogates mentioned above to achieve lower tmp and longer operation time in practical engineering application 4 conclusions the fouling potential of reclaimed water during the dnf o3 uf process was proved to be significantly increased after dnf stage and alleviated with ozonation treatment hoa and hon fractions dominated the membrane fouling of the dnf effluent and the degradation of higher mw components by ozonation led to fouling alleviation in engineering applications the control effects of membrane fouling by ozonation could be monitored simply by determining the reduction of suva or fluorescence intensity as surrogates the modified dnf o3 uf process was expected to enlarge the produce capacity of reclaimed water with much lower electricity costs and chemical consumption this modification strategy will help to improve the design of treatment process integrated with membrane modules in wwrps besides conventional water quality indexes more

18123,a process of denitrification filter dnf coupled with ultrafiltration uf and ozonation dnf uf o3 has been widely applied to advanced nitrogen removal for wastewater reclamation despite of the effective removal of nitrogen by dnf the influence of dnf stage on the operation of uf was still unclear in this study a laboratory filtration system was used to investigate the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent and the fouling control of ozonation the membrane fouling potential was proved to be increased significantly after dnf stage and alleviated with ozonation treatment with the help of uv vis fluorescence spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and molecular weight mw analysis the change of dom component characteristics was proved to be in accordance with the change of fouling potential the water samples were further fractionated into six hydrophobic hydrophilic acidic basic neutral fractions among which hydrophobic acids hoa and hydrophobic neutrals hon dominated the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent detailed study of each fraction revealed that higher mw components in hoa and hon played a crucial role in the fouling of uf membrane the dominant component of membrane fouling could be degraded and removed by ozonation and therefore significant fouling alleviation was achieved these results indicated that in the process of wastewater reclamation besides conventional water quality indexes more detailed water features should also be taken into consideration to optimize the whole process moreover the control effects by ozonation could be monitored simply according to the change of specific uv absorbance suva and fluorescence intensity as surrogates in engineering applications according to these results a modified dnf o3 uf process with o3 dosage of 3 mg l was proposed simply by reversing the sequence of uf and o3 with no more infrastructure this modified dnf o3 uf process was expected to enlarge the produce capacity of reclaimed water with much lower electricity costs and chemical consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification effluent membrane fouling potential ozonation control mechanism component characteristics 1 introduction wastewater reclamation is an important strategy to solve water scarcity and ensure sustainable development reclaimed water has been applied extensively in landscape utilization replenishment of landscape water with reclaimed water demands higher water quality than simple discharge including low concentration of suspended solids ss total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp to ensure sensory pleasure and water safety ao et al 2018 dong et al 2018 wang et al 2017b to meet the standard of landscape use the denitrification filter dnf followed by ultrafiltration uf and ozonation has a broad application in wastewater reclamation plants wwrps in china for advanced nitrogen removal and better water quality in the case of beijing the process of dnf uf o3 has been applied in 6 large scale wwrps with the total capacity of 2 380 000 m3 d including the wwrp of gaobeidian one of the largest wwrp in the world 1 000 000 m3 d the schematic diagram of the conventional treatment process was shown in fig 1 a although the denitrification filter removes nitrogen significantly the changes of dissolved organic matters dom during denitrification process including soluble microbial products smps and the excess carbon source such as methanol etc may impact the fouling potential of subsequent ultrafiltration in the practical operation of uf membrane fouling which increases energy consumption and affects the stability of the whole process is one of the most crucial problem ma et al 2019 yoo 2018 however studies about the influences of dnf process on uf membrane fouling are still limited and further exploration is rather in need according to previous literatures which focused on the fouling of membrane bioreactor mbr integrated with anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process denitrification process might cause fouling deterioration kim and nakhla 2010 lee et al 2014 rosenberger et al 2006 few previous studies focused on the effect of denitrification process on membrane fouling jang et al 2006 concluded that the effluent of denitrification showed higher membrane fouling rates than that of nitrification due to the smaller floc size increased smps and floc deterioration with increased hydrophobicity ma et al 2006 reported that anoxic oxic phase showed lower permeability of membrane than only oxic phase because of the smaller flocs lee et al 2014 reported that anoxic mbr had some drawbacks on the fouling control compared to aerobic mbr the fouling problem of anoxic process was attributed to the smaller floc size lower porosity in biofilm as well as higher cake layer resistance at low concentration of dissolved oxygen during denitrification jin et al 2006 kang et al 2003 kim and nakhla 2009 wang et al 2018 nevertheless the mechanism of membrane fouling in dnf uf process which is supposed to be quite different from that in mbr has not been reported due to the filtration capability of dnf dom in the effluent of dnf rather than flocs could be the primary foulant however since it is difficult to separate natural organic matters nom polysaccharides and protein from each other zhu et al 2010 fouling mechanism of effluent of dnf is rather complicated and remains to be explored resin fractionation has been widely used to identify the components of dom in secondary effluent shen et al 2012 tang et al 2013 2014 hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and acidity basicity were considered as key physicochemical properties that influence fouling xiao et al 2011 kim and dempsey 2012 according to literatures different hydrophobic hydrophilic and acidic basic components fractionated from the same water sample had different fouling potential and the key factor that lead to membrane fouling was diverse in different influent and membrane systems kim and dempsey 2008 tang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 zhu et al 2010 therefore in order to understand the fouling mechanism and improve the operation performance it is crucial to identify the critical fraction in dom that dominates the membrane fouling of dnf uf process in order to control membrane fouling recent researches have investigated a variety of pretreatments including coagulation fan et al 2018 song et al 2019 adsorption kimura and oki 2017 ion exchange filloux et al 2016 metcalfe et al 2016 oxidation benito et al 2017 jeong et al 2014 tian et al 2018 and so on among these processes ozonation was proved to be a promising option to alleviate membrane fouling wang et al 2017a yu et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 owing to its prominent advantage of altering the composition and chemical properties of dom especially molecular weight mw distribution hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and functional groups jin et al 2016 2019 sun et al 2019 in this study we explored the uf membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent by a laboratory filtration system with a single hollow fiber membrane furthermore we investigated the control effect and mechanism of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential as well as dom component characteristics of dnf effluent based on the research results a new dnf o3 uf process fig 1b was proposed which was modified from the conventional process of dnf uf o3 simply by reversing the sequence of uf and o3 with no further infrastructure and operating costs this study helps glean valuable insight into the dnf o3 uf process in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water the feed water used in this study were the influent domestic secondary effluent and effluent of dnf collected from the wwrp of gaobeidian methanol was dosed into the denitrification filter to facilitate the denitrification stage the water samples were transported to the lab immediately after sampling and stored at 4 c in the

suspended solids and turbidity 2 2 filtration system and membrane module the fouling experiments were conducted in a constant flow filtration system as shown in fig 2 the membrane module was constructed in our laboratory with a single hollow fiber membrane which has an outside in configuration influent was filtrated from the surface and penetrant flowed out from inside of the membrane for dead end filtration the ultrafiltration membrane supplied by originwater in this study was the same as that in the wwrp in fig 1 which has a nominal pore diameter of 0 02 μm at the conditions of this study the pure water permeability of the module was 0 18 m h with the transmembrane pressure tmp of 0 2 bar the maximum tmp was fixed at 3 bar and the filtration time was selected as monitoring parameter when the tmp reached 3 bar the pump was stopped at once a constant flow pump was set to maintain the flow rate at 1 5 ml min corresponding to working flux of 0 18 m h while a pressure sensor was used to monitor the tmp during filtration to show the degree of membrane fouling the flow rate of the filtrate was monitored by an electronic balance in real time the filtration experiment was conducted indoors and the temperature was about 25 c each filtration experiment in this study has been repeated 3 times 2 3 fractionation procedure water samples were fractionated into six components

shanmeishuimei high technology co ltd beijing china ozonation experiments were conducted in a 500 ml beaker with a sealing film at the top as for water samples with different ozone dosage the volumes of original water stock ozone solution and ultrapure water were calculated firstly and the final concentration of each water sample was set at 4 mg l water samples after ozonation were stored for 6

the filtration time was prolonged by 3 75 times compared with original dnf effluent with 2 mg o3 mg c treatment demonstrating the effective alleviation performance of membrane fouling by ozonation

hydrophobic fractions especially hoa and hon played a dominant role in the increase of membrane fouling after dnf stage moreover the filtration time prolongation of 3 5 times was achieved with 2 mg o3 mg c ozonation treatment when the doc concentration of effluent was 9 mg l fig 8 c similar with that of 4 mg l fig 4 after ozonation treatment each fraction showed almost no membrane fouling potential when filtrated separately the membrane fouling of effluent treated with 2 mg o3 mg c was probably due to interactions among substances lin et al 2014 tang et al 2009 these results demonstrated that hoa and hon which dominated membrane fouling were converted into hydrophilic fractions by ozonation treatment jin et al 2016 thus alleviating the fouling of uf membrane apparent molecular weight amw distributions of the denitrification filter dnf influent effluent and effluent treated with 2 mg o3 mg c were shown in fig s5 the abundance of dom chromophore in dnf effluent was higher than that in dnf influent and decreased significantly after ozonation treatment with 2 mg o3 mg c correspondingly the chromophore abundances of all six fractions increased after denitrification and decreased after ozonation and the amw distributions were shown in fig s6 it is worth to mention that the chromophores of hoa and hia were more abundant than the other fractions which was in accordance with the uv254 value in fig 7 b fingerprint graph was plotted based on the previous method tang et al 2014 and modified in determining procedure to better understand the changes of component characteristics of reclaimed water during dnf o3 uf process fingerprint graphs of the six components fractionated from all three water samples were shown in fig 9 for all samples low mw components f3 accounted for the largest ratio the ratio of high and medium mw components f1 and f2 significantly increased after denitrification stage especially in hoa and hon fig 9 b therefore it is speculated that the increase of higher mw components in hoa and hon could aggravate the membrane fouling of these two fractions in dnf effluent moreover the ratio of f1and f2 reduced notably with ozonation treatment of 2 mg o3 mg c and the f1 ratio of each fraction was lower than that of influent these results indicated that high mw components in hoa and hon played an important role in membrane fouling of reclaimed water during dnf o3 uf process the fouling control mechanism was also revealed by the experimental results that these dominant components could be effectively degraded and removed by ozonation and therefore significant fouling alleviation was achieved 3 3 foulant layer properties of six different fractions scanning electron microscopy sem images in fig s7 showed the membrane surfaces fouled by different fractions of dnf effluent the pristine hollow fiber uf membrane presented a homogeneous surface with abundant evenly distributed pores and the average pore size was 0 02 μm fig 10 a after the fouling experiments the membrane surfaces exhibited diverse morphology as for the membrane fouled by dnf effluent before fractionation the surface was completely covered by bulk foulants with smooth fouling layer and the original surface pores could not be observed as for the six components fractionated from dnf effluent the surface of fouled membranes exhibited significant differences due to their component characteristics fouling layers of hydrophobic fractions in fig s7 showed similar morphology with the effluent the membrane surface fouled by hoa was almost the same with that of dnf effluent thick and smooth surface with no pores could be recognized which could further support the severe fouling performance of this component fig 8 b the amplified sem image of foulants from hoa was shown in fig 10 b and distinct organic fouling could be further observed hon membrane exhibited obvious organic fouling structures but pores could still be observed fig 10 c which was in accordance with the fouling capacity fig 8 b the other four fractions showed almost no fouling potential in filtration experiment and fouled membranes presented little foulants and widespread pores like pristine membrane fig s7 however even though there were just a few clusters and coupling foulants on the surface of hob membrane apparent organic fouling structures of clusters and plenty of pores could still be observed in fig 10 d quite differently membranes fouled by three hydrophilic fractions presented totally different surface morphology with some regular crystal scaling fig s7 therefore the foulant layer properties of six different fractions were determined by their fouling potential and component characteristics specifically the coverage of foulants was closely related to the fouling potential and the surface morphology of fouled membrane was strongly associated with the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of each fraction 3 4 surrogates for the influence of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential of denitrification filter effluent membrane fouling caused by dnf effluent was significantly alleviated with ozonation treatment and the alleviation of fouling was more noteworthy as the o3 dosage increased the fluorescence intensities and uv254 values of water samples were reduced effectively after ozonation and the decrease was more significant with increased o3 dosage as well fig 11 showed how the fluorescence intensity and specific uv absorbance suva reduction after the ozonation correlated with the tmp at 80 min during the filtration tmp of water samples at 80 min was selected as indicator because the tmp of control sample without ozonation increased to 3 bar after 80 min filtration both fluorescence intensity fig 11 a and suva fig 11 b reduction presented good linear relationships with tmp at 80min of the samples treated by ozone these results indicated that the organic matters which showed fluorescence and uv254 properties were crucial components that contributed to membrane fouling therefore the reductions of fluorescence intensity and suva can be surrogates for the influence of ozonation on the membrane fouling potential of dnf effluent according to these results in the practical operation of dnf o3 uf process the dosage of ozone could be controlled by monitoring the change of suva or fluorescence for the alleviation of membrane fouling the ozone dosage of conventional dnf uf o3 in the wwrp of gaobeidian was 3 mg l corresponding with 0 25 mg o3 mg c as for the modified dnf o3 uf process the filtration time for the tmp to reach 3 bar was 1 6 times that of conventional process with the ozone dosage of 0 25 mg o3 mg c fig 4 therefore the actual operation time of ultrafiltration modules in gaobeidian would be effectively extended and the produce capacity of reclaimed water at the same time would increase by 1 27 times due to the significant increase of capacity and decrease of the backwash frequency the costs of electricity and chemicals consumption were reduced to 0 047 and 0 029 m3 corresponding to 0 79 and 0 62 times respectively based on the scale of wwrp gaobeidian 5 558 750 per year of operational cost would be saved the detailed calculation process could be found in supplementary materials to further improve the produce capacity or reduce the costs ozone dosage in dnf o3 uf process could be adjusted simply according to the reduction of the two surrogates mentioned above to achieve lower tmp and longer operation time in practical engineering application 4 conclusions the fouling potential of reclaimed water during the dnf o3 uf process was proved to be significantly increased after dnf stage and alleviated with ozonation treatment hoa and hon fractions dominated the membrane fouling of the dnf effluent and the degradation of higher mw components by ozonation led to fouling alleviation in engineering applications the control effects of membrane fouling by ozonation could be monitored simply by determining the reduction of suva or fluorescence intensity as surrogates the modified dnf o3 uf process was expected to enlarge the produce capacity of reclaimed water with much lower electricity costs and chemical consumption this modification strategy will help to improve the design of treatment process integrated with membrane modules in wwrps besides conventional water quality indexes more

18124,electrolytes are commonly employed as draw solutes in forward osmosis fo this work demonstrates that electrostatic interactions play a key role in ion transport in the fo process the difference in diffusivity between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte significantly impact the forward transport of the feed ions draw electrolyte composed of low diffusivity cations and high diffusivity anions promoted forward transport of the feed anions and retarded that of the feed cation and vice versa the effects were remarkable even for the most commonly used draw electrolytes nacl or mgcl2 where the forward flux of no3 and no2 was found to increase by a few folds and that of nh4 was reduced by similar magnitudes than that observed in a nonelectrolyte draw solute glucose system more profound increase reduction up to 10 times was observed for draw electrolytes composed of highly asymmetric cations and anions an analytical model is developed by considering the electrostatic interaction between the draw and the feed ions to predict its effect on the forward transport of the feed ions the normalized diffusivity difference θd between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte is found as a key factor that determines the transport behaviors of the feed ions these results may have important implications in enhancing our understanding of bidirectional ion transport in fo the findings may also be useful in the design and development of fo processes for enhanced removal of charged pollutants via draw solute selection and formulation graphical abstract

membrane processes fo takes advantage of natural osmotic pressure for solute water separation and shows merits in reducing energy input lowering membrane fouling and producing high quality product water lutchmiah et al 2014 mcgovern et al 2014 awad et al 2019 as a result fo is considered a promising alternative in brackish and sea water desalination water purification and energy recovery logan

effective technology in the removal of heavy metals cui et al 2016 ge et al 2018 and emerging pollutants xie et al 2012 coday et al 2014 holloway et al 2014 xie et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 the

unparalleled advantages in facilitated nutrient recovery and high through put treatment of wastewater qiu et al 2016a 2016b the numerous new features offered by the fo and fo related processes largely result from the high rejection properties of the fo membranes chung et al 2012 lutchmiah et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 2016a b ansari et al 2017 like reverse osmosis ro fo uses dense membranes which allow water molecule to penetrate but effectively reject solutes however unlike ro separation in fo relies on osmotic pressure which is driven by a draw solution phillip et al 2010 ge et al 2013 shaffer et al 2015 lee and hsieh 2019 apart from the forward transport of solute from the feed to the draw solution draw solutes also inevitably leak from the draw solution into the feed achilli et al 2010 hancock et al 2011 zou et al 2019 this phenomenon is typically termed as bidirectional transport or diffusion of solutes hancock et al 2011 lu et al 2014 when the feed and draw solutes are electrolytes their interactions may mutually affect their transport behaviors models have been developed to describe the bidirectional transport of electrolytes in the fo system by ignoring their electrostatic interactions hancock et al 2011 manickam and mccutcheon 2017 despite the strong agreements between the predicted and observed reverse fluxes of draw ions the observed feed ion fluxes deviated from the model hancock et al 2011 for systems containing no3 the deviation was more pronounced hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 an ion exchange mechanism was proposed to be responsible for these observations although the underlying drive force is not yet understood irvine et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 similar results were reported by kong et al 2018 where greatly overestimated no3 rejection and underestimated nh4 rejection were observed with cellulose triacetate cta membrane and nacl as draw solution asymmetric forward transport of na and cl across a cta membrane was also observed with a draw solution composed of 1 8 m nh4hco3 and 0 2 m nh4oh although the phenomenon has been attributed to the higher reverse diffusion of nh4 resulting from the higher total ammonia concentration 2 0 m than bicarbonate species lu et al 2014 yaroshchuk et al 2013 developed a solution diffusion electro migration model to analyze the electrically coupled transport of three different ions through membrane barrier layers in fo using mgcl2 as a draw solution and nanofiltration nf like membranes modeling revealed 3 to 4 fold enhancements in na rejection i e reduction in the forward flux of na relative to a pressure driven process under similar conditions although these results collectively suggest that reverse flux of draw electrolytes affects the forward transport of the feed ions hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 the way in which the draw electrolytes impact the feed ion fluxes remains unclear since a major task of fo is membrane rejection of pollutants in the feed solution to achieve their removal it is essential to obtain an in depth understanding of the impacts of draw solutes on the rejection of feed ions and the governing mechanisms research has revealed that coupled reverse transport of constituent ions of draw electrolyte occurs in fo when di water was used as a feed paul 2004 hancock et al 2011 the driving force for this coupled transport is the electrostatic attractions between the constituent ions cussler 2009 which modulate the diffusion of the cations and the anions to the same rate the larger the difference in their diffusivity the greater the extent of electrostatic interactions between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte is expected feed ions transport through the membrane are exposed to electrostatic interactions where the slow moving draw ion would attract the oppositely charged feed ions towards the draw solution side and the fast moving draw ion attracts the counter feed ions to the feed side the transport of draw ions may also be affected by the feed ions however since the draw electrolyte concentration is typically much higher than that of the feed electrolyte in fo the impact of feed electrolyte on the transport of draw electrolyte are expected to be less significant based on the above reasoning it may be expected that 1 a difference in the diffusivities of the draw cation and anion potentially affects the forward transport of the feed ions 2 the larger difference the higher the degree of impact may be expected and 3 by analyzing the electrostatic interactions between the draw ions within the fo membrane the impacts on the transport of the feed ions may be predicted the aim of this study is to understand the role of electrostatic interactions in ion transport in fo nh4 no2 and no3 were used as model feed ions due to their ubiquitous presence in water and wastewater and the removal of which is typically a major task in water wastewater treatment the forward transport behavior of nh4 no2 and no3 was analyzed with draw electrolytes composed of cations and anions with different diffusivity nacl mgcl2 kcl na2so4 sodium citrate tris hcl sodium polyacrylate ge et al 2013 and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride glucose as a neutral draw solute was used to test the flux behaviors of the feed ions in the absence of any electrostatic impact from the draw solute a model was developed to describe the transport behaviors of the feed ions by considering the electrostatic interactions between draw ions and the subsequent effects on the transport of feed ions this work provides fundamental knowledge of the role of electrostatic interactions in ion transport in fo which would benefit in improved understanding and manipulation of the fo and related processes 2 material and methods 2 1 fo setup fo experiments were performed using a bench scale setup supplementary material fig s1 the setup consists of a cross flow fo cell holding one piece of cellulose triacetate cta membrane hydration technology innovations albany usa effective area of 0 0003 m2 which separates the cell into a feed solution chamber and a draw solution chamber cta membrane was used since it contains negligible fixed charged groups irvine et al 2013 thus the electrostatic interactions between the draw or feed electrolyte and the membrane were minimized feed solution and draw

with dissimilar difference in diffusivity between the constituent ions glucose 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 m was used as a non electrolyte draw solute to analyze the transport behavior of feed ions without draw feed electrostatic interactions experiments were performed with the feed solution facing the active layer fo model a new piece of fo membrane cut off from the same membrane sheet was used in each experiment before use the membrane was flushed in the fo setup with ultrapure water on both sides to remove any salts adsorbed until the solution conductivity dropped below 0 25 μs the water permeability a the solute permeability b and the membrane structural parameter s were determined according to procedures described by tiraferri et al 2013 to further understand the electrostatic interactions between the feed and the draw electrolytes and the effects of feed ions on the transport of the draw ions fo experiments were performed with 10 mm nh4no3 as the feed solution and 1m nacl mgcl2 kcl na2so4 na3cit or tris hcl as the draw solution the fluxes of the feed ions and the draw ions were measured by monitoring changes in the concentration of draw ions in the feed and that of the feed ions in the draw solution over time all the chemicals were acquired from sigma aldrich merck darmstadt germany the solutions were prepared with ultra pure water from a milli q system merck

ionic species extended nernst planck equation may be used schlögl 1966 dresner 1972 however for a system containing more than three ions an analytical solution of the equation does not exist dresner 1972 hancock et al 2011 yaroshchuk et al 2013 since the draw solute concentration in fo is typically much higher than that of the feed solute we thus made the following theoretical derivation 1 the electrostatic interactions between the draw cation and anion result in their coupled transport cussler 2009 hancock and cath 2009 hancock et al 2011 the extent of the electrostatic interactions between draw ions within the membrane could be established using the extended nernst planck equation 2 the feed ions are exposed to the electrostatic field which resulted from the different transport coefficients of the draw ions when the feed ions pass through the fo membrane 3 the forward transport of the feed ions do not substantially alter the electrostatic interactions between draw ions due to their relatively low concentration the above assumptions would allow us to use the extended nernst planck equation to analyze the electrostatic interactions between draw ions and approximate its effects on the transport of the feed ions fig 1 as the first step the feed and draw solute flux in the absence of electrostatic interactions was considered which may be used to describe the solute

previous studies loeb et al 1997 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 tiraferri et al 2013 manickam and mccutcheon 2017 the water flux is determined by the osmotic pressure difference between the feed and

accurate expression of d ψ d x in the support layer it adds difficulties in understanding the interactions to simplify the equation we consider that j w c d s is typically much higher than j d s for the draw solutes thus from eq 15 a relatively constant d ψ d x may be expected in the support layer this may be verified by plotting the d ψ d x profile in the support layer using eq 17 which is thus

aspects in eq 27 1 an electrostatic force component was added to the convective component suggesting promoted retarded transport of feed ion in the support layer 2 a weight factor 1 z f s i o n θ d d

i o n f e showing the concentration dispersion effects on the feed ions in the active layer 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of draw electrolyte constituents on the feed ion flux no3 flux was measured at a feed nano3 concentration of 1 mm but with different draw solutes at different concentrations for each draw solute high draw solution concentration resulted in high water flux fig 2 there was a general trend that for each draw solute the no3 flux increased with the increase in the water flux due to increased convection hancock and cath 2009 hancock et al 2011 fig 3 a as a non electrolyte draw solute glucose was expected to have minor electrostatic interaction with no3 the non electrostatic interaction model eq 2 predicted the no3 flux in the glucose system well this result also suggested that the cta membrane was largely uncharged hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 when electrolytes were used as draw solutes the no3 flux patterns significantly deviated from the non electrostatic interaction model and that in the case of glucose higher no3 flux was observed when nacl mgcl2 tris hcl or pdadmac was used as draw solute for all these draw solutes the cations na mg2 trish or pdadman have lower diffusion coefficient values and larger hydrated radii nightingale 1959 zheng et al 2019 than that of cl supplementary material table s1 ng and barry 1995 vanysek 2005 adamczyk et al 2014 thus the slow moving cations tend to attract cl towards the draw solution side when transported though the membrane as an anion no3 receives the same attractive force by these cations towards the draw solution side thus resulting in higher forward fluxes these results corroborate other studies where the no3 flux was shown to be deviate significantly from the non electrostatic interaction model when nacl was used as a draw solute hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 additionally it appeared that for these chloride salts the lower the mobility of the cations the higher the impact on the no3 flux fig 3a even for the most commonly used draw solutes i e nacl and mgcl2 the no3 flux was significantly higher than the predictions of the non electrostatic interaction models 1 8 2 0 times for nacl and 2 3 2 7 times for mgcl2 implying that electrostatic interactions played an important role on the flux of the feed ion and must be considered when evaluating membrane rejection of charged compounds in contrast na3cit and paana generated significantly lower no3 flux than that predicted by the non electrostatic interaction model 0 54 0 57 times lower for na3cit and 0 32 0 35 times lower for paana na3cit and paana are weak electrolytes and are not completely dissociated at ph 7 however the diffusivity of the citrate ions and the paa ions are much lower than that of na supplementary material table s1 ng and barry 1995 ge et al 2012 holloway et al 2015 the low diffusivity of these anions and their large hydrated radii adamczyk et al 2006 thomasset et al 1986 results in an attraction of na towards the draw solution side and thus a negative electrostatic field eq 9 which obstructed no3 from passing through and repulsed it to the feed side as a result significantly reduced forward fluxes of no3 were observed similarly the lower the diffusivity of the draw anion the higher the degree of reduction in the no3 flux thus showing that the difference in diffusivity between the draw cation and anion or θ d d s eqs 9 and 27 is a key factor that determines the effects of the draw solutes on the flux of feed ions as an anion no2 showed similar trends to that observed for no3 fig 3b glucose resulted in a no2 flux pattern close to that predicted by the non electrostatic interaction model eq 2 whereas nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac resulted in significantly higher no2 fluxes than the model predictions 1 93 2 01 2 6 3 1 5 4 5 7 and 6 1 6 5 times higher for nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac respectively the no2 flux increased with the decrease in the cation diffusivity and the increase in the hydrated radius values of the cations supplementary material table s1 na3cit and paana resulted in significantly retarded no2 flux 0 43 0 57 and 0 27 0 28 of that predicated by the non electrostatic interaction model due to the higher diffusivity of the cation na than the companion anions citrate3 and paan the no2 flux decreased with a decrease in the anion diffusivity the transport of nh4 showed an opposite trend as compared to no3 and no2 where draw solutes with the constitution of a slow moving cation and a fast moving anion nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac resulted in nh4 fluxes lower than that observed in the glucose system fig 3c conversely in the system with draw solutes composed of fast moving cations and slow moving anions the forward transport of nh4 was highly promoted the resultant nh4 fluxes in na3cit and paana systems were 3 8 5 6 and 8 4 9 8 times higher than the predicted flux ignoring the electrostatic interactions and that in the glucose system overall these results fig 3 demonstrated that the composition of the draw solute has significant effects on the forward transport of the feed ions the slow moving constituent ion of the draw solute attracts the counter ion and repulses the co ion resulting in promoted forward fluxes of the counter ion and reduced forward fluxes of the co ion the higher degree of the difference in diffusivity between the constituent ions of the draw solute the higher was the impact observed on the feed ion transport a one way electrostatic model eq 27 was used to estimate the electrostatic impacts of the draw electrolytes on the flux of the feed ions the extent of the influence of each draw electrolyte was well predicted fig 3 the model was established based on the assumption that the draw ion concentrations were much higher than that of the feed ions within the membrane matrix this assumption is valid within a major part of the membrane even when the concentration of the draw solute in the feed solution is at low levels where c d s f may be close to or lower than c f s f supplementary material fig s2 since within the active layer the draw solute concentration increases dramatically from the feed side to the draw side while the concentration of the feed ion sharply decreases in the same direction eq 12 and supplementary material fig s2 however in this case i e when the concentration of the draw solute in the feed solution is at low levels the direct use of eq 27 would overestimate the feed ion fluxes since not all the feed ions may be effectively affected by the draw ions when their concentrations were at similar levels from eq 27 the extent of the electrostatic effects on the feed ion flux is affected by the concentration of the draw electrolytes in the membrane which decreases as the concentrations of the draw electrolytes at the feed side surface of the active layer c d s f e decrease on the other hand the proportion of the feed ions affected by the draw ions would depend on the concentration ratio of the feed to the draw ions as the concentration of the draw ions at the surface of the active layer decreases the proportion of the feed ions affected by the draw ions would correspondingly decrease in general the electrostatic effects would be expected to first increase and then decrease as the concentration of the draw solute at the surface of the active layer increased supplementary material fig s3 thus the feed ion fluxes were approximated with c d s f e eq 27 set to 20 and 50 mm fig 3 overall it suggested that the effects of the draw electrolyte on the flux of the feed ions may be predicted based on the model developed considering the electrostatic interactions 3 2 role of electrostatic interactions to better understand the electrostatic effects of the draw solute on the flux of the feed ions the concentration profile and the electrostatic potential gradient profile of the draw electrolyte within the fo membrane was established based on eqs 11 13 and 15 17 fig 4 shows the use of mgcl2 as draw solute since the diffusivity of mg2 is lower than cl supplementary material table s1 mg2 drags cl when they transport through the membrane along the concentration gradient eqs 11 and 15 the electrostatic interactions between mg2 and cl ions results in the transport of mg2 and cl at the same speed eq 8 ng et al 2006 cussler 2009 the extent of the electrostatic interaction between mg2 and cl is reflected in the calculated electrostatic potential gradient d ψ d x eqs 12 and 17 higher d ψ d x values were observed in the active layer than in the support layer owing to a high concentration gradient of mgcl2 in the active layer the highest electrostatic potential gradient is adjacent to the feed side interface and is reduced gradually through the active layer fig 4a a relative constant electrostatic potential gradient was found within the support layer fig 4a owing largely to the same trends in the concentration and the concentration gradient profiles of mgcl2 in the support layer fig 4a which also supports the assumption of a constant electrostatic potential gradient ψ s to simplify eq 17 into eq 18 the d ψ d x profile fig 4a suggested that the draw electrolytes are expected to show a more significant impact on the transport of feed ions in the active layer than in the support layer feed ions passing through the membrane are subjected to this electrostatic potential gradient no2 as an anion experiences the same electrostatic force as cl i e attracted by mg2 toward the draw solution side and thus an increase in the forward flux fig 4b shows the concentration profiles of no2 in the membrane with and without considering the electrostatic effects from the draw electrolytes with electrostatic effects as according to eqs 21 and 24 significantly increased no2 concentrations was observed in the active layer which resulted in a much higher no2 concentration at the active layer support layer interface in the support layer no2 continues to be attracted by the mg2 as a result the transport of no2 was enhanced nh4 as a cation is expected to experience the same electrostatic force as did mg2 from cl i e toward the feed side as a result nh4 shows significantly reduced forward flux and reduced concentrations within the membrane fig 4c from the d ψ d x profile fig 4a of the draw solution and the concentration gradient profiles of no2 fig 4b and nh4 fig 4c it is clear that the electrostatic effects on the transport of feed ions occurred mainly in the active layer especially in the part close to the feed solution although interactions occur between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte within the membrane matrix as indicated by the nernst planck equation eqs 4a and 4b these interactions modulated the transport of the draw ions to the same rate since electroneutrality of the solution is maintained at any point within the membrane no explicit electrostatic potential is likely to be generated across the membrane during bidirectional transport the electrostatic interactions among the feed and draw ions results in re partitioning of the feed and draw ions within the membrane matrix fig 4b and c overall electroneutrality will still be maintained as such the solutions or the membrane would not show any electrostatic potential externally 3 3 electroneutrality in bidirectional transport to further understand the interactions between feed and draw solution and the effects of feed ions on the reverse transport of draw ions fo experiments was performed at an elevated feed electrolyte concentration with 10 mm nh4no3 as a feed and with different draw solutes at a concentration of 1m the bidirectional transport behavior of the feed ions and the draw ions was evaluated results showed that electrostatic interactions played a key role in the transport of the feed ions even with elevated feed ion concentrations 10 mm fig 4a the trend was largely similar to that observed at low feed ion concentrations 1 mm fig 2 in the glucose system similar nh4 and no3 fluxes were observed without electrostatic impact from the draw solute the transport of nh4 and no3 is coupled to maintain electrostatic neutrality in the system fig 1a eq 7 cussler 2009 hancock et al 2011 while in other systems the transport of nh4 and no3 was largely uncoupled significantly promoted no3 flux with highly reduced nh4 flux was observed in systems with draw solute composed of fast moving anions and slow moving cations kcl nacl mgcl2 and trishcl while the draw electrolyte with fast cation slow anion combinations na2so4 and na3cit generated significantly higher nh4 flux then that of no3 the nh4 flux no3 flux ratio show a strong positive correlation with θd eq 9 fig 5 a suggesting that the flux behaviors of the feed ions were largely determined by the diffusivity difference between the draw ions θd of the draw electrolyte is an effective indictor to denote the effects of draw electrolyte on the transport of feed ions analyses of the reverse flux of the draw ions showed that the reverse transport of draw electrolytes is largely coupled when the feed solution was ultra pure water phillip et al 2010 figs 5c and 1a and eq 7 uncoupled transport of the draw ions was observed when the feed solution was 10 mm nh4no3 fig 5c corresponding to the higher no3 fluxes increased reverse transport of cl was observed for nacl mgcl and kcl suggesting the effects of feed ions on the reverse transport of the draw ions this observation was in line with the ion exchange phenomena reported by irvine et al 2013 similar evidences were observed in other studies with nacl as a draw solute kong et al 2018 from this study it seems clear that electrostatic interaction between draw and feed ions is a key driving force of the ion exchange phenomena contrasting the huge differences in the feed nh4 and no3 fluxes fig 5a lower differences were observed for the draw ions fig 5c owing to the higher concentration of the draw ions than the feed ions these results also suggested that the electrostatic interactions between draw and feed ions has more remarkable impact on the transport of the feed ions than on the draw ions hancock et al 2011 mass charge balance evaluated showed that despite the transport of draw and feed ions was affected in different extents the mass charge difference generated due to the different flux of the feed ions was well compensated by that generated due to the different flux of the draw ions in all systems fig 5d which allowed both the draw and the feed sides maintain an electroneutrality during the bidirectional transport of the feed and the draw ions these results again manifested that electrostatic interactions are the essential drive force of the different bidirectional ions flux behaviors in different systems fig 5 3 4 discussion and implications using no3 no2 and nh4 salts as feed solutes this study demonstrated that electrostatic interaction plays a key role in the ion transport in the fo process the composition of the draw solute specifically the difference in the diffusion coefficient between the draw anions and cations showed significant effects on the transport of the feed ions i e the membrane rejection of the feed ions draw solute composed of a slower cation lower diffusion coefficient and a faster anion higher diffusion coefficient e g nacl mgcl2 tris hcl or pdadmac significantly promoted the forward transport of the feed anions e g no2 or no3 and retarded that of the feed cations e g nh4 the opposite was true for draw solute composed of faster cations and slower anions e g na3cit or paana the extent of the effects was determined by the normalized diffusivity difference of the draw cation and anion θd the effects were remarkable even for the commonly used draw solutes such as nacl and mgcl2 where the flux of the no2 and no3 was increased by a few times and the transport of nh4 was retarded by a similar magnitude figs 3 and 5 these results may explain the commonly observed lower membrane cta fo membrane rejection of no2 and no3 than nh4 when nacl or mgcl2 was used as draw solutes qiu and ting 2013 2015 wang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 the electrostatic interaction between draw and feed ions also provide a more fundamental explanation of the ion exchange phenomena observed in the fo process irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 draw solute composition significantly affects the membrane rejection of the feed ions fig 3 these results imply that the effects of draw solute may not be omitted when evaluating the performance of fo processes and or fo membranes nacl and mgcl2 are among the most commonly used draw solute in fo achilli et al 2010 ge et al 2013 shaffer et al 2015 qiu et al 2016a 2016b awad et al 2019 the diffusivity difference between cl and na or mg2 is high enough to show significant effect on the forward transport of feed ions additionally organic salts islam et al 2019 and some largely asymmetric electrolytes have been proposed as novel draw solutes e g na10 phytate ge et al 2018 paana ge et al 2012 etc in fo due to their extremely low leakage holloway et al 2015 cai and hu 2016 zou et al 2019 the electrostatic effects in fo systems using these electrolytes are expected to be more significant the effects of electrostatic interaction on the removal of charged pollutants in these systems may need to be considered additionally the effects of the composition of the draw solute in amending the transport of feed ions also suggested an opportunity to enhance the removal of specific charged pollutants in fo by selecting appropriate draw solutes to enhance the removal of negatively charged ions a draw solute composed of faster cations high diffusivity or large hydrated radius and slower anions lower diffusivity or small hydrated radius are preferable conversely a draw solute composed of slower cations and faster anions would be expected to enhance the removal of positively charged pollutants the greater the difference in diffusivity between the ions in the draw solution θd the higher the degree of effectiveness may be expected the electrostatic interactions between the feed and draw ions may be considered as a form of the donnan equilibrium in a more general sense donnan 1924 hancock et al 2011 where it is not non diffusible ions or fixed charges in the membrane matrix that electrostatically excludes charged ions lu et al 2014 but the diffusivity difference between the constituent draw ions that altered the transport behaviors of feed ions the fluxes of the anion and the cation could differ by several folds e g the flux of no3 was 36 times higher than nh4 when 1m mgcl2 was used as a draw solution fig 5 these differences might be further enhanced by increasing the draw solute concentration or using a highly asymmetrical draw solute such as paana or pdadmac as in this work these results suggest the potential to use fo for selective ion removal or concentration in general electrostatic interaction is a key factor governing ion transport behaviors in fo an in depth analysis of the effects of electrostatic interactions would result in improved understanding of solute transport this may lead to novel developments by manipulating the effects of electrostatic interactions to enhance the removal of specific pollutants such as heavy metals and or charged trace organic compounds 4 conclusion electrostatic interactions were shown to play a key role in ion transport in the fo process the composition of the draw electrolyte significantly impacts the forward transport of the feed ions draw electrolyte composed of low diffusivity cations and high diffusivity anions promoted the forward transport of the feed anions and retarded that of the feed cation conversely the forward transport of the feed anions was greatly reduced while that of the feed cation was significantly enhanced with draw electrolyte composed of high mobility cations and low mobility anions the effects were remarkable even for the most commonly used draw electrolytes nacl or mgcl2 where the forward fluxes of nutrient ions nh4 no3 and no2 were promoted retarded by a few folds compared to that in a nonelectrolyte draw solute glucose system more profound increase reduction up to 10 times was observed for highly asymmetric draw electrolytes paana or pdadmac a mathematic model is developed by considering the electrostatic interaction between the draw and the feed ions to predict the effect of electrostatic interactions on the forward transport of the feed ions the normalized diffusivity difference θd between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte is found as a key factor that determines the degree of the electrostatic effects on the forward flux of the feed ions these results may have important implications in enhancing our understanding of bidirectional ion transport in fo the findings may be useful in the design and development of fo processes for enhanced removal of charged pollutants via draw solute selection and

18124,electrolytes are commonly employed as draw solutes in forward osmosis fo this work demonstrates that electrostatic interactions play a key role in ion transport in the fo process the difference in diffusivity between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte significantly impact the forward transport of the feed ions draw electrolyte composed of low diffusivity cations and high

water molecule to penetrate but effectively reject solutes however unlike ro separation in fo relies on osmotic pressure which is driven by a draw solution phillip et al 2010 ge et al 2013 shaffer et al 2015 lee and hsieh 2019 apart from the forward transport of solute from the feed to the draw solution draw solutes also inevitably leak from the draw solution into the feed achilli et al 2010 hancock et al 2011 zou et al 2019 this phenomenon is typically termed as bidirectional transport or diffusion of solutes hancock et al 2011 lu et al 2014 when the feed and draw solutes are electrolytes their interactions may mutually affect their transport behaviors models have been developed to describe the bidirectional transport of electrolytes in the fo system by ignoring their electrostatic interactions hancock et al 2011 manickam and mccutcheon 2017 despite the strong agreements between the predicted and observed reverse fluxes of draw ions the observed feed ion fluxes deviated from the model hancock et al 2011 for systems containing no3 the deviation was more pronounced hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 an ion exchange mechanism was proposed to be responsible for these observations although the underlying drive force is not yet understood irvine et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 similar results were reported by kong et al 2018 where greatly overestimated no3 rejection and underestimated nh4 rejection were observed with cellulose triacetate cta membrane and nacl as draw solution asymmetric forward transport of na and cl across a cta membrane was also observed with a draw solution composed of 1 8 m nh4hco3 and 0 2 m nh4oh although the phenomenon has been attributed to the higher reverse diffusion of nh4 resulting from the higher total ammonia concentration 2 0 m than bicarbonate species lu et al 2014 yaroshchuk et al 2013 developed a solution diffusion electro migration model to analyze the electrically coupled transport of three different ions through membrane barrier layers in fo using mgcl2 as a draw solution and nanofiltration nf like membranes modeling revealed 3 to 4 fold enhancements in na rejection i e reduction in the forward flux of na relative to a pressure driven process under similar conditions although these results collectively suggest that reverse flux of draw electrolytes affects the forward transport of the feed ions hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 the way in which the draw electrolytes impact the feed ion fluxes remains unclear since a major task of fo is membrane rejection of pollutants in the feed solution to achieve their removal it is essential to obtain an in depth understanding of the impacts of draw solutes on the rejection of feed ions and the governing mechanisms research has revealed that coupled reverse transport of constituent ions of draw electrolyte occurs in fo when di water was used as a feed paul 2004 hancock et al 2011 the driving force for this coupled transport is the electrostatic attractions between the constituent ions cussler 2009 which modulate the diffusion of the cations and the anions to the same rate the larger the difference in their diffusivity the greater the extent of electrostatic interactions between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte is expected feed ions transport through the membrane are exposed to electrostatic interactions where the slow moving draw ion would attract the oppositely charged feed ions towards the draw solution side and the fast moving draw ion attracts the counter feed ions to the feed side the transport of draw ions may also be affected by the feed ions however since the draw electrolyte concentration is typically much higher than that of the feed electrolyte in fo the impact of feed electrolyte on the transport of draw electrolyte are expected to be less significant based on the above reasoning it may be expected that 1 a difference in the diffusivities of the draw cation and anion potentially affects the forward transport of the feed ions 2 the larger difference the higher the degree of impact may be expected and 3 by analyzing the electrostatic interactions between the draw ions within the fo membrane the impacts on the transport of the feed ions may be predicted the aim of this study is to understand the role of electrostatic interactions in ion transport in fo nh4 no2 and no3 were used as model feed ions due to their ubiquitous presence in water and wastewater and the removal of which is typically a major task in water wastewater treatment the forward transport behavior of nh4 no2 and no3 was analyzed with draw electrolytes composed of cations and anions with different diffusivity nacl mgcl2 kcl na2so4 sodium citrate tris hcl sodium polyacrylate ge et al 2013 and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride glucose as a neutral draw solute was used to test the flux behaviors of the feed ions in the absence of any electrostatic impact from the draw solute a model was developed to describe the transport behaviors of the feed ions by considering the electrostatic interactions between draw ions and the subsequent effects on the transport of feed ions this work provides fundamental knowledge of the role of electrostatic interactions in ion transport in fo which would benefit in improved understanding and manipulation of the fo and related processes 2

ionic species extended nernst planck equation may be used schlögl 1966 dresner 1972 however for a system containing more than three ions an analytical solution of the equation does not exist dresner 1972 hancock et al 2011 yaroshchuk et al 2013 since the draw solute concentration in fo is typically much higher than that of the feed solute we thus made the following theoretical derivation 1 the electrostatic interactions between the draw cation and anion result in their coupled transport cussler 2009 hancock and cath 2009 hancock et al 2011 the extent of the electrostatic interactions between draw ions within the membrane could be established using the extended nernst planck equation 2 the feed ions are exposed to the electrostatic field which resulted from the different transport coefficients of the draw ions when the feed ions pass through the fo membrane 3 the forward transport of the feed ions do not substantially alter the electrostatic interactions between draw ions due to their relatively low concentration the above assumptions would allow us to use the extended nernst planck equation to analyze the electrostatic interactions between draw ions and approximate its effects on the transport of the feed ions fig 1 as the first step the feed and draw solute flux in the absence of electrostatic interactions was considered which may be used to describe the solute

accurate expression of d ψ d x in the support layer it adds difficulties in understanding the interactions to simplify the equation we consider that j w c d s is typically much higher than j d s for

i o n f e showing the concentration dispersion effects on the feed ions in the active layer 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of draw electrolyte constituents on the feed ion flux no3 flux was measured at a feed nano3 concentration of 1 mm but with different draw solutes at different concentrations for each draw solute high draw solution concentration resulted in high water flux fig 2 there was a general trend that for each draw solute the no3 flux increased with the increase in the water flux due to increased convection hancock and cath 2009 hancock et al 2011 fig 3 a as a non electrolyte draw solute glucose was expected to have minor electrostatic interaction with no3 the non electrostatic interaction model eq 2 predicted the no3 flux in the glucose system well this result also suggested that the cta membrane was largely uncharged hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 when electrolytes were used as draw solutes the no3 flux patterns significantly deviated from the non electrostatic interaction model and that in the case of glucose higher no3 flux was observed when nacl mgcl2 tris hcl or pdadmac was used as draw solute for all these draw solutes the cations na mg2 trish or pdadman have lower diffusion coefficient values and larger hydrated radii nightingale 1959 zheng et al 2019 than that of cl supplementary material table s1 ng and barry 1995 vanysek 2005 adamczyk et al 2014 thus the slow moving cations tend to attract cl towards the draw solution side when transported though the membrane as an anion no3 receives the same attractive force by these cations towards the draw solution side thus resulting in higher forward fluxes these results corroborate other studies where the no3 flux was shown to be deviate significantly from the non electrostatic interaction model when nacl was used as a draw solute hancock et al 2011 irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 additionally it appeared that for these chloride salts the lower the mobility of the cations the higher the impact on the no3 flux fig 3a even for the most commonly used draw solutes i e nacl and mgcl2 the no3 flux was significantly higher than the predictions of the non electrostatic interaction models 1 8 2 0 times for nacl and 2 3 2 7 times for mgcl2 implying that electrostatic interactions played an important role on the flux of the feed ion and must be considered when evaluating membrane rejection of charged compounds in contrast na3cit and paana generated significantly lower no3 flux than that predicted by the non electrostatic interaction model 0 54 0 57 times lower for na3cit and 0 32 0 35 times lower for paana na3cit and paana are weak electrolytes and are not completely dissociated at ph 7 however the diffusivity of the citrate ions and the paa ions are much lower than that of na supplementary material table s1 ng and barry 1995 ge et al 2012 holloway et al 2015 the low diffusivity of these anions and their large hydrated radii adamczyk et al 2006 thomasset et al 1986 results in an attraction of na towards the draw solution side and thus a negative electrostatic field eq 9 which obstructed no3 from passing through and repulsed it to the feed side as a result significantly reduced forward fluxes of no3 were observed similarly the lower the diffusivity of the draw anion the higher the degree of reduction in the no3 flux thus showing that the difference in diffusivity between the draw cation and anion or θ d d s eqs 9 and 27 is a key factor that determines the effects of the draw solutes on the flux of feed ions as an anion no2 showed similar trends to that observed for no3 fig 3b glucose resulted in a no2 flux pattern close to that predicted by the non electrostatic interaction model eq 2 whereas nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac resulted in significantly higher no2 fluxes than the model predictions 1 93 2 01 2 6 3 1 5 4 5 7 and 6 1 6 5 times higher for nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac respectively the no2 flux increased with the decrease in the cation diffusivity and the increase in the hydrated radius values of the cations supplementary material table s1 na3cit and paana resulted in significantly retarded no2 flux 0 43 0 57 and 0 27 0 28 of that predicated by the non electrostatic interaction model due to the higher diffusivity of the cation na than the companion anions citrate3 and paan the no2 flux decreased with a decrease in the anion diffusivity the transport of nh4 showed an opposite trend as compared to no3 and no2 where draw solutes with the constitution of a slow moving cation and a fast moving anion nacl mgcl2 tris hcl and pdadmac resulted in nh4 fluxes lower than that observed in the glucose system fig 3c conversely in the system with draw solutes composed of fast moving cations and slow moving anions the forward transport of nh4 was highly promoted the resultant nh4 fluxes in na3cit and paana systems were 3 8 5 6 and 8 4 9 8 times higher than the predicted flux ignoring the electrostatic interactions and that in the glucose system overall these results fig 3 demonstrated that the composition of the draw solute has significant effects on the forward transport of the feed ions the slow moving constituent ion of the draw solute attracts the counter ion and repulses the co ion resulting in promoted forward fluxes of the counter ion and reduced forward fluxes of the co ion the higher degree of the difference in diffusivity between the constituent ions of the draw solute the higher was the impact observed on the feed ion transport a one way electrostatic model eq 27 was used to estimate the electrostatic impacts of the draw electrolytes on the flux of the feed ions the extent of the influence of each draw electrolyte was well predicted fig 3 the model was established based on the assumption that the draw ion concentrations were much higher than that of the feed ions within the membrane matrix this assumption is valid within a major part of the membrane even when the concentration of the draw solute in the feed solution is at low levels where c d s f may be close to or lower than c f s f supplementary material fig s2 since within the active layer the draw solute concentration increases dramatically from the feed side to the draw side while the concentration of the feed ion sharply decreases in the same direction eq 12 and supplementary material fig s2 however in this case i e when the concentration of the draw solute in the feed solution is at low levels the direct use of eq 27 would overestimate the feed ion fluxes since not all the feed ions may be effectively affected by the draw ions when their concentrations were at similar levels from eq 27 the extent of the electrostatic effects on the feed ion flux is affected by the concentration of the draw electrolytes in the membrane which decreases as the concentrations of the draw electrolytes at the feed side surface of the active layer c d s f e decrease on the other hand the proportion of the feed ions affected by the draw ions would depend on the concentration ratio of the feed to the draw ions as the concentration of the draw ions at the surface of the active layer decreases the proportion of the feed ions affected by the draw ions would correspondingly decrease in general the electrostatic effects would be expected to first increase and then decrease as the concentration of the draw solute at the surface of the active layer increased supplementary material fig s3 thus the feed ion fluxes were approximated with c d s f e eq 27 set to 20 and 50 mm fig 3 overall it suggested that the effects of the draw electrolyte on the flux of the feed ions may be predicted based on the model developed considering the electrostatic interactions 3 2 role of electrostatic interactions to better understand the electrostatic effects of the draw solute on the flux of the feed ions the concentration profile and the electrostatic potential gradient profile of the draw electrolyte within the fo membrane was established based on eqs 11 13 and 15 17 fig 4 shows the use of mgcl2 as draw solute since the diffusivity of mg2 is lower than cl supplementary material table s1 mg2 drags cl when they transport through the membrane along the concentration gradient eqs 11 and 15 the electrostatic interactions between mg2 and cl ions results in the transport of mg2 and cl at the same speed eq 8 ng et al 2006 cussler 2009 the extent of the electrostatic interaction between mg2 and cl is reflected in the calculated electrostatic potential gradient d ψ d x eqs 12 and 17 higher d ψ d x values were observed in the active layer than in the support layer owing to a high concentration gradient of mgcl2 in the active layer the highest electrostatic potential gradient is adjacent to the feed side interface and is reduced gradually through the active layer fig 4a a relative constant electrostatic potential gradient was found within the support layer fig 4a owing largely to the same trends in the concentration and the concentration gradient profiles of mgcl2 in the support layer fig 4a which also supports the assumption of a constant electrostatic potential gradient ψ s to simplify eq 17 into eq 18 the d ψ d x profile fig 4a suggested that the draw electrolytes are expected to show a more significant impact on the transport of feed ions in the active layer than in the support layer feed ions passing through the membrane are subjected to this electrostatic potential gradient no2 as an anion experiences the same electrostatic force as cl i e attracted by mg2 toward the draw solution side and thus an increase in the forward flux fig 4b shows the concentration profiles of no2 in the membrane with and without considering the electrostatic effects from the draw electrolytes with electrostatic effects as according to eqs 21 and 24 significantly increased no2 concentrations was observed in the active layer which resulted in a much higher no2 concentration at the active layer support layer interface in the support layer no2 continues to be attracted by the mg2 as a result the transport of no2 was enhanced nh4 as a cation is expected to experience the same electrostatic force as did mg2 from cl i e toward the feed side as a result nh4 shows significantly reduced forward flux and reduced concentrations within the membrane fig 4c from the d ψ d x profile fig 4a of the draw solution and the concentration gradient profiles of no2 fig 4b and nh4 fig 4c it is clear that the electrostatic effects on the transport of feed ions occurred mainly in the active layer especially in the part close to the feed solution although interactions occur between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte within the membrane matrix as indicated by the nernst planck equation eqs 4a and 4b these interactions modulated the transport of the draw ions to the same rate since electroneutrality of the solution is maintained at any point within the membrane no explicit electrostatic potential is likely to be generated across the membrane during bidirectional transport the electrostatic interactions among the feed and draw ions results in re partitioning of the feed and draw ions within the membrane matrix fig 4b and c overall electroneutrality will still be maintained as such the solutions or the membrane would not show any electrostatic potential externally 3 3 electroneutrality in bidirectional transport to further understand the interactions between feed and draw solution and the effects of feed ions on the reverse transport of draw ions fo experiments was performed at an elevated feed electrolyte concentration with 10 mm nh4no3 as a feed and with different draw solutes at a concentration of 1m the bidirectional transport behavior of the feed ions and the draw ions was evaluated results showed that electrostatic interactions played a key role in the transport of the feed ions even with elevated feed ion concentrations 10 mm fig 4a the trend was largely similar to that observed at low feed ion concentrations 1 mm fig 2 in the glucose system similar nh4 and no3 fluxes were observed without electrostatic impact from the draw solute the transport of nh4 and no3 is coupled to maintain electrostatic neutrality in the system fig 1a eq 7 cussler 2009 hancock et al 2011 while in other systems the transport of nh4 and no3 was largely uncoupled significantly promoted no3 flux with highly reduced nh4 flux was observed in systems with draw solute composed of fast moving anions and slow moving cations kcl nacl mgcl2 and trishcl while the draw electrolyte with fast cation slow anion combinations na2so4 and na3cit generated significantly higher nh4 flux then that of no3 the nh4 flux no3 flux ratio show a strong positive correlation with θd eq 9 fig 5 a suggesting that the flux behaviors of the feed ions were largely determined by the diffusivity difference between the draw ions θd of the draw electrolyte is an effective indictor to denote the effects of draw electrolyte on the transport of feed ions analyses of the reverse flux of the draw ions showed that the reverse transport of draw electrolytes is largely coupled when the feed solution was ultra pure water phillip et al 2010 figs 5c and 1a and eq 7 uncoupled transport of the draw ions was observed when the feed solution was 10 mm nh4no3 fig 5c corresponding to the higher no3 fluxes increased reverse transport of cl was observed for nacl mgcl and kcl suggesting the effects of feed ions on the reverse transport of the draw ions this observation was in line with the ion exchange phenomena reported by irvine et al 2013 similar evidences were observed in other studies with nacl as a draw solute kong et al 2018 from this study it seems clear that electrostatic interaction between draw and feed ions is a key driving force of the ion exchange phenomena contrasting the huge differences in the feed nh4 and no3 fluxes fig 5a lower differences were observed for the draw ions fig 5c owing to the higher concentration of the draw ions than the feed ions these results also suggested that the electrostatic interactions between draw and feed ions has more remarkable impact on the transport of the feed ions than on the draw ions hancock et al 2011 mass charge balance evaluated showed that despite the transport of draw and feed ions was affected in different extents the mass charge difference generated due to the different flux of the feed ions was well compensated by that generated due to the different flux of the draw ions in all systems fig 5d which allowed both the draw and the feed sides maintain an electroneutrality during the bidirectional transport of the feed and the draw ions these results again manifested that electrostatic interactions are the essential drive force of the different bidirectional ions flux behaviors in different systems fig 5 3 4 discussion and implications using no3 no2 and nh4 salts as feed solutes this study demonstrated that electrostatic interaction plays a key role in the ion transport in the fo process the composition of the draw solute specifically the difference in the diffusion coefficient between the draw anions and cations showed significant effects on the transport of the feed ions i e the membrane rejection of the feed ions draw solute composed of a slower cation lower diffusion coefficient and a faster anion higher diffusion coefficient e g nacl mgcl2 tris hcl or pdadmac significantly promoted the forward transport of the feed anions e g no2 or no3 and retarded that of the feed cations e g nh4 the opposite was true for draw solute composed of faster cations and slower anions e g na3cit or paana the extent of the effects was determined by the normalized diffusivity difference of the draw cation and anion θd the effects were remarkable even for the commonly used draw solutes such as nacl and mgcl2 where the flux of the no2 and no3 was increased by a few times and the transport of nh4 was retarded by a similar magnitude figs 3 and 5 these results may explain the commonly observed lower membrane cta fo membrane rejection of no2 and no3 than nh4 when nacl or mgcl2 was used as draw solutes qiu and ting 2013 2015 wang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 the electrostatic interaction between draw and feed ions also provide a more fundamental explanation of the ion exchange phenomena observed in the fo process irvine et al 2013 kong et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 draw solute composition significantly affects the membrane rejection of the feed ions fig 3 these results imply that the effects of draw solute may not be omitted when evaluating the performance of fo processes and or fo membranes nacl and mgcl2 are among the most commonly used draw solute in fo achilli et al 2010 ge et al 2013 shaffer et al 2015 qiu et al 2016a 2016b awad et al 2019 the diffusivity difference between cl and na or mg2 is high enough to show significant effect on the forward transport of feed ions additionally organic salts islam et al 2019 and some largely asymmetric electrolytes have been proposed as novel draw solutes e g na10 phytate ge et al 2018 paana ge et al 2012 etc in fo due to their extremely low leakage holloway et al 2015 cai and hu 2016 zou et al 2019 the electrostatic effects in fo systems using these electrolytes are expected to be more significant the effects of electrostatic interaction on the removal of charged pollutants in these systems may need to be considered additionally the effects of the composition of the draw solute in amending the transport of feed ions also suggested an opportunity to enhance the removal of specific charged pollutants in fo by selecting appropriate draw solutes to enhance the removal of negatively charged ions a draw solute composed of faster cations high diffusivity or large hydrated radius and slower anions lower diffusivity or small hydrated radius are preferable conversely a draw solute composed of slower cations and faster anions would be expected to enhance the removal of positively charged pollutants the greater the difference in diffusivity between the ions in the draw solution θd the higher the degree of effectiveness may be expected the electrostatic interactions between the feed and draw ions may be considered as a form of the donnan equilibrium in a more general sense donnan 1924 hancock et al 2011 where it is not non diffusible ions or fixed charges in the membrane matrix that electrostatically excludes charged ions lu et al 2014 but the diffusivity difference between the constituent draw ions that altered the transport behaviors of feed ions the fluxes of the anion and the cation could differ by several folds e g the flux of no3 was 36 times higher than nh4 when 1m mgcl2 was used as a draw solution fig 5 these differences might be further enhanced by increasing the draw solute concentration or using a highly asymmetrical draw solute such as paana or pdadmac as in this work these results suggest the potential to use fo for selective ion removal or concentration in general electrostatic interaction is a key factor governing ion transport behaviors in fo an in depth analysis of the effects of electrostatic interactions would result in improved understanding of solute transport this may lead to novel developments by manipulating the effects of electrostatic interactions to enhance the removal of specific pollutants such as heavy metals and or charged trace organic compounds 4 conclusion electrostatic interactions were shown to play a key role in ion transport in the fo process the composition of the draw electrolyte significantly impacts the forward transport of the feed ions draw electrolyte composed of low diffusivity cations and high diffusivity anions promoted the forward transport of the feed anions and retarded that of the feed cation conversely the forward transport of the feed anions was greatly reduced while that of the feed cation was significantly enhanced with draw electrolyte composed of high mobility cations and low mobility anions the effects were remarkable even for the most commonly used draw electrolytes nacl or mgcl2 where the forward fluxes of nutrient ions nh4 no3 and no2 were promoted retarded by a few folds compared to that in a nonelectrolyte draw solute glucose system more profound increase reduction up to 10 times was observed for highly asymmetric draw electrolytes paana or pdadmac a mathematic model is developed by considering the electrostatic interaction between the draw and the feed ions to predict the effect of electrostatic interactions on the forward transport of the feed ions the normalized diffusivity difference θd between the constituent ions of the draw electrolyte is found as a key factor that determines the degree of the electrostatic effects on the forward flux of the feed ions these results may have important implications in enhancing our understanding of bidirectional ion transport in fo the findings may be useful in the design and development of fo processes for enhanced removal of charged pollutants via draw solute selection and
