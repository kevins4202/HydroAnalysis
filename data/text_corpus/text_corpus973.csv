4865,the goal of this work is to estimate surface and root zone soil moisture at resolutions that are useful for decision making and water resources management a 500 m atmospheric forcing dataset is developed from the 12 5 km nldas 2 north america land data assimilation system products across oklahoma where high quality observations are available for validation purposes a land surface model is then forced with three combinations of input variables to simulate surface and root zone soil moisture 1 nldas 2 atmospheric forcings at their original resolution 2 downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and original resolution nldas 2 precipitation and 3 downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation results show that the third simulation is able to bring modeled standard normal deviates of both surface and root zone soil moisture closer to in situ observations whereas the second simulation only shows slight improvements with respect to one forced with original resolution nldas 2 data this is particularly evident for negative values of standard normal deviates which correspond to drier than usual cases due to the improved ability of the downscaled precipitation to detect missed events and no rain cases in summary finer resolution forcings have the potential to improve simulations of soil moisture and the resolution of precipitation plays a critical role in improving time series of soil moisture standard normal deviates keywords hyper resolution soil moisture land surface modeling 1 introduction by controlling the partitioning of available energy incident on the land surface soil moisture is a key variable in land atmosphere interactions that impact local weather such as cloud coverage and precipitation and hydrological parameters such as runoff and evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 soil moisture is also involved in several feedbacks e g soil moisture temperature and soil moisture precipitation that may be significant not only at the local scale but also at regional and global scale in particular root zone soil moisture plays a prime role in the regulation of water and energy budgets at the soil vegetation atmosphere interface through evaporation processes of the surface soil layer and plant transpiration shukla and mintz 1982 if the initialization of root zone soil moisture is not accurate it may cause drifts of the temporal evolution of the surface state variables and degrade weather forecasts beljaars et al 1996 dirmeyer 2000 koster and suarez 2003 thus realistic estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture can improve weather and climate prediction hazard mitigation floods and droughts agricultural planning and water resources management as the global availability of in situ high quality high resolution soil moisture measurements is limited satellite missions such as the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a and the soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 represent a valid alternative satellite based instruments measure land surface brightness temperature and radar backscatter thus providing information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column the significance of these products depends critically on the resolution at which they are available which often limits their use in decision making therefore modeling is necessary to estimate soil moisture and its variations over time space and with depth in the soil column this need for improved accuracy and resolution of soil moisture across different landscapes drove the development of hyper resolution land surface modeling models at high resolution often referred to as hyper resolution 100 m to 1 km globally have recently been able to provide detailed information about the storage movement and quality of carbon and water at and near the land surface wood et al 2011 however developing such modeling systems is challenging as adequate model physics should be assessed computing resources must be available and atmospheric variables at such resolutions are needed as input to force the model beven et al 2015 garnaud et al 2015 singh et al 2015 ji et al 2017 land surface models lsms generally require a set of near surface atmospheric forcing variables at every time step air temperature air humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave radiation shortwave radiation and precipitation physical dynamic and statistical downscaling approaches have been developed in the past to interpolate coarser resolution atmospheric variables to the required resolution cosgrove et al 2003 haylock et al 2006 liston and elder 2006 girotto et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 gaur and simonovic 2017 rouf et al 2019 recently developed a downscaling approach for a set of atmospheric variables based on correlations with landscape information such as topography surface roughness and vegetation their proof of concept over oklahoma showed that correlation coefficients between the downscaled products at 500 m and ground observations were consistently higher and biases smaller than the ones between the native resolution data at 12 5 km and ground observations moreover the random forest rf framework developed by mei et al 2020 for downscaling precipitation showed promises specifically they downscaled the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 precipitation product to 1 km resolution using the rf classification and regression algorithm across high mountain asia their results suggest improvements with respect to the original resolution merra 2 and comparable performance with several satellite products and ground based observations both in terms of precipitation magnitude and variability this work investigates the potential of applying these downscaling techniques to a set of atmospheric forcings and subsequently force an lsm to estimate surface and root zone soil moisture at 500 m across oklahoma particular attention is given to the resolution of precipitation the reason is twofold first being precipitation the main driving forcing variable in land surface modeling it controls several hydrological and biogeochemical processes including runoff evaporation transpiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture hazra et al 2019 second precipitation largely varies both in space and time and its resolution may play a fundamental role in the estimation of soil moisture nevertheless soil moisture temporally integrates prior precipitation and is subject to lower and upper limits and the variability of errors in soil moisture is typically smaller than that of errors in precipitation maggioni et al 2012 hence the impact of atmospheric forcings and their associated resolutions on soil moisture simulated by an lsm is not straightforward this works seeks therefore to answer the following main research questions do finer resolution forcing data improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by an lsm is the resolution of precipitation more important than the one of others in order to answer such questions we propose three different simulations that use different combinations of lsm input data at different resolutions as described in the methodology section the coarse resolution dataset comes from the phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 the downscaling approaches developed by rouf et al 2019 and mei et al 2020 which consider local topography to downscale a set of atmospheric variables are applied to the nldas 2 dataset 2 methodology this work focuses on a domain in oklahoma in the midwestern united states during 2015 this area is chosen because of the availability of a dense network of hydrometeorological stations the oklahoma mesonet brock et al 1994 mcpherson et al 2007 fig 1 which is fundamental to evaluate the proposed modeling approach oklahoma is characterized by a gentle topography that spans from an altitude of 88 mamsl meters above mean sea level in the southeastern corner to a height of 1515 mamsl in the northwestern corner and by a continental climate with cold winters and hot summers the western region is drier compared to the wetter eastern half as shown in fig 1 the noah mp is selected as the land surface model see section 2 2 the meteorological forcing used for noah mp come from nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 mitchell 2004 the non precipitation land surface forcing fields for nldas 2 are derived from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 while nldas uses the eta data assimilation system for precipitation edas rogers et al 1996 nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 1 8 degree and temporal resolution hourly for the period of 1979 present the original nldas 2 variables near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and precipitation are downscaled to 500 m using the combination of physically based methods for all variables but precipitation and a rf based framework for precipitation as described in the next section the 500 m resolution is chosen as most physical parameters used to downscale the atmospheric variables are available at such resolution globally approaching finer resolutions would require downscaling these parameters as well adding the opportunity for more uncertainties and errors then both the original resolution nldas 2 and the downscaled variables are used to force the noah mp land surface model to produce high resolution soil moisture estimates three different simulations are proposed in this work in which noah mp is forced with different combinations of input data 1 nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation at their original resolution hereinafter simulation 1 2 nldas 2 downscaled atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and original resolution nldas 2 precipitation hereinafter simulation 2 and 3 nldas 2 downscaled atmospheric variables and precipitation hereinafter simulation 3 2 1 the downscaled forcing dataset the downscaling framework proposed by rouf et al 2019 is based on a set of deterministic physical rules and was tested on the nldas 2 dataset across oklahoma during 2015 their methodology assumes that topography and vegetation cover have a large impact on surface atmospheric conditions and thus uses high resolution topography and vegetation information to spatially downscale 12 5 km nldas 2 2 m air temperature surface pressure 2 m humidity incident longwave shortwave radiation and 10 m wind speed to 500 m moreover this approach adopts i a dynamic lapse rate of air and dewpoint temperature to downscale air temperature pressure and humidity ii multiple factors including a clearness index local illumination cast shadowing sky obstruction and topographic configuration for downscaling shortwave radiation and iii a spatially downscaled surface roughness and zero plane displacement height for downscaling wind speed in rouf et al 2019 the 500 m downscaled products were compared to high quality high resolution ground observations collected by the oklahoma mesonet network for all the atmospheric variables an improvement was observed in terms of bias correlation coefficient root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency additionally the downscaled atmospheric products were able to overall capture more spatial variability than the original nldas 2 since the dataset adopted in this study is exactly the same as the one developed and validated by rouf et al 2019 over the same domain no additional evaluation is proposed here and the reader is referred to their study for supplementary information and more detail on the algorithms and their performance the 500 m precipitation dataset is obtained through the framework developed by mei et al 2020 the core of this method is rf classification and regression first a recursive feature elimination procedure is used to select relevant predictors which include variables representing atmospheric geographic and vegetation cover information i e air temperature dew point temperature air pressure specific humidity relative humidity incident longwave radiation incident shortwave radiation wind speed 30 day lagged vegetation index 60 day lagged vegetation index distance to the closest dry grid cell climate class latitude longitude and day of year the eight variables selected as relevant predicators are dew point temperature air pressure specific humidity incident longwave radiation incident shortwave radiation wind speed 60 day lagged vegetation index and day of year a binary precipitation mask is produced based on daily cumulative precipitation rate greater than 0 mm and an rf classification model is trained to the daily precipitation mask then the rf regression model is applied to provide the 500 m precipitation field using the downscaled predictors over rainy pixels only the obtained product is validated across the study area using observations collected at the mesonet rain gauges as discussed in section 2 3 the rf based framework provides downscaled precipitation at 500 m daily resolution this downscaled precipitation is further disaggregated to hourly for the land surface model following a method similar to lópez lópez et al 2018 specifically the fraction of precipitation per hour derived from the 12 5 km nldas 2 dataset is used to disaggregate daily downscaled precipitation at 500 m resolution to the hourly time scale following these steps i precipitation at 12 5 km resolution that occurs during the ith hour pi is divided by the daily total precipitation to obtain the fraction of precipitation f for hour i ii f i p i i 1 24 p i where 24 is the number of hours in a day note that fi is defined for pixel with non zero daily precipitation accumulation only iii the fractions of precipitation obtained for the 12 5 km grid fi are bilinearly interpolated to the 500 m grid obtaining fdi iv daily downscaled precipitation is multiplied by the corresponding fractions fdi to obtain hourly precipitation at each 500 m grid cell daily precipitation is disaggregating evenly for pixels whose fdi is not defined 2 2 the noah mp land surface model simulations the lsm adopted in this study is the community noah land surface model with multi parameterization options noah mp version 3 6 niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the noah mp is based on the original noah lsm with improved physical processes such as the separation of the vegetation canopy from the ground surface and the inclusion of a multi layer snow model noah mp has been shown to successfully simulate land atmosphere energy water and carbon exchanges and hydrologic states such as surface runoff soil moisture snow depth snow water equivalent and terrestrial water storage both over the united states e g cai et al 2014 chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 and in other complex regions such as high mountain asia xue et al 2019 noah mp is run within the nasa land information system lis peters lidard et al 2007 a software for high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation that provides a common framework capable of ensemble land surface modeling on points regions or the globe in order to initialize the offline lsm a multi year spin up loop approach is adopted the model is first spun up for 20 years looping over a 10 year period from 2005 to 2014 reaching quasi equilibrium for both surface and subsurface temperature states and then run at a 15 min time step to produce hourly output for 2015 on a regular 1 km and 12 5 km spatial grid model parameters e g land cover land mask soil texture elevation slope aspect greenness data albedo snow albedo bottom temperature are used at 1 km for the high resolution runs and averaged to the 12 5 km grid for the coarser resolution simulations quasi equilibrium is reached when the difference in soil moisture values between the last two runs was less than 0 1 following the approach in rodell et al 2005 and cai et al 2016 within lis the nldas 2 forcing fields i e near surface air temperature and specific humidity downward longwave and shortwave radiation eastward and northward wind surface pressure and total precipitation with an hourly temporal resolution and 12 5 km and 1 km spatial resolution onto the same model time step the static input data for noah mp are obtained from the national center for atmospheric research application laboratory website https ral ucar edu solutions products noah multiparameterization land surface model noah mp lsm which are preprocessed onto the same model grid using the nasa land surface data toolkit ldt public release of version 7 2 arsenault et al 2018 the noah mp is developed based on the original noah land surface model with multiple options available for surface water infiltration runoff groundwater transfer and storage dynamic vegetation canopy resistance and frozen soil physics niu et al 2011 table 1 summarizes all noah mp options and parameters used in this study 2 3 validation dataset and performance metrics the oklahoma mesonet network used as reference for validating the model estimates both in terms of precipitation and soil moisture is a statewide network designed and implemented by the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university fig 1 it consists of 120 automated environmental monitoring stations that provide regular measurements of several atmospheric and hydrologic variables martens et al 2017 mesonet home page n d the measurements are taken every 5 min and transmitted to a central facility that performs quality control the total amount of rainfall is measured by tipping bucket rain gauge sensors approximately 0 01 in per tip or 0 254 mm the gauges are located 0 6 m above the ground have a 30 5 cm diameter opening and are surrounded by a 121 cm shield to minimize wind effects mesonet uses unheated gauges because of their cost and power efficiency which may cause underestimation in case of snow or freezing rain events soil moisture at each mesonet site is measured using thermocouples at four different depths 5 25 60 and 75 cm for each measurement temperature is measured before and after a short heat pulse 21 s each sensor measurement is calibrated with its own coefficient first then a linear regression is applied to normalize the response and reduce sensor specific variances using a set of empirical coefficients measured from different retention curves the volumetric water content is determined from the soil matric potential which is a measure of the capillary force needed to retain water in the soil calculated using the calibrated temperature values van genuchten 1980 arya and paris 1981 illston et al 2008 in this work we focus on anomaly time series of precipitation and soil moisture i e standard normal deviates computed by subtracting the 2015 yearly mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation this is because we are well aware of systematic differences between in situ observations and model estimates due to the point scale character of the first versus the distributed nature of the latter in the case of soil moisture there is also a mismatch in the available measurement depths and the vertical resolution of the land surface model specifically surface soil moisture in this manuscript refers to the mesonet soil moisture measured at 5 cm depth and the 0 10 cm soil moisture output from the noah mp model whereas root zone soil moisture is defined as the mesonet observation at 60 cm depth and the 40 100 cm the mid point of the layer is 70 cm output from noah mp standard normal deviates capture the phase correspondence between model estimates and in situ measurements regardless of potential mean biases or differences in dynamic range maggioni et al 2011 entekhabi et al 2010b to validate the downscaled precipitation dataset against the mesonet in situ observations we adopt both continuous metrics like correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse of time series of standard normal deviates additionally we investigate categorical metrics like hit rate probability of detection threat score probability of false detection and false alarm rate defined based on a contingency table table 2 specifically the hit rate hr measures the number of events that were correctly detected either both products detect rain hits or neither does correct no rain divided by the total number of events n the probability of detection pod assesses the chances that the model estimates in our case either nldas 2 or the downscaled product correctly detect rain hits when the in situ stations measure rain hits misses the threat score ts is equal to the total number of correctly detected events hits divided by the total number of estimated events plus the number of misses hits false alarms misses the probability of false detection pofd measures the number of false alarms per the total number of non events false alarms correct zeros whereas the false alarm rate far is computed as the number of false alarms per the total number of estimated events hits false alarms for soil moisture we analyze time series of station averaged standard normal deviates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by noah mp for the three experiments described above and the corresponding mesonet observations to study the temporal correspondence between model prediction and in situ measurements similar to precipitation soil moisture standard normal deviate time series are computed by subtracting the 2015 yearly mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation next the cumulative distribution function cdf of each dataset is computed to investigate whether the model performs particularly well or poorly for certain value ranges of surface root zone soil moisture we also analyze scatterplots of simulated soil moisture deviates versus their corresponding reference values to visually assess the proximity of these two datasets for each proposed simulation as a last step we summarize what observed through the time series cdfs and scatterplots in boxplots of correlation coefficients and rmses computed between the model estimates and the mesonet observations 3 results 3 1 precipitation in order to validate the downscaled precipitation product we investigate maps of precipitation standard normal deviates and compute correlation coefficients and root mean square errors between the original resolution nldas 2 and downscaled product deviates and corresponding mesonet deviates at each site across the study region fig 2 the annual average for precipitation mm day over oklahoma during 2015 is presented in fig 2 a at the original nldas 2 resolution and in fig 2 b at the downscaled 500 m resolution the overall statistics shown on the plots to summarize the product s performance prove that r does not change and rmse decreases thanks to downscaling in general r and rmse only slightly improve the precipitation anomalies after downscaling some locations show poor performance in the original nldas 2 dataset and the downscaling algorithm only marginally improves some of them e g the yellow dark blue dot located in the panhandle in panel 1c 1e turns into brownish light blue in panel 1d 1f demonstrating a slightly higher correlation and smaller root mean square error a larger improvement is noticed in rmse compared to r at several stations although the improvement in the statistical metrics is not substantial the level of detail that the 500 m map 1a presents compared to the native nldas 2 resolution one 1b is certainly noteworthy fig 2 also demonstrates that there is no systematic spatial bias introduced by the downscaling algorithm since the improvement in the rmse is evident at most mesonet stations whereas r values are consistently similar to the ones observed in the original dataset as shown by the contingency table in table 2 and the categorical statistics in table 3 the downscaled precipitation product is able to improve decrease the number of misses and therefore correctly detect more no rain events this results in a slightly larger hr and ts i e 1 higher and in an enhanced pod from 72 to 79 the downside is an increased false alarm rate from 18 to 23 and a slightly higher probability of false detection i e 1 higher although still below 10 false alarms are particularly critical in flood prediction but in agriculture management missed events are also essential for instance to avoid irrigating crops where and when there is no need 3 2 soil moisture fig 3 presents maps of 12 5 km output soil moisture obtained from the noah mp model forced with the native resolution nldas 2 atmospheric variables simulation 1 and output at 500 m resolution from simulations 2 and 3 forced with the downscaled nldas 2 data as a reminder in simulation 2 only select atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure are downscaled and the original resolution nldas 2 precipitation is used whereas in simulation 3 all nldas 2 atmospheric variables including precipitation are downscaled to 500 m the spatial distribution of soil wetness across the study region is maintained when moving the coarser 12 5 km to the finer grid nevertheless the level of detail added by the downscaling procedure is evident when comparing maps in the first row with the remainder in order to investigate the temporal variability of soil moisture fig 4 presents station average standard normal deviate daily time series of model predicted surface and root zone soil moisture for the three simulations and corresponding mesonet observations during the study period first off standard normal deviate time series are consistent between surface and root zone soil moisture second variations of the modeled soil moisture in all three simulations are consistent with the mesonet observations third simulation 3 which uses as input all the downscaled atmospheric variables including precipitation is able to bring the model closer to the in situ time series especially when the soil is either particularly wet winter or dry summer this is noticeable both in surface and root zone soil moisture time series cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal deviates of soil moisture estimates and observations are constructed based on all model pixels where both a mesonet measurement is available cdfs for each simulation and for the mesonet observations are shown in fig 5 first off simulations 1 and 2 are very closed to each other as also demonstrated by the time series in fig 4 with a slight difference for low values of standard normal deviates between 2 5 and 1 5 and being more pronounced in the root zone soil moisture distributions this stresses how the resolution in the input atmospheric variables only has a minor impact on modeled soil moisture anomalies the story is very different when actual values of soil moisture are considered rather than anomalies as simulation 2 is able to remove the bias between the original resolution noah mp i e simulation 1 and the reference dataset however since this comparison is not completely fair as discussed in the section 2 such analysis is not discussed here the cdf from simulation 3 is much closer to the ground observations both in terms of surface and root zone moisture and particularly for negative standard normal deviates i e when the soil is drier than the average value these results suggest that the higher resolution precipitation product improves the accuracy of the land surface model under dry condition which is linked to the better performance of the downscaled precipitation product with respect to the original resolution nldas 2 in terms of number of misses and correct detection of no rain events as shown in tables 2 and 3 what previously shown in the time series and cdfs is corroborated by the density scatterplots in fig 6 that present soil moisture predicted by noah mp in the 3 different simulations versus the corresponding mesonet observations simulation 3 largely improves surface soil moisture estimates moving them closer to the 1 1 line with respect to the native resolution simulation simulation 1 and the one with only the atmospheric variables downscaled to 500 m but not the precipitation input simulation 2 once again this is particularly evident at negative values of standard normal deviates which are pushed closer to the reference mesonet values in the case of root zone soil moisture the improvement is not as obvious as in surface soil moisture which is why rs and rmses are investigated next in order to quantify what discussed above we analyze the correlation coefficients and rmses between simulated and observed standard normal deviates of soil moisture for each station and corresponding model pixel boxplots in fig 7 present the median the 25th and 75th percentiles and the minimum and maximum of such values of r and rmse the median value of r slightly increases throughout the different simulations for both surface and root zone soil moisture even more interestingly the variability around the median i e difference between 75th and 25th percentile and difference between minimum and maximum value also shrinks thanks to the higher resolution input dataset once again simulation 3 improves the performance of both simulations 1 and 2 showing the importance of precipitation resolution in modeling soil moisture similarly the median rmse decreases when downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation are used to force noah mp to simulate both surface and root zone soil moisture with respect to simulation 1 in which the native resolution nldas 2 dataset is used although the difference between the rmse in simulation 1 and 2 is minimal for surface soil moisture it is more substantial in predictions of root zone soil moisture showing some impact due to the change in resolution of most atmospheric variables excluding precipitation the variability around the median rmse is noticeably narrower for surface and root zone soil moisture in simulation 3 with respect to the corresponding simulations 1 4 conclusions one of the top priorities and fundamental input for hydrologic process models is surface weather at the land atmosphere boundary as hydrologic models move toward higher spatial and temporal resolution and larger spatial domains this work contributes an assessment of a land surface model forced with 500 m atmospheric variables that simulates surface and root zone soil moisture such resolutions provide more detailed information about the storage movement and quality of water at and near the land surface which is fundamental for water resources management crop yield prediction and hydroclimatic hazards monitoring the proposed downscaled precipitation product is shown to only marginally improve the original resolution nldas 2 dataset in terms of correlation coefficients and root mean square errors of standard normal deviates of precipitation with respect to the oklahoma mesonet observations in terms of categorical statistics the downscaled product is able to improve the number of missed events and correctly detect more no rain events but showed larger false alarm rates and a slightly higher probability of false detection nevertheless the level of detail that the 500 m precipitation field presents compared to the 12 5 km resolution is noteworthy which is also translated into maps of soil moisture simulated by noah mp simulation 3 which used as input all the downscaled atmospheric variables including precipitation is proven to be the most successful at pushing the model closer to the mesonet soil moisture observations for standard normal deviates of both surface and root zone soil moisture simulation 2 forced with downscaled atmospheric variables but original resolution nldas 2 precipitation only shows slight improvements with respect to simulation 1 forced with original resolution nldas 2 data which stresses the importance of precipitation resolution on modeled soil moisture anomalies this is more evident for negative values of standard normal deviates which correspond to drier than usual cases and may be related to the ability of the downscaled precipitation product to better detect missed events and improve the detection of no rain cases in summary to answer the research questions posed in the introductory section results show that 1 finer resolution forcing data have the potential to improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by noah mp in terms of higher correlations and lower rmses in soil moisture anomalies and 2 the resolution of input precipitation has a critical role in improving time series of both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates although land surface models can provide spatial and temporal soil moisture variability information they are well known to introduce biases which is the reason why biases were not discussed in this work nevertheless assimilation of satellite based soil moisture products e g smap smos can help to correct these first order large scale biases future work should focus on combining model estimates of surface soil moisture with satellite based observations e g from the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission within a land data assimilation system this methodology can potentially be applied to improve the estimates of hyper resolution surface and root zone soil moisture globally spatial resolutions finer than 500 m could potentially be investigated achieving higher resolutions is complicated by i the risk of adding uncertainties and errors as several parameters used in the downscaling techniques would require interpolation or more sophisticated methods from coarser to finer scales ii higher resolutions are currently not available within the lis framework and iii computational expenses especially at the global scale and fine temporal sampling this work proved the viability of the proposed framework to improve our estimation of soil moisture in a region oklahoma characterized by gentle topography but where high quality high resolution continuous ground based data are available further expansion of this work should assess the performance of such method in different regions of the world some preliminary work conducted in high mountain asia showed some promise in this regard where the downscaling techniques were applied to the global modern era

4865,the goal of this work is to estimate surface and root zone soil moisture at resolutions that are useful for decision making and water resources management a 500 m atmospheric forcing dataset is developed from the 12 5 km nldas 2 north america land data assimilation system products across oklahoma where high quality observations are available for validation purposes a land surface model is then forced with three combinations of input variables to simulate surface and root zone soil moisture 1 nldas 2 atmospheric forcings at their original resolution 2 downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and original resolution nldas 2 precipitation and 3 downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation results show that the third simulation is able to bring modeled standard normal deviates of both surface and root zone soil moisture closer to in situ observations whereas the second simulation only shows slight improvements with respect to one forced with original resolution nldas 2 data this is particularly evident for negative values of standard normal deviates which correspond to drier than usual cases due to the improved ability of the downscaled precipitation to detect missed events and no rain cases in summary finer resolution forcings have the potential to improve simulations of soil moisture and the resolution of precipitation plays a critical role in improving time series of soil moisture standard normal deviates keywords hyper resolution soil moisture land surface modeling 1 introduction by controlling the partitioning of available energy incident on the land surface soil moisture is a key variable in land atmosphere interactions that impact local weather such as cloud coverage and precipitation and hydrological parameters such as runoff and evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 soil moisture is also involved in several feedbacks e g soil moisture temperature and soil moisture precipitation that may be significant not only at the local scale but also at regional and global scale in particular root zone soil moisture plays a prime role in the regulation of water and energy budgets at the soil vegetation atmosphere interface through evaporation processes of the surface soil layer and plant transpiration shukla and mintz 1982 if the initialization of root zone soil moisture is not accurate it may cause drifts of the temporal evolution of the surface state variables and degrade weather forecasts beljaars et al 1996 dirmeyer 2000 koster and suarez 2003 thus realistic estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture can improve weather and climate prediction hazard mitigation floods and droughts agricultural planning and water resources management as the global availability of in situ high quality high resolution soil moisture measurements is limited satellite missions such as the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a and the soil moisture ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2001 represent a valid alternative satellite based instruments measure land surface brightness temperature and radar backscatter thus providing information on surface soil moisture top 5 cm of the soil column the significance of these products depends critically on the resolution at which they are available which often limits their use in decision making therefore modeling is necessary to estimate soil moisture and its variations over time space and with depth in the soil column this need for improved accuracy and resolution of soil moisture across different landscapes drove the development of hyper resolution land surface modeling models at high resolution often referred to as hyper resolution 100 m to 1 km globally have recently been able to provide detailed information about the storage movement and quality of carbon and water at and near the land surface wood et al 2011 however developing such modeling systems is challenging as adequate model physics should be assessed computing resources must be available and atmospheric variables at such resolutions are needed as input to force the model beven et al 2015 garnaud et al 2015 singh et al 2015 ji et al 2017 land surface models lsms generally require a set of near surface atmospheric forcing variables at every time step air temperature air humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave radiation shortwave radiation and precipitation physical dynamic and statistical downscaling approaches have been developed in the past to interpolate coarser resolution atmospheric variables to the required resolution cosgrove et al 2003 haylock et al 2006 liston and elder 2006 girotto et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 gaur and simonovic 2017 rouf et al 2019 recently developed a downscaling approach for a set of atmospheric variables based on correlations with landscape information such as topography surface roughness and vegetation their proof of concept over oklahoma showed that correlation coefficients between the downscaled products at 500 m and ground observations were consistently higher and biases smaller than the ones between the native resolution data at 12 5 km and ground observations moreover the random forest rf framework developed by mei et al 2020 for downscaling precipitation showed promises specifically they downscaled the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 precipitation product to 1 km resolution using the rf classification and regression algorithm across high mountain asia their results suggest improvements with respect to the original resolution merra 2 and comparable performance with several satellite products and ground based observations both in terms of precipitation magnitude and variability this work investigates the potential of applying these downscaling techniques to a set of atmospheric forcings and subsequently force an lsm to estimate surface and root zone soil moisture at 500 m across oklahoma particular attention is given to the resolution of precipitation the reason is twofold first being precipitation the main driving forcing variable in land surface modeling it controls several hydrological and biogeochemical processes including runoff evaporation transpiration groundwater recharge and soil moisture hazra et al 2019 second precipitation largely varies both in space and time and its resolution may play a fundamental role in the estimation of soil moisture nevertheless soil moisture temporally integrates prior precipitation and is subject to lower and upper limits and the variability of errors in soil moisture is typically smaller than that of errors in precipitation maggioni et al 2012 hence the impact of atmospheric forcings and their associated resolutions on soil moisture simulated by an lsm is not straightforward this works seeks therefore to answer the following main research questions do finer resolution forcing data improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by an lsm is the resolution of precipitation more important than the one of others in order to answer such questions we propose three different simulations that use different combinations of lsm input data at different resolutions as described in the methodology section the coarse resolution dataset comes from the phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 the downscaling approaches developed by rouf et al 2019 and mei et al 2020 which consider local topography to downscale a set of atmospheric variables are applied to the nldas 2 dataset 2 methodology this work focuses on a domain in oklahoma in the midwestern united states during 2015 this area is chosen because of the availability of a dense network of hydrometeorological stations the oklahoma mesonet brock et al 1994 mcpherson et al 2007 fig 1 which is fundamental to evaluate the proposed modeling approach oklahoma is characterized by a gentle topography that spans from an altitude of 88 mamsl meters above mean sea level in the southeastern corner to a height of 1515 mamsl in the northwestern corner and by a continental climate with cold winters and hot summers the western region is drier compared to the wetter eastern half as shown in fig 1 the noah mp is selected as the land surface model see section 2 2 the meteorological forcing used for noah mp come from nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 mitchell 2004 the non precipitation land surface forcing fields for nldas 2 are derived from the ncep north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 while nldas uses the eta data assimilation system for precipitation edas rogers et al 1996 nldas 2 has a spatial resolution of 1 8 degree and temporal resolution hourly for the period of 1979 present the original nldas 2 variables near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and precipitation are downscaled to 500 m using the combination of physically based methods for all variables but precipitation and a rf based framework for precipitation as described in the next section the 500 m resolution is chosen as most physical parameters used to downscale the atmospheric variables are available at such resolution globally approaching finer resolutions would require downscaling these parameters as well adding the opportunity for more uncertainties and errors then both the original resolution nldas 2 and the downscaled variables are used to force the noah mp land surface model to produce high resolution soil moisture estimates three different simulations are proposed in this work in which noah mp is forced with different combinations of input data 1 nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation at their original resolution hereinafter simulation 1 2 nldas 2 downscaled atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure and original resolution nldas 2 precipitation hereinafter simulation 2 and 3 nldas 2 downscaled atmospheric variables and precipitation hereinafter simulation 3 2 1 the downscaled forcing dataset the downscaling framework proposed by rouf et al 2019 is based on a set of deterministic physical rules and was tested on the nldas 2 dataset across oklahoma during 2015 their methodology assumes that topography and vegetation cover have a large impact on surface atmospheric conditions and thus uses high resolution topography and vegetation information to spatially downscale 12 5 km nldas 2 2 m air temperature surface pressure 2 m humidity incident longwave shortwave radiation and 10 m wind speed to 500 m moreover this approach adopts i a dynamic lapse rate of air and dewpoint temperature to downscale air temperature pressure and humidity ii multiple factors including a clearness index local illumination cast shadowing sky obstruction and topographic configuration for downscaling shortwave radiation and iii a spatially downscaled surface roughness and zero plane displacement height for downscaling wind speed in rouf et al 2019 the 500 m downscaled products were compared to high quality high resolution ground observations collected by the oklahoma mesonet network for all the atmospheric variables an improvement was observed in terms of bias correlation coefficient root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency additionally the downscaled atmospheric products were able to overall capture more spatial variability than the original nldas 2 since the dataset adopted in this study is exactly the same as the one developed and validated by rouf et al 2019 over the same domain no additional evaluation is proposed here and the reader is referred to their study for supplementary information and more detail on the algorithms and their performance the 500 m precipitation dataset is obtained through the framework developed by mei et al 2020 the core of this method is rf classification and regression first a recursive feature elimination procedure is used to select relevant predictors which include variables representing atmospheric geographic and vegetation cover information i e air temperature dew point temperature air pressure specific humidity relative humidity incident longwave radiation incident shortwave radiation wind speed 30 day lagged vegetation index 60 day lagged vegetation index distance to the closest dry grid cell climate class latitude longitude and day of year the eight variables selected as relevant predicators are dew point temperature air pressure specific humidity incident longwave radiation incident shortwave radiation wind speed 60 day lagged vegetation index and day of year a binary precipitation mask is produced based on daily cumulative precipitation rate greater than 0 mm and an rf classification model is trained to the daily precipitation mask then the rf regression model is applied to provide the 500 m precipitation field using the downscaled predictors over rainy pixels only the obtained product is validated across the study area using observations collected at the mesonet rain gauges as discussed in section 2 3 the rf based framework provides downscaled precipitation at 500 m daily resolution this downscaled precipitation is further disaggregated to hourly for the land surface model following a method similar to lópez lópez et al 2018 specifically the fraction of precipitation per hour derived from the 12 5 km nldas 2 dataset is used to disaggregate daily downscaled precipitation at 500 m resolution to the hourly time scale following these steps i precipitation at 12 5 km resolution that occurs during the ith hour pi is divided by the daily total precipitation to obtain the fraction of precipitation f for hour i ii f i p i i 1 24 p i where 24 is the number of hours in a day note that fi is defined for pixel with non zero daily precipitation accumulation only iii the fractions of precipitation obtained for the 12 5 km grid fi are bilinearly interpolated to the 500 m grid obtaining fdi iv daily downscaled precipitation is multiplied by the corresponding fractions fdi to obtain hourly precipitation at each 500 m grid cell daily precipitation is disaggregating evenly for pixels whose fdi is not defined 2 2 the noah mp land surface model simulations the lsm adopted in this study is the community noah land surface model with multi parameterization options noah mp version 3 6 niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the noah mp is based on the original noah lsm with improved physical processes such as the separation of the vegetation canopy from the ground surface and the inclusion of a multi layer snow model noah mp has been shown to successfully simulate land atmosphere energy water and carbon exchanges and hydrologic states such as surface runoff soil moisture snow depth snow water equivalent and terrestrial water storage both over the united states e g cai et al 2014 chen et al 2014 ma et al 2017 and in other complex regions such as high mountain asia xue et al 2019 noah mp is run within the nasa land information system lis peters lidard et al 2007 a software for high performance land surface modeling and data assimilation that provides a common framework capable of ensemble land surface modeling on points regions or the globe in order to initialize the offline lsm a multi year spin up loop approach is adopted the model is first spun up for 20 years looping over a 10 year period from 2005 to 2014 reaching quasi equilibrium for both surface and subsurface temperature states and then run at a 15 min time step to produce hourly output for 2015 on a regular 1 km and 12 5 km spatial grid model parameters e g land cover land mask soil texture elevation slope aspect greenness data albedo snow albedo bottom temperature are used at 1 km for the high resolution runs and averaged to the 12 5 km grid for the coarser resolution simulations quasi equilibrium is reached when the difference in soil moisture values between the last two runs was less than 0 1 following the approach in rodell et al 2005 and cai et al 2016 within lis the nldas 2 forcing fields i e near surface air temperature and specific humidity downward longwave and shortwave radiation eastward and northward wind surface pressure and total precipitation with an hourly temporal resolution and 12 5 km and 1 km spatial resolution onto the same model time step the static input data for noah mp are obtained from the national center for atmospheric research application laboratory website https ral ucar edu solutions

et al 2018 the noah mp is developed based on the original noah land surface model with multiple options available for surface water infiltration runoff groundwater transfer and storage dynamic vegetation canopy resistance and frozen soil physics niu et al 2011 table 1 summarizes all noah mp options and parameters used in this study 2 3 validation dataset and performance metrics the oklahoma mesonet network used as reference for validating the model estimates both in terms of precipitation and soil moisture is a statewide network designed and implemented by the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university fig 1 it consists of 120 automated environmental monitoring stations that provide regular measurements of several atmospheric and hydrologic variables martens et al 2017 mesonet home page n d the measurements are taken every 5 min and transmitted to a central facility that performs quality control the total amount of rainfall is measured by tipping bucket rain gauge sensors approximately 0 01 in per tip or 0 254 mm the gauges are located 0 6 m above the ground have a 30 5 cm diameter opening and are surrounded by a 121 cm shield to minimize wind effects mesonet uses unheated gauges because of their cost and power efficiency which may cause underestimation in case of snow or freezing rain events soil moisture at each mesonet site is measured using thermocouples at four different depths 5 25 60 and 75 cm for each measurement temperature is measured before and after a short heat pulse 21 s each sensor measurement is calibrated with its own coefficient first then a linear regression is applied to normalize the response and reduce sensor specific variances using a set of empirical coefficients measured from different retention curves the volumetric water content is determined from the soil matric potential which is a measure of the capillary force needed to retain water in the soil calculated using the calibrated temperature values van genuchten 1980 arya and paris 1981 illston et al 2008 in this work we focus on anomaly time series of precipitation and soil moisture i e standard normal deviates computed by subtracting the 2015 yearly mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation this is because we are well aware of systematic differences between in situ observations and model estimates due to the point scale character of the first versus the distributed nature of the latter in the case of soil moisture there is also a mismatch in the available measurement depths and the vertical resolution of the land surface model specifically surface soil moisture in this manuscript refers to the mesonet soil moisture measured at 5 cm depth and the 0 10 cm soil moisture output from the noah mp model whereas root zone soil moisture is defined as the mesonet observation at 60 cm depth and the 40 100 cm the mid point of the layer is 70 cm output from noah mp standard normal deviates capture the phase correspondence between model estimates and in situ measurements regardless of potential mean biases or differences in dynamic range maggioni et al 2011 entekhabi et al 2010b to validate the downscaled precipitation dataset against the mesonet in situ observations we adopt both continuous metrics like correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse of time series of standard normal deviates additionally we investigate categorical metrics like hit rate probability of detection threat score probability of false detection and false alarm rate defined based on a contingency table table 2 specifically the hit rate hr measures the number of events that were correctly detected either both products detect rain hits or neither does correct no rain divided by the total number of events n the probability of detection pod assesses the chances that the model estimates in our case either nldas 2 or the downscaled product correctly detect rain hits when the in situ stations measure rain hits misses the threat score ts is equal to the total number of correctly detected events hits divided by the total number of estimated events plus the number of misses hits false alarms misses the probability of false detection pofd measures the number of false alarms per the total number of non events false alarms correct zeros whereas the false alarm rate far is computed as the number of false alarms per the total number of estimated events hits false alarms for soil moisture we analyze time series of station averaged standard normal deviates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by noah mp for the three experiments described above and the corresponding mesonet observations to study the temporal correspondence between model prediction and in situ measurements similar to precipitation soil moisture standard normal deviate time series are computed by subtracting the 2015 yearly mean and dividing by the corresponding standard deviation next the cumulative distribution function cdf of each dataset is computed to investigate whether the model performs particularly well or poorly for certain value ranges of surface root zone soil moisture we also analyze scatterplots of simulated soil moisture deviates versus their corresponding reference values to visually assess the proximity of these two datasets for each proposed simulation as a last step we summarize what observed through the time series cdfs and scatterplots in boxplots of correlation coefficients and rmses computed between the model estimates and the mesonet observations 3 results 3 1 precipitation in order to validate the downscaled precipitation product we investigate maps of precipitation standard normal deviates and compute correlation coefficients and root mean square errors between the original resolution nldas 2 and downscaled product deviates and corresponding mesonet deviates at each site across the study region fig 2 the annual average for precipitation mm day over oklahoma during 2015 is presented in fig 2 a at the original nldas 2 resolution and in fig 2 b at the downscaled 500 m resolution the overall statistics shown on the plots to summarize the product s performance prove that r does not change and rmse decreases thanks to downscaling in general r and rmse only slightly improve the precipitation anomalies after downscaling some locations show poor performance in the original nldas 2 dataset and the downscaling algorithm only marginally improves some of them e g the yellow dark blue dot located in the panhandle in panel 1c 1e turns into brownish light blue in panel 1d 1f demonstrating a slightly higher correlation and smaller root mean square error a larger improvement is noticed in rmse compared to r at several stations although the improvement in the statistical metrics is not substantial the level of detail that the 500 m map 1a presents compared to the native nldas 2 resolution one 1b is certainly noteworthy fig 2 also demonstrates that there is no systematic spatial bias introduced by the downscaling algorithm since the improvement in the rmse is evident at most mesonet stations whereas r values are consistently similar to the ones observed in the original dataset as shown by the contingency table in table 2 and the categorical statistics in table 3 the downscaled precipitation product is able to improve decrease the number of misses and therefore correctly detect more no rain events this results in a slightly larger hr and ts i e 1 higher and in an enhanced pod from 72 to 79 the downside is an increased false alarm rate from 18 to 23 and a slightly higher probability of false detection i e 1 higher although still below 10 false alarms are particularly critical in flood prediction but in agriculture management missed events are also essential for instance to avoid irrigating crops where and when there is no need 3 2 soil moisture fig 3 presents maps of 12 5 km output soil moisture obtained from the noah mp model forced with the native resolution nldas 2 atmospheric variables simulation 1 and output at 500 m resolution from simulations 2 and 3 forced with the downscaled nldas 2 data as a reminder in simulation 2 only select atmospheric variables i e near surface air temperature and humidity wind speed and direction incident longwave and shortwave radiation pressure are downscaled and the original resolution nldas 2 precipitation is used whereas in simulation 3 all nldas 2 atmospheric variables including precipitation are downscaled to 500 m the spatial distribution of soil wetness across the study region is maintained when moving the coarser 12 5 km to the finer grid nevertheless the level of detail added by the downscaling procedure is evident when comparing maps in the first row with the remainder in order to investigate the temporal variability of soil moisture fig 4 presents station average standard normal deviate daily time series of model predicted surface and root zone soil moisture for the three simulations and corresponding mesonet observations during the study period first off standard normal deviate time series are consistent between surface and root zone soil moisture second variations of the modeled soil moisture in all three simulations are consistent with the mesonet observations third simulation 3 which uses as input all the downscaled atmospheric variables including precipitation is able to bring the model closer to the in situ time series especially when the soil is either particularly wet winter or dry summer this is noticeable both in surface and root zone soil moisture time series cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal deviates of soil moisture estimates and observations are constructed based on all model pixels where both a mesonet measurement is available cdfs for each simulation and for the mesonet observations are shown in fig 5 first off simulations 1 and 2 are very closed to each other as also demonstrated by the time series in fig 4 with a slight difference for low values of standard normal deviates between 2 5 and 1 5 and being more pronounced in the root zone soil moisture distributions this stresses how the resolution in the input atmospheric variables only has a minor impact on modeled soil moisture anomalies the story is very different when actual values of soil moisture are considered rather than anomalies as simulation 2 is able to remove the bias between the original resolution noah mp i e simulation 1 and the reference dataset however since this comparison is not completely fair as discussed in the section 2 such analysis is not discussed here the cdf from simulation 3 is much closer to the ground observations both in terms of surface and root zone moisture and particularly for negative standard normal deviates i e when the soil is drier than the average value these results suggest that the higher resolution precipitation product improves the accuracy of the land surface model under dry condition which is linked to the better performance of the downscaled precipitation product with respect to the original resolution nldas 2 in terms of number of misses and correct detection of no rain events as shown in tables 2 and 3 what previously shown in the time series and cdfs is corroborated by the density scatterplots in fig 6 that present soil moisture predicted by noah mp in the 3 different simulations versus the corresponding mesonet observations simulation 3 largely improves surface soil moisture estimates moving them closer to the 1 1 line with respect to the native resolution simulation simulation 1 and the one with only the atmospheric variables downscaled to 500 m but not the precipitation input simulation 2 once again this is particularly evident at negative values of standard normal deviates which are pushed closer to the reference mesonet values in the case of root zone soil moisture the improvement is not as obvious as in surface soil moisture which is why rs and rmses are investigated next in order to quantify what discussed above we analyze the correlation coefficients and rmses between simulated and observed standard normal deviates of soil moisture for each station and corresponding model pixel boxplots in fig 7 present the median the 25th and 75th percentiles and the minimum and maximum of such values of r and rmse the median value of r slightly increases throughout the different simulations for both surface and root zone soil moisture even more interestingly the variability around the median i e difference between 75th and 25th percentile and difference between minimum and maximum value also shrinks thanks to the higher resolution input dataset once again simulation 3 improves the performance of both simulations 1 and 2 showing the importance of precipitation resolution in modeling soil moisture similarly the median rmse decreases when downscaled nldas 2 atmospheric variables and precipitation are used to force noah mp to simulate both surface and root zone soil moisture with respect to simulation 1 in which the native resolution nldas 2 dataset is used although the difference between the rmse in simulation 1 and 2 is minimal for surface soil moisture it is more substantial in predictions of root zone soil moisture showing some impact due to the change in resolution of most atmospheric variables excluding precipitation the variability around the median rmse is noticeably narrower for surface and root zone soil moisture in simulation 3 with respect to the corresponding simulations 1 4 conclusions one of the top priorities and fundamental input for hydrologic process models is surface weather at the land atmosphere boundary as hydrologic models move toward higher spatial and temporal resolution and larger spatial domains this work contributes an assessment of a land surface model forced with 500 m atmospheric variables that simulates surface and root zone soil moisture such resolutions provide more detailed information about the storage movement and quality of water at and near the land surface which is fundamental for water resources management crop yield prediction and hydroclimatic hazards monitoring the proposed downscaled precipitation product is shown to only marginally improve the original resolution nldas 2 dataset in terms of correlation coefficients and root mean square errors of standard normal deviates of precipitation with respect to the oklahoma mesonet observations in terms of categorical statistics the downscaled product is able to improve the number of missed events and correctly detect more no rain events but showed larger false alarm rates and a slightly higher probability of false detection nevertheless the level of detail that the 500 m precipitation field presents compared to the 12 5 km resolution is noteworthy which is also translated into maps of soil moisture simulated by noah mp simulation 3 which used as input all the downscaled atmospheric variables including precipitation is proven to be the most successful at pushing the model closer to the mesonet soil moisture observations for standard normal deviates of both surface and root zone soil moisture simulation 2 forced with downscaled atmospheric variables but original resolution nldas 2 precipitation only shows slight improvements with respect to simulation 1 forced with original resolution nldas 2 data which stresses the importance of precipitation resolution on modeled soil moisture anomalies this is more evident for negative values of standard normal deviates which correspond to drier than usual cases and may be related to the ability of the downscaled precipitation product to better detect missed events and improve the detection of no rain cases in summary to answer the research questions posed in the introductory section results show that 1 finer resolution forcing data have the potential to improve estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture simulated by noah mp in terms of higher correlations and lower rmses in soil moisture anomalies and 2 the resolution of input precipitation has a critical role in improving time series of both surface and root zone soil moisture standard normal deviates although land surface models can provide spatial and temporal soil moisture variability information they are well known to introduce biases which is the reason why biases were not discussed in this work nevertheless assimilation of satellite based soil moisture products e g smap smos can help to correct these first order large scale biases future work should focus on combining model estimates of surface soil moisture with satellite based observations e g from the nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission within a land data assimilation system this methodology can potentially be applied to improve the estimates of hyper resolution surface and root zone soil moisture globally spatial resolutions finer than 500 m could potentially be investigated achieving higher resolutions is complicated by i the risk of adding uncertainties and errors as several parameters used in the downscaling techniques would require interpolation or more sophisticated methods from coarser to finer scales ii higher resolutions are currently not available within the lis framework and iii computational expenses especially at the global scale and fine temporal sampling this work proved the viability of the proposed framework to improve our estimation of soil moisture in a region oklahoma characterized by gentle topography but where high quality high resolution continuous ground based data are available further expansion of this work should assess the performance of such method in different regions of the world some preliminary work conducted in high mountain asia showed some promise in this regard where the downscaling techniques were applied to the global modern era

4866,in recent times the groundwater in jianghan plain central china has come under severe stress from agricultural and industrial demand the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity k in the region is important for better and sustainable groundwater exploration and management in this study we determined the spatial distribution of k using a multi method approach i e analytic and numerical simulation as well as intelligent optimization methods particle swarm optimization pso and differential evolution de and geostatistics data from 55 multi format pumping tests situated across the middle confined aquifer consisting of late pleistocene qp3s and middle pleistocene qp2j were used results showed that for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells pso and de were faster and more precise especially de for transient pumping test with variable rate as well as transient pumping test with constant rate by single well the numerical method fitted the drawdown better while the pso and de had large deviations at the early stage of pumping overall the values of k vary from 0 032 to 10 64 m d within qp3s and 0 33 to 36 24 m d within qp2j the spatial variability model demonstrated that the k values in qp3s are greater than those in qp2j the heterogeneity elucidates the sedimentary development of the basin these methods and results can provide new insights for estimating the spatial distribution of k for regional groundwater resources assessment in similar sedimentary environments around the world keywords hydraulic conductivity intelligent optimization algorithm geostatistics sedimentation jianghan plain 1 introduction accurate estimation of aquifer parameters such as storage coefficient s s and hydraulic conductivity k by the inverse modeling approach is essential for groundwater management peralta 2012 particularly knowledge and characterization of the spatial variability of k is essential for numerical models to realistically quantify subsurface fluid flow and contaminant transport eramian et al 1999 pumping test has been the most common approach to directly obtain aquifer parameters in the field work based on a number of groundwater flow models hantush 1966 papadopulos and cooper 1967 wu 2002a li et al 2014 khadri and moharir 2016 wu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 anwar 2018 feng et al 2020 for instance theis 1935 firstly developed a transient model for groundwater flow to a pumping well assuming a constant rate of abstraction in a homogeneous horizontally isotropic laterally unbounded confined aquifer cooper and jacob 1946 proposed a mathematical model which considers the effective radius of an artesian well since such classical theories developed many analytical numerical and intelligent optimization methods have been applied graphical methods were outlined by hantush 1956 for determining the coefficients of transmissibility storage and leakage of an effectively infinite leaky artesian aquifer neuman 1972 proposed a new analytical model for the delayed response process characterizing flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer wen et al 2017 developed a semi analytical model considering an exponentially decreasing pumping rate started at a certain higher rate to obtain aquifer parameters zhuang et al 2019 used a synthetic pumping test in confined aquifer to demonstrate the usage of the newly type

al 2016 li et al 2017 for example mathias et al 2008 proposed numerical solutions using the finite difference scheme whereas ajayi and obilade 1989 presented a numerical scheme for calculating aquifer parameters directly from pumping test data obtained simultaneously from two observational wells in infinite homogeneous and isotropic aquifers khadri and moharir 2016 characterized aquifer parameters in basaltic hard rock region through pumping test methods including analytical and numerical method respectively shen et al 2015 employed both analytical and numerical methods to analyze the hydrogeological parameters in multi aquifers with vertical leakage in tianjin wu et al 2016 used numerical simulation to analyze the effects of pumping in the pit tamayo mas et al 2018 applied different approaches ranging from a traditional analytical solution to more sophisticated numerical models with automatically calibrated input parameters to characterize the hydrogeological properties choopani et al 2019 determined aquifer hydrogeological parameters in sirjan basin using groundwater modelling bumgarner and mccray 2007 liu et al 2009 shen et al 2017 and benson 2020 also used numerical solutions to estimate aquifer parameters in field sites recently heuristic optimizers such as particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de genetic algorithm ga and cat swarm optimization cso have also been commonly used to estimate aquifer parameters by researchers eberhart and shi 2001 abbaspour et al 2001 huggi and rastogi 2003 thomas et al 2018 matott et al 2006 compared various optimization techniques for groundwater remediation studies and showed that pso performs better than ga conjugate gradient and random search algorithm thomas et al 2019 comparatively assessed ga de cso and pso in estimating aquifer parameters of a confined aquifer and found that de cso and pso models are more accurate in estimating aquifer parameters than ga for none noisy observed data spatial distributions of aquifer properties such as k often exhibit high heterogeneity the spatial variability of k has been identified as an important hydraulic property that controls groundwater flow and contaminant transport which are key factors for pollution control and remediation de marsily et al 2005 furthermore variation in k strongly defines average groundwater velocity which characterizes solute plume dispersion in porous media gelhar 1986 dagan 1986 gelhar et al 1992 eramian et al 1999 nevertheless owing to time cost and other technical constraints in field investigation pumping test is often limited in number and spatial distribution and therefore avails little in situ data that can be analyzed it should be pointed out that with sparsely measured geo data comes considerable degree of uncertainty application of geostatistical methods for modeling of geologic heterogeneity has become common practice due to the complexity of the subsurface and the relative scarcity of data on media properties matheron 1963 1971 developed the kriging and co kriging techniques which have been applied recently in different disciplines oliver and webster 2007 stated that kriging is a method of interpolation for geographical information systems idrysy and smedt 2007 elucidated the kriging and co kriging methods for estimating k johnson et al 2018 used kriging and gis to locate high concentrations of iron and manganese in buncombe county north carolina other applications of geostatistical methods in hydrology have been reported in several studies like clifton and neuman 1982 laslett 1994 voltz and webster 2006 schilling et al 2017 chabani et al 2017 and berton 2018 our study area the jianghan plain is a drainage basin densely covered with lakes and rivers major rivers including yangtze river han river tongshun river and dongjing river and rich in groundwater resources it is situated in the middle reaches of the yangtze river central china which is an important base of aquaculture and agricultural activities surface water quality and quantity has been a major source of concern due to industrial and agricultural activities consequently groundwater demand is high exerting pressure on the aquifers anthropogenic activities and excessive abstraction have led to contamination and depletion of the groundwater causing damage to the environment antibiotics and other pollutants i e nitrogen and phosphorus are increasingly being detected in water sources due to large scale agricultural cultivation zhou et al 2011 tong et al 2014 2017 yao et al 2017 the health of 19 6 million people in china and more than 73 000 people particularly in the jianghan plain has been affected by long term intake of primary pollutants such as arsenic heavy metal and nitrate gan et al 2014 duan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 major water conservancy project south to north water transfer project and water diversion works from yangtze river to han river have intensified surface water groundwater interaction causing water quality deterioration and other environmental and geological problems this has also led to a decline in the self purification ability of the wetland due to land degradation and subsidence wang et al 2008 2018 as such to facilitate sustainable development and efficient management of groundwater resources in the jianghan plain it is critical to not only accurately estimate the values k from pumping test but also to determine its spatial variability in the region aquifer units and their properties e g regional k are important parameters to a large extent determines the groundwater flow and the groundwater head distribution and benefits for contaminant transport process as well it is notable that a few hydrogeological studies have been conducted in the area but upon careful review these works are deemed to be limited in scope particularly studies along the han and yangtze rivers were based on sparsely measured data zhang et al 2017 li et al 2017 chen et al 2017 additionally specific pumping test types in the field are frequently limited by several issues e g number of observation wells variable pumping rates or simultaneous pumping singh 2008 karami and younger 2012 shen et al 2015 wen et al 2017 besides different methods have peculiar constraints in their governing equations as well as conditions for localized application and should be selected only under the most appropriate conditions generally few hydrogeological studies have systematically subjected their parameter estimations to large number and variety of pumping tests due to the issues mentioned earlier furthermore the spatial variability of k in the jianghan plain has not yet been assessed although investigations into the development of the sedimentary environment in the jianghan plain have been conducted zeng 1991 yi et al 2002 kang et al 2009 wu et al 2019 the relationship between the spatial variability of k and sedimentary environment has not been elucidated to accurately obtain the spatial distribution of k on a regional scale as well infer its relationship to the sedimentary evolution of the basin a large scale multi format pumping tests and multi method approach is used firstly inversion methods i e analytic method numerical simulation and intelligent optimization methods pso and de were used to directly estimate the aquifer parameter based on a variety of pumping test data obtained from 55 boreholes secondly the spatial variability of k and its relationship with the sedimentary environment is analyzed our findings can be relevant to studies in similar hydrogeological and data scarce settings around the world the aquifer parameter hydraulic conductivity k obtained in this study can provide better knowledge of the groundwater hydraulics which is essential for enhanced evaluation of the groundwater resources as well as contaminant transport for pollution remediation in the study area also the analysis and performance of the different methods employed can provide some guidance for evaluating regional aquifer development and characteristics in similar sedimentary basins 2 location and geology of the study area 2 1 location and geographic setting the jianghan plain is a semi enclosed basin situated within the central yangtze river basin in hubei province of central china it is bounded by hills and mountains elevation values ranged between 100 and 2 000 m above sea level in the west north and east as well as adjoining the dongting lake in the south fig 1 b and c the spatial coverage of the area is about 46 000 km2 the han river a major tributary of the yangtze river and yangtze river flow across the basin and converge in the jianghan plain supplying alluvial lacustrine sediments gan et al 2018 the geomorphology can be classified into three categories hill hilly land and lowland plain the elevations gradually decline from northwest to southeast the low plain areas have a very low slope of 1 20 000 1 30 000 from west to east zhou et al 2013 the main area of focus in this study covers three hydrological systems comprising the han river tongshun river and dongjing river which are subdivided into three segments reaches covering an area of approximately 9 892 km2 segments of the han river include the western central and eastern the elevations range from 23 56 to 47 99 m above sea level fig 1d areas along the main river channels are typically 3 6 m higher than around the tributaries due to artificial or natural levees 2 2 geological and hydrogeological conditions geologically neotectonic movement controlled the geological structure and sedimentary characteristics of the basin wu et al 2017 alluvial lacustrine quaternary sediments overlie the top of the bedrock with the thickness gradually diminishing from the central area 150 280 m to the periphery 25 100 m fig 1c the quaternary stratigraphy is generally a sandy layer interbedded with clay layers in the western and central areas which gradually transformed into silty clay layers near the yangtze river overlain by a clayey layer dominant by loamy soil clay mucky clay and silty clay gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 silty clay and clay constitute a relatively waterproof layer where the thickness varies greatly ranging from 0 5 to 20 m lens fig 1d and fig 2 the quaternary aquifer system in the study area can be divided vertically into three aquifer groups zhang et al 2017 fig 1d and fig 2 the first is the phreatic aquifer 0 20 m depth with holocene qhg composed of loamy soil mucky clay silty clay clay silty sand silt and fine sand in this aquifer the depth to groundwater level generally ranges from 1 28 to 7 67 m 1 28 5 04 m during wet season and 2 73 7 67 m during dry reason the second system is the middle confined aquifer 20 80 m depth with late pleistocene qp3s and middle pleistocene qp2j and composed mainly of fine sand medium sand coarse sand sandy gravel and sandy cobble where part of the cross sections containing clay and silty clay lens as local aquitards with a thickness of 1 18 m the piezometric levels in this formation range from 20 to 35 m above sea level it is also the main aquifer that supplies agricultural industrial and domestic needs the third system is the deep confined aquifer greater than80 m depth with early pleistocene qp1d fine sand medium sand coarse sand sandy gravel and clay there is a continuous clay aquitard with a thickness of about 10 m which separates the deep confined aquifer from the middle confined aquifer the general trend of the quaternary aquifer is thick around the central area 90 100 m with thin margins 10 15 m thick in the east 20 30 m and thin in the west 10 20 m the stable water retaining floor between the quaternary aquifer and the underlying fissure pore confined water bearing rock formation is deeply buried in the central area and gradually rises to the margins fig 1c d and fig 2 controlled by the regional topography the flow directions of confined groundwater phreatic groundwater and surface water have similar directions all from north west to south east and discharge to the yangtze river fig 1b and d 3 materials and methods 3 1 dataset the middle confined aquifer resources are abstracted for large scale water diversion project irrigation households and industries the intense water stress encouraged water managers to conduct several pumping tests to obtain hydrogeological parameters over a period of four years 2014 2018 a database was created from several hundred laboratory lithology tests based on 24 sampling boreholes and pumping tests on 55 wells mainly distributed along the han and yangtze rivers comprising 24 pumping tests and 31 collecting wells obtained from hubei institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology these data are described and presented in table 1 and fig 1b along the western reach of the han river there are 13 boreholes while 19 others are located along its central and eastern reaches meanwhile along the tongshun river and dongjing river systems there are 9 and 12 boreholes respectively similarly 2 boreholes are situated near the yangtze river the type of pumping test employed falls into three categories transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells transient pumping test with variable rate by single well and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well 3 2 parameter estimation 3 2 1 numerical method the finite element model feflow feflow 6 2 was used in this study with the numerical simulation range taking corresponding pumping wells as the simulation center and extending 500 m in length and width which was found to eliminate the influence of pumping wells on the model boundary a mesh refinement criterion was presented near the pumping well where the groundwater level drops rapidly the pumping test lasted no more than 16 8 h and the drawdown generally hardly changed significantly after about 2 h therefore factors such as precipitation infiltration and evaporation were not considered also parameters such as ss and k were adjusted mainly based on the differences between the observed and calculated values the optimal parameters and best fitting values were obtained through repeated debugging divisions of aquifer structures triangular mesh subdivisions 3d geological models and other details of all the pumping tests are presented in tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information additionally drawdown of fitting curves for each pumping test corresponding to specific set of curves are all presented in the supporting information 3 2 2 pso the pso is a population based self adaptive and stochastic optimization technique jain et al 2018 it was first inspired by the movements of bird flocks or fish shoals seeking food eberhart and kennedy 1995 similar to the foraging process of birds each bird transmits the information captured by itself to the whole flock the entire flock constantly adjusts its direction during the flight until it finally finds the right food the optimal solution corresponds to the right food of the flock the pso starts by creating the initial particles and allotting them initial velocities where the objective function is evaluated for each particle location to determine the best function value and best location the pso is described mathematically as follows suppose n massless and volumeless particles in a physical dimensional search space d where the initial position x i and velocity v i of each particle are randomly generated as 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x id i 1 2 n 2 v i v i 1 v i 2 v id i 1 2 n where x i and v i are the initial position and the initial vector of the ith swarm particle respectively all particles are computed for fitness function values fit i the best position of individual particle p best and the global community g best are represented as 3 p best p i 1 p i 2 p id 4 g best p g 1 p g 2 p gd for individual particle comparing the fitness function values fit i and the best position of individual particle p best if the former is less than the latter then the former replaces the latter as the new p best as for fitness function values fit i and the best position of the global community g best the principle is the same each particle then updates its position and velocity during the subsequent iteration robinson and rahmat 2004 from the following 5 v i j t 1 w v i j t c 1 r 1 p i j x i j t c 2 r 2 p g j x i j t 6 x i j t 1 x i j t v i j t 1 j 1 2 d where v i j v max v max and x i j x max x max velocity v i j and position x i j should be within allowable limits and not out of the bounds t is the iteration number w is the inertia weight and set differently for different pumping tests i e for transient test with constant rate by multi wells w 0 5 for transient test with variable rate and steady state test with constant rate by single well w max 0 9 and w min 0 4 respectively c 1 and c 2 are learning factors c 1 c 2 2 in the former type and c 1 c 2 1 8 in the last two types r 1 and r 2 are random numbers 0 1 consequently when the termination criterion is satisfied the optimal results are presented otherwise the next iteration will compute the fitness function values fit i again 3 2 3 de de is generated by cooperation and competition among individuals within a group storn and price 1995 it is likened to the process of human evolving from apes to modern humans through initialization of apes gene mutation crossover with other races continuous selection of adaptive environment storn and price 1997 the final survival of the human corresponds to the optimal solution of a specific problem the de is described mathematically as follows initialization randomly initialize the position of np populations in d dimensional space within specified upper and lower bound 7 x ji 0 r a n d 0 1 x j u x j l x j l i 1 2 n p j 1 2 d where xi u and xi l are the upper and lower bound of the variable xi i 1 2 np represents population size g represents generations rand 0 1 means random number generated between 0 and 1 mutation for each target vector xi g mutant vector is generated by 8 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g where r 1 r 2 r 3 1 2 3 np f is mutation factor 0 2 and set as 0 85 for transient test with constant rate by multi wells and 0 4 for transient test with variable rate and steady state test with constant rate by single well crossover trial vector generated u ji g 1 from the mutant vector v ji g 1 and target vector x ji g 1 9 u ji g 1 v ji g 1 i f r a n d b j c r o r j r n b i x ji g 1 i f r a n d b j c r o r j r n b i i 1 2 n p j 1 2 d where randb j is a random number 0 1 rnb i is a random series 1 2 d cr is crossover factor 0 1 and set as 0 2 and 0 1 for transient test with constant rate by multi wells and the latter two types respectively selection compare trial vector u j i g 1 and target vector x ji g 1 select the vector in the next generation which can obtain the lowest fitness function value continue the last three basic elements until the termination criterion is satisfied for the optimization algorithms mentioned above the termination criterion can be based either on the user defined number of generations or the precision of the calculation the latter was chosen in this study which can be expressed as 10 δ 1 n i 1 n s i s s i 2 where s i are the ith actual drawdowns and ss i are the calculated drawdowns thereafter n np g c 1 c 2 p min p max v min v max x min x max were continuously adjusted until the termination criterion was satisfied and the curve of the actual and calculated drawdown fitted well simultaneously thereby producing the optimal results it should be noted that the parameters setting fitness function curves and drawdown of fitting curves for the two optimization methods of each pumping test are given detail in the supporting information 3 3 geostatistical analysis heterogeneity is inherent in geological media furthermore it is unrealistic to collect large amounts of observational data on a regional scale due to cost and other technical constrains consequently geostatistical techniques based on spatial interpolation methods have to be adopted despite the associated uncertainty geostatistics has attracted the attention of several researchers kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 hoeksema and kitanidis 1984 illman et al 2009 2010 borkowski and kwiatkowska malina 2017 benjamin et al 2019 providing a pragmatic means to achieve reasonable results that can be utilized for earth resources evaluation to accurately determine spatial variability of k in the jianghan plain geostatistical techniques kriging are implemented based on the following protocol 1 data analysis 2 fitting applicable theoretical variograms with experimental variograms 3 structural analysis 4 cross validation and estimation of spatial variability of k finally a residuals map can be obtained which can be used to verify the estimation errors an experimental variogram quantifies the spatial variability of k by assessing effects of spatial shifts such as from k xi to k xi h remy et al 2009 11 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h k x i k x i h 2 where γ h is the experimental variogram n h is the pair number h is the lag distance between two sample points xi is a given spatial location the alternative theoretical variogram models such as the spherical sp exponential ex or gaussian model gs containing three deterministic parameters i e nugget effect c 0 sill cs and correlation length λ h were applied and compared to obtain an applicable theoretical variogram model herein in our study area the k values in the quaternary strata tables 2 and 3 show that the ranges between the maximum and minimum are 1 333 times maximum 333 times in qp3s and 110 times in qp2j for such heavily skewed distributions the estimation of the variogram can be distorted by outliers leading to less accuate estimates with linear kriging technique freeze 1975 noted that most k values have log normal distribution characteristics from many field investigations based on statistical analysis delhomme 1978 also found that the ln k distributions are less skewed than the k and have a better spatial variation structure than the original values later scholars mostly used ln k for k estimations delhomme 1979 woodbury and sudicky 1991 eggleston and rojstaczer 1998 therefore log normal transformed values ln k are used in this study because they provide more robust variograms and also show better correlations than the original values the experimental variogram is then fitted by the best theoretical model and used to analyze the spatial structures relative to an angle as well as a distance of tolerance in cross validation the estimation procedure at the locations of existing field data is tested this involves removing sample of a given point and estimating it based on values around its neighborhood this process is then repeated for all the samples until the validation criteria is met which is based on the residuals between the observed values and their estimates the main steps in spatial structure analysis are as follows 1 calculate experimental variograms in different directions 2 fit experimental variograms with theoretical model to obtain correlation length λ h in all directions 3 draw the anisotropic rose diagram based on the results from the previous steps the procedure described above including exploratory data analysis and variable transformation as well as variography cross validation and estimation were implemented using a group of software arcgis arcgis 10 5 surfer surfer 12 gslib matlab matlab 2018b spss spss 22 0 tecplot tecplot 10 0 2 4 results 4 1 verification of models when running intelligent optimization models the termination criterion is commonly set to the scale of 10 6 similarly the s s was preset to the scale of 10 5 for convenience due to large lithology data from 24 boreholes the generated data p min p max v min v max as well as other parameters require debugging repeatedly until precision is satisfied the analytical approaches including special type curve matching and straight line methods were used in every borehole the numerical simulation and intelligent optimization methods were also applied in each pumping test tables 2 and 4 present a statistical summary of k and ss from 24 pumping tests using analytic numerical simulation and intelligent optimization inversion methods pso and de respectively table 3 shows the k values from the collecting boreholes evaluation criteria such as mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 were used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the accuracy of different inversion methods with the results presented in table 5 it is important to highlight that the values of l1 and l2 should be as small as possible it is notable that the analytical approaches were implemented using the aquifer test aquifer test 2011 1 software as shown in tables 2 and 4 results obtained by the analytical approaches differ significantly with that of the numerical solution and intelligent optimization methods respectively additionally differences in optimal parameters setting for pso and de stem from the types of pumping test and the definitions used in each intelligent optimization model as shown in the tables s1 and s2 of the supporting information for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells optimal generations are 8 in pso and 10 in de suitable p min and p max are 0 50 in pso and 0 40 in de and appropriate v max and v min are 1 0 in pso no improvements in the results were observed when the parameters exceeded the optimal values the evaluation criteria in table 5 and specific fitting curves in the supporting information show that the pso and de are more precise than the numerical method with de being the overall best also pso and de are more concise and faster in practice if vulnerability to being trapped by local minima is ignored overall pso and de are preferred for this type of pumping test in the field for transient pumping test with variable rate by single well optimal generations are 50 in pso and 26 in de suitable p min and p max are 0 30 in pso and 0 10 in de and appropriate v min and v max are 10 10 in pso also for transient pumping tests with constant rate by single well optimal generations are between 15 and 26 in pso and de suitable p min and p max are 0 30 in pso and 0 10 in de and appropriate v min and v max are 10 10 in pso for the two latter types of pumping test the evaluation criteria in table 5 show that l1 and l2 of the numerical method are significantly different from that of pso and de large number of specific fitting curves in the supporting information also illustrate that the numerical method fits better with the actual drawdown data while pso and de are both observed to have a large deviation at the early stage of pumping in this case the numerical method is preferred over pso and de 4 2 variogram comparison the main characteristics of regionalized variables can be discerned by constructing a comprehensive variogram model and quantitatively summarizing all effective structural information jiang and liu 2004 a theoretical variogram model that fits with the experimental variogram can well describe the shape of variables and can also be regarded as a significant factor for determining the spatial correlations in aquifer material thereby establishing the origin of its formation or sedimentation based on the relationship between the experimental variogram and theoretical model it is helpful to develop a more accurate ordinary kriging model in the process of establishing theoretical variogram models parameter optimization is necessary as it can better reflect the variation of regional variables and support the kriging interpolation as well as any random simulation technique based on kriging the key steps are to select a model that fits well with the experimental variogram from a series of feasible alternative models and finally select a representative theoretical model based on specific indicators on the basis of cross validation for this paper the corresponding coefficients of determination r 2 residual sum of squares rss and fitted variogram parameters are tabulated in table 6 for the three variogram models used typically r 2 value should be close to 1 while rss should be as small as possible the r 2 and rss are slightly different whereas c 0 c 0 c s especially λ h differ significantly stemming from the definitions used in each model between the three alternative variogram models fitted the spherical variogram model gives the greatest λ h over the other two additionally the goodness of fit for the spherical model r 2 ranges from 0 8682 to 0 9125 while rss from 0 0061 to 0 0162 in qp3s and qp2j respectively the other models gave poorer values as such the spherical model was adopted 4 3 spatial structure analysis analyzing the spatial structure of the study area is critical to gaining better understanding of the variability of hydraulic parameter particularly on such a large scale to reflect the anisotropy of k better the experimental variograms fitted by theoretical variogram models in different directions were calculated including all inflection point changes n0e n20e n40e n60e n80e s80e s60e s40e s20e s0e s20w s40w s60w s80w n80w n60w n40w n20w with 22 5 and one tenth of the lag distance that is 0 4 km as the tolerance angle and distance the experimental variograms and improved spherical compared to the exponential and gaussian variogram models of all calculated directions in qp3s and qp2j are computed representively showing two directions for each formation in fig 3 and fig 4 the anisotropic rose diagram is plotted from the values of λ h in all directions that were calculated the anisotropic rose diagram exhibits elliptical shapes with the long axis indicating the maximum continuous direction while the short axis indicate the minimum continuous direction as the regionalized variability is anisotropic as seen in fig 5 for qp3s semi major axis is 60 000 m and semi minor axis is 14 000 m with a direction angle of 20 anisotropy ratio 4 357 presenting geometric anisotropy n20e perpendicular to the han river λ h is short indicating that the river s alluvial effect was strong farther away from this direction the k values change from large to small s70e along the han river channel λ h is long and k floats in a small range for qp2j the semi major axis is 30 000 m while the semi minor axis is 13 000 m with a direction angle of 20 anisotropy ratio 2 308 also presenting geometric anisotropy n20e perpendicular to the flooding direction of the northern water systems flow from west to east λ h is small with greater change in k values trending away from this direction along the flooding direction of the northern water systems substantially along the northern water systems to the central area of the basin s70e λ h is long having smaller changes in k values meanwhile the spatial distrubtion analysis shows that the degree of variation from east to west is smaller compared to the larger variation along the north south direction additionally the spatial variability in all directions of qp2j is not as strong as that of qp3s which may be closely related to the sedimentary evolution over various periods 4 4 spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity the natural logarithmof the measured k ln k which precisely fitted values from the pumping tests and available values from collecting boreholes was determined it is important to note that before kriging operation is performed it is necessary to validate the selected theoretical spherical model and test whether the probability density function of the reduced residuals meets the standard normal distribution ideally the kriging average error kae should be close to 0 while the kriging reduced mean square error krmse should be close to 1 if the latter is greater than 1 then c 0 needs to be raised for correction conversely c 0 should be lowered to ascertain whether the statistical distribution is close to the standard normal data such as the orientation and length of the long and short axis obtained form the main input for the cross validation the final results show that the kae and krmse are 0 023 and 1 011 respectively both are within the allowable error range chiles and delfiner 1999 additionally the cross validation can also test the validity and accuracy of the spatial interpolations quantitatively the cross validation procedure tests the robustness of a model by evaluating the validation criteria based on the statistical properties of mean m mean standardized ms root mean square rms root mean square standardized rmss and average standard error ase obviously the m and ms should be as close to 0 as possible and the former indicates that the prediction is unbiased the rms and ase should be as small as possible closer to 0 as they highlight the deviation between the predicted and measured values additionally the rmss should be close to 1 denotes accurate prediction the grid configuration in each strata imposed had 400 rows 600 columns after back transformation with the cell size of 1 m 1 m this grid resolution was chosen in order to ensure that the cells are smaller than λ h in all corresponding directions as suggested by modis and sideri 2013 and troldborg 2004 the verified results of fitted variograms sp ex and gs are given in table 7 it should be noted that the exponential and gaussian models are not consistent with the trend of the standard error making the interpolation error large consequently the best fit was the spherical model as it provided the smallest standard error values therefore the most representative spatial distributions of k in quaternary heterogeneous confined aquifer where four groundwater flow systems had compounded environmental geological problems yet to be assessed were selected and plotted as shown in fig 6 a and fig 7 a to quantitatively evaluate the accuracies the statistical properties of the differences residuals or errors e between the observed values and their estimates are presented in fig 6b and fig 7b the map of the k values reflect the existing conditions encountered in the field in qp3s highest k values are found in the transition from hilly land to the lowland plain from jiukou town to zhanggang town and the area along the yangtze river the low k values in maiwang town xiantao town yanglinwei town and xingou town are closely followed by the high k values from the center of the study area presenting a striped distribution meanwhile the lowest k values are found in the northwest of the study area from the boundary of study area to jiukou town and yanglinwei town in qp2j the corresponding highest values of k are found in the central area east of qianjiang town south of xiantao town and xingou town and other parts close to the yangtze river low k values increase gradually extending in the form of wide strips from the central areas to the margins accordingly the lowest k values continue unto the periphery of the study area generally near the han river and yangtze river the k values in qp3s are greater compared to qp2j whereas they have the same variability in that the k values farther away from large rivers are lower than near the rivers especially the yangtze river additionally the k values increase from north to south both in qp3s and qp2j near the yangtze river the estimation errors for estimated k values fig 6b and fig 7b are rather high in some areas in addition to the influence of the smoothing effect of kriging anthropogenic activities were not excluded e g in the yanglinwei town where most of the pumping wells are situated there are large residual values nevertheless the main cause of the large residual in this area is due to limited number of pumping tests especially in the locations farther away from the centre of the plain closer to the yangtze river 5 discussion different methods were used to guarantee the precision of the estimated aquifer parameter from the specific fitting curves in the supporting information for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells pso and de were found to be more concise and precise they should be considered in field application especially if time is a constraint in that case their vulnerability to being trapped by local minima must be ignored repeated simulation results in the supporting information confirm that the numerical method strictly requires field hydrogeological data thereby yielding more realistic results however it is susceptible to constant debugging which can take up a lot of time as for the transient pumping test with variable rate and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well the numerical method is preferred over pso and de as they have a tendency to produce a large deviation at the early stage of pumping nevertheless when considering multiple factors the optimization algorithm i e pso and de methods provide a better alternative to estimate large set of aquifer parameters the spatial variability of k is largely dependent on the composition of sediment characteristics and its spatial distribution hydrodynamic conditions as well as sedimentary environment sun et al 2015 bridge and lunt 2006 falivene et al 2007 the distribution of sediments is not the only basis for sediment type classification but can also reflect the sedimentary environment and provenance information these three main factors represent the most important differences among clusters which could be useful to infere the main processes controlling spatial variability understanding their regularities and correlations have practical significance in predicting k values at locations where no tests have been conducted yang et al 2016 restored the sedimentary environment of different quaternary period as in early qp3s most lakes at the end of qp2j evolved into swamps due to a colder climate and low precipitation whereas the yangtze river and han river still maintained considerable water volume varying hydrodynamic conditions have resulted in the accumulation of fine sand and silt in the western verge of the study area from the boundary of study area to jiukou town similarly sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand and fine sand are deposited in the west from jiukou town to zhanggang town in the central areas fine sand is well deposited with medium sand and fine sand distributed in the eastern parts of the area along the yangtze river conseuently the k also decreased gradually along the han river and increased when it closer to the yangtze river in middle qp3s the surface water apparently became more active due to warmer and semi humid climate as well as an increase in precipitation also sustained melting of snow and ice increased surface water activity thereby driving a large scale accumulation as alluvial and alluvial diluvial gravel bed developed in the basin periphery and alluvial floodplain and shallow lacustrine facies deposited in the centre the sediments caused by hydrodynamic conditions were mainly fine sand silt and clay as such k decreased from the central area to the margins in late qp3s the river was more stable and river phase deposited by alluvial rivers were formed the cumulative deposition of the three different stages are responsible for hodiernal qp3s strata as shown in fig 2 fig 6a and table 8 in the western reach of the han river the layers of sediment and aquifer increase in thickness along the river and the k value also rises gradually the main lithology from fine sand silt and mucky clay to sandy cobble sandy gravel fine sand and clay and gradually transition to medium sand fine sand and clay for the other hydrological systems the thicknesses exhibits a decreasing trend vertically moving farther away from the rivers and following the rivers flow direction also the sediment size and k values exhibit similar decreasing variability characterizing the landscape changes from hill and hilly land to lowland plain as the terrain flattens the carrying capacity of rivers begin to reduce causing detrital materials to be gradually deposited from mainly sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand fine sand clay in the west of han river meanwhile medium sand fine sand and clay are deposited in the midwest and near the yangtze river fine sand and silt are deposited respectively in the central area extending eastward with an addition of clay and silty clay in the east fig 2 and table 8 hence the distribution of k gradually decreases from west to east along flow direction of the han river and it decreaces from the han river to the north or the south along the perpendicular direction of the han river as shown in fig 6a the mutual consistency of the borehole data the spatial variability of k distribution and the prior studies about the sedimentary environment e g yang and cai 1997 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 is a good proof of the findings here as an appropriate representation of the hodiernal sedimentary characteristics nevertheless there are some areas like the south eastern parts of dongjing river where the average sediment size increases from north to south while k values also increase gradually in the same trend this phenomenon is associated with the alluvial deposits of the yangtze river from early qp2j except for the relative settlement in the central area other parts began to rise due to the general tectonic uplift in eastern china this factor in additon to fluvial and aeolian processes are the main reason for the absence of the whole qp2j in the west of the study area from the boundary of study area to shayang town furthermore in early qp2j the extensive deep water lake became shallow lakes and swamps thereby driving accumulation of sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand fine sand and clay as well as other alluvial and lacustrine deposits the compositions of sediments and sedimentary environments are similar to those presented by yi et al 2002 liu and wu 2011 determined the palaeolimnology that an increase in temperature in middle qp2j led to an increase in precipitation and river levels this created a sloping fan shaped plain in front of the piedmont and a floodplain in the center where river and river lake sediments alternately accumulated to form complex lithofacies due to the frequent change in surface water levels this continued into late qp2j when the alluvial fan facies of alluvial diluvial origin was formed in the peripheral area the central area formed from the flood facies and lacustrine facies of alluvial and lacustrine origin hence the thicknesses of hodiernal qp2j strata and aquifer trends decreases from there unto the margin this phemonon is also observed trending from south to north along the yangtze river furthermore the lithology around the central area is mainly composed of thick sandy cobble sandy gravel and fine sand interbedded with medium to fine sand and clay east to jianli town and west to maiwang town the sediment sizes were not found to differ greatly and the k values are the largest in the entire study area from the central area to the northern parts of the study area zhanggang town maiwang town and near the tianmen town the sediment size gradually becomes thinner composed mainly of fine sand with the k values being fairly large but not as in the central areas in the east west of the maiwang town but not near the yangtze river the sediment size is generally small while the k values gradually reduce as fine sand is the only lithology constituting the aquifer closer to the yangtze river stronger sediments are affected by fluvial fluctuation significantly thereby reducing the sediment size predominantly from medium sand to fine sand as the k values also reveal a decreasing trend from the yangtze river to the center although some areas are greatly affected by anthropogenic factors which could affect result the field fig 6 a b and fig 7 a b it is however undeniable that the spatial variability of k is inseparable from the factors mentioned above fig 2 table 8 and fig 7a kang et al 2009 xu et al 2016 overall these studies are consistent with our findings and therefore add credibility to the methods that were employed 6 conclusions in this study the hydraulic conductivity k of jianghan plain was estimated and its spatial variability analyzed and discussed a multi method appraoch comprising analytical numerical pso and de was used to guarantee the precision of the estimated k values where the results can be validated and complemented by each respective method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 data from 55 wells comprising three types of pumping tests 24 and collecting wells 31 were collected and analyzed in light of the large number of specific fitting curves and evaluation criteria pso and de especially de are preferred for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells however their vulnerability to being trapped in local minima must be ignore also the numerical method is best suited for transient pumping test with variable rate and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well these outcomes can provide some guidance for selecting best parameter estimation method for similar aquifers in the field work 2 the values of k vary from 0 032 to 10 64 m d within qp3s and 0 33 to 36 24 m d within qp2j the anisotropic rose diagram highlighted geometric anisotropy in both qp3s and qp2j with an anisotropy ratio of 4 357 and 2 308 respectively however the k values in qp2j have less spatial variability as the correlation length λ h in all calculated directions did not change as strongly as in qp3s 3 the spatial variability of k is largely dependent on the sedimentary environment comprising sediment characteristics and their spatial distribution the k values in qp3s decrease along the direction of the major rivers han and yangtze highlighting fluvial activity except for some terrain factors around the boundary of study area close jiukou town similarly the k values in qp2j exhibit a decreasing trend represented by wide alluvial strips from the central area unto the margin also the k values close to the major rivers in qp3s are greater compared to qp2j whereas they both have the same variability overall this research can provide some new insights into large scale estimation k and its spatial variability in relation to the local sedimentary development the results can also support a more sustainable evaluation and management of groundwater resources in the jianghan plain as well as in similar sedimentary environments around the world

4866,in recent times the groundwater in jianghan plain central china has come under severe stress from agricultural and industrial demand the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity k in the region is important for better and sustainable groundwater exploration and management in this study we determined the spatial distribution of k using a multi method approach i e analytic and numerical simulation as well as intelligent optimization methods particle swarm optimization pso and differential evolution de and geostatistics data from 55 multi format pumping tests situated across the middle confined aquifer consisting of late pleistocene qp3s and middle pleistocene qp2j were used results showed that for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells pso and de were faster and more precise especially de for transient pumping test with variable rate as well as transient pumping test with constant rate by single well the numerical method fitted the drawdown better while the pso and de had large deviations at the early stage of pumping overall the values of k vary from 0 032 to 10 64 m d within qp3s and 0 33 to 36 24 m d within qp2j the spatial variability model demonstrated that the k values in qp3s are greater than those in qp2j the heterogeneity elucidates the sedimentary development of the basin these methods and results can provide new insights for estimating the spatial distribution of k for regional groundwater resources assessment in similar sedimentary environments around the world keywords hydraulic conductivity intelligent optimization algorithm geostatistics sedimentation jianghan plain 1 introduction accurate estimation of aquifer parameters such as storage coefficient s s and hydraulic conductivity k by the inverse modeling approach is essential for groundwater management peralta 2012 particularly knowledge and characterization of the spatial variability of k is essential for numerical models to realistically quantify subsurface fluid flow and contaminant transport eramian et al 1999 pumping test has been the most common approach to directly obtain aquifer parameters in the field work based on a number of groundwater flow models hantush 1966 papadopulos and cooper 1967 wu 2002a li et al 2014 khadri and moharir 2016 wu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 anwar 2018 feng et al 2020 for instance theis 1935 firstly developed a transient model for groundwater flow to a pumping well assuming a constant rate of abstraction in a homogeneous horizontally isotropic laterally unbounded confined aquifer cooper and jacob 1946 proposed a mathematical model which considers the effective radius of an artesian well since such classical theories developed many analytical numerical and intelligent optimization methods have been applied graphical methods were outlined by hantush 1956 for determining the coefficients of transmissibility storage and leakage of an effectively infinite leaky artesian aquifer neuman 1972 proposed a new analytical model for the delayed response process characterizing flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer wen et al 2017 developed a semi analytical model considering an exponentially decreasing pumping rate started at a certain higher rate to obtain aquifer parameters zhuang et al 2019 used a synthetic pumping test in confined aquifer to demonstrate the usage of the newly type curve and analytic methods in addition to the analytical models numerical solutions have also been developed recently rushton and holt 1981 şen 1990 kolditz 2001 wu 2002b sarwade et al 2007 arshad et al 2016 li et al 2017 for example mathias et al 2008 proposed numerical solutions using the finite difference scheme whereas ajayi and obilade 1989 presented a numerical scheme for calculating aquifer parameters directly from pumping test data obtained simultaneously from two observational wells in infinite homogeneous and isotropic aquifers khadri and moharir 2016 characterized aquifer parameters in basaltic hard rock region through pumping test methods including analytical and numerical method respectively shen et al 2015 employed both analytical and numerical methods to analyze the hydrogeological parameters in multi aquifers with vertical leakage in tianjin wu et al 2016 used numerical simulation to analyze the effects of pumping in the pit tamayo mas et al 2018 applied different approaches ranging from a traditional analytical solution to more sophisticated numerical models with automatically calibrated input parameters to characterize the hydrogeological properties choopani et al 2019 determined aquifer hydrogeological parameters in sirjan basin using groundwater modelling bumgarner and mccray 2007 liu et al 2009 shen et al 2017 and benson 2020 also used numerical solutions to estimate aquifer parameters in field sites recently heuristic optimizers such as particle swarm optimization pso differential evolution de genetic algorithm ga and cat swarm optimization cso have also been commonly used to estimate aquifer parameters by researchers eberhart and shi 2001 abbaspour et al 2001 huggi and rastogi 2003 thomas et al 2018 matott et al 2006 compared various optimization techniques for groundwater remediation studies and showed that pso performs better than ga conjugate gradient and random search algorithm thomas et al 2019 comparatively assessed ga de cso and pso in estimating aquifer parameters of a confined aquifer and found that de cso and pso models are more accurate in estimating aquifer parameters than ga for none noisy observed data spatial distributions of aquifer properties such as k often exhibit high heterogeneity the spatial variability of k has been identified as an important hydraulic property that controls groundwater flow and contaminant transport which are key factors for pollution control and remediation de marsily et al 2005 furthermore variation in k strongly defines average groundwater velocity which characterizes solute plume dispersion in porous media gelhar 1986 dagan 1986 gelhar et al 1992 eramian et al 1999 nevertheless owing to time cost and other technical constraints in field investigation pumping test is often limited in number and spatial distribution and therefore avails little in situ data that can be analyzed it should be pointed out that with sparsely measured geo data comes considerable degree of uncertainty application of geostatistical methods for modeling of geologic heterogeneity has become common practice due to the complexity of the subsurface and the relative scarcity of data on media properties matheron 1963 1971 developed the kriging and co kriging techniques which have been applied recently in different disciplines oliver and webster 2007 stated that kriging is a method of interpolation for geographical information systems idrysy and smedt 2007 elucidated the kriging and co kriging methods for estimating k johnson et al 2018 used kriging and gis to locate high concentrations of iron and manganese in buncombe county north carolina other applications of geostatistical methods in hydrology have been reported in several studies like clifton and neuman 1982 laslett 1994 voltz and webster 2006 schilling et al 2017 chabani et al 2017 and berton 2018 our study area the jianghan plain is a drainage basin densely covered with lakes and rivers major rivers including yangtze river han river tongshun river and dongjing river and rich in groundwater resources it is situated in the middle reaches of the yangtze river central china which is an important base of aquaculture and agricultural activities surface water quality and quantity has been a major source of concern due to industrial and agricultural activities consequently groundwater demand is high exerting pressure on the aquifers anthropogenic activities and excessive abstraction have led to contamination and depletion of the groundwater causing damage to the environment antibiotics and other pollutants i e nitrogen and phosphorus are increasingly being detected in water sources due to large scale agricultural cultivation zhou et al 2011 tong et al 2014 2017 yao et al 2017 the health of 19 6 million people in china and more than 73 000 people particularly in the jianghan plain has been affected by long term intake of primary pollutants such as arsenic heavy metal and nitrate gan et al 2014 duan et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 major water conservancy project south to north water transfer project and water diversion works from yangtze river to han river have intensified surface water groundwater interaction causing water quality deterioration and other environmental and geological problems this has also led to a decline in the self purification ability of the wetland due to land degradation and subsidence wang et al 2008 2018 as such to facilitate sustainable development and efficient management of groundwater resources in the jianghan plain it is critical to not only accurately estimate the values k from pumping test but also to determine its spatial variability in the region aquifer units and their properties e g regional k are important parameters to a large extent determines the groundwater flow and the groundwater head distribution and benefits for contaminant transport process as well it is notable that a few hydrogeological studies have been conducted in the area but upon careful review these works are deemed to be limited in scope particularly studies along the han and yangtze rivers were based on sparsely measured data zhang et al 2017 li et al 2017 chen et al 2017 additionally specific pumping test types in the field are frequently limited by several issues e g number of observation wells variable pumping rates or simultaneous pumping singh 2008 karami and younger 2012 shen et al 2015 wen et al 2017 besides different methods have peculiar constraints in their governing equations as well as conditions for localized application and should be selected only under the most appropriate conditions generally few hydrogeological studies have systematically subjected their parameter estimations to large number and variety of pumping tests due to the issues mentioned earlier furthermore the spatial variability of k in the jianghan plain has not yet been assessed although investigations into the development of the sedimentary environment in the jianghan plain have been conducted zeng 1991 yi et al 2002 kang et al 2009 wu et al 2019 the relationship between the spatial variability of k and sedimentary environment has not been elucidated to accurately obtain the spatial distribution of k on a regional scale as well infer its relationship to the sedimentary evolution of the basin a large scale multi format pumping tests and multi method approach is used firstly inversion methods i e analytic method numerical simulation and intelligent optimization methods pso and de were used to directly estimate the aquifer parameter based on a variety of pumping test data obtained from 55 boreholes secondly the spatial variability of k and its relationship with the sedimentary environment is analyzed our findings can be relevant to studies in similar hydrogeological and data scarce settings around the world the aquifer parameter hydraulic conductivity k obtained in this study can provide better knowledge of the groundwater hydraulics which is essential for enhanced evaluation of the groundwater resources as well as contaminant transport for pollution remediation in the study area also the analysis and performance of the different methods employed can provide some guidance for evaluating regional aquifer development and characteristics in similar sedimentary basins 2 location and geology of the study area 2 1 location and geographic setting the jianghan plain is a semi enclosed basin situated within the central yangtze river basin in hubei province of central china it is bounded by hills and mountains elevation values ranged between 100 and 2 000 m above sea level in the west north and east as well as adjoining the dongting lake in the south fig 1 b and c the spatial coverage of the area is about 46 000 km2 the han river a major tributary of the yangtze river and yangtze river flow across the basin and converge in the jianghan plain supplying alluvial lacustrine sediments gan et al 2018 the geomorphology can be classified into three categories hill hilly land and lowland plain the elevations gradually decline from northwest to southeast the low plain areas have a very low slope of 1 20 000 1 30 000 from west to east zhou et al 2013 the main area of focus in this study covers three hydrological systems comprising the han river tongshun river and dongjing river which are subdivided into three segments reaches covering an area of approximately 9 892 km2 segments of the han river include the western central and eastern the elevations range from 23 56 to 47 99 m above sea level fig 1d areas along the main river channels are typically 3 6 m higher than around the tributaries due to artificial or natural levees 2 2 geological and hydrogeological conditions geologically neotectonic movement controlled the geological structure and sedimentary characteristics of the basin wu et al 2017 alluvial lacustrine quaternary sediments overlie the top of the bedrock with the thickness gradually diminishing from the central area 150 280 m to the periphery 25 100 m fig 1c the quaternary stratigraphy is generally a sandy layer interbedded with clay layers in the western and central areas which gradually transformed into silty clay layers near the yangtze river overlain by a clayey layer dominant by loamy soil clay mucky clay and silty clay gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 2 silty clay and clay constitute a relatively waterproof layer where the thickness varies greatly ranging from 0 5 to 20 m lens fig 1d and fig 2 the quaternary aquifer system in the study area can be divided vertically into three aquifer groups zhang et al 2017 fig 1d and fig 2 the first is the phreatic aquifer 0 20 m depth with holocene qhg composed of loamy soil mucky clay silty clay clay silty sand silt and fine sand in this aquifer the depth to groundwater level generally ranges from 1 28 to 7 67 m 1 28 5 04 m during wet season and 2 73 7 67 m during dry reason the second system is the middle confined aquifer 20 80 m depth with late pleistocene qp3s and middle pleistocene qp2j and composed mainly of fine sand medium sand coarse sand sandy gravel and sandy cobble where part of the cross sections containing clay and silty clay lens as local aquitards with a thickness of 1 18 m the piezometric levels in this formation range from 20 to 35 m above sea level it is also the main aquifer that supplies agricultural industrial and domestic needs the third system is the deep confined aquifer greater than80 m depth with early pleistocene qp1d fine sand medium sand coarse sand sandy gravel and clay there is a continuous clay aquitard with a thickness of about 10 m which separates the deep confined aquifer from the middle confined aquifer the general trend of the quaternary aquifer is thick around the central area 90 100 m with thin margins 10 15 m thick in the east 20 30 m and thin in the west 10 20 m the stable water retaining floor between the quaternary aquifer and the underlying fissure pore confined water bearing rock formation is deeply buried in the central area and gradually rises to the margins fig 1c d and fig 2 controlled by the regional topography the flow directions of confined groundwater phreatic groundwater and surface water have similar directions all from north west to south east and discharge to the yangtze river fig 1b and d 3 materials and methods 3 1 dataset the middle confined aquifer resources are abstracted for large scale water diversion project irrigation households and industries the intense water stress encouraged water managers to conduct several pumping tests to obtain hydrogeological parameters over a period of four years 2014 2018 a database was created from several hundred laboratory lithology tests based on 24 sampling boreholes and pumping tests on 55 wells mainly distributed along the han and yangtze rivers comprising 24 pumping tests and 31 collecting wells obtained from hubei institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology these data are described and presented in table 1 and fig 1b along the western reach of the han river there are 13 boreholes while 19 others are located along its central and eastern reaches meanwhile along the tongshun river and dongjing river systems there are 9 and 12 boreholes respectively similarly 2 boreholes are situated near the yangtze river the type of pumping test employed falls into three categories transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells transient pumping test with variable rate by single well and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well 3 2 parameter estimation 3 2 1 numerical method the finite element model feflow feflow 6 2 was used in this study with the numerical simulation range taking corresponding pumping wells as the simulation center and extending 500 m in length and width which was found to eliminate the influence of pumping wells on the model boundary a mesh refinement criterion was presented near the pumping well where the groundwater level drops rapidly the pumping test lasted no more than 16 8 h and the drawdown generally hardly changed significantly after about 2 h therefore factors such as precipitation infiltration and evaporation were not considered also parameters such as ss and k were adjusted mainly based on the differences between the observed and calculated values the optimal parameters and best fitting values were obtained through repeated debugging divisions of aquifer structures triangular mesh subdivisions 3d geological models and other details of all the pumping tests are presented in tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information additionally drawdown of fitting curves for each pumping test corresponding to specific set of curves are all presented in the supporting information 3 2 2 pso the pso is a population based self adaptive and stochastic optimization technique jain et al 2018 it was first inspired by the movements of bird flocks or fish shoals seeking food eberhart and kennedy 1995 similar to the foraging process of birds each bird transmits the information captured by itself to the whole flock the entire flock constantly adjusts its direction during the flight until it finally finds the right food the optimal solution corresponds to the right food of the flock the pso starts by creating the initial particles and allotting them initial velocities where the objective function is evaluated for each particle location to determine the best function value and best location the pso is described mathematically as follows suppose n massless and volumeless particles in a physical dimensional search space d where the initial position x i and velocity v i of each particle are randomly generated as 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x id i 1 2 n 2 v i v i 1 v i 2 v id i 1 2 n where x i and v i are the initial position and the initial vector of the ith swarm particle respectively all particles are computed for fitness function values fit i the best position of individual particle p best and the global community g best are represented as 3 p best p i 1 p i 2 p id 4 g best p g 1 p g 2 p gd for individual particle comparing the fitness function values fit i and the best position of individual particle p best if the former is less than the latter then the former replaces the latter as the new p best as for fitness function values fit i and the best position of the global community g best the principle is the same each particle then updates its position and velocity during the subsequent iteration robinson and rahmat 2004 from the following 5 v i j t 1 w v i j t c 1 r 1 p i j x i j t c 2 r 2 p g j x i j t 6 x i j t 1 x i j t v i j t 1 j 1 2 d where v i j v max v max and x i j x max x max velocity v i j and position x i j should be within allowable limits and not out of the bounds t is the iteration number w is the inertia weight and set differently for different pumping tests i e for transient test with constant rate by multi wells w 0 5 for transient test with variable rate and steady state test with constant rate by single well w max 0 9 and w min 0 4 respectively c 1 and c 2 are learning factors c 1 c 2 2 in the former type and c 1 c 2 1 8 in the last two types r 1 and r 2 are random numbers 0 1 consequently when the termination criterion is satisfied the optimal results are presented otherwise the next iteration will compute the fitness function values fit i again 3 2 3 de de is generated by cooperation and competition among individuals within a group storn and price 1995 it is likened to the process of human evolving from apes to modern humans through initialization of apes gene mutation crossover with other races continuous selection of adaptive environment storn and price 1997 the final survival of the human corresponds to the optimal solution of a specific problem the de is described mathematically as follows initialization randomly initialize the position of np populations in d dimensional space within specified upper and lower bound 7 x ji 0 r a n d 0 1 x j u x j l x j l i 1 2 n p j 1 2 d where xi u and xi l are the upper and lower bound of the variable xi i 1 2 np represents population size g represents generations rand 0 1 means random number generated between 0 and 1 mutation for each target vector xi g mutant vector is generated by 8 v i g 1 x r 1 g f x r 2 g x r 3 g where r 1 r 2 r 3 1 2 3 np f is mutation factor 0 2 and set as 0 85 for transient test with constant rate by multi wells and 0 4 for transient test with variable rate and steady state test with constant rate by single well crossover trial vector generated u ji g 1 from the mutant vector v ji g 1 and target vector x ji g 1 9 u ji g 1 v ji g 1 i f r a n d b j c r o r j r n b i x ji g 1 i f r a n d b j c r o r j r n b i i 1 2 n p j 1 2 d where randb j is a random number 0 1 rnb i is a random series 1 2 d cr is crossover factor 0 1 and set as 0 2 and 0 1 for transient test with constant rate by multi wells and the latter two types respectively selection compare trial vector u j i g 1 and target vector x ji g 1 select the vector in the next generation which can obtain the lowest fitness function value continue the last three basic elements until the termination criterion is satisfied for the optimization algorithms mentioned above the termination criterion can be based either on the user defined number of generations or the precision of the calculation the latter was chosen in this study which can be expressed as 10 δ 1 n i 1 n s i s s i 2 where s i are the ith actual drawdowns and ss i are the calculated drawdowns thereafter n np g c 1 c 2 p min p max v min v max x min x max were continuously adjusted until the termination criterion was satisfied and the curve of the actual and calculated drawdown fitted well simultaneously thereby producing the optimal results it should be noted that the parameters setting fitness function curves and drawdown of fitting curves for the two optimization methods of each pumping test are given detail in the supporting information 3 3 geostatistical analysis heterogeneity is inherent in geological media furthermore it is unrealistic to collect large amounts of observational data on a regional scale due to cost and other technical constrains consequently geostatistical techniques based on spatial interpolation methods have to be adopted despite the associated uncertainty geostatistics has attracted the attention of several researchers kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 hoeksema and kitanidis 1984 illman et al 2009 2010 borkowski and kwiatkowska malina 2017 benjamin et al 2019 providing a pragmatic means to achieve reasonable results that can be utilized for earth resources evaluation to accurately determine spatial variability of k in the jianghan plain geostatistical techniques kriging are implemented based on the following protocol 1 data analysis 2 fitting applicable theoretical variograms with experimental variograms 3 structural analysis 4 cross validation and estimation of spatial variability of k finally a residuals map can be obtained which can be used to verify the estimation errors an experimental variogram quantifies the spatial variability of k by assessing effects of spatial shifts such as from k xi to k xi h remy et al 2009 11 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h k x i k x i h 2 where γ h is the experimental variogram n h is the pair number h is the lag distance between two sample points xi is a given spatial location the alternative theoretical variogram models such as the spherical sp exponential ex or gaussian model gs containing three deterministic parameters i e nugget effect c 0 sill cs and correlation length λ h were applied and compared to obtain an applicable theoretical variogram model herein in our study area the k values in the quaternary strata tables 2 and 3 show that the ranges between the maximum and minimum are 1 333 times maximum 333 times in qp3s and 110 times in qp2j for such heavily skewed distributions the estimation of the variogram can be distorted by outliers leading to less accuate estimates with linear kriging technique freeze 1975 noted that most k values have log normal distribution characteristics from many field investigations based on statistical analysis delhomme 1978 also found that the ln k distributions are less skewed than the k and have a better spatial variation structure than the original values later scholars mostly used ln k for k estimations delhomme 1979 woodbury and sudicky 1991 eggleston and rojstaczer 1998 therefore log normal transformed values ln k are used in this study because they provide more robust variograms and also show better correlations than the original values the experimental variogram is then fitted by the best theoretical model and used to analyze the spatial structures relative to an angle as well as a distance of tolerance in cross validation the estimation procedure at the locations of existing field data is tested this involves removing sample of a given point and estimating it based on values around its neighborhood this process is then repeated for all the samples until the validation criteria is met which is based on the residuals between the observed values and their estimates the main steps in spatial structure analysis are as follows 1 calculate experimental variograms in different directions 2 fit experimental variograms with theoretical model to obtain correlation length λ h in all directions 3 draw the anisotropic rose diagram based on the results from the previous steps the procedure described above including exploratory data analysis and variable transformation as well as variography cross validation and estimation were implemented using a group of software arcgis arcgis 10 5 surfer surfer 12 gslib matlab matlab 2018b spss spss 22 0 tecplot tecplot 10 0 2 4 results 4 1 verification of models when running intelligent optimization models the termination criterion is commonly set to the scale of 10 6 similarly the s s was preset to the scale of 10 5 for convenience due to large lithology data from 24 boreholes the generated data p min p max v min v max as well as other parameters require debugging repeatedly until precision is satisfied the analytical approaches including special type curve matching and straight line methods were used in every borehole the numerical simulation and intelligent optimization methods were also applied in each pumping test tables 2 and 4 present a statistical summary of k and ss from 24 pumping tests using analytic numerical simulation and intelligent optimization inversion methods pso and de respectively table 3 shows the k values from the collecting boreholes evaluation criteria such as mean absolute error l1 and mean square error l2 were used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the accuracy of different inversion methods with the results presented in table 5 it is important to highlight that the values of l1 and l2 should be as small as possible it is notable that the analytical approaches were implemented using the aquifer test aquifer test 2011 1 software as shown in tables 2 and 4 results obtained by the analytical approaches differ significantly with that of the numerical solution and intelligent optimization methods respectively additionally differences in optimal parameters setting for pso and de stem from the types of pumping test and the definitions used in each intelligent optimization model as shown in the tables s1 and s2 of the supporting information for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells optimal generations are 8 in pso and 10 in de suitable p min and p max are 0 50 in pso and 0 40 in de and appropriate v max and v min are 1 0 in pso no improvements in the results were observed when the parameters exceeded the optimal values the evaluation criteria in table 5 and specific fitting curves in the supporting information show that the pso and de are more precise than the numerical method with de being the overall best also pso and de are more concise and faster in practice if vulnerability to being trapped by local minima is ignored overall pso and de are preferred for this type of pumping test in the field for transient pumping test with variable rate by single well optimal generations are 50 in pso and 26 in de suitable p min and p max are 0 30 in pso and 0 10 in de and appropriate v min and v max are 10 10 in pso also for transient pumping tests with constant rate by single well optimal generations are between 15 and 26 in pso and de suitable p min and p max are 0 30 in pso and 0 10 in de and appropriate v min and v max are 10 10 in pso for the two latter types of pumping test the evaluation criteria in table 5 show that l1 and l2 of the numerical method are significantly different from that of pso and de large number of specific fitting curves in the supporting information also illustrate that the numerical method fits better with the actual drawdown data while pso and de are both observed to have a large deviation at the early stage of pumping in this case the numerical method is preferred over pso and de 4 2 variogram comparison the main characteristics of regionalized variables can be discerned by constructing a comprehensive variogram model and quantitatively summarizing all effective structural information jiang and liu 2004 a theoretical variogram model that fits with the experimental variogram can well describe the shape of variables and can also be regarded as a significant factor for determining the spatial correlations in aquifer material thereby establishing the origin of its formation or sedimentation based on the relationship between the experimental variogram and theoretical model it is helpful to develop a more accurate ordinary kriging model in the process of establishing theoretical variogram models parameter optimization is necessary as it can better reflect the variation of regional variables and support the kriging interpolation as well as any random simulation technique based on kriging the key steps are to select a model that fits well with the experimental variogram from a series of feasible alternative models and finally select a representative theoretical model based on specific indicators on the basis of cross validation for this paper the corresponding coefficients of determination r 2 residual sum of squares rss and fitted variogram parameters are tabulated in table 6 for the three variogram models used typically r 2 value should be close to 1 while rss should be as small as possible the r 2 and rss are slightly different whereas c 0 c 0 c s especially λ h differ significantly stemming from the definitions used in each model between the three alternative variogram models fitted the spherical variogram model gives the greatest λ h over the other two additionally the goodness of fit for the spherical model r 2 ranges from 0 8682 to 0 9125 while rss from 0 0061 to 0 0162 in qp3s and qp2j respectively the other models gave poorer values as such the spherical model was adopted 4 3 spatial structure analysis analyzing the spatial structure of the study area is critical to gaining better understanding of the variability of hydraulic parameter particularly on such a large scale to reflect the anisotropy of k better the experimental variograms fitted by theoretical variogram models in different directions were calculated including all inflection point changes n0e n20e n40e n60e n80e s80e s60e s40e s20e s0e s20w s40w s60w s80w n80w n60w n40w n20w with 22 5 and one tenth of the lag distance that is 0 4 km as the tolerance angle and distance the experimental variograms and improved spherical compared to the exponential and gaussian variogram models of all calculated directions in qp3s and qp2j are computed representively showing two directions for each formation in fig 3 and fig 4 the anisotropic rose diagram is plotted from the values of λ h in all directions that were calculated the anisotropic rose diagram exhibits elliptical shapes with the long axis indicating the maximum continuous direction while the short axis indicate the minimum continuous direction as the regionalized variability is anisotropic as seen in fig 5 for qp3s semi major axis is 60 000 m and semi minor axis is 14 000 m with a direction angle of 20 anisotropy ratio 4 357 presenting geometric anisotropy n20e perpendicular to the han river λ h is short indicating that the river s alluvial effect was strong farther away from this direction the k values change from large to small s70e along the han river channel λ h is long and k floats in a small range for qp2j the semi major axis is 30 000 m while the semi minor axis is 13 000 m with a direction angle of 20 anisotropy ratio 2 308 also presenting geometric anisotropy n20e perpendicular to the flooding direction of the northern water systems flow from west to east λ h is small with greater change in k values trending away from this direction along the flooding direction of the northern water systems substantially along the northern water systems to the central area of the basin s70e λ h is long having smaller changes in k values meanwhile the spatial distrubtion analysis shows that the degree of variation from east to west is smaller compared to the larger variation along the north south direction additionally the spatial variability in all directions of qp2j is not as strong as that of qp3s which may be closely related to the sedimentary evolution over various periods 4 4 spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity the natural logarithmof the measured k ln k which precisely fitted values from the pumping tests and available values from collecting boreholes was determined it is important to note that before kriging operation is performed it is necessary to validate the selected theoretical spherical model and test whether the probability density function of the reduced residuals meets the standard normal distribution ideally the kriging average error kae should be close to 0 while the kriging reduced mean square error krmse should be close to 1 if the latter is greater than 1 then c 0 needs to be raised for correction conversely c 0 should be lowered to ascertain whether the statistical distribution is close to the standard normal data such as the orientation and length of the long and short axis obtained form the main input for the cross validation the final results show that the kae and krmse are 0 023 and 1 011 respectively both are within the allowable error range chiles and delfiner 1999 additionally the cross validation can also test the validity and accuracy of the spatial interpolations quantitatively the cross validation procedure tests the robustness of a model by evaluating the validation criteria based on the statistical properties of mean m mean standardized ms root mean square rms root mean square standardized rmss and average standard error ase obviously the m and ms should be as close to 0 as possible and the former indicates that the prediction is unbiased the rms and ase should be as small as possible closer to 0 as they highlight the deviation between the predicted and measured values additionally the rmss should be close to 1 denotes accurate prediction the grid configuration in each strata imposed had 400 rows 600 columns after back transformation with the cell size of 1 m 1 m this grid resolution was chosen in order to ensure that the cells are smaller than λ h in all corresponding directions as suggested by modis and sideri 2013 and troldborg 2004 the verified results of fitted variograms sp ex and gs are given in table 7 it should be noted that the exponential and gaussian models are not consistent with the trend of the standard error making the interpolation error large consequently the best fit was the spherical model as it provided the smallest standard error values therefore the most representative spatial distributions of k in quaternary heterogeneous confined aquifer where four groundwater flow systems had compounded environmental geological problems yet to be assessed were selected and plotted as shown in fig 6 a and fig 7 a to quantitatively evaluate the accuracies the statistical properties of the differences residuals or errors e between the observed values and their estimates are presented in fig 6b and fig 7b the map of the k values reflect the existing conditions encountered in the field in qp3s highest k values are found in the transition from hilly land to the lowland plain from jiukou town to zhanggang town and the area along the yangtze river the low k values in maiwang town xiantao town yanglinwei town and xingou town are closely followed by the high k values from the center of the study area presenting a striped distribution meanwhile the lowest k values are found in the northwest of the study area from the boundary of study area to jiukou town and yanglinwei town in qp2j the corresponding highest values of k are found in the central area east of qianjiang town south of xiantao town and xingou town and other parts close to the yangtze river low k values increase gradually extending in the form of wide strips from the central areas to the margins accordingly the lowest k values continue unto the periphery of the study area generally near the han river and yangtze river the k values in qp3s are greater compared to qp2j whereas they have the same variability in that the k values farther away from large rivers are lower than near the rivers especially the yangtze river additionally the k values increase from north to south both in qp3s and qp2j near the yangtze river the estimation errors for estimated k values fig 6b and fig 7b are rather high in some areas in addition to the influence of the smoothing effect of kriging anthropogenic activities were not excluded e g in the yanglinwei town where most of the pumping wells are situated there are large residual values nevertheless the main cause of the large residual in this area is due to limited number of pumping tests especially in the locations farther away from the centre of the plain closer to the yangtze river 5 discussion different methods were used to guarantee the precision of the estimated aquifer parameter from the specific fitting curves in the supporting information for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells pso and de were found to be more concise and precise they should be considered in field application especially if time is a constraint in that case their vulnerability to being trapped by local minima must be ignored repeated simulation results in the supporting information confirm that the numerical method strictly requires field hydrogeological data thereby yielding more realistic results however it is susceptible to constant debugging which can take up a lot of time as for the transient pumping test with variable rate and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well the numerical method is preferred over pso and de as they have a tendency to produce a large deviation at the early stage of pumping nevertheless when considering multiple factors the optimization algorithm i e pso and de methods provide a better alternative to estimate large set of aquifer parameters the spatial variability of k is largely dependent on the composition of sediment characteristics and its spatial distribution hydrodynamic conditions as well as sedimentary environment sun et al 2015 bridge and lunt 2006 falivene et al 2007 the distribution of sediments is not the only basis for sediment type classification but can also reflect the sedimentary environment and provenance information these three main factors represent the most important differences among clusters which could be useful to infere the main processes controlling spatial variability understanding their regularities and correlations have practical significance in predicting k values at locations where no tests have been conducted yang et al 2016 restored the sedimentary environment of different quaternary period as in early qp3s most lakes at the end of qp2j evolved into swamps due to a colder climate and low precipitation whereas the yangtze river and han river still maintained considerable water volume varying hydrodynamic conditions have resulted in the accumulation of fine sand and silt in the western verge of the study area from the boundary of study area to jiukou town similarly sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand and fine sand are deposited in the west from jiukou town to zhanggang town in the central areas fine sand is well deposited with medium sand and fine sand distributed in the eastern parts of the area along the yangtze river conseuently the k also decreased gradually along the han river and increased when it closer to the yangtze river in middle qp3s the surface water apparently became more active due to warmer and semi humid climate as well as an increase in precipitation also sustained melting of snow and ice increased surface water activity thereby driving a large scale accumulation as alluvial and alluvial diluvial gravel bed developed in the basin periphery and alluvial floodplain and shallow lacustrine facies deposited in the centre the sediments caused by hydrodynamic conditions were mainly fine sand silt and clay as such k decreased from the central area to the margins in late qp3s the river was more stable and river phase deposited by alluvial rivers were formed the cumulative deposition of the three different stages are responsible for hodiernal qp3s strata as shown in fig 2 fig 6a and table 8 in the western reach of the han river the layers of sediment and aquifer increase in thickness along the river and the k value also rises gradually the main lithology from fine sand silt and mucky clay to sandy cobble sandy gravel fine sand and clay and gradually transition to medium sand fine sand and clay for the other hydrological systems the thicknesses exhibits a decreasing trend vertically moving farther away from the rivers and following the rivers flow direction also the sediment size and k values exhibit similar decreasing variability characterizing the landscape changes from hill and hilly land to lowland plain as the terrain flattens the carrying capacity of rivers begin to reduce causing detrital materials to be gradually deposited from mainly sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand fine sand clay in the west of han river meanwhile medium sand fine sand and clay are deposited in the midwest and near the yangtze river fine sand and silt are deposited respectively in the central area extending eastward with an addition of clay and silty clay in the east fig 2 and table 8 hence the distribution of k gradually decreases from west to east along flow direction of the han river and it decreaces from the han river to the north or the south along the perpendicular direction of the han river as shown in fig 6a the mutual consistency of the borehole data the spatial variability of k distribution and the prior studies about the sedimentary environment e g yang and cai 1997 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 is a good proof of the findings here as an appropriate representation of the hodiernal sedimentary characteristics nevertheless there are some areas like the south eastern parts of dongjing river where the average sediment size increases from north to south while k values also increase gradually in the same trend this phenomenon is associated with the alluvial deposits of the yangtze river from early qp2j except for the relative settlement in the central area other parts began to rise due to the general tectonic uplift in eastern china this factor in additon to fluvial and aeolian processes are the main reason for the absence of the whole qp2j in the west of the study area from the boundary of study area to shayang town furthermore in early qp2j the extensive deep water lake became shallow lakes and swamps thereby driving accumulation of sandy cobble sandy gravel medium sand fine sand and clay as well as other alluvial and lacustrine deposits the compositions of sediments and sedimentary environments are similar to those presented by yi et al 2002 liu and wu 2011 determined the palaeolimnology that an increase in temperature in middle qp2j led to an increase in precipitation and river levels this created a sloping fan shaped plain in front of the piedmont and a floodplain in the center where river and river lake sediments alternately accumulated to form complex lithofacies due to the frequent change in surface water levels this continued into late qp2j when the alluvial fan facies of alluvial diluvial origin was formed in the peripheral area the central area formed from the flood facies and lacustrine facies of alluvial and lacustrine origin hence the thicknesses of hodiernal qp2j strata and aquifer trends decreases from there unto the margin this phemonon is also observed trending from south to north along the yangtze river furthermore the lithology around the central area is mainly composed of thick sandy cobble sandy gravel and fine sand interbedded with medium to fine sand and clay east to jianli town and west to maiwang town the sediment sizes were not found to differ greatly and the k values are the largest in the entire study area from the central area to the northern parts of the study area zhanggang town maiwang town and near the tianmen town the sediment size gradually becomes thinner composed mainly of fine sand with the k values being fairly large but not as in the central areas in the east west of the maiwang town but not near the yangtze river the sediment size is generally small while the k values gradually reduce as fine sand is the only lithology constituting the aquifer closer to the yangtze river stronger sediments are affected by fluvial fluctuation significantly thereby reducing the sediment size predominantly from medium sand to fine sand as the k values also reveal a decreasing trend from the yangtze river to the center although some areas are greatly affected by anthropogenic factors which could affect result the field fig 6 a b and fig 7 a b it is however undeniable that the spatial variability of k is inseparable from the factors mentioned above fig 2 table 8 and fig 7a kang et al 2009 xu et al 2016 overall these studies are consistent with our findings and therefore add credibility to the methods that were employed 6 conclusions in this study the hydraulic conductivity k of jianghan plain was estimated and its spatial variability analyzed and discussed a multi method appraoch comprising analytical numerical pso and de was used to guarantee the precision of the estimated k values where the results can be validated and complemented by each respective method the following conclusions can be drawn 1 data from 55 wells comprising three types of pumping tests 24 and collecting wells 31 were collected and analyzed in light of the large number of specific fitting curves and evaluation criteria pso and de especially de are preferred for transient pumping test with constant rate by multi wells however their vulnerability to being trapped in local minima must be ignore also the numerical method is best suited for transient pumping test with variable rate and transient pumping test with constant rate by single well these outcomes can provide some guidance for selecting best parameter estimation method for similar aquifers in the field work 2 the values of k vary from 0 032 to 10 64 m d within qp3s and 0 33 to 36 24 m d within qp2j the anisotropic rose diagram highlighted geometric anisotropy in both qp3s and qp2j with an anisotropy ratio of 4 357 and 2 308 respectively however the k values in qp2j have less spatial variability as the correlation length λ h in all calculated directions did not change as strongly as in qp3s 3 the spatial variability of k is largely dependent on the sedimentary environment comprising sediment characteristics and their spatial distribution the k values in qp3s decrease along the direction of the major rivers han and yangtze highlighting fluvial activity except for some terrain factors around the boundary of study area close jiukou town similarly the k values in qp2j exhibit a decreasing trend represented by wide alluvial strips from the central area unto the margin also the k values close to the major rivers in qp3s are greater compared to qp2j whereas they both have the same variability overall this research can provide some new insights into large scale estimation k and its spatial variability in relation to the local sedimentary development the results can also support a more sustainable evaluation and management of groundwater resources in the jianghan plain as well as in similar sedimentary environments around the world

4867,evaluation of hydrological response to future climate change is essential for water quality risk assessment and adaptive management implementation within a watershed context in this study we present a modeling framework that integrates a hydrological model with projections of general circulation models gcms temperature and precipitation projections of six gcms with two downscaling methods are used to force the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the hamilton harbour watershed in ontario canada a flow based weighting strategy was developed to integrate the projections of multiple gcms based on their ability to recreate empirical flow frequency distributions in multiple monitoring sites our study renders support to the ability of the weighted model ensemble to draw meaningful hydrological forecasts nonetheless we also note that the ensemble strategy understates the frequency and magnitude of flow extremes and therefore the domain that is collectively delineated by individual gcms can still provide complementary planning information climate change is projected to trigger a distinct increase in air temperature and precipitation during the late winter early spring period which in turn will likely result in an earlier snowmelt and changes in the magnitude and timing of peak flow events analysis of the water cycle shows that the sensitivity of the individual hydrological components to climate change may vary along the urban to agriculture gradient the projected declining soil water content in agricultural catchments highlights the likelihood of more intensified drought conditions in the croplands evapotranspiration rates will likely increase across the entire watershed whereas surface runoff could be reduced but less so in urbanized locations overall our findings suggest that any future planning exercise to ameliorate the prevailing water quality conditions will only be insightful if we consider the interplay between climate change and urbanization processes in the area keywords extreme hydrological events climate change gcms ensemble strategy agricultural watersheds urban watersheds 1 introduction the impacts of climate change are becoming a growing concern worldwide increased global temperatures have been predicted to alter hydrological processes with a tendency towards more frequent hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods trenberth 2011 the projected increase in the intensity of heavy precipitation events with warming mallakpour and villarini 2017 ragno et al 2018 is expected to affect soil moisture and runoff rahmani et al 2016 plant productivity and growth arroyo cosultchi et al 2016 gorton et al 2019 and water quality in watersheds delpla et al 2011 bosch et al 2014 carpenter et al 2018 developing strategies to adapt to and or mitigate the impacts of climate change requires a better understanding of the effects of future climate trends on watershed hydrology null et al 2010 this is of particular importance in canada where warming rates are expected to be twice as high relative to other regions of the world cohen et al 2019 these changes in canadian climate are predicted to vary across regions and seasons with higher temperature trends already being registered in northern and western areas during the winter and spring months vincent et al 2018 annual precipitation has also increased in all parts of canada but more distinct changes have been reported in parts of northern canada british columbia atlantic canada quebec and southern ontario vincent et al 2018 cohen et al 2019 the emerging precipitation and temperature patterns have resulted in earlier spring snowmelt reduced snow cover duration and hydrological shifts from snowmelt to more rainfall dominated regimes mcmartin et al 2018 vincent et al 2018 all of these changes in the water cycle are generally affecting streamflow by leading to prolonged droughts in the summer and higher runoff and frequency of flooding events during the winter chezik et al 2017 mcmartin et al 2018 although considerable insights have been gained through past and recent efforts to evaluate regional climate change trends there are still significant knowledge gaps with respect to the potential impacts of climate change on water balance components at the watershed scale in canada predictions of multiple climatic variables e g air temperature precipitation wind speed are required in order to comprehensively assess the response of watershed hydrology to climate change general circulation models gcms are numerical tools that are not only used to simulate the effects of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases on the climate system defined as the complex system comprising the atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere biosphere and the interactions among these components baede et al 2001 but can also be used to derive estimates of climatic variables on a global scale prudhomme et al 2003 ghosh and misra 2010 tzabiras et al 2016 however gcm projections are subjected to uncertainties originating from three broadly defined sources model scenarios and intrinsic system variability hingray and said 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 giuntoli et al 2018 model or response uncertainty represents the production of diverse climate responses by different gcm models despite being driven by identical external forcing this difference in gcm outputs stems from the model structure and parameterization or any other constraints that are postulated in light of incomplete knowledge of the geophysical processes underlying global change ghosh and misra 2010 hingray and said 2014 scenario uncertainty arises from limited understanding of the external conditions that influence the climate system such as the unpredictable future trajectories of greenhouse gases land use changes and stratospheric ozone concentrations giuntoli et al 2018 intrinsic variability also known as climate noise is the natural variability in the climate system that occurs in the absence of radiative forcing and results from non linear dynamic and stochastic processes pertaining to the atmosphere ocean and the coupled stratosphere troposphere system hawkins and sutton 2009 giuntoli et al 2018 the relative contribution of these three sources of uncertainty has been shown to vary across variables of interest location lead time and temporal scales hawkins and sutton 2009 for instance hawkins and sutton 2009 demonstrated that model and scenario uncertainties become dominant sources at longer time scales for both regional and larger spatial domains while internal variability generally becomes more significant within shorter time spans and at smaller spatial scales recognizing the significant uncertainties associated with any climate forecasting exercise it becomes essential to combine projections of a wide range of gcms in order to reduce the likelihood of type i model error which occurs when a valid alternative model is rejected or omitted from the decision making process mccarthy et al 2001 beigi et al 2019 empirical evidence suggests that the simple averaging of gcm model ensembles yields improved climate predictions than a single model in terms of reliability and consistency null et al 2010 gulizia and camilloni 2015 samouly et al 2018 dayon et al 2018 her et al 2019 likewise weighted ensemble strategies in which different weights are assigned to individual model ensemble members can be used to reduce the predictive uncertainty by downplaying the predictions drawn from poorly performing models chen et al 2017 one of the main challenges of using gcm weighted techniques is that there are no universally accepted standards of climate model performance that can help to distinguish between good or bad models giorgi and mearns 2002 developed an ensemble averaging method based on two reliability criteria bias and convergence in an attempt to evaluate multiple models and produce future climate estimates with a weighted average of individual gcms model bias also commonly known as model performance can be defined as the ability of the gcm models to simulate observed climate records while model convergence refers to the agreement among simulations by different gcm models across space and time giorgi and mearns 2002 razavi et al 2016 used several indices to characterize changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature and precipitation events and reported that a weighted scheme based on these indices performed better than the mean values of all climate models to collectively capture outcomes of meteorological extremes probabilistic strategies to formulate weighting schemes are increasingly becoming popular dessai and hulme 2004 rasmussen et al 2016 for instance murphy et al 2004 introduced the climate prediction index cpi to weight different gcms by comparing the likelihood of reproducing a set of present day atmospheric variables and tebaldi et al 2005 extended the reliability criteria with a bayesian statistical framework to determine probability distributions of future climate change even though many different methods have been proposed to determine the weights of gcms a common feature among all the conventional weighting strategies is their dependence upon the assessment of model performance against historical records of multiple climatic variables nevertheless this approach has limitations as climate models usually serve for a wide range of field applications e g risks of floods and droughts forecasts of ecosystem health and therefore the focal variables for the assessment of model error or even the establishment of performance standards for the same variable may vary depending on the research goals prior experience and knowledge of the system tebaldi and knutti 2007 weiland et al 2012 colorado ruiz et al 2018 from a watershed hydrology perspective many indices e g magnitude of precipitation and temperature frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have been considered relevant to characterize model performance but satisfactory model fidelity for one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects given the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena this variability in the error associated with different model endpoints makes it difficult to assign weights to individual gcms gleckler et al 2008 to reduce the uncertainties associated with multiple performance metrics in gcm ensembles our study introduces a flow based weighting scheme that can support a robust assessment of hydrological response to climate change at the watershed scale our case study is the hamilton harbour watershed in southern ontario canada which has a long history of environmental degradation due to industrial discharges and urban agricultural runoff entering the harbour through its major tributaries long et al 2015 munawar and fitzpatrick 2017 accurate modelling of the potential impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology is critical for guiding management strategies and mitigating the eutrophication severity in the area our flow based ensemble strategy assigns probabilistic weights to individual gcms based on the likelihood of each model to be a correct representation of the system given the daily flow time series registered in six gauging stations flow projections from the weighted multi model ensemble are then used to gain insights into the spatial hydrological changes in the near and distant future to the best of our knowledge there are only a handful of studies e g weiland et al 2012 that have assembled gcms based on their fidelity to predict hydrological responses to climate change and even fewer are the attempts to synthesize gcm predictions based on their ability to recreate empirical flow frequency distributions the proposed modelling framework can be used as a tool for obtaining long term estimates of regional climatic variables and analyzing structural changes of the water cycle 2 methodology 2 1 study area and swat modelling hamilton harbor is a shallow embayment located at the western end of lake ontario with a drainage area of 445 km2 the surrounding watershed encompasses four main tributaries spencer creek grindstone creek redhill creek and indian creek whereas the land use of spencer and grindstone catchments is dominated by agriculture mainly cropland most of the area in redhill and indian catchments is urbanized specifically grindstone creek drains an area of 87 km2 90 of which is non urban pasture forest and cropland spencer creek drains an area of 290 km2 with 47 occupied by cropland and pasture and 28 occupied by forests however it is worth noting that the southern portion of the spencer creek catchment adjacent to the harbour is highly urbanized the urbanized areas occupy 74 and 69 of the indian and redhill catchments respectively the soils of the hamilton harbour basin consist mainly of loams 49 sandy loams 23 clay loams 17 and clay 11 properties of the soil exhibit uneven spread between the four hydrologic soil groups hsgs classified by the natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture ross et al 2018 groups a and b are the least likely soils to generate runoff and account for 23 and 31 of the basin s area respectively on the other end groups c and d have higher potential to generate runoff and cover 40 and 6 of the basin s area respectively the slopes of the basin are mostly mild with average slope of the basin being 4 4 the hamilton harbour watershed has been previously shown to demonstrate significant season specific hydrological patterns due to intra annual variations of climate conditions peak flows that usually occur in the spring are likely in response to snowmelt events whereas streamflow during the growing season may to october are driven by precipitation events dong et al 2019 flows during the winter are relatively lower because most of the precipitation occurs in the form of snow and accumulates as snowpack the soil and water assessment tool swat version 2012 usda agricultural research service usda ars 2018 neitsch et al 2011 was used to simulate watershed hydrology for the hamilton harbour the watersheds for the four tributaries were divided into 51 sub watersheds based on information pertaining to land cover soil and slope dong et al 2019 the sub watersheds in turn encompass 295 hydrologic response units hrus with each hru representing a unique land use slope and soil type combination daily instream flows were simulated from 2005 to 2015 and the first four years were used for the warm up period to phase out the impacts of uncertain initial conditions in the system the model was calibrated with observed flows from 2009 to 2012 and validated from 2013 to 2015 a multi site season specific strategy was performed for swat calibration in six discharge gauging stations three in spencer creek two in grindstone creek and one in redhill creek based on a previous sensitivity analysis exercise the curve number for antecedent runoff condition ii cn2 was determined to be one of the most sensitive swat parameters for successful streamflow simulation in hamilton harbour see table 1 in dong et al 2019 cn2 relates surface runoff to precipitation and is affected by land cover soil properties and planting harvest activities feyereisen et al 2008 because ground cover varies between growing and dormant seasons in croplands feyereisen et al 2008 we assigned different cn2 values based on two distinct multiplicative effects during the two seasons using the swat model characterization of the water cycle displayed significant spatial heterogeneity across the hamilton harbour watershed evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater rates were projected to be much higher in the catchments of spencer creek and grindstone creek where landcover is dominated by forest and pasture in contrast higher surface runoff was mainly registered in the urbanization dominant indian creek and redhill creek catchments more detailed information on the swat application to the hamilton harbour basin and the data sources employed in this study can be found in dong et al 2019 2 2 climate models the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 is a collaborative framework designed to support the assessment ofclimate change knutti and sedláček 2013 whereby an increasing number of gcms is used to predict changes in greenhouse gas concentrations or the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the gcms predict global climate variables based on four rcp scenarios including the mitigation scenario rcp2 6 medium stabilization scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and continued emission scenario rcp8 5 the numbers associated with these rcp scenarios represent the radiative forcing 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 for mitigation medium stabilization and continued emission scenarios respectively in the year 2100 rcp4 5 the scenario with stabilized radiative forcing that is achieved through the implementation of technologies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was selected for this study twelve climate models six gcms with two downscaling methods for rcp4 5 were used to drive the calibrated swat model in the hamilton harbour watershed the downscaled projections of daily climate variables minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation come from the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic with a gridded resolution of 10 km werner et al 2019 the downscaled projections provided by pcic were calibrated based on the historically observed variables during the 1950 2005 period recognizing that the gcm models are prone to systemic error biases the two downscaling methods include i bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd murphy et al 2004 and ii bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq murphy et al 2004 bcsd bias corrects monthly temperature and precipitation from gcms against observations using quantile mapping with the delta method similarly bccaq uses quantile mapping for bias correction with a daily rather than monthly scale detailed information on the six selected gcms and two downscaling methods is included in table 1 2 3 flow based ensemble strategy all of the selected climate projections were assembled based on the performance metrics in our study the performance of gcms is assessed against their ability to reproduce frequency distributions of observed daily flow during the swat simulation period 2009 2015 this strategy differs from the approach employed in most studies which normally focus on the ability of gcms to reproduce observed conditions of multiple climatic variables the weight of each gcm in our flow based ensemble is calculated by quantifying the discrepancies between the cdfs for simulated and observed flows 1 d c s m x s min x s max f s x s g s m x s d x s s 1 2 s m 1 2 m where s and m stand for the numbers of gauging stations and climate models respectively d c s m is the discrepancy between observed and simulated flow cdfs with the mth climate model in the sth station f s is the empirical cdf of observed daily flows in the sth station g s m is the cdf of swat simulated daily flows with the mth climate model in the ith station x s min and x s max represent the minimum and maximum observed daily flows in the sth station respectively for the convenience of calculation d c s m is estimated by dividing cdfs into several bins as follows 2 d c s m i 1 n f s x s i g s m x s i δ x s i s 1 2 s m 1 2 m 3 δ x s i x s i m a x x s i m i n x s i x s i m a x x s i m i n 2 i 1 2 n where f s and g s m are divided into n bins within the range x s min x s max in the present study n was set equal to 50 for precise representation of cdfs x s i m a x and x s i m i n are the maximum and the minimum daily flows in the ith bin δ x s i and x s i represent the width and the midpoint flow of the ith bin respectively to obtain the weight of each climate model the dc values across all the six stations should be taken into consideration 4 dc m s 1 s d c s m x s s 1 2 s m 1 2 m where x s is the average daily flow in the sth station a lower d c m value indicates that the mth climate projection can recreate more closely the empirical cdf of the registered flows and should be assigned a larger weight when assembling gcms therefore the weights of the mth climate projection w m are calculated as follows 5 w m 1 dc m m 1 2 m 6 w m w m m 1 m w m m 1 2 m the inverse of dc m is normalized to limit the value of the corresponding weight w m within the range 0 1 and m 1 m w m 1 subsequently a weighted multi model ensemble based on the monitored flows can be derived with the weights 7 as v m 1 m c m m v w m v 1 2 v where v is the number of climate variables as v is the weighted ensemble for the vth climate variable c m m v is the value of the vth climate variable for the mth individual model to recap the proposed framework provides a means for assembling climate model predictions and assessing the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology fig 1 model weights are determined from present day flow records and the weighted ensemble is then used to project changes in future climate and watershed hydrology the modelling framework consists of three steps i swat modelling with gcm projections ii evaluation of performance metrics and development of the multi model ensemble iii long term hydrological predictions with the climate ensemble and the swat model our previous research established a swat model to simulate hydrology in the hamilton harbor watersheds with monitored meteorological data dong et al 2019 the model was calibrated and validated against streamflow records obtained during 2009 2015 from six discharge stations the meteorological time series of the twelve selected climate models six gcms with two downscaling methods were inputted into the calibrated model to produce twelve daily time series of gcm based flows the weight of each gcm was calculated based on the disparity between the simulated gcm forced and empirical cdfs of daily flows during the study period 2009 2015 the 120 yr daily meteorological precipitation minimum and maximum temperature time series from the twelve climate models from 1980 to 2099 were then combined according to the flow based weights and inputted into the swat model to predict the long term hydrology of the hamilton harbour watershed in stream flow and water balance components were quantified and analyzed during three periods the reference 2000s 1980 2019 near 2040s 2020 2059 and distant future 2080s 2060 2099 periods 3 results 3 1 flow weighted climate model ensemble and evaluation against daily streamflows the present study is founded upon the recent swat application in the hamilton harbour watershed dong et al 2019 the hydrological submodel was calibrated with a season specific multi site strategy at six discharge stations in the three local tributaries spencer grindstone and redhill creeks briefly the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values for the calibration and validation periods were determined to be 0 70 and 0 67 respectively fig s1 since hydrological models are usually regarded as satisfactory with nse 0 5 good with nse 0 65 and very good with nse 0 75 werner and cannon 2016 the original swat application to the hamilton harbour watershed is capable of providing reliable discharge predictions for the purposes of the present study however notwithstanding the good performance in reproducing historical flow discharge records 2009 2015 it should be noted that the model fit for the urbanized redhill creek was comparatively poorer nse 0 54 than the average fit for the non urban spencer nse 0 74 and grindstone creeks nse 0 72 during the calibration period this result also held true for the validation period where nse was found to be 0 48 0 69 and 0 73 in redhill spencer and grindstone creeks respectively the consistency of model fidelity between calibration and validation periods was attributed to the multi site character of the original model training exercise dong et al 2019 moreover the season specific representation of hydrological processes improved the predictive capacity relative to the conventional practice that assumes uniform parameter values over the entire simulation period dong et al 2019 in the present study we inputted the selected twelve gcm projections into the calibrated swat model and obtained simulated daily flows for the period 2009 2015 from the comparison of the cdfs for the simulated against the flows registered in the six stations fig 2 it is apparent that there are discrepancies of varying degree between the flows generated after forcing swat with the individual gcms and the six empirical cdfs see also the corresponding probability density functions in fig s2 these disparities were more pronounced with the base flows in redhill creek figs 2 and s2 reflecting the aforementioned inferior model fit and underestimation of base flow conditions in the same creek fig s1f following eqs 1 7 the weights assigned to the twelve gcm models are provided in table 1 miroc5 was given the highest weights with both bcsd 0 242 and bccaq 0 132 downscaling methods suggesting that the climatic forcing generated by that model led to a more realistic reproduction of the flow records in the hamilton harbour watershed in contrast the lowest weights were assigned to mri cgcm3 0 046 and 0 040 for bcsd and bccaq respectively which are 70 80 lower than the weights assigned to miroc5 compared to the individual gcms the weighted denoted with red lines in figs 2 and s2 and simple averaged green lines ensembles appear to improve the representation of the empirical cdfs blue lines except from redhill creek fig 2f and s2f given the consideration of different gcms with diverse daily climate projections the improved performance of the ensemble strategies stems from smoothing the variations of the twelve climatic time series fig s3 for the same reason though the extreme simulated flows were downplayed by the two ensemble strategies resulting in peak flow rates that were lying within the range delineated after forcing swat with individual gcms but were distinctly lower than those registered in the corresponding monitoring sites tables 2 and s2 while the latter result partly reflects the inability of our hydrological model to capture the magnitude of several peak flow events it is still an important point to bear in mind when evaluating the impact of climate change on hydrological extremes in the area in particular taking the downstream station of spencer creek ds as an example the top 100th percentile of the simulated flows with the weighted ensemble 24 61m3s 1 was lower by nearly 20 and 26 from its maximum counterpart 30 57m3s 1 of the twelve streamflow time series generated by the gcms and the actual value 32 40m3s 1 registered in that monitoring station respectively max gcm and observed in table 2 likewise the top percentile from the weighted ensemble 14 78m3s 1 in the downstream station in grindstone creek dg was 34 and 45 lower than its maximum counterpart 22 46m3s 1 derived from the flows projected by individual gcms and the observed flow 26 80m3s 1 respectively table 2 the same trend held true for the urban catchment redhill creek where the underestimation of the registered maximum daily flow 30 50m3s 1 was 63 and 39 for the weighted ensemble 11 40m3s 1 and the maximum individual gcm projection 18 71m3s 1 respectively in the same context the flow weighted ensemble strategy slightly outperformed the multi model average which assigned equal weights to all gcms in terms of the degree of similarity between the empirical cdfs and those recreated by the two ensembles fig 2 in particular the weighted ensemble was closer to the observed values in 38 out of 60 percentiles 10 percentiles for each station relative to the values predicted when using a simple averaged arithmetic mean climatic forcing table 2 for comparison purposes we also considered an alternative post hoc scheme that assigned the weights to the predicted flows generated by swat after being forced by the twelve gcm projections and not to the climatic series that is used to force the model notably the gcm weighted ensemble strategy displayed superior performance for all peak flows relative to the weighted or averaged flows weighted flow and average in table s2 the latter finding suggests that the post hoc weighting assigned to the predicted flows is more prone to understate hydrological extremes rather than the present approach that propagates a smoother climatic forcing through the hydrological model 3 2 evaluation of the flow weighted ensemble strategy against monthly streamflows this section tests whether our flow weighted ensemble approach can satisfactorily reproduce the monthly flow time series in the hamilton harbour watershed the predicted monthly streamflow times series during the swat calibration and validation periods 2009 2015 in the six monitoring stations are shown in fig 3 where the grey areas represent the wide range of streamflows generated by the meteorological forcing of all twelve gcms upper and lower boundaries of streamflow projections suggest that the individual gcms can overestimate atypically wet months with high streamflows and or underestimate drier months with low flow conditions by contrast the weighted and multi model average ensembles captured the mean monthly flows registered in all six gauging stations but appear to underestimate cases representing higher than usual flow conditions assessing model performance with the nse criterion reinforced the significant disparities between monthly flow records in the six monitoring stations and those derived from the meteorological forcing of the individual gcms table 3 the substantial model error was particularly evident for grindstone creek where nse values for the upstream and downstream stations varied from 1 22 to 0 46 and 1 09 to 0 35 respectively since negative nse values indicate that the model outputs are worse than the mean value of the corresponding dataset it can be inferred that most of the analyzed gcms fail to capture the monthly flow time series a notable exception was the miroc5 gcm which displayed nse 0 4 for three gauging stations and was thus assigned the highest weight when formulating the weighted ensemble the weighted ensemble led to higher nse values for each gauging station and the improved performance was particularly evident for the upstream station in spencer creek where nse increased from 0 17 to 0 38 this result also holds true for redhill creek where the weighted ensemble is the only approach aside from the swat model nse 0 51 calibrated with the actual meteorological data which displayed a positive nse 0 04 value overall notwithstanding the moderate ability to reproduce atypically high flow conditions we can infer that the flow weighted ensemble outperforms all the gcms as well as the averaged model ensemble in terms of its capacity to reproduce the monthly flow time series 3 3 long term climate streamflow projections and characterization of the water cycle based on the multi model ensemble the long term monthly minimum and maximum daily temperatures were projected to increase in the hamilton harbour basin fig s3a and b whereas there was no clear trend for the precipitation fig s3c there were also noticeable differences between the climate projections drawn from the flow weighted ensemble and multi model average in general the weighted ensemble projected lower minimum and maximum temperatures than the model average by contrast precipitation projections with the two ensemble strategies were in close proximity with each other for most of the temporal domain studied fig s3 according to the month to month variability of the weighted ensemble fig 4 a and b minimum and maximum daily temperatures were projected to gradually elevate during the near 2040s and distant 2080s future relative to the reference condition 2000s this trend was particularly evident during the early spring period when surface runoff is usually driven by snowmelt events the greatest increase of maximum temperature occurs in march when the monthly median was projected to increase by 3 5 c and 5 3 c in 2040s and 2080s relative to the reference period 5 6 c respectively table s1 similarly the medians of minimum temperature were projected to increase by 2 9 c and 4 4 c in february which represents the greatest change of minimum temperature compared to temperature precipitation projections displayed greater intra month and lower among season variability nevertheless it is evident that the precipitation during january march most of which occurred as snowfall was projected to display a long term increase 11 15 increase of the precipitation medians in 2080s interestingly the estimated increase in precipitation was temporally similar to the projections of elevated temperatures in the early spring we inputted the climate projections of the weighted ensemble into the swat model and the cdfs of the projected daily streamflows for the reference 2000s near 2040s and distant future 2080s periods are shown in fig 5 the same projections are also provided for the post hoc weighting scheme of the flows predicted from swat as well as those predicted when the model is forced by the individual gcms tables s3 s5 there were relatively distinct discrepancies between cdfs of the 2000s and 2040s which suggests a sharper shift of the flow patterns in the near future for the non urban watersheds spencer and grindstone creeks the greatest differences were registered on the frequency of moderate flows fig 5a e whereas evidence for a similar change was additionally provided for the low flow conditions in the urbanized redhill creek watershed fig 5f based on the percentile analysis table 4 the frequencies of low flow conditions 30th percentile were projected to remain stable in the long term whereas moderate or higher flow rates would distinctly increase the 50th flow percentiles were projected to increase across all monitoring sites by 14 45 and 29 64 in 2040s and 2080s from the reference period respectively table 4 generally flow estimates between the 40th and 80th percentiles displayed a gradual increase in the long term simply put compared to the reference period the prevailing flow rates or the anticipated average flow conditions will be higher during the 2040s and 2080s fig s4 by contrast the flow maxima 100th percentiles were projected to decrease in magnitude in most of the gauging stations four out of six with the most dramatic drop occurring between the 2000s to 2040s when the flow maxima reduced from 21 49 m3s 1 and 32 68 m3 s 1 to 15 76 m3s 1 and 26 03 m3s 1 at the downstream stations of spencer and grindstone creeks respectively in regards to the month to month variability fig 6 it is worth noting that the streamflow was projected to significantly increase in january and february and decrease from march to may this trend is very likely attributed to the earlier snowmelt in the winter and early spring due to the aforementioned elevated temperatures regarding the water cycle characterization our swat projections of the individual components i e precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater and soil water are suggestive of a significant level of heterogeneity across the hamilton harbour watershed fig s5 for the reference period 2000s evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater rates were much higher in non urban areas catchments surrounding spencer creek and grindstone creek compared to the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek in urban areas most of the precipitation is delivered as surface runoff rather than infiltrating into the soil profile as opposed to the prevailing patterns in non urban catchments in the upstream catchments of spencer and grindstone creeks where land cover is dominated by forest and pasture the annual evapotranspiration rate was found to be significantly higher than other areas 700 mm whereas deeper surface runoff depth 300 mm was projected in urban catchments due to lower permeability levels owing to the lower infiltration rates in the mostly urbanized redhill creek catchment the soil water content 20 mm and groundwater discharge rate 90 mm were consistently lower than other catchments 80 mm and 180 mm respectively the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge rate tends to amplify over time in 2000s the mean annual groundwater discharge rate was below 120 mm for about 80 of the sub watersheds whereas it was projected to vary between 120 mm and 251 mm in half sub watersheds by 2080s similarly the disparities of evapotranspiration among different sub watersheds were projected to be more distinct since the maximum annual evapotranspiration rate across the watershed increased from 820 mm in 2000s to 920 mm in 2080s the absolute changes in the magnitude of water balance components in the future were converted to a percent change relative to the reference period fig 7 the results showed that the sensitivity of water balance components to climate change varied spatially due to local topographic features in most areas of the non urban catchments groundwater rates are projected to increase dramatically by 16 50 in the near future with some subwatersheds demonstrating an increase 50 in the distant future on the contrary groundwater flow rates were predicted to decline in most urban areas evapotranspiration rates were projected to be slightly higher in the near future and dramatically higher in the distant future across the hamilton harbour watershed but the increase was less pronounced in the urban areas in contrast with evapotranspiration surface runoff is predicted to decrease in most areas with the exception of the downstream catchment of redhill creek although there was no clear trend with the soil water content some areas including the urban catchments and the downstream catchment of spencer creek were projected to experience increased decreased soil water content in the near distant future 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and challenges in long term hydrological projections under climate change the various typologies proposed in the literature to characterize climate model uncertainties typically identify two primary categories related to i the uncertainty inherent in the climate system and ii the uncertainty in our ability to recreate its dynamics and underlying mechanisms through our models tannert et al 2007 hawkins sutton 2009 foley 2010 giuntoli et al 2018 the former category encompasses the inherently irreducible uncertainty over human actions such as the unknown future emission concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or type i uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 as well as the uncertainty over how the climate system is likely to respond to our actions nonetheless it is often argued that impact studies often tend to be overly optimistic about the reliability of the predictions drawn by the current generation of models but also overly pessimistic about the effects on society and their capacity to adapt blӧschl and montanari 2010 notwithstanding the challenges in predicting the future emission trajectories owing to the influence of local policies socio economic norms and development practices the present study focused on a single scenario rcp4 5 which postulated a stabilization of the greenhouse gas concentrations our results suggested that even when forced with an identical emissions scenario different gcms with diverse downscaling methods have the potential to provide fairly different outlooks of daily and monthly climatic conditions and streamflow regimes the latter range of predictions reflects either our knowledge gaps in emulating the dynamics of the climate system also known as epistemological or type iii uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 and or the stochasticity of the climate system the so called ontological or type ii uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 consistent with our results recent line of evidence not only suggests that the projected changes in the water cycle within the climate hydrology modelling framework are characterized by large spread but also that the spread from the selection of the hydrological model may be comparatively larger than that originating from climate models hagemann et al 2013 aryal et al 2019 recognizing that there is no single perfect model for climate forecasting our study employed an ensemble approach which blended forecasts from six gcms and two downscaling methods in order to improve the skill and reduce the errors associated with weather forecasts tebaldi knutti 2007 samouly et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 beigi et al 2019 the optimal type of ensemble scheme weighted versus averaged is still debatable and may lead to diverse hydrological projections although there are studies that have demonstrated minimal differences between the two ensemble techniques schmittner et al 2005 weiland et al 2012 comparing between flow based weighted and averaged model ensembles our results showed the weighted ensemble outperformed the multi model average as well as any single gcm in reproducing flow time series and associated percentiles nonetheless our analysis also showed that the two multi model ensemble strategies distinctly underestimated the extreme flow conditions registered in the six locations from a statistical point of view this result is not surprising as the distribution of flows is expected to be narrower for the model average when the predicted maxima from the individual models are not collocated in a broader context the same pattern was eloquently described by knutti et al 2010 as the loss of signal when combining solutions from multiple models that do not converge or may even display a bifurcation which leads to an average state that is not physically plausible and could be misleading thus while our study renders support to the ability of a weighted ensemble strategy to draw hydrological forecasts we caution that it may still understate as any type of multi model averaging the frequency and magnitude of flow extremes and therefore the domain that is collectively delineated by individual gcms can also provide meaningful planning information 4 2 climate change and impacts on water cycle and streamflow regimes climate variability exerts significant impacts on different facets of watershed hydrology and any changes in precipitation intensity or duration temperature antecedent soil moisture snow accumulation and melt may cause alterations in frequency and intensity of streamflow regimes depending on watershed topography and geology chang and franczyk 2008 weiland et al 2012 consistent with registered trends and long term projections for the laurentian great lakes cohen et al 2019 the hamilton harbour basin is expected to experience a distinct increase in air temperature and precipitation levels during the winter early spring period emerging consensus among many hydrological impact assessment studies suggests that the realization of the latter pattern of temperature and precipitation increase will likely result in an earlier snowmelt and changes in the magnitude and timing of peak flow events cohen et al 2019 dibike et al 2019 specifically our study projected a streamflow increase from january to february accompanied by a decrease from march to june thereby suggesting that climate change could substantially alter the streamflow regime by smoothing the sharp mid spring flow peaks and shifting the elevated flow conditions towards early spring to late winter another way to view the projected hydrological changes in the hamilton harbour watershed relates to the overall increase of peak flows for both low and high frequency events for most part of the year fig 8 b except from the period between march and june when the flow frequency curves among the reference near and distant future periods become practically indistinguishable fig 8a interestingly the highly urbanized redhill creek subwatershed displayed a decreasing pattern of the mid spring early summer peak flow events over the mid and distant future across the entire range of return periods fig 8a our results of an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and declining spring peak flows for the hamilton harbour watershed are corroborated by many recent studies investigating effects of climate change in snowmelt dominated watersheds across canada for example gombault et al 2015 used a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swatqc to project future 2041 2070 or 2050s hydrological changes due to climate change in the pike river quebec canada the derived projections weresuggestive of a two to three fold increase in the winter streamflow relative to historical trends as well as of an earlier start of the spring floods in march rather than april whereas the simulated summer streamflows displayed a distinct decrease similar evidence of a strong potential for climate change to exacerbate seasonal water availability and flooding issues in agricultural watersheds was also provided by li et al 2016 who applied the providing regional climates for impacts studies precis model and the hydrological inference model him to the grand river watershed in southern ontario likewise o neil et al 2017 assessed changes in hydroclimatic variables between the time periods of 1971 2000 and 2050s and predicted an earlier onset of the spring freshet owing to the higher frequency of mid winter snowmelt events in western canada based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model eum et al 2017 and dibike et al 2019 similarly projected an earlier timing of the spring freshet along with an overall increase in mean annual streamflow over the athabasca river basin alberta canada interestingly the same study also showed that the river flows could experience increases during the winter and spring seasons but decreases during the summer and early fall with an overall peak flow increase especially for low frequency extreme events the potential impacts of climate change on hydrological extremes have received considerable attention as it is predicted that global warming will amplify the hydrological cycle in the form of increased cloudiness latent heat fluxes intense precipitation events and flooding huntington 2006 knapp and schwabe 2008 notwithstanding the devastating recent floods in central europe vogel 2002 the united kingdom arduino et al 2005 southern united states travis 2005 and southeast asia alam and rabbani 2007 current research has not addressed unequivocally whether or not a changing climate is responsible for these major flood events mudelsee et al 2003 in the same context though the influence of land cover changes such as deforestation and urbanization can similarly elevate the risks of excessive runoff due to reduced infiltration capacity lower soil porosity lower evapotranspiration rates and plant interception from the vegetation loss chang and franczyk 2008 however the ability to parse out the direct influence of land cover land use from the potential impacts of climate change is problematic because flow extremes are typically the result of a complex interplay among a multitude of factors such as variations in precipitation evapotranspiration watershed topography soil moisture and depth chang and franczyk 2008 eum et al 2016 farjad et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 consistent with our current paradigm of the effects of urbanization our modelling exercise showed that most of the precipitation is delivered as surface runoff in the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek rather than infiltrating into the soil profile increased impervious cover and reduced water retention capacity can clearly magnify the peak flow rates and reduce the response time to rainfall fohrer et al 2001 miller et al 2014 which is reinforced by the higher number of peak events in the hydrograph of the urbanized redhill creek as well as the stronger relationship between flow and precipitation see our fig s1f and fig 2 in wellen et al 2014a by contrast evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater flow rates are much higher in the non urban areas catchments surrounding spencer creek and grindstone creek compared to the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek in the upstream sites of spencer and grindstone creeks where land cover is dominated by forest and pasture evapotranspiration was found to be significantly higher than other areas it is also important to note that the evapotranspiration fluxes and groundwater discharges into the local reaches derived by the present swat application are on par with the estimates reported by the combined use of the precipitation runoff modelling system with modflow for the 1989 1997 period as presented in the water budget and water quantity stress study for the halton hamilton source protection region hhsps 2010 dong et al 2019 increased temperature and changes in precipitation have the potential to affect hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff soil moisture and groundwater discharge yin et al 2017 joseph et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 our hydrological modelling results forced by the ensemble of gcm projections show that the water balance components will respond differently to climate change and the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration and groundwater will likely amplify over time along the urban to agriculture gradient in the hamilton harbour watershed based on our projections groundwater flow rates will increase in non urban catchments while a decrease will likely occur in mostly urban locations the overall evapotranspiration rates will increase across the basin but the increase is expected to be less pronounced in urban areas surface runoff will be reduced except from small pockets in the southernmost part of the watershed mainly located in the predominately urban redhill creek catchment similar insights have been gained by other attempts to understand the projected effects of climate change on hydrological processes in the laurentian great lakes for example verma et al 2015 projected a summer precipitation decline and an evapotranspiration increase in the maumee river watershed in lake erie which may be collectively responsible for a distinct river flow decline by the mid century indeed according to farjad et al 2017 the largest variations in evapotranspiration could occur in the summer modulated by the higher atmospheric demands due to higher average air temperatures as well as the increased plant leaf area interestingly du et al 2019 projected that future evapotranspiration could be responsible for approximately 10 of the water loss in the athabasca river basin but the water yield could still increase substantially 50 due to the higher precipitation and higher snowmelt runoff in fact the same study predicted a decreasing trend in the ratio of sub surface flow to total water which may increase the stream temperatures owing to the lower temperature of the sub surface runoff compared with the surface runoff du et al 2019 4 3 linking climate driven hydrological changes with water quality in the hamilton harbour the studied watershed directly influences the hamilton harbour a large embayment located at the western end of lake ontario with a long history of eutrophication problems primarily manifested as excessive algal blooms low water transparency predominance of toxic cyanobacteria and low hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations during the late summer arhonditsis et al 2018 the drastic nutrient loading reduction has historically played a central role in local restoration efforts although the determination of critical levels is a contentious issue as the population growth and increasing urbanization reinforce the need for expansion of the local wastewater treatment plants nonetheless a major confounding factor for these efforts is that the contemporary nutrient loading estimates are uncertain and appear to inadequately account for the seasonality of non point sources the role of episodic hydrological events and the potential impact of climate change kim et al 2014 long et al 2015 recent research has shown that both total phosphorus tp and phosphate loads can vary by three orders of magnitude between wet and dry conditions with storm events and spring freshets driving peak daily loads in the local urban and agricultural catchments respectively long et al 2014 moreover areal tp loads are significantly higher from the urban relative to the agricultural catchment while a significant fraction 50 of the annual phosphorus loads can be generated during a small number of brief but intense precipitation events long et al 2014 wellen et al 2014b in the same context long et al 2014 used the profound differences in weather between the 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 seasons as a window of opportunity to examine the potential impacts of climate change on water quality in the hamilton harbour taken together with the present modelling projections it was found that tp loading may change from a bimodal delivery pattern quiescent period followed by intense spring freshet in cold winters to an export characterized by intermittent nutrient fluxes during warmer winters reflective of a meteorological forcing and subsequent tributary response observed during any other time of the year recent modelling work suggests that the water quality goals for tp levels 20 μg l 1 chlorophyll a concentrations between 5 and 10 μgl 1 and water clarity 3 m can likely be met in the hamilton harbour only if the proposed phosphorus loading reduction at the level of 142 kg day 1 is realized ramin et al 2011 from a management standpoint our recent and present hydrological modelling work has allowed for the identification of the potential impacts of urbanization and climate change on watershed hydrology dong et al 2019 which should be an integral component of all the local efforts to reduce non point source phosphorus loading specifically the distinctly higher tp and phosphate concentrations during rain melt events relative to baseflow conditions underscores the importance of storm water mitigation storm water management practices such as green roofs porous pavements bioretention systems and infiltration trenches can effectively reduce peak flows by allowing rainfall to percolate into the underlying soil layer promote infiltration along with evapotranspiration control streambed scouring and transport of entrained particulate matter in runoff askarizadeh et al 2015 the potential impacts of climate change on nutrient dynamics in watersheds are likely to be experienced beyond the winter season in the area for example long et al 2014 showed that the riverine phosphate concentrations in predominantly agricultural catchments e g grindstone creek tended to be higher in summer and fall and lower in winter during low flow conditions likely due to elevated temperature dependent release from phosphorus laden riverine sediments in the same catchments summer precipitation events were also strong and ubiquitous drivers of particulate matter and nutrient export and thus the projected increase in the frequency of such events during the biologically active period could accentuate the eutrophication severity in the system gudimov et al 2011 thus while storm water mitigation is an important step to reduce storm water runoff and peak flows it is equally important to adopt practices conducive to higher precision fertilization manure application techniques and reduction of vertical stratification in the soil profile maguire et al 2018 in conclusion we presented an ensemble modelling strategy to assess the impact of climate change on watershed hydrology by weighting the projections of multiple gcms based on their performance in reproducing the observed streamflow regime the framework was used to project long term changes in the hydrology of the hamilton harbour watershed based on a previously developed swat model compared to the conventional multi model average our flow based weighted ensemble framework improved the reproduction of flow time series and empirical frequency distributions and the same results held true against any individual gcm in terms of reproducing monthly stream flows nevertheless the multi model ensembles distinctly underestimated the extreme flow conditions and thus we contend that the greater variability generated by individual gcms on the magnitude of low frequency events can still provide critical planning information our analysis reinforces the popular notion that climate change would have significant impacts on the streamflow regime in the hamilton harbour watershed based on the projections with the flow based multi model ensemble streamflow in the six gauging stations of the hamilton harbour watershed would experience an increase in the late winter early spring and a decline in the mid spring owing to elevated temperature and earlier snowmelt regarding the individual components of the water balance our modelling exercise also projected a distinct change along the urban to agriculture gradient whereby groundwater discharge could increase in agricultural catchments and experience an apparent decrease in urban settings evapotranspiration rates are projected to increase across the entire hamilton harbour watershed while surface runoff could be reduced in most areas the projected declining soil water content in the catchments of spencer and grindstone creeks highlight the likelihood of more intensified drought conditions in the croplands overall our findings suggest that the on going remediation efforts and any future planning exercise to ameliorate the prevailing water quality conditions will only be meaningful if we jointly consider the effects

4867,evaluation of hydrological response to future climate change is essential for water quality risk assessment and adaptive management implementation within a watershed context in this study we present a modeling framework that integrates a hydrological model with projections of general circulation models gcms temperature and precipitation projections of six gcms with two downscaling methods are used to force the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the hamilton harbour watershed in ontario canada a flow based weighting strategy was developed to integrate the projections of multiple gcms based on their ability to recreate empirical flow frequency distributions in multiple monitoring sites our study renders support to the ability of the weighted model ensemble to draw meaningful hydrological forecasts nonetheless we also note that the ensemble strategy understates the frequency and magnitude of flow extremes and therefore the domain that is collectively delineated by individual gcms can still provide complementary planning information climate change is projected to trigger a distinct increase in air temperature and precipitation during the late winter early spring period which in turn will likely result in an earlier snowmelt and changes in the magnitude and timing of peak flow events analysis of the water cycle shows that the sensitivity of the individual hydrological components to climate change may vary along the urban to agriculture gradient the projected declining soil water content in agricultural catchments highlights the likelihood of more intensified drought conditions in the croplands evapotranspiration rates will likely increase across the entire watershed whereas surface runoff could be reduced but less so in urbanized locations overall our findings suggest that any future planning exercise to ameliorate the prevailing water quality conditions will only be insightful if we consider the interplay between climate change and urbanization processes in the area keywords extreme hydrological events climate change gcms ensemble strategy agricultural watersheds urban watersheds 1 introduction the impacts of climate change are becoming a growing concern worldwide increased global temperatures have been predicted to alter hydrological processes with a tendency towards more frequent hydrological extremes such as droughts and floods trenberth 2011 the projected increase in the intensity of heavy precipitation events with warming mallakpour and villarini 2017 ragno et al 2018 is expected to affect soil moisture and runoff rahmani et al 2016 plant productivity and growth arroyo cosultchi et al 2016 gorton et al 2019 and water quality in watersheds delpla et al 2011 bosch et al 2014 carpenter et al 2018 developing strategies to adapt to and or mitigate the impacts of climate change requires a better understanding of the effects of future climate trends on watershed hydrology null et al 2010 this is of particular importance in canada where warming rates are expected to be twice as high relative to other regions of the world cohen et al 2019 these changes in canadian climate are predicted to vary across regions and seasons with higher temperature trends already being registered in northern and western areas during the winter and spring months vincent et al 2018 annual precipitation has also increased in all parts of canada but more distinct changes have been reported in parts of northern canada british columbia atlantic canada quebec and southern ontario vincent et al 2018 cohen et al 2019 the emerging precipitation and temperature patterns have resulted in earlier spring snowmelt reduced snow cover duration and hydrological shifts from snowmelt to more rainfall dominated regimes mcmartin et al 2018 vincent et al 2018 all of these changes in the water cycle are generally affecting streamflow by leading to prolonged droughts in the summer and higher runoff and frequency of flooding events during the winter chezik et al 2017 mcmartin et al 2018 although considerable insights have been gained through past and recent efforts to evaluate regional climate change trends there are still significant knowledge gaps with respect to the potential impacts of climate change on water balance components at the watershed scale in canada predictions of multiple climatic variables e g air temperature precipitation wind speed are required in order to comprehensively assess the response of watershed hydrology to climate change general circulation models gcms are numerical tools that are not only used to simulate the effects of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases on the climate system defined as the complex system comprising the atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere biosphere and the interactions among these components baede et al 2001 but can also be used to derive estimates of climatic variables on a global scale prudhomme et al 2003 ghosh and misra 2010 tzabiras et al 2016 however gcm projections are subjected to uncertainties originating from three broadly defined sources model scenarios and intrinsic system variability hingray and said 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 giuntoli et al 2018 model or response uncertainty represents the production of diverse climate responses by different gcm models despite being driven by identical external forcing this difference in gcm outputs stems from the model structure and parameterization or any other constraints that are postulated in light of incomplete knowledge of the geophysical processes underlying global change ghosh and misra 2010 hingray and said 2014 scenario uncertainty arises from limited understanding of the external conditions that influence the climate system such as the unpredictable future trajectories of greenhouse gases land use changes and stratospheric ozone concentrations giuntoli et al 2018 intrinsic variability also known as climate noise is the natural variability in the climate system that occurs in the absence of radiative forcing and results from non linear dynamic and stochastic processes pertaining to the atmosphere ocean and the coupled stratosphere troposphere system hawkins and sutton 2009 giuntoli et al 2018 the relative contribution of these three sources of uncertainty has been shown to vary across variables of interest location lead time and temporal scales hawkins and sutton 2009 for instance hawkins and sutton 2009 demonstrated that model and scenario uncertainties become dominant sources at longer time scales for both regional and larger spatial domains while internal variability generally becomes more significant within shorter time spans and at smaller spatial scales recognizing the significant uncertainties associated with any climate forecasting exercise it becomes essential to combine projections of a wide range of gcms in order to reduce the likelihood of type i model error which occurs when a valid alternative model is rejected or omitted from the decision making process mccarthy et al 2001 beigi et al 2019 empirical evidence suggests that the simple averaging of gcm model ensembles yields improved climate predictions than a single model in terms of reliability and consistency null et al 2010 gulizia and camilloni 2015 samouly et al 2018 dayon et al 2018 her et al 2019 likewise weighted ensemble strategies in which different weights are assigned to individual model ensemble members can be used to reduce the predictive uncertainty by downplaying the predictions drawn from poorly performing models chen et al 2017 one of the main challenges of using gcm weighted techniques is that there are no universally accepted standards of climate model performance that can help to distinguish between good or bad models giorgi and mearns 2002 developed an ensemble averaging method based on two reliability criteria bias and convergence in an attempt to evaluate multiple models and produce future climate estimates with a weighted average of individual gcms model bias also commonly known as model performance can be defined as the ability of the gcm models to simulate observed climate records while model convergence refers to the agreement among simulations by different gcm models across space and time giorgi and mearns 2002 razavi et al 2016 used several indices to characterize changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme temperature and precipitation events and reported that a weighted scheme based on these indices performed better than the mean values of all climate models to collectively capture outcomes of meteorological extremes probabilistic strategies to formulate weighting schemes are increasingly becoming popular dessai and hulme 2004 rasmussen et al 2016 for instance murphy et al 2004 introduced the climate prediction index cpi to weight different gcms by comparing the likelihood of reproducing a set of present day atmospheric variables and tebaldi et al 2005 extended the reliability criteria with a bayesian statistical framework to determine probability distributions of future climate change even though many different methods have been proposed to determine the weights of gcms a common feature among all the conventional weighting strategies is their dependence upon the assessment of model performance against historical records of multiple climatic variables nevertheless this approach has limitations as climate models usually serve for a wide range of field applications e g risks of floods and droughts forecasts of ecosystem health and therefore the focal variables for the assessment of model error or even the establishment of performance standards for the same variable may vary depending on the research goals prior experience and knowledge of the system tebaldi and knutti 2007 weiland et al 2012 colorado ruiz et al 2018 from a watershed hydrology perspective many indices e g magnitude of precipitation and temperature frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have been considered relevant to characterize model performance but satisfactory model fidelity for one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects given the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena this variability in the error associated with different model endpoints makes it difficult to assign weights to individual gcms gleckler et al 2008 to reduce the uncertainties associated with multiple performance metrics in gcm ensembles our study introduces a flow based weighting scheme that can support a robust assessment of hydrological response to climate change at the watershed scale our case study is the hamilton harbour watershed in southern ontario canada which has a long history of environmental degradation due to industrial discharges and urban agricultural runoff entering the harbour through its major tributaries long et al 2015 munawar and fitzpatrick 2017 accurate modelling of the potential impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology is critical for guiding management strategies and mitigating the eutrophication severity in the area our flow based ensemble strategy assigns probabilistic weights to individual gcms based on the likelihood of each model to be a correct representation of the system given the daily flow time series registered in six gauging stations flow projections from the weighted multi model ensemble are then used to gain insights into the spatial hydrological changes in the near and distant future to the best of our knowledge there are only a handful of studies e g weiland et al 2012 that have assembled gcms based on their fidelity to predict hydrological responses to climate change and even fewer are the attempts to synthesize gcm predictions based on their ability to recreate empirical flow frequency distributions the proposed modelling framework can be used as a tool for obtaining long term estimates of regional climatic variables and analyzing structural changes of the water cycle 2 methodology 2 1 study area and swat modelling hamilton harbor is a shallow embayment located at the western end of lake ontario with a drainage area of 445 km2 the surrounding watershed encompasses four main tributaries spencer creek grindstone creek redhill creek and indian creek whereas the land use of spencer and grindstone catchments is dominated by agriculture mainly cropland most of the area in redhill and indian catchments is urbanized specifically grindstone creek drains an area of 87 km2 90 of which is non urban pasture forest and cropland spencer creek drains an area of 290 km2 with 47 occupied by cropland and pasture and 28 occupied by forests however it is worth noting that the southern portion of the spencer creek catchment adjacent to the harbour is highly urbanized the urbanized areas occupy 74 and 69 of the indian and redhill catchments respectively the soils of the hamilton harbour basin consist mainly of loams 49 sandy loams 23 clay loams 17 and clay 11 properties of the soil exhibit uneven spread between the four hydrologic soil groups hsgs classified by the natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture ross et al 2018 groups a and b are the least likely soils to generate runoff and account for 23 and 31 of the basin s area respectively on the other end groups c and d have higher potential to generate runoff and cover 40 and 6 of the basin s area respectively the slopes of the basin are mostly mild with average slope of the basin being 4 4 the hamilton harbour watershed has been previously shown to demonstrate significant season specific hydrological patterns due to intra annual variations of climate conditions peak flows that usually occur in the spring are likely in response to snowmelt events whereas streamflow during the growing season may to october are driven by precipitation events dong et al 2019 flows during the winter are relatively lower because most of the precipitation occurs in the form of snow and accumulates as snowpack the soil and water assessment tool swat version 2012 usda agricultural research service usda ars 2018 neitsch et al 2011 was used to simulate watershed hydrology for the hamilton harbour the watersheds for the four tributaries were divided into 51 sub watersheds based on information pertaining to land cover soil and slope dong et al 2019 the sub watersheds in turn encompass 295 hydrologic response units hrus with each hru representing a unique land use slope and soil type combination daily instream flows were simulated from 2005 to 2015 and the first four years were used for the warm up period to phase out the impacts of uncertain initial conditions in the system the model was calibrated with observed flows from 2009 to 2012 and validated from 2013 to 2015 a multi site season specific strategy was performed for swat calibration in six discharge gauging stations three in spencer creek two in grindstone creek and one in redhill creek based on a previous sensitivity analysis exercise the curve number for antecedent runoff condition ii cn2 was determined to be one of the most sensitive swat parameters for successful streamflow simulation in hamilton harbour see table 1 in dong et al 2019 cn2 relates surface runoff to precipitation and is affected by land cover soil properties and planting harvest activities feyereisen et al 2008 because ground cover varies between growing and dormant seasons in croplands feyereisen et al 2008 we assigned different cn2 values based on two distinct multiplicative effects during the two seasons using the swat model characterization of the water cycle displayed significant spatial heterogeneity across the hamilton harbour watershed evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater rates were projected to be much higher in the catchments of spencer creek and grindstone creek where landcover is dominated by forest and pasture in contrast higher surface runoff was mainly registered in the urbanization dominant indian creek and redhill creek catchments more detailed information on the swat application to the hamilton harbour basin and the data sources employed in this study can be found in dong et al 2019 2 2 climate models the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 is a collaborative framework designed to support the assessment ofclimate change knutti and sedláček 2013 whereby an increasing number of gcms is used to predict changes in greenhouse gas concentrations or the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 the gcms predict global climate variables based on four rcp scenarios including the mitigation scenario rcp2 6 medium stabilization scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and continued emission scenario rcp8 5 the numbers associated with these rcp scenarios represent the radiative forcing 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 for mitigation medium stabilization and continued emission scenarios respectively in the year 2100 rcp4 5 the scenario with stabilized radiative forcing that is achieved through the implementation of technologies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was selected for this study twelve climate models six gcms with two downscaling methods for rcp4 5 were used to drive the calibrated swat model in the hamilton harbour watershed the downscaled projections of daily climate variables minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation come from the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic with a gridded resolution of 10 km werner et al 2019 the downscaled projections provided by pcic were calibrated based on the historically observed variables during the 1950 2005 period recognizing that the gcm models are prone to systemic error biases the two downscaling methods include i bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd murphy et al 2004 and ii bias correction constructed analogues with quantile mapping reordering bccaq murphy et al 2004 bcsd bias corrects monthly temperature and precipitation from gcms against observations using quantile mapping with the delta method similarly bccaq uses quantile mapping for bias correction with a daily rather than monthly scale detailed information on the six selected gcms and two downscaling methods is included in table 1 2 3 flow based ensemble strategy all of the selected climate projections were assembled based on the performance metrics in our study the performance of gcms is assessed against their ability to reproduce frequency distributions of observed daily flow during the swat simulation period 2009 2015 this strategy differs from the approach employed in most studies which normally focus on the ability of gcms to reproduce observed conditions of multiple climatic variables the weight of each gcm in our flow based ensemble is calculated by quantifying the discrepancies between the cdfs for simulated and observed flows 1 d c s m x s min x s max f s x s g s m x s d x s s 1 2 s m 1 2 m where s and m stand for the numbers of gauging stations and climate models respectively d c s m is the discrepancy between observed and simulated flow cdfs with the mth climate model in the sth station f s is the empirical cdf of observed daily flows in the sth station g s m is the cdf of swat simulated daily flows with the mth climate model in the ith station x s min and x s max represent the minimum and maximum observed daily flows in the sth station respectively for the convenience of calculation d c s m is estimated by dividing cdfs into several bins as follows 2 d c s m i 1 n f s x s i g s m x s i δ x s i s 1 2 s m 1 2 m 3 δ x s i x s i m a x x s i m i n x s i x s i m a x x s i m i n 2 i 1 2 n where f s and g s m are divided into n bins within the range x s min x s max in the present study n was set equal to 50 for precise representation of cdfs x s i m a x and x s i m i n are the maximum and the minimum daily flows in the ith bin δ x s i and x s i represent the width and the midpoint flow of the ith bin respectively to obtain the weight of each climate model the dc values across all the six stations should be taken into consideration 4 dc m s 1 s d c s m x s s 1 2 s m 1 2 m where x s is the average daily flow in the sth station a lower d c m value indicates that the mth climate projection can recreate more closely the empirical cdf of the registered flows and should be assigned a larger weight when assembling gcms therefore the weights of the mth climate projection w m are calculated as follows 5 w m 1 dc m m 1 2 m 6 w m w m m 1 m w m m 1 2 m the inverse of dc m is normalized to limit the value of the corresponding weight w m within the range 0 1 and m 1 m w m 1 subsequently a weighted multi model ensemble based on the monitored flows can be derived with the weights 7 as v m 1 m c m m v w m v 1 2 v where v is the number of climate variables as v is the weighted ensemble for the vth climate variable c m m v is the value of the vth climate variable for the mth individual model to recap the proposed framework provides a means for assembling climate model predictions and assessing the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology fig 1 model weights are determined from present day flow records and the weighted ensemble is then used to project changes in future climate and watershed hydrology the modelling framework consists of three steps i swat modelling with gcm projections ii evaluation of performance metrics and development of the multi model ensemble iii long term hydrological predictions with the climate ensemble and the swat model our previous research established a swat model to simulate hydrology in the hamilton harbor watersheds with monitored meteorological data dong et al 2019 the model was calibrated and validated against streamflow records obtained during 2009 2015 from six discharge stations the meteorological time series of the twelve selected climate models six gcms with two downscaling methods were inputted into the calibrated model to produce twelve daily time series of gcm based flows the weight of each gcm was calculated based on the disparity between the simulated gcm forced and empirical cdfs of daily flows during the study period 2009 2015 the 120 yr daily meteorological precipitation minimum and maximum temperature time series from the twelve climate models from 1980 to 2099 were then combined according to the flow based weights and inputted into the swat model to predict the long term hydrology of the hamilton harbour watershed in stream flow and water balance components were quantified and analyzed during three periods the reference 2000s 1980 2019 near 2040s 2020 2059 and distant future 2080s 2060 2099 periods 3 results 3 1 flow weighted climate model ensemble and evaluation against daily streamflows the present study is founded upon the recent swat application in the hamilton harbour watershed dong et al 2019 the hydrological submodel was calibrated with a season specific multi site strategy at six discharge stations in the three local tributaries spencer grindstone and redhill creeks briefly the average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values for the calibration and validation periods were determined to be 0 70 and 0 67 respectively fig s1 since hydrological models are usually regarded as satisfactory with nse 0 5 good with nse 0 65 and very good with nse 0 75 werner and cannon 2016 the original swat application to the hamilton harbour watershed is capable of providing reliable discharge predictions for the purposes of the present study however notwithstanding the good performance in reproducing historical flow discharge records 2009 2015 it should be noted that the model fit for the urbanized redhill creek was comparatively poorer nse 0 54 than the average fit for the non urban spencer nse 0 74 and grindstone creeks nse 0 72 during the calibration period this result also held true for the validation period where nse was found to be 0 48 0 69 and 0 73 in redhill spencer and grindstone creeks respectively the consistency of model fidelity between calibration and validation periods was attributed to the multi site character of the original model training exercise dong et al 2019 moreover the season specific representation of hydrological processes improved the predictive capacity relative to the conventional practice that assumes uniform parameter values over the entire simulation period dong et al 2019 in the present study we inputted the selected twelve gcm projections into the calibrated swat model and obtained simulated daily flows for the period 2009 2015 from the comparison of the cdfs for the simulated against the flows registered in the six stations fig 2 it is apparent that there are discrepancies of varying degree between the flows generated after forcing swat with the individual gcms and the six empirical cdfs see also the corresponding probability density functions in fig s2 these disparities were more pronounced with the base flows in redhill creek figs 2 and s2 reflecting the aforementioned inferior model fit and underestimation of base flow conditions in the same creek fig s1f following eqs 1 7 the weights assigned to the twelve gcm models are provided in table 1 miroc5 was given the highest weights with both bcsd 0 242 and bccaq 0 132 downscaling methods suggesting that the climatic forcing generated by that model led to a more realistic reproduction of the flow records in the hamilton harbour watershed in contrast the lowest weights were assigned to mri cgcm3 0 046 and 0 040 for bcsd and bccaq respectively which are 70 80 lower than the weights assigned to miroc5 compared to the individual gcms the weighted denoted with red lines in figs 2 and s2 and simple averaged green lines ensembles appear to improve the representation of the empirical cdfs blue lines except from redhill creek fig 2f and s2f given the consideration of different gcms with diverse daily climate projections the improved performance of the ensemble strategies stems from smoothing the variations of the twelve climatic time series fig s3 for the same reason though the extreme simulated flows were downplayed by the two ensemble strategies resulting in peak flow rates that were lying within the range delineated after forcing swat with individual gcms but were distinctly lower than those registered in the corresponding monitoring sites tables 2 and s2 while the latter result partly reflects the inability of our hydrological model to capture the magnitude of several peak flow events it is still an important point to bear in mind when evaluating the impact of climate change on hydrological extremes in the area in particular taking the downstream station of spencer creek ds as an example the top 100th percentile of the simulated flows with the weighted ensemble 24 61m3s 1 was lower by nearly 20 and 26 from its maximum counterpart 30 57m3s 1 of the twelve streamflow time series generated by the gcms and the actual value 32 40m3s 1 registered in that monitoring station respectively max gcm and observed in table 2 likewise the top percentile from the weighted ensemble 14 78m3s 1 in the downstream station in grindstone creek dg was 34 and 45 lower than its maximum counterpart 22 46m3s 1 derived from the flows projected by individual gcms and the observed flow 26 80m3s 1 respectively table 2 the same trend held true for the urban catchment redhill creek where the underestimation of the registered maximum daily flow 30 50m3s 1 was 63 and 39 for the weighted ensemble 11 40m3s 1 and the maximum individual gcm projection 18 71m3s 1 respectively in the same context the flow weighted ensemble strategy slightly outperformed the multi model average which assigned equal weights to all gcms in terms of the degree of similarity between the empirical cdfs and those recreated by the two ensembles fig 2 in particular the weighted ensemble was closer to the observed values in 38 out of 60 percentiles 10 percentiles for each station relative to the values predicted when using a simple averaged arithmetic mean climatic forcing table 2 for comparison purposes we also considered an alternative post hoc scheme that assigned the weights to the predicted flows generated by swat after being forced by the twelve gcm projections and not to the climatic series that is used to force the model notably the gcm weighted ensemble strategy displayed superior performance for all peak flows relative to the weighted or averaged flows weighted flow and average in table s2 the latter finding suggests that the post hoc weighting assigned to the predicted flows is more prone to understate hydrological extremes rather than the present approach that propagates a smoother climatic forcing through the hydrological model 3 2 evaluation of the flow weighted ensemble strategy against monthly streamflows this section tests whether our flow weighted ensemble approach can satisfactorily reproduce the monthly flow time series in the hamilton harbour watershed the predicted monthly streamflow times series during the swat calibration and validation periods 2009 2015 in the six monitoring stations are shown in fig 3 where the grey areas represent the wide range of streamflows generated by the meteorological forcing of all twelve gcms upper and lower boundaries of streamflow projections suggest that the individual gcms can overestimate atypically wet months with high streamflows and or underestimate drier months with low flow conditions by contrast the weighted and multi model average ensembles captured the mean monthly flows registered in all six gauging stations but appear to underestimate cases representing higher than usual flow conditions assessing model performance with the nse criterion reinforced the significant disparities between monthly flow records in the six monitoring stations and those derived from the meteorological forcing of the individual gcms table 3 the substantial model error was particularly evident for grindstone creek where nse values for the upstream and downstream stations varied from 1 22 to 0 46 and 1 09 to 0 35 respectively since negative nse values indicate that the model outputs are worse than the mean value of the corresponding dataset it can be inferred that most of the analyzed gcms fail to capture the monthly flow time series a notable exception was the miroc5 gcm which displayed nse 0 4 for three gauging stations and was thus assigned the highest weight when formulating the weighted ensemble the weighted ensemble led to higher nse values for each gauging station and the improved performance was particularly evident for the upstream station in spencer creek where nse increased from 0 17 to 0 38 this result also holds true for redhill creek where the weighted ensemble is the only approach aside from the swat model nse 0 51 calibrated with the actual meteorological data which displayed a positive nse 0 04 value overall notwithstanding the moderate ability to reproduce atypically high flow conditions we can infer that the flow weighted ensemble outperforms all the gcms as well as the averaged model ensemble in terms of its capacity to reproduce the monthly flow time series 3 3 long term climate streamflow projections and characterization of the water cycle based on the multi model ensemble the long term monthly minimum and maximum daily temperatures were projected to increase in the hamilton harbour basin fig s3a and b whereas there was no clear trend for the precipitation fig s3c there were also noticeable differences between the climate projections drawn from the flow weighted ensemble and multi model average in general the weighted ensemble projected lower minimum and maximum temperatures than the model average by contrast precipitation projections with the two ensemble strategies were in close proximity with each other for most of the temporal domain studied fig s3 according to the month to month variability of the weighted ensemble fig 4 a and b minimum and maximum daily temperatures were projected to gradually elevate during the near 2040s and distant 2080s future relative to the reference condition 2000s this trend was particularly evident during the early spring period when surface runoff is usually driven by snowmelt events the greatest increase of maximum temperature occurs in march when the monthly median was projected to increase by 3 5 c and 5 3 c in 2040s and 2080s relative to the reference period 5 6 c respectively table s1 similarly the medians of minimum temperature were projected to increase by 2 9 c and 4 4 c in february which represents the greatest change of minimum temperature compared to temperature precipitation projections displayed greater intra month and lower among season variability nevertheless it is evident that the precipitation during january march most of which occurred as snowfall was projected to display a long term increase 11 15 increase of the precipitation medians in 2080s interestingly the estimated increase in precipitation was temporally similar to the projections of elevated temperatures in the early spring we inputted the climate projections of the weighted ensemble into the swat model and the cdfs of the projected daily streamflows for the reference 2000s near 2040s and distant future 2080s periods are shown in fig 5 the same projections are also provided for the post hoc weighting scheme of the flows predicted from swat as well as those predicted when the model is forced by the individual gcms tables s3 s5 there were relatively distinct discrepancies between cdfs of the 2000s and 2040s which suggests a sharper shift of the flow patterns in the near future for the non urban watersheds spencer and grindstone creeks the greatest differences were registered on the frequency of moderate flows fig 5a e whereas evidence for a similar change was additionally provided for the low flow conditions in the urbanized redhill creek watershed fig 5f based on the percentile analysis table 4 the frequencies of low flow conditions 30th percentile were projected to remain stable in the long term whereas moderate or higher flow rates would distinctly increase the 50th flow percentiles were projected to increase across all monitoring sites by 14 45 and 29 64 in 2040s and 2080s from the reference period respectively table 4 generally flow estimates between the 40th and 80th percentiles displayed a gradual increase in the long term simply put compared to the reference period the prevailing flow rates or the anticipated average flow conditions will be higher during the 2040s and 2080s fig s4 by contrast the flow maxima 100th percentiles were projected to decrease in magnitude in most of the gauging stations four out of six with the most dramatic drop occurring between the 2000s to 2040s when the flow maxima reduced from 21 49 m3s 1 and 32 68 m3 s 1 to 15 76 m3s 1 and 26 03 m3s 1 at the downstream stations of spencer and grindstone creeks respectively in regards to the month to month variability fig 6 it is worth noting that the streamflow was projected to significantly increase in january and february and decrease from march to may this trend is very likely attributed to the earlier snowmelt in the winter and early spring due to the aforementioned elevated temperatures regarding the water cycle characterization our swat projections of the individual components i e precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff groundwater and soil water are suggestive of a significant level of heterogeneity across the hamilton harbour watershed fig s5 for the reference period 2000s evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater rates were much higher in non urban areas catchments surrounding spencer creek and grindstone creek compared to the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek in urban areas most of the precipitation is delivered as surface runoff rather than infiltrating into the soil profile as opposed to the prevailing patterns in non urban catchments in the upstream catchments of spencer and grindstone creeks where land cover is dominated by forest and pasture the annual evapotranspiration rate was found to be significantly higher than other areas 700 mm whereas deeper surface runoff depth 300 mm was projected in urban catchments due to lower permeability levels owing to the lower infiltration rates in the mostly urbanized redhill creek catchment the soil water content 20 mm and groundwater discharge rate 90 mm were consistently lower than other catchments 80 mm and 180 mm respectively the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration and groundwater discharge rate tends to amplify over time in 2000s the mean annual groundwater discharge rate was below 120 mm for about 80 of the sub watersheds whereas it was projected to vary between 120 mm and 251 mm in half sub watersheds by 2080s similarly the disparities of evapotranspiration among different sub watersheds were projected to be more distinct since the maximum annual evapotranspiration rate across the watershed increased from 820 mm in 2000s to 920 mm in 2080s the absolute changes in the magnitude of water balance components in the future were converted to a percent change relative to the reference period fig 7 the results showed that the sensitivity of water balance components to climate change varied spatially due to local topographic features in most areas of the non urban catchments groundwater rates are projected to increase dramatically by 16 50 in the near future with some subwatersheds demonstrating an increase 50 in the distant future on the contrary groundwater flow rates were predicted to decline in most urban areas evapotranspiration rates were projected to be slightly higher in the near future and dramatically higher in the distant future across the hamilton harbour watershed but the increase was less pronounced in the urban areas in contrast with evapotranspiration surface runoff is predicted to decrease in most areas with the exception of the downstream catchment of redhill creek although there was no clear trend with the soil water content some areas including the urban catchments and the downstream catchment of spencer creek were projected to experience increased decreased soil water content in the near distant future 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and challenges in long term hydrological projections under climate change the various typologies proposed in the literature to characterize climate model uncertainties typically identify two primary categories related to i the uncertainty inherent in the climate system and ii the uncertainty in our ability to recreate its dynamics and underlying mechanisms through our models tannert et al 2007 hawkins sutton 2009 foley 2010 giuntoli et al 2018 the former category encompasses the inherently irreducible uncertainty over human actions such as the unknown future emission concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols or type i uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 as well as the uncertainty over how the climate system is likely to respond to our actions nonetheless it is often argued that impact studies often tend to be overly optimistic about the reliability of the predictions drawn by the current generation of models but also overly pessimistic about the effects on society and their capacity to adapt blӧschl and montanari 2010 notwithstanding the challenges in predicting the future emission trajectories owing to the influence of local policies socio economic norms and development practices the present study focused on a single scenario rcp4 5 which postulated a stabilization of the greenhouse gas concentrations our results suggested that even when forced with an identical emissions scenario different gcms with diverse downscaling methods have the potential to provide fairly different outlooks of daily and monthly climatic conditions and streamflow regimes the latter range of predictions reflects either our knowledge gaps in emulating the dynamics of the climate system also known as epistemological or type iii uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 and or the stochasticity of the climate system the so called ontological or type ii uncertainty schwierz et al 2006 consistent with our results recent line of evidence not only suggests that the projected changes in the water cycle within the climate hydrology modelling framework are characterized by large spread but also that the spread from the selection of the hydrological model may be comparatively larger than that originating from climate models hagemann et al 2013 aryal et al 2019 recognizing that there is no single perfect model for climate forecasting our study employed an ensemble approach which blended forecasts from six gcms and two downscaling methods in order to improve the skill and reduce the errors associated with weather forecasts tebaldi knutti 2007 samouly et al 2018 sharma et al 2019 beigi et al 2019 the optimal type of ensemble scheme weighted versus averaged is still debatable and may lead to diverse hydrological projections although there are studies that have demonstrated minimal differences between the two ensemble techniques schmittner et al 2005 weiland et al 2012 comparing between flow based weighted and averaged model ensembles our results showed the weighted ensemble outperformed the multi model average as well as any single gcm in reproducing flow time series and associated percentiles nonetheless our analysis also showed that the two multi model ensemble strategies distinctly underestimated the extreme flow conditions registered in the six locations from a statistical point of view this result is not surprising as the distribution of flows is expected to be narrower for the model average when the predicted maxima from the individual models are not collocated in a broader context the same pattern was eloquently described by knutti et al 2010 as the loss of signal when combining solutions from multiple models that do not converge or may even display a bifurcation which leads to an average state that is not physically plausible and could be misleading thus while our study renders support to the ability of a weighted ensemble strategy to draw hydrological forecasts we caution that it may still understate as any type of multi model averaging the frequency and magnitude of flow extremes and therefore the domain that is collectively delineated by individual gcms can also provide meaningful planning information 4 2 climate change and impacts on water cycle and streamflow regimes climate variability exerts significant impacts on different facets of watershed hydrology and any changes in precipitation intensity or duration temperature antecedent soil moisture snow accumulation and melt may cause alterations in frequency and intensity of streamflow regimes depending on watershed topography and geology chang and franczyk 2008 weiland et al 2012 consistent with registered trends and long term projections for the laurentian great lakes cohen et al 2019 the hamilton harbour basin is expected to experience a distinct increase in air temperature and precipitation levels during the winter early spring period emerging consensus among many hydrological impact assessment studies suggests that the realization of the latter pattern of temperature and precipitation increase will likely result in an earlier snowmelt and changes in the magnitude and timing of peak flow events cohen et al 2019 dibike et al 2019 specifically our study projected a streamflow increase from january to february accompanied by a decrease from march to june thereby suggesting that climate change could substantially alter the streamflow regime by smoothing the sharp mid spring flow peaks and shifting the elevated flow conditions towards early spring to late winter another way to view the projected hydrological changes in the hamilton harbour watershed relates to the overall increase of peak flows for both low and high frequency events for most part of the year fig 8 b except from the period between march and june when the flow frequency curves among the reference near and distant future periods become practically indistinguishable fig 8a interestingly the highly urbanized redhill creek subwatershed displayed a decreasing pattern of the mid spring early summer peak flow events over the mid and distant future across the entire range of return periods fig 8a our results of an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and declining spring peak flows for the hamilton harbour watershed are corroborated by many recent studies investigating effects of climate change in snowmelt dominated watersheds across canada for example gombault et al 2015 used a modified version of the soil and water assessment tool swatqc to project future 2041 2070 or 2050s hydrological changes due to climate change in the pike river quebec canada the derived projections weresuggestive of a two to three fold increase in the winter streamflow relative to historical trends as well as of an earlier start of the spring floods in march rather than april whereas the simulated summer streamflows displayed a distinct decrease similar evidence of a strong potential for climate change to exacerbate seasonal water availability and flooding issues in agricultural watersheds was also provided by li et al 2016 who applied the providing regional climates for impacts studies precis model and the hydrological inference model him to the grand river watershed in southern ontario likewise o neil et al 2017 assessed changes in hydroclimatic variables between the time periods of 1971 2000 and 2050s and predicted an earlier onset of the spring freshet owing to the higher frequency of mid winter snowmelt events in western canada based on the variable infiltration capacity vic model eum et al 2017 and dibike et al 2019 similarly projected an earlier timing of the spring freshet along with an overall increase in mean annual streamflow over the athabasca river basin alberta canada interestingly the same study also showed that the river flows could experience increases during the winter and spring seasons but decreases during the summer and early fall with an overall peak flow increase especially for low frequency extreme events the potential impacts of climate change on hydrological extremes have received considerable attention as it is predicted that global warming will amplify the hydrological cycle in the form of increased cloudiness latent heat fluxes intense precipitation events and flooding huntington 2006 knapp and schwabe 2008 notwithstanding the devastating recent floods in central europe vogel 2002 the united kingdom arduino et al 2005 southern united states travis 2005 and southeast asia alam and rabbani 2007 current research has not addressed unequivocally whether or not a changing climate is responsible for these major flood events mudelsee et al 2003 in the same context though the influence of land cover changes such as deforestation and urbanization can similarly elevate the risks of excessive runoff due to reduced infiltration capacity lower soil porosity lower evapotranspiration rates and plant interception from the vegetation loss chang and franczyk 2008 however the ability to parse out the direct influence of land cover land use from the potential impacts of climate change is problematic because flow extremes are typically the result of a complex interplay among a multitude of factors such as variations in precipitation evapotranspiration watershed topography soil moisture and depth chang and franczyk 2008 eum et al 2016 farjad et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 consistent with our current paradigm of the effects of urbanization our modelling exercise showed that most of the precipitation is delivered as surface runoff in the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek rather than infiltrating into the soil profile increased impervious cover and reduced water retention capacity can clearly magnify the peak flow rates and reduce the response time to rainfall fohrer et al 2001 miller et al 2014 which is reinforced by the higher number of peak events in the hydrograph of the urbanized redhill creek as well as the stronger relationship between flow and precipitation see our fig s1f and fig 2 in wellen et al 2014a by contrast evapotranspiration soil water and groundwater flow rates are much higher in the non urban areas catchments surrounding spencer creek and grindstone creek compared to the predominately urbanized drainage areas of indian creek and redhill creek in the upstream sites of spencer and grindstone creeks where land cover is dominated by forest and pasture evapotranspiration was found to be significantly higher than other areas it is also important to note that the evapotranspiration fluxes and groundwater discharges into the local reaches derived by the present swat application are on par with the estimates reported by the combined use of the precipitation runoff modelling system with modflow for the 1989 1997 period as presented in the water budget and water quantity stress study for the halton hamilton source protection region hhsps 2010 dong et al 2019 increased temperature and changes in precipitation have the potential to affect hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration infiltration surface runoff soil moisture and groundwater discharge yin et al 2017 joseph et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 our hydrological modelling results forced by the ensemble of gcm projections show that the water balance components will respond differently to climate change and the spatial heterogeneity of evapotranspiration and groundwater will likely amplify over time along the urban to agriculture gradient in the hamilton harbour watershed based on our projections groundwater flow rates will increase in non urban catchments while a decrease will likely occur in mostly urban locations the overall evapotranspiration rates will increase across the basin but the increase is expected to be less pronounced in urban areas surface runoff will be reduced except from small pockets in the southernmost part of the watershed mainly located in the predominately urban redhill creek catchment similar insights have been gained by other attempts to understand the projected effects of climate change on hydrological processes in the laurentian great lakes for example verma et al 2015 projected a summer precipitation decline and an evapotranspiration increase in the maumee river watershed in lake erie which may be collectively responsible for a distinct river flow decline by the mid century indeed according to farjad et al 2017 the largest variations in evapotranspiration could occur in the summer modulated by the higher atmospheric demands due to higher average air temperatures as well as the increased plant leaf area interestingly du et al 2019 projected that future evapotranspiration could be responsible for approximately 10 of the water loss in the athabasca river basin but the water yield could still increase substantially 50 due to the higher precipitation and higher snowmelt runoff in fact the same study predicted a decreasing trend in the ratio of sub surface flow to total water which may increase the stream temperatures owing to the lower temperature of the sub surface runoff compared with the surface runoff du et al 2019 4 3 linking climate driven hydrological changes with water quality in the hamilton harbour the studied watershed directly influences the hamilton harbour a large embayment located at the western end of lake ontario with a long history of eutrophication problems primarily manifested as excessive algal blooms low water transparency predominance of toxic cyanobacteria and low hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations during the late summer arhonditsis et al 2018 the drastic nutrient loading reduction has historically played a central role in local restoration efforts although the determination of critical levels is a contentious issue as the population growth and increasing urbanization reinforce the need for expansion of the local wastewater treatment plants nonetheless a major confounding factor for these efforts is that the contemporary nutrient loading estimates are uncertain and appear to inadequately account for the seasonality of non point sources the role of episodic hydrological events and the potential impact of climate change kim et al 2014 long et al 2015 recent research has shown that both total phosphorus tp and phosphate loads can vary by three orders of magnitude between wet and dry conditions with storm events and spring freshets driving peak daily loads in the local urban and agricultural catchments respectively long et al 2014 moreover areal tp loads are significantly higher from the urban relative to the agricultural catchment while a significant fraction 50 of the annual phosphorus loads can be generated during a small number of brief but intense precipitation events long et al 2014 wellen et al 2014b in the same context long et al 2014 used the profound differences in weather between the 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 seasons as a window of opportunity to examine the potential impacts of climate change on water quality in the hamilton harbour taken together with the present modelling projections it was found that tp loading may change from a bimodal delivery pattern quiescent period followed by intense spring freshet in cold winters to an export characterized by intermittent nutrient fluxes during warmer winters reflective of a meteorological forcing and subsequent tributary response observed during any other time of the year recent modelling work suggests that the water quality goals for tp levels 20 μg l 1 chlorophyll a concentrations between 5 and 10 μgl 1 and water clarity 3 m can likely be met in the hamilton harbour only if the proposed phosphorus loading reduction at the level of 142 kg day 1 is realized ramin et al 2011 from a management standpoint our recent and present hydrological modelling work has allowed for the identification of the potential impacts of urbanization and climate change on watershed hydrology dong et al 2019 which should be an integral component of all the local efforts to reduce non point source phosphorus loading specifically the distinctly higher tp and phosphate concentrations during rain melt events relative to baseflow conditions underscores the importance of storm water mitigation storm water management practices such as green roofs porous pavements bioretention systems and infiltration trenches can effectively reduce peak flows by allowing rainfall to percolate into the underlying soil layer promote infiltration along with evapotranspiration control streambed scouring and transport of entrained particulate matter in runoff askarizadeh et al 2015 the potential impacts of climate change on nutrient dynamics in watersheds are likely to be experienced beyond the winter season in the area for example long et al 2014 showed that the riverine phosphate concentrations in predominantly agricultural catchments e g grindstone creek tended to be higher in summer and fall and lower in winter during low flow conditions likely due to elevated temperature dependent release from phosphorus laden riverine sediments in the same catchments summer precipitation events were also strong and ubiquitous drivers of particulate matter and nutrient export and thus the projected increase in the frequency of such events during the biologically active period could accentuate the eutrophication severity in the system gudimov et al 2011 thus while storm water mitigation is an important step to reduce storm water runoff and peak flows it is equally important to adopt practices conducive to higher precision fertilization manure application techniques and reduction of vertical stratification in the soil profile maguire et al 2018 in conclusion we presented an ensemble modelling strategy to assess the impact of climate change on watershed hydrology by weighting the projections of multiple gcms based on their performance in reproducing the observed streamflow regime the framework was used to project long term changes in the hydrology of the hamilton harbour watershed based on a previously developed swat model compared to the conventional multi model average our flow based weighted ensemble framework improved the reproduction of flow time series and empirical frequency distributions and the same results held true against any individual gcm in terms of reproducing monthly stream flows nevertheless the multi model ensembles distinctly underestimated the extreme flow conditions and thus we contend that the greater variability generated by individual gcms on the magnitude of low frequency events can still provide critical planning information our analysis reinforces the popular notion that climate change would have significant impacts on the streamflow regime in the hamilton harbour watershed based on the projections with the flow based multi model ensemble streamflow in the six gauging stations of the hamilton harbour watershed would experience an increase in the late winter early spring and a decline in the mid spring owing to elevated temperature and earlier snowmelt regarding the individual components of the water balance our modelling exercise also projected a distinct change along the urban to agriculture gradient whereby groundwater discharge could increase in agricultural catchments and experience an apparent decrease in urban settings evapotranspiration rates are projected to increase across the entire hamilton harbour watershed while surface runoff could be reduced in most areas the projected declining soil water content in the catchments of spencer and grindstone creeks highlight the likelihood of more intensified drought conditions in the croplands overall our findings suggest that the on going remediation efforts and any future planning exercise to ameliorate the prevailing water quality conditions will only be meaningful if we jointly consider the effects

spatial resolution of imerg i e 0 1 2 3 computational methods table 1 lists seven statistical metrics in which er is considered as the estimate and fr as the reference the first category consists of binary counts i e pod far and csi aiming to examine rainfall detectability the minimum rainfall rate is defined as 0 1 mm h 1 to avoid large uncertainties in light precipitation li et al 2020b tapiador et al 2020 the second category evaluates the continuous differences including the relative bias rb mean absolute difference mad root mean squared difference rmsd and the normalized rmsd rmsd norm it should be noted that the evaluation shows the relative difference between er and fr instead of the actual accuracy of er because fr also contains uncertainties 3 results 3 1 global analysis 3 1 1 rainy probabilities fig 1c and d illustrate the probability of rain for fr and the er fr difference calculated from the 20 year datasets at 0 1 spatial resolution and half hourly time scale globally er displays 5 84 of rainy probability on average which is only 0 47 lower than fr 6 37 however 91 7 of the surface of the globe shows negative differences meaning that er detects less rainfall with respect to fr over a majority of the globe the maximum rainy probabilities for both er 35 8 and fr 41 7 occur in the itcz while the minima nearly zero are located in polar regions 3 1 2 global annual rainfall average the 20 year mean annual rainfall is shown in fig 1 with fr e and er fr f the global annual rainfall average for er 1201 8 mm year 1 is 5 3 higher than fr 1141 6 mm year 1 yet the maximum annual rainfall 8867 3 mm year 1 of er is 2 8 lower 9118 9 mm year 1 likewise the maxima are located inside the itcz which is comparable with the results revealed by wang et al 2018 over oceans fig 1e features the itcz that stretches across the indian ocean and the pacific ocean in the tropics the tropical rainfall band across north america and asian continents is obvious associated with maxima in annual rainfall in addition another precipitation band extends from the subtropics to north america denoted as mid latitude storm tracks which supplies a substantial amount of rainfall to higher latitudes some coastal regions with a significant amount of rainfall are also noticeable in tropical south america middle africa and south asian islands over land some striking features with remarkable rainfall amounts are observed in the equatorial african south american and asian continental regions with a focus on the differences between er and fr the mean annual difference is about 60 1 mm year 1 and 76 0 of the grid cells display positive differences globally specifically most of the positive differences are situated in the copious rainfall regions in middle and low latitudes however negative differences tend to be prevalent in the high latitude oceans and over complex terrain the maximum annual difference of 3642 0 mm year 1 is found at sarygamysh lake 57 45 e 41 85 n in uzbekistan in the upper right subplot there er fr estimates the annual rainfall of 5310 9 1668 9 mm year 1 yet this region should not have such heavy rainfall even 1668 9 mm year 1 according to the regional climatology https www climatestotravel com climate turkmenistan it could be ascribed to the gprof algorithm that misrepresents the emissivity and temperature of water bodies on land which in turn results in systematical overestimation tian and peters lidard 2007 it is worth noting that the gauge correction in final markedly reduces systematic error ensuring its appropriateness for water resources management applications 3 1 3 statistical analysis of two decades of hourly rainfall rates fig 2 provides global maps of the statistical metrics described in table 1 the first three subplots i e a b and c show the global distribution of categorical indices i e pod far csi for precipitation detection with respect to fr overall er is comparable with fr in rainfall detection the mean pod 0 78 far 0 24 and csi 0 63 especially in wet places 1500 mm year 1 however er deviates from fr markedly in dry places 500 mm year 1 e g cold oceanic regions sahara desert in north africa tibetan plateau middle east and us rocky mountains where pod is below 0 6 and far is above 0 5 previous studies e g mahmoud et al 2018 also showed relatively poor detection below 0 6 of er against ground observations in the middle east in these regions er possibly suffers from fractional coverage issues due to the lower availability of pmw estimates and their associated use in backward morphing according to the morphing techniques described by joyce et al 2004 it is also likely that er misses rainfall events as it measures zero rainfall rate at the beginning t 0 h and then no rainfall value is propagated to the next half hour t 0 5 h if only using forward morphing however it is possible that the subsequent overpass t 0 5 h measures a nonzero value and then the backward morphing will make up the value at t 0 5 h on the other hand the estimated grid cell is unlikely to be reset to zero if the origin already has an initial rainfall value therefore the morphing difference forward morphing in er compared to two way morphing in fr likely leads to more misses which is reflected in the pod statistic for precipitation quantification with respect to fr the overall rb 0 12 is significant on average over the globe and er measures slightly higher rainfall over 71 9 of the earth s surface fig 2d notably the maximum rb 1264 1 is found in the chugach mountains 140 55 w 60 15 n near the gulf of alaska precipitation generally falls as snow here and also receives orographic enhancement which are possible fundamental factors explaining the er and fr discrepancies in addition the availability of pmw data is more limited in high latitudes because of masked snowy and icy surfaces which challenges the morphing schemes as well the globally averaged mad and rmsd is not negligible with values of 0 87 1 82 mm h 1 compared with the average rainfall rate of 2 61 mm h 1 as these two metrics are highly correlated with the rainfall rate huffman 1997 they are markedly scaled by large rainfall rates alternatively the corresponding normalized rmsd rmsd norm becomes useful for further investigation the global mean value of rmsd norm is 0 93 which is broken down as 1 09 over land surfaces and 0 84 over oceans it suggests higher differences between er and fr over land due to the use of gauge adjustments similar to the performance of categorical indices large rmsd norm 2 values are exhibited in arid regions e g cold oceans and deserts 3 2 meridional analysis fig 3 depicts the latitudinal distribution grouped by every 10 latitudinal band of rainy samples and annual rainfall amounts in general er and fr perform similarly across latitudes er detects less rainy samples than fr systematically across all latitudes the rb of rainy samples is almost symmetric which peaks in the poles 0 12 and then gradually improves to 0 04 in the 30 60 n s band followed by another peak in the tropics 0 06 as speculated previously the difference is possibly ascribed to the morphing differences because the forward only morphing er possibly misses rainfall events regarding mean annual rainfall er 1025 mm year 1 estimates 5 6 more annual rainfall than fr 982 mm year 1 which is similar to the globally averaged difference 5 3 moreover large discrepancies are found in low latitudes within the 30 n s band in which er estimates mean annual rainfall amounts of 1429 9 mm year 1 which is about 9 higher than fr 1326 7 mm year 1 within 60 n s the rb for rainfall amount increases to a peak at 30 n and 30 s 0 1 and then decreases in the tropics 0 05 finally outside of 60 n s the rb peaks for both rainy occurrences and rainfall amounts which can be explained by the different numerical weather models used to provide cloud motion vectors and also the divergence between spps behrangi et al 2016 tan et al 2019b 3 3 earth surface based analysis the performance of er and fr with regard to three earth surface types i e land ocean and coast are evaluated and intercompared at hourly time scale in fig 4 in terms of systematic bias the mode of rb for rainy samples is ranked in the order of inland 6 88 coast 6 42 and ocean 5 31 in fig 4a on average the land surface exhibits higher bias 16 7 compared to oceanic 5 21 and coastal 7 05 regions this ranking still holds for the rb of rainfall amounts with land 5 49 coast 2 14 and ocean 0 05 in fig 4b concerning instantaneous discrepancies even though the mode of rmsd in fig 4c is ranked slightly differently with land 2 38 mm h 1 ocean 2 18 mm h 1 and coast 2 06 mm h 1 the coast still yields the largest range 2 7 mm h 1 compared to land 2 06 mm h 1 and ocean 2 10 mm h 1 the above results are somewhat anticipated because oceans have more homogenous surfaces while land areas have more diverse features in terms of topography surface roughness and land cover heterogeneity kim et al 2017 sharifi et al 2016 these features complicate precipitation patterns and their retrievals which ultimately magnifies the differences see section 3 4 1 the difference in coastal regions is described by the algorithmic transition between land and oceanic surfaces gruber et al 2000 tapiador et al 2020 in addition one can witness that the rmsd for both ocean and coast are bimodal with one mode inside the 30 n s band rmsd 1 7 mm h 1 for ocean and 1 5 mm h 1 for coast and the other mode outside the 60 n s band rmsd 0 8 mm h 1 for ocean and 0 5 mm h 1 for coast within the 30 n s band the peak of rmsd is associated with increased precipitation e g warm oceans outside 60 n s the difference is again attributed to the different numerical weather models utilized as previously mentioned and potentially more pmw estimates in fr towards high latitudes 3 4 land based analysis 3 4 1 elevation the systematic bias of satellite precipitation products over high elevations is attributed to sensor limitations precipitation type retrieval algorithms and temporal sampling hashemi et al 2017 2020 all these issues propagate to imerg estimates fr and er adopt different approaches to derive cloud motion vectors from total precipitable water vapor merra 2 for fr and geos fp for er tan et al 2019b and such differences in methodology are highly impacted by orography in addition to that er potentially infuses more ir based precipitation estimates than fr which is hypothesized to condition differences on different elevations fig 5 shows the rb of rainy samples and precipitation amounts as functions of elevation the general trend of rb for rainy samples decreases from nearly 0 to 0 2 with increasing elevation from 0 to 5500 m overall the rainy samples detected by er is 11 2 lower than fr on average and the rb 0 21 peaks at the elevation range from 4500 to 5000 m notably above 2000 m each bin shows negative biases with 75 of the samples suggesting a significant uncertainty of rainfall detection in high elevations for the annual precipitation amount the mean rb is 0 06 overall indicating that er generally estimates less annual precipitation than fr the rb gradually decreases from 0 2 to 0 3 going from 500 m to 4500 m followed by a slight increase at the highest elevations 4500 m this behavior is similar to the study of hashemi et al 2020 in which a positive bias is found below 2000 m and then the bias transitions to a negative value above that it is worth noting that the rb of precipitation amounts and rainy samples covary positively with elevation suggesting that the systematic bias is possibly due to the missed events caused by forward only morphing in er given the context of this study we focus mainly on the intercomparison of similarity and difference exposed in merged products as for the impact of ir estimates one can analyse it by isolating ir only precipitation from the merged products also other root causes are worth exploring for an independent research topic 3 4 2 continents since fr bears less uncertainty in places with rain gauges i e the gauge density in the gpcc it is worth exploring the differences between er and fr with respect to available gauges the rmsd field of the imerg product is aggregated to 0 5 to match the gpcc resolution fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of the gpcc gauges it is visually discernable that europe has the densest gauge networks of all continents with as many as 40 gauges inside one grid box on the other hand africa and south america exhibit more sparsely distributed gauge networks fig 6b illustrates the rmsd as a function of gauge numbers within each grid box compared to pixels with no gauges pixels containing at least one gauge exhibit higher differences highlighting the effect of the gauge based correction that was applied also notably increasing the number of gauges in each pixel reduces the interquartile range iqr of the rmsd the exception to this result is the bin with 20 gauges per pixel but the sample size is much smaller therefore higher gauge numbers in a pixel tend to reduce the uncertainty and stabilize the bias correction fig 7 exhibits the rmsd grouped by continents fig 7a shows the spatial distributions of rmsd and fig 7b reveals the gauge density in each continent obtained from gpcc standardized by the maximum the standardized gauge density in each continent is ranked in the following order europe asia north america australia africa and south america for the rmsd the instantaneous differences between er and fr are ranked as follows africa 2 82 mm h 1 australia 2 76 mm h 1 south america 2 42 mm h 1 asia 2 42 mm h 1 north america 2 40 mm h 1 and europe 2 16 mm h 1 moreover the iqr for rmsd shows that north america has the smallest uncertainties while australia has the largest ones the iqrs in other continents are relatively similar combining the rmsd and gauge density as in a taylor plot fig 7b europe stands out to be the top continent to be able to take advantage of er products for research and operations beyond that the americas and asia could also be suitable continents for applying such er products unfortunately the continent of africa that needs satellite data the most for flood alerting and water resource management suffers the most from large discrepancies and low gauge densities even though it does not imply er is not suitable in these regions further attentions should be drawn when using er for applications 3 4 3 climates fig 8 depicts the normalized instantaneous hourly difference rmsd norm for different climates according to the köppen geiger classifications fig 8a shows the distribution of rmsd norm and fig 8b complements it with standardized gauge densities the mean rmsd norms are ranked according to the following climates arid 1 86 warm climate 1 21 equatorial 1 16 and snow 1 16 and polar 0 91 as a result arid regions like north africa and the middle east have the largest instantaneous differences when considering temperatures the rmsd norms are then ranked in the following order hot arid 1 90 cold arid 1 79 extremely continental 1 67 hot summer 1 11 cold summer 1 07 and polar 0 87 therefore in general arid regions with higher temperatures i e hot arid regions exhibit the highest instantaneous differences this is likely due to the effect of sub cloud evaporation causing large discrepancies between the remote sensing estimates and in situ observations which lowers fr estimates from the initial er values additionally the forward only morphing in er may miss the short duration rainfall events common in arid environments since most of the gauge networks are located in warm temperate regions hot arid and cold snow regions remain the most problematic regimes for the gpm era 3 5 precipitation extremes extreme precipitation is defined here as rainfall rates in the 99th percentile during the twenty year time period at each grid cell liu and zipser 2015 notably imerg precipitation rates are capped to a maximum of 120 mm h 1 in the current 06b version which is likely to impact this extreme event analysis skofronick jackson et al 2017 due to the aforementioned fact that fr is heavily dependent on the gauge densities the extreme precipitation rates captured by fr may not be homogenous fig 9 a depicts the extreme rainfall rate analysis for er and fr with the corresponding conditional differences er estimates a globally averaged extreme rainfall rate of 12 1 mm h 1 which is 33 0 higher than fr 9 1 mm h 1 while in contrast to previous results that the location with maximum annual rainfall occurs at the same place for er and fr the maximum extreme rainfall rates are more distant the maximum for er 60 0 mm h 1 occurs in the arabian sea 57 4 e 10 5 n while fr 52 1 mm h 1 is near mount hubbard 138 3 w 59 9 n in fact the location of the maximum extreme rainfall rate estimated by fr is adjacent to the location with the maximum rb of annual rainfall in the gulf of alaska instead of overestimation rb 0 of er in terms of annual rainfall average worldwide the conditional rb rb cond in extreme events is trivial 0 08 though with 80 of the grid cells showing negative rb cond this indicates the comparable performance of er and fr in capturing the extreme rainfall rates the maximum rb cond 30 3 is obtained in egypt 30 5 n 26 0 e surrounded by deserts this finding aligns well with previous results i e climate zone analysis of large differences in arid regimes moreover the conditioned rmsd rmsd cond over the globe is 4 87 mm h 1 while the maximum 24 7 mm h 1 observed at 84 7 e 27 8 n is in a mountainous region this is again likely caused by the misrepresentation of orographic precipitation as discussed in section 3 4 1 4 conclusions this study presents a 20 yr intercomparison of gpm imerg early run er and final run fr precipitation products these products are compared globally and regionally with a focus on the following three aspects 1 precipitation climatology for water resource management 2 instantaneous rainfall rate differences for general hydrometeorology and 3 hydrological extremes for flood hazards regarding precipitation climatology the similarities and differences of rain detection and mean annual rainfall amount are evaluated first er detects less rainy samples than fr over 79 6 of the grid cells leading to an overall 8 4 under detection in relation to fr however er has higher mean annual rainfall amounts in 71 9 of the grid cells yielding an average 12 0 higher amount over land the relative bias 16 7 is slightly exacerbated due to the diverse terrain that impacts precipitation dynamics and the emitted brightness temperatures the instantaneous rainfall rate differences between er and fr are higher over land with rmsd and rmsd norm 2 38 mm h 1and 1 09 than ocean surfaces 2 18 mm h 1and 0 84 this is again likely due to the heterogeneity of the land cover and terrain when examining differences over continents er exhibits the most similarities with fr in europe with the lowest rmsd 2 16 mm h 1 where the rain gauge densities are highest meanwhile over africa a continent in need of satellite data for its flood alert and water resources management systems suffers from the largest rmsd 2 82 mm h 1 regarding climate zones hot arid regions rmsd norm 1 86 and cold snow regions rmsd norm 1 16 remain the most problematic places for the gpm era algorithms we also found in this study that grid boxes containing gauges have higher differences than those grid cells containing no gauges highlighting the effect of the gauge based correction that was applied for extreme precipitation i e the top 1 the globally averaged rainfall rate for er 12 1 mm h 1 is 33 0 higher than with fr 9 1 mm h 1 in contrast to mean rainfall estimates the rb conditioned on extreme events shows that er slightly measures less intense rainfall over the globe the similarities and differences revealed in this study can provide a broad overview of the circumstances for using er first in long range simulations i e decadal annual scale er is biased and some statistical bias correction methods should be applied prior to use second for mid range simulations i e monthly weekly scale er can be conditionally applied in regions that have acceptable instantaneous differences e g europe cold regions lastly for short range simulations daily hourly scale er is appropriate for hydrometeorological applications such as the early warning or alerting of precipitation induced hazards future events based studies aided by hydrologic modeling are necessary to examine the flood prediction capabilities of er versus fr

4868,precipitation is an essential climate and forcing variable for modeling the global water cycle particularly the recent integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg product retrospectively provides an unprecedented two decades of high resolution satellite precipitation estimates the primary goal of this study is to examine the similarities and differences between the two latest and also arguably the most popular gpm imerg early and final run er and fr products across the globe the results reveal that 1 er systematically estimates 12 0 higher annual rainfall than fr particularly over land 16 7 2 er and fr show significant differences in instantaneous rates root mean squared difference rmsd 2 38 mm h 1 and normalized rmsd rmsd norm 1 09 especially in africa rmsd 2 40 mm h 1 and hot arid regions rmsd norm 1 11 but less so in europe rmsd 2 16 mm h 1 and cold areas rmsd norm 0 87 and 3 er measures 33 0 higher extreme rainfall rates than fr over the globe the exploration of their similarities and differences provides a first order global assessment of various hydrological utilities fr is designed to be more suitable for retrospective hydroclimatology and water resource applications while the earliest available er product though not bias corrected by rain gauges still shows potential utility for operational modeling of rainfall triggered hazards the findings of this study can provide an assessment to product developers and broader data users and practitioners to address the inherent issues in hardware limitations retrieval algorithms and uncertainty

gauge analyses and potentially other precipitation estimators at fine time and space scales over the entire globe in order to accommodate various requirements for latency and accuracy three products are systematically generated tan et al 2019a the first two are near real time nrt products denoted as imerg early run er 4 h latency and late run lr 14 h latency with more data available given the

products are summarized in tan et al 2019b despite imerg being a state of the art spp numerous users e g research communities and operational agencies oftentimes face many unanswered questions and lack clear guidance to the best of our knowledge previous works of comparing the imerg three stage products are either temporally short or localized o et al 2017 evaluated the performance of the three products referenced to two dense gauge networks in southeastern austria and found the accuracy is ranked as follows fr lr er wang et al 2017 compared the three datasets with a hydrologic evaluation in a small beijing river basin in china and they demonstrated that fr exhibits the best overall statistical performance with respect to ground rain gauges and streamflow gauges omranian and sharif 2018b similarly found that fr has better performance than er and lr in the lower colorado river basin mahmoud et al 2018 performed station based event evaluation for the three products in saudi arabia and highlighted that fr performs best in summary fr generally outperforms er and lr in terms of accuracy based on local case studies mainly due to rain gauge adjustments however a comprehensive examination of the differences between er and fr is still lacking from the perspectives of hydroclimatology hydrometeorology and hydrological extremes especially in its full lifespan of data availability on a global basis the overarching goal of this study is to systematically investigate the similarity and difference between the gpm imerg early and final run products over the globe for the last two decades their similarities and differences are revealed from three aspects 1 precipitation climatology 2 instantaneous precipitation rates and 3 extreme precipitation events which hopefully can provide valuable information for applications in the fields of hydroclimatology hydrometeorology and disaster monitoring and early warning this study s findings and feedbacks will further motivate product developers to implement algorithmic corrections to address the inherent problems of imerg early run in order to maximize its joint advantages in both latency and accuracy this

1 spatial resolution at a half hourly time interval in the following sections study areas include the globe as a whole and are further broken down into land vs ocean surface over land the areas are studied from the perspective of continents elevations and climate zones it is worth noting that the characteristics of rainfall over land are more diverse than the ocean as land surfaces have more complicated terrain and influences on the generation of precipitation kim et al 2017 sharifi et al 2016 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 imergs in this study the latest imerg version 06b er and fr are used for

over er mazzoglio et al 2019 the full lifespan of data availability for er and fr is depicted in fig 1 a and b in which nearly 100 of data are available within 60 n s outside of it only partial data can be utilized due to the infrequent sampling and lack of ir measurements and also the snowy icy regions are completely masked out as described in the technical documentation huffman et al 2019b tan et al 2019b a minimum of 40 of the total data length is set as a threshold to filter out regions mostly outside 60 n s and to maintain consistent statistical significance of the results 2 2 2 earth

is made from three sources nasa s space shuttle canada s radarsat satellite and topographic maps made by the u s geological survey it comes with the same spatial resolution as imerg data namely 0 1 as a part of this study is to investigate the impact of climatologies on the differences between er and fr the modern climate köppen geiger classification is adopted from http koeppen geiger vu wien ac at which has also been verified by the global prediction climatology center gpcc and applied to evaluate global climates and regionalization santini and di paola 2015 yang et al 2020 this classification is based on five main climate categories equatorial arid warm temperate snow and polar furthermore the sub categories are based on atmospheric conditions according to the regional humidity and temperatures 2 2 3 auxiliary datasets the gpcc product used by imerg fr to perform monthly gauge corrections at 1 spatial resolution is retrieved from https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcc html the gpcc product provides the number of gauges inside each pixel at spatial resolutions of 0 5 1 and 2 5 in this study the 0 5 one is selected as it is the closest to the spatial resolution of imerg i e 0 1 2 3 computational methods table 1 lists seven statistical metrics in which er is considered as the estimate and fr as the reference the first category consists of binary counts i e pod far and csi aiming to examine rainfall detectability the minimum rainfall rate is defined as 0 1 mm h 1 to avoid large uncertainties in light precipitation li et al 2020b tapiador et al 2020 the second category evaluates the continuous differences including the relative bias rb mean absolute difference mad root mean squared difference rmsd and the normalized rmsd rmsd norm it should be noted that the evaluation shows the relative difference between er and fr instead of the actual accuracy of er because fr also contains uncertainties 3 results 3 1 global analysis 3 1 1 rainy probabilities fig 1c and d illustrate the probability of rain for fr and the er fr difference calculated from the 20 year datasets at 0 1 spatial resolution and half hourly time scale globally er displays 5 84 of rainy probability on average which is only 0 47 lower than fr 6 37 however 91 7 of the surface of the globe shows negative differences meaning that er detects less rainfall with respect to fr over a majority of the globe the maximum rainy probabilities for both er 35 8 and fr 41 7 occur in the itcz while the minima nearly zero are located in polar regions 3 1 2 global annual rainfall average the 20 year mean annual rainfall is shown in fig 1 with fr e and er fr f the global annual rainfall average for er 1201 8 mm year 1 is 5 3 higher than fr 1141 6 mm year 1 yet the maximum annual rainfall 8867 3 mm year 1 of er is 2 8 lower 9118 9 mm year 1 likewise the maxima are located inside the itcz which is comparable with the results revealed by wang et al 2018 over oceans fig 1e features the itcz that stretches across the indian ocean and the pacific ocean in the tropics the tropical rainfall band across north america and asian continents is obvious associated with maxima in annual rainfall in addition another precipitation band extends from the subtropics to north america denoted as mid latitude storm tracks which supplies a substantial amount of rainfall to higher latitudes some coastal regions with a significant amount of rainfall are also noticeable in tropical south america middle africa and south asian islands over land some striking features with remarkable rainfall amounts are observed in the equatorial african south american and asian continental regions with a focus on the differences between er and fr the mean annual difference is about 60 1 mm year 1 and 76 0 of the grid cells display positive differences globally specifically most of the positive differences are situated in the copious rainfall regions in middle and low latitudes however negative differences tend to be prevalent in the high latitude oceans and over complex terrain the maximum annual difference of 3642 0 mm year 1 is found at sarygamysh lake 57 45 e 41 85 n in uzbekistan in the upper right subplot there er fr estimates the annual rainfall of 5310 9 1668 9 mm year 1 yet this region should not have such heavy rainfall even 1668 9 mm year 1 according to the regional climatology https www climatestotravel com climate turkmenistan it could be ascribed to the gprof algorithm that misrepresents the emissivity and temperature of water bodies on land which in turn results in systematical overestimation tian and peters lidard 2007 it is worth noting that the gauge correction in final markedly reduces systematic error ensuring its appropriateness for water resources management applications 3 1 3 statistical analysis of two decades of hourly rainfall rates fig 2 provides global maps of the statistical metrics described in table 1 the first three subplots i e a b and c show the global distribution of categorical indices i e pod far csi for precipitation detection with respect to fr overall er is comparable with fr in rainfall detection the mean pod 0 78 far 0 24 and csi 0 63 especially in wet places 1500 mm year 1 however er deviates from fr markedly in dry places 500 mm year 1 e g cold oceanic regions sahara desert in north africa tibetan plateau middle east and us rocky mountains where pod is below 0 6 and far is above 0 5 previous studies e g mahmoud et al 2018 also showed relatively poor detection below 0 6 of er against ground observations in the middle east in these regions er possibly suffers from fractional coverage issues due to the lower availability of pmw estimates and their associated use in backward morphing according to the morphing techniques described by joyce et al 2004 it is also likely that er misses rainfall events as it measures zero rainfall rate at the beginning t 0 h and then no rainfall value is propagated to the next half hour t 0 5 h if only using forward morphing however it is possible that the subsequent overpass t 0 5 h measures a nonzero value and then the backward morphing will make up the value at t 0 5 h on the other hand the estimated grid cell is unlikely to be reset to zero if the origin already has an initial rainfall value therefore the morphing difference forward morphing in er compared to two way morphing in fr likely leads to more misses which is reflected in the pod statistic for precipitation quantification with respect to fr the overall rb 0 12 is significant on average over the globe and er measures slightly higher rainfall over 71 9 of the earth s surface fig 2d notably the maximum rb 1264 1 is found in the chugach mountains 140 55 w 60 15 n near the gulf of alaska precipitation generally falls as snow here and also receives orographic enhancement which are possible fundamental factors explaining the er and fr discrepancies in addition the availability of pmw data is more limited in high latitudes because of masked snowy and icy surfaces which challenges the morphing schemes as well the globally averaged mad and rmsd is not negligible with values of 0 87 1 82 mm h 1 compared with the average rainfall rate of 2 61 mm h 1 as these two metrics are highly correlated with the rainfall rate huffman 1997 they are markedly scaled by large rainfall rates alternatively the corresponding normalized rmsd rmsd norm becomes useful for further investigation the global mean value of rmsd norm is 0 93 which is broken down as 1 09 over land surfaces and 0 84 over oceans it suggests higher differences between er and fr over land due to the use of gauge adjustments similar to the performance of categorical indices large rmsd norm 2 values are exhibited in arid regions e g cold oceans and deserts 3 2 meridional analysis fig 3 depicts the latitudinal distribution grouped by every 10 latitudinal band of rainy samples and annual rainfall amounts in general er and fr perform similarly across latitudes er detects less rainy samples than fr systematically across all latitudes the rb of rainy samples is almost symmetric which peaks in the poles 0 12 and then gradually improves to 0 04 in the 30 60 n s band followed by another peak in the tropics 0 06 as speculated previously the difference is possibly ascribed to the morphing differences because the forward only morphing er possibly misses rainfall events regarding mean annual rainfall er 1025 mm year 1 estimates 5 6 more annual rainfall than fr 982 mm year 1 which is similar to the globally averaged difference 5 3 moreover large discrepancies are found in low latitudes within the 30 n s band in which er estimates mean annual rainfall amounts of 1429 9 mm year 1 which is about 9 higher than fr 1326 7 mm year 1 within 60 n s the rb for rainfall amount increases to a peak at 30 n and 30 s 0 1 and then decreases in the tropics 0 05 finally outside of 60 n s the rb peaks for both rainy occurrences and rainfall amounts which can be explained by the different numerical weather models used to provide cloud motion vectors and also the divergence between spps behrangi et al 2016 tan et al 2019b 3 3 earth surface based analysis the performance of er and fr with regard to three earth surface types i e land ocean and coast are evaluated and intercompared at hourly time scale in fig 4 in terms of systematic bias the mode of rb for rainy samples is ranked in the order of inland 6 88 coast 6 42 and ocean 5 31 in fig 4a on average the land surface exhibits higher bias 16 7 compared to oceanic 5 21 and coastal 7 05 regions this ranking still holds for the rb of rainfall amounts with land 5 49 coast 2 14 and ocean 0 05 in fig 4b concerning instantaneous discrepancies even though the mode of rmsd in fig 4c is ranked slightly differently with land 2 38 mm h 1 ocean 2 18 mm h 1 and coast 2 06 mm h 1 the coast still yields the largest range 2 7 mm h 1 compared to land 2 06 mm h 1 and ocean 2 10 mm h 1 the above results are somewhat anticipated because oceans have more homogenous surfaces while land areas have more diverse features in terms of topography surface roughness and land cover heterogeneity kim et al 2017 sharifi et al 2016 these features complicate precipitation patterns and their retrievals which ultimately magnifies the differences see section 3 4 1 the difference in coastal regions is described by the algorithmic transition between land and oceanic surfaces gruber et al 2000 tapiador et al 2020 in addition one can witness that the rmsd for both ocean and coast are bimodal with one mode inside the 30 n s band rmsd 1 7 mm h 1 for ocean and 1 5 mm h 1 for coast and the other mode outside the 60 n s band rmsd 0 8 mm h 1 for ocean and 0 5 mm h 1 for coast within the 30 n s band the peak of rmsd is associated with increased precipitation e g warm oceans outside 60 n s the difference is again attributed to the different numerical weather models utilized as previously mentioned and potentially more pmw estimates in fr towards high latitudes 3 4 land based analysis 3 4 1 elevation the systematic bias of satellite precipitation products over high elevations is attributed to sensor limitations precipitation type retrieval algorithms and temporal sampling hashemi et al 2017 2020 all these issues propagate to imerg estimates fr and er adopt different approaches to derive cloud motion vectors from total precipitable water vapor merra 2 for fr and geos fp for er tan et al 2019b and such differences in methodology are highly impacted by orography in addition to that er potentially infuses more ir based precipitation estimates than fr which is hypothesized to condition differences on different elevations fig 5 shows the rb of rainy samples and precipitation amounts as functions of elevation the general trend of rb for rainy samples decreases from nearly 0 to 0 2 with increasing elevation from 0 to 5500 m overall the rainy samples detected by er is 11 2 lower than fr on average and the rb 0 21 peaks at the elevation range from 4500 to 5000 m notably above 2000 m each bin shows negative biases with 75 of the samples suggesting a significant uncertainty of rainfall detection in high elevations for the annual precipitation amount the mean rb is 0 06 overall indicating that er generally estimates less annual precipitation than fr the rb gradually decreases from 0 2 to 0 3 going from 500 m to 4500 m followed by a slight increase at the highest elevations 4500 m this behavior is similar to the study of hashemi et al 2020 in which a positive bias is found below 2000 m and then the bias transitions to a negative value above that it is worth noting that the rb of precipitation amounts and rainy samples covary positively with elevation suggesting that the systematic bias is possibly due to the missed events caused by forward only morphing in er given the context of this study we focus mainly on the intercomparison of similarity and difference exposed in merged products as for the impact of ir estimates one can analyse it by isolating ir only precipitation from the merged products also other root causes are worth exploring for an independent research topic 3 4 2 continents since fr bears less uncertainty in places with rain gauges i e the gauge density in the gpcc it is worth exploring the differences between er and fr with respect to available gauges the rmsd field of the imerg product is aggregated to 0 5 to match the gpcc resolution fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of the gpcc gauges it is visually discernable that europe has the densest gauge networks of all continents with as many as 40 gauges inside one grid box on the other hand africa and south america exhibit more sparsely distributed gauge networks fig 6b illustrates the rmsd as a function of gauge numbers within each grid box compared to pixels with no gauges pixels containing at least one gauge exhibit higher differences highlighting the effect of the gauge based correction that was applied also notably increasing the number of gauges in each pixel reduces the interquartile range iqr of the rmsd the exception to this result is the bin with 20 gauges per pixel but the sample size is much smaller therefore higher gauge numbers in a pixel tend to reduce the uncertainty and stabilize the bias correction fig 7 exhibits the rmsd grouped by continents fig 7a shows the spatial distributions of rmsd and fig 7b reveals the gauge density in each continent obtained from gpcc standardized by the maximum the standardized gauge density in each continent is ranked in the following order europe asia north america australia africa and south america for the rmsd the instantaneous differences between er and fr are ranked as follows africa 2 82 mm h 1 australia 2 76 mm h 1 south america 2 42 mm h 1 asia 2 42 mm h 1 north america 2 40 mm h 1 and europe 2 16 mm h 1 moreover the iqr for rmsd shows that north america has the smallest uncertainties while australia has the largest ones the iqrs in other continents are relatively similar combining the rmsd and gauge density as in a taylor plot fig 7b europe stands out to be the top continent to be able to take advantage of er products for research and operations beyond that the americas and asia could also be suitable continents for applying such er products unfortunately the continent of africa that needs satellite data the most for flood alerting and water resource management suffers the most from large discrepancies and low gauge densities even though it does not imply er is not suitable in these regions further attentions should be drawn when using er for applications 3 4 3 climates fig 8 depicts the normalized instantaneous hourly difference rmsd norm for different climates according to the köppen geiger classifications fig 8a shows the distribution of rmsd norm and fig 8b complements it with standardized gauge densities the mean rmsd norms are ranked according to the following climates arid 1 86 warm climate 1 21 equatorial 1 16 and snow 1 16 and polar 0 91 as a result arid regions like north africa and the middle east have the largest instantaneous differences when considering temperatures the rmsd norms are then ranked in the following order hot arid 1 90 cold arid 1 79 extremely continental 1 67 hot summer 1 11 cold summer 1 07 and polar 0 87 therefore in general arid regions with higher temperatures i e hot arid regions exhibit the highest instantaneous differences this is likely due to the effect of sub cloud evaporation causing large discrepancies between the remote sensing estimates and in situ observations which lowers fr estimates from the initial er values additionally the forward only morphing in er may miss the short duration rainfall events common in arid environments since most of the gauge networks are located in warm temperate regions hot arid and cold snow regions remain the most problematic regimes for the gpm era 3 5 precipitation extremes extreme precipitation is defined here as rainfall rates in the 99th percentile during the twenty year time period at each grid cell liu and zipser 2015 notably imerg precipitation rates are capped to a maximum of 120 mm h 1 in the current 06b version which is likely to impact this extreme event analysis skofronick jackson et al 2017 due to the aforementioned fact that fr is heavily dependent on the gauge densities the extreme precipitation rates captured by fr may not be homogenous fig 9 a depicts the extreme rainfall rate analysis for er and fr with the corresponding conditional differences er estimates a globally averaged extreme rainfall rate of 12 1 mm h 1 which is 33 0 higher than fr 9 1 mm h 1 while in contrast to previous results that the location with maximum annual rainfall occurs at the same place for er and fr the maximum extreme rainfall rates are more distant the maximum for er 60 0 mm h 1 occurs in the arabian sea 57 4 e 10 5 n while fr 52 1 mm h 1 is near mount hubbard 138 3 w 59 9 n in fact the location of the maximum extreme rainfall rate estimated by fr is adjacent to the location with the maximum rb of annual rainfall in the gulf of alaska instead of overestimation rb 0 of er in terms of annual rainfall average worldwide the conditional rb rb cond in extreme events is trivial 0 08 though with 80 of the grid cells showing negative rb cond this indicates the comparable performance of er and fr in capturing the extreme rainfall rates the maximum rb cond 30 3 is obtained in egypt 30 5 n 26 0 e surrounded by deserts this finding aligns well with previous results i e climate zone analysis of large differences in arid regimes moreover the conditioned rmsd rmsd cond over the globe is 4 87 mm h 1 while the maximum 24 7 mm h 1 observed at 84 7 e 27 8 n is in a mountainous region this is again likely caused by the misrepresentation of orographic precipitation as discussed in section 3 4 1 4 conclusions this study presents a 20 yr intercomparison of gpm imerg early run er and final run fr precipitation products these products are compared globally and regionally with a focus on the following three aspects 1 precipitation climatology for water resource management 2 instantaneous rainfall rate differences for general hydrometeorology and 3 hydrological extremes for flood hazards regarding precipitation climatology the similarities and differences of rain detection and mean annual rainfall amount are evaluated first er detects less rainy samples than fr over 79 6 of the grid cells leading to an overall 8 4 under detection in relation to fr however er has higher mean annual rainfall amounts in 71 9 of the grid cells yielding an average 12 0 higher amount over land the relative bias 16 7 is slightly exacerbated due to the diverse terrain that impacts precipitation dynamics and the emitted brightness temperatures the instantaneous rainfall rate differences between er and fr are higher over land with rmsd and rmsd norm 2 38 mm h 1and 1 09 than ocean surfaces 2 18 mm h 1and 0 84 this is again likely due to the heterogeneity of the land cover and terrain when examining differences over continents er exhibits the most similarities with fr in europe with the lowest rmsd 2 16 mm h 1 where the rain gauge densities are highest meanwhile over africa a continent in need of satellite data for its flood alert and water resources management systems suffers from the largest rmsd 2 82 mm h 1 regarding climate zones hot arid regions rmsd norm 1 86 and cold snow regions rmsd norm 1 16 remain the most problematic places for the gpm era algorithms we also found in this study that grid boxes containing gauges have higher differences than those grid cells containing no gauges highlighting the effect of the gauge based correction that was applied for extreme precipitation i e the top 1 the globally averaged rainfall rate for er 12 1 mm h 1 is 33 0 higher than with fr 9 1 mm h 1 in contrast to mean rainfall estimates the rb conditioned on extreme events shows that er slightly measures less intense rainfall over the globe the similarities and differences revealed in this study can provide a broad overview of the circumstances for using er first in long range simulations i e decadal annual scale er is biased and some statistical bias correction methods should be applied prior to use second for mid range simulations i e monthly weekly scale er can be conditionally applied in regions that have acceptable instantaneous differences e g europe cold regions lastly for short range simulations daily hourly scale er is appropriate for hydrometeorological applications such as the early warning or alerting of precipitation induced hazards future events based studies aided by hydrologic modeling are necessary to examine the flood prediction capabilities of er versus fr

4869,this study proposed a novel double machine learning dml approach to merge multiple satellite based precipitation products spps and gauge observations and tested its reliability and validity over the chinese mainland the dml approach was mainly developed based on the classification model of random forest rf in combination with the regression models of the machine learning ml algorithms including rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm this led to four dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf lm the performance of the dml algorithms were compared to the single machine learning sml algorithms developed based solely on the regression models of rf ann svm and elm and to the liner merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting the one outlier removed average and the optimized weight average in total we produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms four of the sml algorithms three of the liner merging methods and another one generated via the gauge only interpolation the precipitation observations at 697 gauges were spatially and randomly divided into two parts i e 70 and 30 one was used for the training of the ml algorithms or for the interpolation while the other for the performance evaluations results indicate that the dml algorithms outperform the other merging methods the gauge only interpolation and the original spps over the chinese mainland the median kling gupta efficiency kge ranges 0 67 0 71 for the merged products of dml which are obviously higher than the original spps 0 31 0 54 the linear merged product 0 54 0 55 gauge only interpolated product 0 62 and the sml based products 0 47 0 65 the dml based products also exhibit better performances than the other products in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day and outperform the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds further analyses imply that i the dml based products could outperform the original spps even with a small training dataset size ii the superiority of the dml approach to sml is mainly due to that the former can better capture the temporal dynamics of precipitation iii the added values of the merged products of dml relative to the original spps and the gauge only product vary with the sizes of the training dataset and iv the ensemble of the dml algorithms could not further improve the accuracy of the precipitation estimates this study not only provided an effective and robust tool for the fusion of multiple spps and gauge observations but also for the first time compared the performance of various ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation keywords precipitation merging satellite based precipitation product machine learning gauge density chinese mainland 1 introduction precipitation is one of the key components in the hydrological and atmospheric cycles it is essential not only to the understanding of water balance and climate variability markonis et al 2019 du et al 2020 but also to a wide range of applications such as flood forecasting breugem et al 2020 drought monitoring zhong et al 2019 water resource managements brodeur and steinschneider 2020 and hydrological and earth system modeling tesfa et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b however it is very challenging to obtain high quality precipitation estimates at fine spatial temporal resolutions xie and xiong 2011 rain gauges are the traditional and reliable tools used to measure point scale precipitation which typically serve as the benchmark for the evaluation of various precipitation products however they are scarcely and unevenly distributed in most regions of the world sharifi et al 2019 beck et al 2020 and the spatial continuous precipitation estimates based solely on gauge based observations are subjected to large uncertainties baez villanueva test et al 2020 over the last few decades the rapid development of remote sensing techniques provides an unprecedented opportunity for estimating spatial continuous precipitation at the global scale satellite based precipitation products spps are increasingly available to the public which significantly improved our understanding of the precipitation characteristics chen and gao 2018 gupta et al 2019 markonis et al 2019 and promoted a variety of hydrometeorological applications munier et al 2014 belabid et al 2019 pellet et al 2019 especially over the gauge sparse regions nevertheless the spps are inherently subjected to large uncertainties and biases arising from the retrieval algorithms the indirect measurements and the deficiencies of the sensors e g the false precipitation detections by infrared sensors if cold nonprecipitating clouds exist and the undervalue of localized storm events by microwave sensors bharti and singh 2015 ebrahimi et al 2017 they typically have trouble in estimating heavy and solid rainfall xu et al 2017 as well as the local orographic precipitation bharti and singh 2015 the gauge based precipitation observations have high accuracy but with limited coverages and uneven distributions on the other hand the spps have continuous and large coverages but with large biases hence in recent years many efforts have been made to merge spps and gauge observations to improve the accuracy and spatial coverage of the precipitation estimates nie et al 2015 yang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 beck et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 xu et al 2020 a variety of methods have been proposed to merge satellite and gauge based precipitation including i the simplest linear merging methods e g the one outlier removed average shen et al 2014 the inverse error variance weighting mastrantonas et al 2019 and the inverse root mean square error weighting yang et al 2017 ii the bias correction or residual based methods e g the probability mapping method zhang and tang 2015 the geographical difference ratio analysis duan and bastiaanssen 2013 bai et al 2019 and the kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 iii the intermediate complexity approaches e g the geographically weighted regression gwr chao et al 2018 and the optimal interpolation technique xie and xiong 2011 nie et al 2015 and iv some other more complex methods such as the bayesian model averaging bma scheme ma et al 2018 rahman et al 2020 and the kriging based algorithms manz et al 2016 chen et al 2020a these merging methods have proved to be effective in improving the accuracy of precipitation estimates nevertheless most of them are subjected to strong ad hoc assumptions that may not hold true in reality wu et al 2020 more specifically i the linear average method assumes a linear relationship between the output and the merging members ii the optimal interpolation technique assumes a sole dependence of the error variance on precipitation intensity iii the geographically weighted regression method hypothesizes a non linear correlation between the dependent variables iv the bias correction method assumes an unbiased estimation of the precipitation background field by the spps and v the bma and kriging based methods assume a normal gaussian distribution of precipitation moreover many of the methods are applicable to blending gauge based observations with only one single spp as we know each spp could have its own pros and cons and might show varying performance for different regions and timescales for instance zhang et al 2020a found that the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg early run product outperforms the sm2rain ascat product in the humid subregions of china while the contrary is the case in the semi arid subregions the fusion of gauge based observations with multiple spps instead of one single spp might be more favorable for the improvement of the precipitation estimates chen et al 2020b lastly to our best knowledge there are few studies devoted to compare the performance of the merged precipitation products with the gauge only interpolated product especially in the conditions of different rain gauge densities these few exceptions include the studies of wang and lin 2015 and bai et al 2019 a comparison to the gauge only interpolated precipitation however is very important for the evaluation of the added value of the merged products and could provide valuable information to the data users for instance the gauge only interpolated precipitation might be more preferred than the spps or the merged precipitation products for hydrological modeling providing it shows a higher performance zhang et al 2020b the machine learning ml algorithms known as data driven methods have received increasing popularity in hydrology and climate sciences sharifi et al 2019 wang et al 2019 boucher et al 2020 lin et al 2020 merz et al 2020 many studies have been carried out to bias correct or merge spps by taking the advantages of the ml techniques yang and luo 2014 corrected the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa product by using a back propagation bp neural network bhuiyan et al 2018 and ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 investigated the use of the quantile regression forests qrf for blending multiple spps with the atmospheric reanalysis precipitation dataset and evaluated its performance over the tropical regions with complex terrains kumar et al 2019 corrected the near real time tmpa product by combining it with nrt soil moisture through a nonlinear support vector machine based regression svr model recently baez villanueva et al 2020 proposed a rf based approach to combine multiple spps with the gauge observations in chile wu et al 2020 presented a spatiotemporal deep fusion model to merge satellite and gauge based precipitation in china bhuiyan et al 2020 employed two ml algorithms i e the rf and neural networks to generate an error corrected imerg product over the brahmaputra river basin wehbe et al 2020 adopted the artificial neural networks anns to derived a multi source precipitation product by fusing weather radar satellite retrievals and surface parameters previous studies demonstrated a great potential of the ml algorithms in correcting and merging spps the ml technique has at least the following advantages relative to the traditional precipitation merging methods hengl et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2020 wu et al 2020 i it can deal well with the complex and non linear relationships between inputs and output ii it contains no rigid assumption iii it is of great flexibility to incorporate multiple types of explanatory variables iv it has the capability of blending gauge observations with multiple spps and v it is easy to implement nevertheless few of the previous studies incorporated the spatial autocorrelation information of the gauge based observations into the precipitation merging framework moreover typically the regression model of the ml algorithm was solely used for the precipitation fusion the combined use of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms which could improve the rain no rain detection skill chen et al 2010 however has rarely been reported in the previous studies in addition to our best knowledge few efforts were made to compare the performance of different ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation and to assess the added value of their merged products relative to the gauge only product especially with the consideration of the influence of rain gauge density in the study we proposed a novel double machine learning dml approach developed based on the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms to merge multiple spps and gauge observations the reliability and validity of the new precipitation merging method were tested over the chinese mainland our major objectives are threefold i to evaluate the effectiveness of the dml algorithms ii to compare the performance of dml to the traditional single machine learning sml methods the linear merging methods and the gauge only interpolation and iii to assess the added value of the merged products of dml relative to the original spps and the gauge only interpolated product the rest of the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the study region and data are briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the methodology of the study the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the chinese mainland which covers a large geographical area of about 9 6 million km2 was selected as the study region in this research as depicted in fig 1 the chinese mainland exhibits a strong variability of the elevations ranging from 152 m below the sea level in eastern china to 7528 m above the sea level on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp according to the gradients of elevations and the precipitation patterns eight subregions can be subdivided from the chinese mainland chen et al 2013 chen and li 2016 including xinjiang xj qinghai tibetan plateau qtp northeast china nec north china nc southeast china sec northwest china nwc the middle and downstream areas of yangtze river basin yz and the southwest yungui plateau ygp the subregions xj and nwc have an arid and semi arid climate with scarce precipitation and intensive evaporation yz ygp and sec have a tropical and sub tropical climate nec and nc have a temperate monsoon climate of medium latitudes with hot and wet summer and cold and dry winter and qtp has a distinct plateau climate with strong radiation low temperature and highly variable precipitation 2 2 data 2 2 1 gauge observations the precipitation observations at 697 rain gauges were used for training and testing the ml algorithms as plotted in fig 1 the rain gauges are unevenly distributed over the chinese mainland with an obvious lower density in the subregions xj nwc and qtp than the remaining subregions we collected the half daily precipitation observations for the period 2007 2011 from the china meteorological data service center cmdsc http data cma cn the half daily precipitation are the accumulated data between 20 00 8 00 and 8 00 20 00 beijing time utc 8 respectively the dataset have been subjected to strict quality controls shen et al 2010 zhao and yatagai 2014 including i the manual inspection and correction ii the extreme values check iii the spatio temporal consistency check and iv the internal consistency check e g the duplicated data and incorrect units 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products as listed in table 1 three near real time spps including imerg persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks and gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation and one bottom up spp generated from the ascat soil moisture product i e sm2rain ascat were selected in this study the spatial resolutions of these products were unified to 0 1 0 1 by using the nearest neighboring interpolation algorithm to ensure a spatial consistency the daily precipitation of the selected spps are consistently the accumulated data for the period 00 00 24 00 utc which however are different from the gauge observations that represent the accumulations between 20 00 and 20 00 utc 8 in the study we recalculated the daily precipitation observations by adding the accumulated data between 8 00 and 20 00 utc 8 in the current day to that between 20 00 and 8 00 utc 8 in the next day as done in our previous study zhang et al 2020a the recalculations would lead the gauge observations to be the accumulated precipitation data between 0 00 and 24 00 utc or 8 00 and 8 00 utc 8 which is in line with the spps the imerg product was generated through the intercalibration interpolation and integration of all microwave satellite based precipitation estimates precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared ir satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators huffman et al 2014 it currently covers the quasi global areas ranging 60 n 60 s with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution huffman et al 2019 the daily accumulated imerg early run product version 6 simply referred to as imerg was used in this study the data was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration at the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc https disc gsfc nasa gov the persiann product was produced using the network function classification approximation procedures based on the geostationary ir brightness temperature image and daytime visible imagery sorooshian et al 2000 nguyen et al 2019 it covers 60 s to 60 n globally with a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 2000 to present the data released in a near real time manner with 2 day delay was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci we collected the data from the chrs data portal at the website http chrsdata eng uci edu the gsmap product was produced using the japan science and technology agency jaxa global rainfall watch system based on the combined mw ir algorithm using extensive satellite data from both passive microwave pmw and infrared ir sensors kubota et al 2007 it has a quasi global coverage 60 s 60 n with high spatial and temporal resolutions 0 1 0 1 1 h the daily accumulated gsmap early run product gsmap nrt simply referred to as gsmap was used in this research the data was obtained from the earth observation research center of jaxa at the website https hokusai eorc jaxa jp the sm2rain ascat product were generated by applying the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2013 to the ascat soil moisture product brocca et al 2019 it was provided at the global scale with a high spatial resolution of 12 5 km and a daily temporal resolution the data was selected because it was generated form the satellite based soil moisture product in a bottom up manner and could compensate the deficiency of the top down spps zhang et al 2020a the newly released version of sm2rain ascat version 1 1 simply referred to as sm2rain was collected from zenodo at the website https zenodo org record 3405563 3 methodology the workflow of the study is briefly illustrated in fig 2 we adopted four traditional sml schemes and four newly proposed dml algorithms to merge multiple spps i e imerg sm2rain perisann and gsmap and gauge observations the sml algorithms were developed based solely on the regression models of random forest rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm the dml algorithms however were developed based on the classification model of the random forest rf in combination with the regression models of rf ann svm and elm this leads to four different dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm moreover the linear satellite gauge merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting ievw the one outlier removed average oora and the optimized weight average owa were also adopted in the study for the comparison with the ml based precipitation methods details about the sml and dml algorithms will be presented in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively and those about the liner merging methods in section 3 2 in addition a gauge only precipitation product was generated by using the simple but robust idw i e inverse distance weighting interpolation algorithm camera et al 2014 it was used together with the original spps as the benchmarks for the evaluation of the added value of the merged products of dml in the study the gauge observations were randomly and spatially subdivided into two parts i e 70 and 30 one was used as the training dataset while the other as the test dataset this is done by randomly sampling 70 of all the available gauges in each subregion separately considering the uneven distribution of the rain gauges if the sampling was performed for the entire chinese mainland the training and test dataset would be biased toward the southeastern regions due to the higher rain gauge densities in total this study produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms four of the sml algorithms three of the linear merging methods and one additional gauge only interpolated product these products and the original spps were evaluated based on the test dataset by using both the continuous and categorical metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi 3 1 machine learning based satellite gauge merging methods fig 3 presents the framework of the ml based methods used to merge spps and gauge observations a critical and preliminary step is to choose informative auxiliary variables the geographical and topographical covariates including latitude longitude subregion id and altitude were selected to account for the spatial variations of precipitation and the influences of topography on precipitation patterns the other topographical variables including slope aspect terrain shadows and roughness were tested to have minimal impacts on the merged results and they were excluded from the ml models in addition the geographical correlation information i e the spatial autocorrelation of the precipitation observations were incorporated into the precipitation merging framework following the previous studies li et al 2017 hengl et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2020 the rationale behind this is that the nearer observations are more informative than the farther ones for the precipitation estimates we defined two covariates i e ne and pop to account for the spatial autocorrelation between the gauge observations 1 ne i 1 n w i p i i 1 n w i w i 1 d i 2 2 pop i 1 n w i po i i 1 n w i w i 1 d i 2 po i 0 p i 0 1 p i 0 where ne is the precipitation estimates from the neighbor observations di is the distance to the i th neighbor gauge pop is the probability of precipitation occurrence thornton et al 1997 poi is the binary variable related to occurrence of observed precipitation and pi is the precipitation at the i th neighbor gauge after the determination of the auxiliary variables the sml section 3 1 1 and dml section 3 1 2 algorithms were trained and calibrated at each day of the period 2007 2011 by using the training dataset i e the observations at 493 gauges fig 1 the day to day training strategy was tested to be more effective and computationally efficient than the periodic training strategy e g month to month and year to year afterwards the trained ml algorithms were used to predict daily precipitation at the test gauges for the same period i e 2007 2011 the observations at the test gauges which are completely independent from the training dataset would benefit a robust performance evaluation of the ml algorithms the assessments were carried out at the daily scale over the entire study period 2007 2011 with some attention paid to the seasonal and subregional variations of the performance 3 1 1 single machine learning approach the principle of the sml based merging method is to build a transfer function between the predictors and the output based on the regression model of the ml algorithm as 3 p merg f x s x a e r r o r where pmerg is the output which represents the gauge based and merged precipitation respectively at the training and test prediction stages f is the transfer function built with the ml regression model xs and xa are the predictors of which the former represents the precipitation estimates of spps while the later represents the auxiliary variables in the study the popular ml algorithms including rf ann svm and elm were used to construct the transfer functions which leads to four different sml based precipitation merging methods 1 random forest rf the rf algorithm is an ensemble ml approach that aggregates the results of multiple decision tree models breiman 2001 the randomness of rf mainly reflects in two aspects one is the random samples and the other is the random features or predictors the bootstrap method is used to generate the random samples from the training dataset which are further adopted to construct a number of decision trees at each decision tree the internal splits are generated according to the randomly selected features rf could substantially alleviate the overfitting problems and improve the generalization capability owing to the random selections of the input samples and predictors and the use of ensemble predictions this study implemented the rf algorithm using the matlab treebagger function as shown in table 2 the hyperparameters including the ntree and minobs were determined for the rf algorithm through the trial and error procedures they were identified as 50 and 5 respectively the hyperparameter nsplit i e the number of variables randomly sampled at each decision split was set to one third of the number of the input variables following the previous studies beck et al 2019 baez villanueva test et al 2020 the treebagger has a built in function to measure the relative importance of the different predictors this is done through the method based on permutation feature importance pfi by using the out of bag oob samples i e the samples not selected by the bootstrap approach he et al 2016 schmidt et al 2020 the underlying principle of pfi is to broke the ties between the target and one of the predictors and then estimate the prediction accuracy deterioration schmidt et al 2020 the stronger of the deterioration the more important of the predictor for the model s prediction more specifically pfi is estimated with the following steps i calculating the original prediction error i e the mean squared error for the regression tree and the misclassification probability for the classification tree across the oob observations for the j th decision tree i e erroobj ii generating the permuted predictor matrix by shuffling the i th predictor while keeping the others fixed and re estimating the prediction error for the j th decision tree i e erroobi j iii calculating the increase in the prediction error increerrori j after shuffling the i th predictor using the eq 4 and lastly iv estimating pfi of the i th predictor pfii by averaging the increerrori j and dividing it by the standard deviation σ over the decision trees using eq 5 4 increerrori i j erroobi i j erroob j 5 pfi i 1 ntree j ntree increerrori i j σ increerrori i j i 1 2 3 10 2 artificial neural network ann the ann algorithm is an information processing paradigm inspired by the biological neural networks gardner and dorling 1998 the basic elements of ann are the neurons or units which are interconnected by the weighted links at each unit the output is computed by a transfer or active function of the weighted summation of the inputs the multilayer perceptron mlp with a three layer structure i e the input hidden and output layers which are one of the widely used forms of the ann algorithms was used in the study we implemented the ann algorithm using the matlab fitnet function this study setted the transfer functions tranfunc as tansig for both the hidden and output layers of ann as presented in table 2 the hyperparameters including the nnh and iw were optimized through a parallel computing based and grid research pc gr approach more specifically we considered 3 nnh i e 10 20 30 and 10 random iw i e 30 grids and searched the best 10 grids through the cross validation the searching processes were implemented via the parallel computing technique to improve the computational efficiency the ensemble average of the precipitation estimations with the best 10 parameter sets were used as the final predictions 3 support vector machine svm the svm is a popular ml algorithm widely used for both classification and regression purposes vapnik 1998 the classification model of the svm aims to find a hyperplane whereby the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible on the other hand the regression model aims to find a hyperplane expressed by a regression function that best describes the observed outputs with an error tolerance in addition to linear problems svms can also deal efficiently with non linear problems by using the kernel function to map the non linear inputs to linearly separable and high dimensional feature spaces in this study the svm algorithm was implemented by using the libsvm package chang and lin 2011 the kernel function kernfunc was set as the radial basis function rbf through the trial and error procedure the two stage pc gr approach was applied to optimize the two hyperparameters of svm including c and γ we first determined the best parameter set c1 and γ1 from the coarse grids c γ 810 2 10 through the cross validation and then searched the fine grids centered on c1 and γ1 i e c1 2 0 2 c1 2 γ1 2 0 2 γ1 2 to identify the final best parameter set similarly the parallel computing technique was used to accelerate the optimization and training processes 4 extreme learning machine elm the elm algorithm proposed by huang et al 2012 has the similar structure as the mlp with one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer after randomly initializing the weights and bias between the input and hidden layers the weights between the hidden and output layers are directly estimated as the product of the moore penrose generalized inverse of the output matrix of the hidden layer and the target variable this is quite different from the mlp that estimates the weights between the hidden and output layers via an iterative learning process the distinct feature leads to a high computational efficiency of the elm algorithm the codes of elm are available at https www ntu edu sg home egbhuang elm codes html we modified the original codes to get an ensemble prediction of the 10 best estimates of elm through the parallel computing based optimization process similar to ann these efforts are mainly devoted to ameliorate the impact of the random initial weights and biases between the input and hidden layers and the influence of different number of nodes in the hidden layer 3 1 2 double machine learning approach inspired by the work of chen et al 2010 this study proposed a novel dml approach based the classification and regression models of the ml algorithm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations as presented in fig 4 we first developed a classification model by using one of the ml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm the precipitation observations that are greater than zero were classified as wet day while those are equal to zero as dry day the classified precipitation observations were used together with the input variables to train and optimize the classification model of each ml algorithm which refers to the first ml the training and optimization processes are similar to the regression models of the ml algorithms section 3 1 1 with the difference that the optimization objectives are the classification accuracy of the precipitation events afterwards the classification accuracy of dry wet day for each ml algorithm was evaluated based on the independent test dataset fig 1 and the best performed ml algorithm was identified the classification accuracy ca was defined as 6 ca 1 n i 1 n w i d i t i where wi and di are the total number of days correctly classified as wet day and dry day respectively at the i th gauge ti is the total number of days over the evaluation period i e 2007 2011 and n is the total number of gauges in the test dataset i e 204 in our case at the second stage we trained the regression model of each ml algorithm to estimate precipitation at the day that was predicted as wet day similar to the sml approach which refers to the second ml the amount of precipitation was set to zero if the day was predicted as dry day by the classification model of the ml algorithm hence the merged products of dml were generated by combining the predictions of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms at the two separate stages the wet dry day classification accuracy of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm are listed in table 3 the classification models show very comparable classification accuracy 0 888 0 889 which are obviously higher than the regression models 0 286 0 450 the preliminary analysis indicates that the inclusion a classification model into the precipitation merging framework is reasonable and could improve the rain no rain detection skill in this study we selected the classification model of rf for the classification purpose due to its slightly better performance and higher computational efficiency relative to the other ml algorithms this led to four different dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm 3 2 linear satellite gauge merging methods this study adopted three linear precipitation merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting ievw the optimized weight average owa and the one outlier removed average oora which are described in eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively 7 p merg 1 i 1 n 1 e i 2 i 1 n 1 e i 2 s i 8 p merg i 1 n wopt i s i 9 p merg 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s i where pmerg is the merged precipitation n is the number of spps si is the i th spp e is the error variance and wopt is the optimized weight the error variance and weight of each spp were calculated for the ievw method based on the training dataset and the weights of spps were optimized for the owa method with the objective of minimizing the root mean square error rmse between the precipitation estimates and the observations in the training dataset afterwards the weights were used by the ievw and owa methods to predict precipitation at the test gauges regarding to the oora method one of the spps that has the largest rmse was removed and regarded as the outlier and the arithmetic average of the precipitation estimates of the remaining spps was used as the merged results 3 3 performance evaluation the kling gupta efficiency kge proposed by gupta et al 2009 was used for the performance evaluations as shown in eq 10 the kge is a multi component performance metric that includes the correlation coefficient cc the bias ratio beta and the variability ratio gama which measure the correlation bias and relative temporal variability between the precipitation estimates and the gauge observations respectively 10 kge 1 1 c c 2 1 b e t a 2 1 g a m a 2 11 cc i 1 n p i merg p mean merg o i o mean i 1 n p i merg p mean merg 2 i 1 n o i o mean 2 12 beta μ merg μ o 13 gama σ merg σ o where p and o are the merged precipitation and the observations respectively at the test gauges µ is the mean value σ is the standard deviation i is the time step and n is the total number of time steps in the study following kling et al 2012 we calculated the gama by using eq 14 instead of e q 13 to ensure the variability and bias ratios are not cross correlated 14 gama σ merg μ merg σ o μ o the ranges of the kge cc beta and gama are 1 1 1 0 and 0 respectively the closer of the kge and its components to unity the better the performance of the precipitation products in addition we adopted four categorical metrics to assess the capability of the products in detecting precipitation events they are the probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi which are defined as in eqs 15 16 17 and 18 respectively 15 p o d a a c 16 s r a a b 17 b s p o d s r a b a c 18 c s i a a b c where a is the number of precipitation events correctly detected b is the number of non events that are incorrectly detected i e event was detected to occur but not observed to occur c is the number of the missing events i e event was not detected to occur but observed to occur the four metrics were mapped on a single diagram proposed by roebber 2009 to better visualize the evaluation results the closer of the metrics to the upper right of the diagram the better detectability of precipitation events the perfect performance is reached when pod sr csi bs 1 the categorical metrics were computed at each test gauge for the precipitation thresholds of 1 5 10 and 15 mm day respectively 3 4 sensitivity analysis of training dataset size a sensitivity analysis was additionally conducted to investigate the impacts of training dataset size on the performance of the dml algorithms and the gauge only interpolation this is done by reducing the size of the original training dataset and analyzing the changes of the accuracy of the precipitation estimates at the test gauges specifically speaking the size of the training dataset i e the proportions of rain gauges in the training dataset was first randomly reduced to 80 60 40 and 20 of its original size that includes 493 gauges the reduction processes were implemented for each subregion separately to ensure the condensed training dataset is representative over the chinese mainland afterwards we repeated the dml based merging process and the interpolation process with the different sizes of the training dataset lastly we analyzed the variations of the performance of the dml algorithms and the gauge only interpolation with the decreasing sizes of the training dataset the sensitivity analysis would facilitate an evaluation of the robustness and reliability of the dml algorithms 4 results 4 1 performance assessment over the chinese mainland 4 1 1 overall performance fig 5 shows the boxplots of the kge and its components cc beta and gama for the sixteen precipitation products over the chinese mainland the median kge values are relatively small for gsmap perisann and sm2rain which are 0 39 0 31 and 0 32 respectively fig 5 a the imerg product performs the best among the original spps with a median kge of 0 54 the merged products produced by the three sml algorithms i e rf ann and elm achieve higher median kge values than the original spps which are 0 65 0 60 and 0 60 respectively the median kge of the merged product generated by svm however is smaller than the imerg product the products of the linear merging methods i e oora owa and ievw show comparable performances to the imerg product in terms of kge regarding to the gauge only interpolated product i e idw interestingly it provides a comparable and even higher median kge than the products of the sml algorithms and the linear merging methods the merged products of the dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm have consistently higher median kge 0 67 0 71 than the other precipitation products fig 5 b shows the boxplots of the correlation coefficients cc for the different precipitation products the merged products of sml and dml give comparable median cc which are higher than other products the original spps have the lowest cc ranging 0 46 0 64 among the sixteen precipitation products the median bias ratios beta as show in fig 5 c are closer to unity with smaller ranges for the dml based and rf based products and the gauge only interpolated product in comparison to other products as present in fig 5 d the median variability ratio gama for the products of dml range from 0 83 to 0 90 which are apparently higher than those of sml 0 66 0 76 and the linear merged and gauge only interpolated products 0 70 0 72 the median gama of imerg gsmap and perisann are close to unity but with large ranges in comparison to the other products overall the merged products of the dml algorithms outperform the other merged products and the gauge only interpolated product in terms of kge fig 6 shows the roebber s performance diagrams for the sixteen precipitation products with different precipitation thresholds over the chinese mainland the merged products of the dml algorithms exhibit the best performance in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day followed by the rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product the linear merged products and the products of ann svm and elm achieve comparable median csi values but larger bs to the imerg and gsmap products with respect to the precipitation events higher than 5 mm day i e precipitation threshold 5 mm day the merged products of the dml algorithms perform comparable to those of the sml algorithms except svm they consistently perform better than the other products as shown in fig 6a c and d comparing the results for different precipitation thresholds all the products tend to show lower detectability of the precipitation events with larger magnitudes as indicated by the decreasing csi values regardless the merged products of the dml algorithms outperform the other products in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day and perform better than the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds 4 1 2 seasonal performance fig 7 presents the boxplots of the kge and csi for the 16 precipitation products in the seasons of spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february in terms of kge the original spps consistently perform worse than the products of the dml algorithms in all of the seasons the linear merged products obviously outperform gsmap sm2rain and persiann in spring autumn and winter while they perform worse than the gauge only interpolated product the imerg product shows a comparable performance to the merged product in spring and summer although it exhibits a lower performance in autumn and winter the products of the sml algorithms including elm svm and ann generally perform better than the original spps but they perform worse than the gauge only interpolated product in the different seasons the products of the dml algorithms show higher performances than other products in terms of kge in spring summer and autumn in winter the products of the dml and rf algorithms and the gauge only interpolation achieve comparable higher performances than the other products in terms of csi the products of the dml algorithms outperform all the other products in spring summer and autumn with the precipitation threshold of 1 mm day followed by rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product as shown in fig 7e f and g in winter the products of the dml rf and ann algorithms perform comparable to the gauge only interpolated product but outperform the remaining products 4 2 performance assessment at the subregional scale fig 8 shows the boxplots of the kge for the sixteen precipitation products over the eight subregions of the chinese mainland the merged products of the dml algorithms perform better than the other products in most of the subregions including sec yz nc ygp nec and nwc in the subregion qtp the product of rf rf performs best among the sixteen precipitation products followed by those of rf ann rf and rf svm the products of rf rf rf ann and rf svm perform better than the other products in the subregion xj while the product of rf elm perform worse than sm2rain and the gauge only interpolated product fig 9 presents the roebber s performance diagrams for the different precipitation products over the different subregions the products of dml outperform the other products in detecting precipitation events threshold 1 mm day in all the subregions especially in the subregion xj the rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product show higher performances than the other products except those of dml all of the precipitation products tend to perform worse in xj than in the other subregions the performances for the merged and interpolated products can vary substantially over the eight subregions this can be explained by the varying densities of the rain gauges used for the training of the ml algorithms or for the interpolation and the varying complexities of the spatial temporal variabilities of precipitation nevertheless our results indicate that in terms of kge and csi the merged products of the dml algorithms generally perform better than the other precipitation products at the sub regional scale 4 3 influence of training dataset size on the performance of the dml algorithms fig 10 shows the boxplots of the kge for the dml based precipitation products i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm and the gauge only interpolated product i e idw at the test gauges with the different sizes of the training dataset the kge ranges of the best performed spp i e imerg which is independent of the size of the training dataset were also provided for the comparison purpose we can observe the decreasing trends of the performances for the merged and gauge only interpolated products when the size of the training dataset i e the proportions of rain gauges in the training dataset reduces from 100 to 20 nevertheless the deteriorations of the performance are more significant for the gauge only interpolated product than the dml based product taking a close look we can note that the performance of the interpolated product is comparable and even worse than the best spp when the proportion of gauges in the training dataset drops below 40 the dml based products however consistently perform better than the best spp regardless of the size of the training dataset meanwhile the performances of the dml based products only show slight decreases when the size of the training dataset drop from 100 to 60 the sensitive analysis implies that the newly proposed dml approach is robust and has obvious advantages over the gauge only interpolation in the condition of low training dataset size 5 discussion 5 1 relative importance of the predictors an analysis of the relative importance of the predictors could help to better understand and interpret the ml algorithm in this study the relative importance of the selected predictors i e permuted feature importance pfi for the classification and regression models of the rf algorithm which are employed by the dml approach i e rf rf were estimated using the matlab treebagger function as shown in fig 11 all the predictors achieve the pfi higher than 0 15 for both the classification and regression models indicating that they could contribute useful information to the precipitation merging results the spatial autocorrelation predictors i e ne and pop and the spps including gsmap sm2rain and imerg exhibit higher importance than the other predictors this indicates that it is very important to include the spatial autocorrelation information of the gauge observations in the ml based precipitation merging framework which could help to incorporate the geographical laws into ml yuan et al 2020 the persiann product shows an obviously lower importance than the other spps i e gsmap sm2rain and imerg which might be explained by its coarser spatial resolution the time invariant covariates including altitude longitude attitude and region id present are of relatively low importance which is consistent with the previous reports bhuiyan et al 2018 2020 baez villanueva test et al 2020 5 2 added value of the merged products of the dml algorithms a quantitative assessment of the added value of the merged products relative to the merging members is of great importance for evaluating the effectiveness of the satellite gauge merging method in the study we further analyzed the variations of the added value i e the increase in kge δkge of the dml based products i e rf ann and rf rf relative to the gauge only interpolated product i e idw and the best performed spp i e imerg with increasing rain gauge densities i e the number of gauges per 106 km2 in the training dataset the analyses were performed for the chinese mainland and its five subregions the remaining subregions including the qtp xj and nwc were excluded for the analyses due to the low rain gauge densities as shown in fig 12 the added value of the merged product relative to the best spp consistently exhibits an upward trend with increasing rain gauge densities while that relative to the gauge only interpolated product shows a downward trend the relationships between δkge and the rain gauge densities could be well represented by the logarithmic curves with the coefficients of determination r2 higher than 0 70 in most of the cases the finding agrees well with that reported by bai et al 2019 we can observe from fig 12 that the δkge values are consistently greater than zero in the chinese mainland and its subregions including yz nz nec and ygp with different gauge densities in the training dataset meanwhile they range from 0 09 to 0 54 or 0 06 to 0 55 and 0 11 to 0 98 or 0 07 to 0 97 respectively for the merged product of rf rf or rf ann relative to the best spp and the gauge only interpolated product in the subregions qtp xj and nwc which are shown here the improvement of the precipitation estimates over the different subregions with varying rain gauge densities overall demonstrate the transferability of the proposed dml algorithm in a variety of situations nevertheless we admit the new precipitation merging method is more effective in the regions with scarce or medium rain gauge densities than those with extremely low or high rain gauge densities as reported by wang and lin 2015 and bai et al 2019 the extremely low gauge density would result in a poor representation of the training dataset which might even induce a decrease in the performance of the merged product relative to the original spps as shown in fig 12b on the other hand if the rain gauge density is high enough the precipitation patterns could already be well captured by the gauge based precipitation observations and the incorporation of the precipitation information from the spps would have a limited ability to further improve the precipitation estimates it should be noted that the condition rain gauge density is extreme low or high enough would vary with region to region depending on the topographic and climatic features as well as the selected ml algorithm for instance the added value of merged product of rf ann relative to the gauge only interpolated product will converge to zero in the subregion nc if the rain gauge density is higher than 403 gauges per 106 km2 according to the logarithmic curves shown in fig 12d however it needs to exceed 1000 gauges per 106 km2 in ygp as mentioned before typically the performance of the merged precipitation product is compared solely to the original spps yang et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 chen et al 2020b wu et al 2020 our results however imply that a comparison made to the gauge only interpolated product is of equal importance considering that the added value of the merged product relative to the interpolated product would decrease or even converge to zero with the increasing rain gauge densities moreover we argue that more efforts are needed to investigate whether the added value of the merged product relative to the original spps and to the gauge only interpolated product could be propagated to hydrological modeling liu et al 2016 ur rahman et al 2020 5 3 comparison of the machine learning algorithms this study adopted four sml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm and four dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to compare the performances of different ml algorithms for blending satellite and gauge based precipitation in terms of kge rf performs best while svm performs worst among the sml algorithms over the chinese mainland the superiority of rf to the other sml algorithms tends to be more obvious in the gauge scarce subregions i e nwc qtp and xj than in the other subregions regarding to the dml algorithms rf rf and rf ann perform better than rf svm and rf elm nevertheless there seems no consistent results at the sub regional scale and the performances of the sml and dml algorithms could vary with the subregions the dml algorithms consistently perform better than the sml algorithms in terms of kge and csi precipitation threshold 1 mm day over the chinese mainland the median kge for the dml based products would increase by the ranges from 0 04 to 0 20 or 6 09 to 41 62 relative to the sml based products meanwhile the median csi would increase by the ranges from 0 04 to 0 22 or 7 05 and 52 51 at the sub regional level the increases in the median kge could be up to 6 78 or more than 10 times and the increased in the median csi up to 0 28 or 378 04 the better performance of dml than sml is mainly due to the fact that the former could provide a higher classification accuracy of the dry wet day see table 3 which leads to a better capability in describing the temporal dynamics of precipitation as indicated by the obviously higher beta values see fig 5 d the increase in the median kge could approach to 31 48 for the merged product of rf ann relative to the best spp over the chinese mainland baez villanueva test et al 2020 reported an improvement of their blended product of rf by about 43 in terms of kge in comparison to the best performed merging member the greater improvement could be explained by the fact their rain gauges are apparently denser than ours as shown in fig 12 higher rain gauge densities would lead to more added value of the merged product relative to the merging members in the study of wu et al 2020 the performance improvement of their ml based merged product is about 9 in terms of cc over the chinese mainland which is lower than ours that could be up to 21 the improvement of the precipitation estimates achieved by the dml algorithms also tends to be higher than some other related studies conducted in china ma et al 2018 bai et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a which adopted the non machine learning methods such as the linear merging approach the geographical difference ratio analysis and the bma method the comparisons made to the previous studies prove the effectiveness of our new satellite gauge merging method nevertheless we admit that the dml approach is subjected to some deficiencies as mentioned before it might not be effective in the regions with extremely low or high rain gauge densities moreover it might not facilitate the fusion of real time near real time data due to the fact the gauge based observations are typically unavailable in a real time or near real time manner additionally the approach as well as some other ml based methods have limited abilities to capture extreme precipitation as pointed out by he et al 2016 and bhuiyan et al 2020 5 4 ensemble of the dml algorithms this study developed and adopted four dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations it is easy to raise an interesting question i e whether the ensemble of the dml algorithms could further improve the precipitation estimates in order to answer the question we additionally produced three ensemble precipitation products based on the predictions of the four dml algorithms by using the ievw oora and oml optimal machine leaning methods the ievw and oora methods are similar to the linear precipitation merging approaches see section 3 2 with the difference that the spps are replaced by the ensemble members i e the predictions of the dml algorithms the oml method is to select the best performed dml algorithm to predict precipitation the training dataset can t be simultaneously used to train and evaluate the performance of the dml algorithms due to the issue of overfitting and each dml algorithm can provide equally good precipitation estimates in the training process we separated the original training data into two parts one 80 is used to train the dml algorithms and the other 20 to estimate the ensemble weights of the ievw method and to determine the outlier and the best dml algorithm for the oora and oml methods as shown in fig 13 the ensemble precipitation products perform very comparable to the original products of the dml algorithms this indicates that the ensemble of the dml algorithms shows little potential for the further improvement of the precipitation estimates this might be explained by the following reasons one is that the performance of dml is not spatially uniform and can vary significantly over different locations the ensemble weights the outlier and the optimal dml algorithm determined by the 20 of the training dataset might not be applicable to the gauges in the test dataset the other is that the condensed training data 80 will impair the performance of the dml algorithms see section 4 3 which will in turn affect the performance of the ensemble precipitation products 5 5 limitations and uncertainties the spatial scale mismatch between the spps and gauge observations was neglected in the study we assumed the point scale and gauge based precipitation are equal to the grid scale and satellite based precipitation as done in many other studies ebrahimi et al 2017 bai et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a the hypothesis however might not hold true especially over the regions of complex topography which would affect the satellite gauge merging results and meanwhile bring some biases to the performance assessments of the precipitation products in recent years some researchers have attempted to first downscale the grid scale spps to the point scale via the approaches such as the kriging and gwr chen et al 2018 2020a or to first upscale the point scale observation to the grid scale yang et al 2017 and then carried out the satellite gauge merging task these operations might help to ameliorate the influences of the spatial scale mismatch although they would produce additional uncertainties the training and test dataset were sampled for each subregion separately due to the fact the rain gauges are more densely distributed in southeast china than in northwest china the region by region sampling method would benefit a better representation of the training and test dataset over the chinese mainland but not ensure a good representation in all of its subregions this is because the sampling was conducted via a random manner at the subregional scale the random sampling method widely adopted in many previous researches ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 baez villanueva test et al 2020 wehbe et al 2020 might not be able to generate satisfactory samples if the rain gauges have a skewed distribution e g qtp this might bring some uncertainties to the subregional scale results further efforts are needed to investigate the impacts of the sampling methods on the precipitation merging results this study produced a gauge only product using the idw interpolation algorithm to better evaluate the added value of the merged precipitation products although the idw method is a popular and computationally efficient interpolation method it has several deficiencies such as the neglection of the influence of topography on precipitation xu et al 2015 and the generation of the bull s eyes phenomenon achilleos 2008 which limits its precipitation estimation accuracy especially in the mountainous areas with complex terrains such as the subregion qtp hence the findings of the study might not be applicable if some other more advanced interpolation algorithms e g micromet liston and elder 2006 are used for the development of the gauge only product the gauge based precipitation observations even subjected to the quality control might still have biases sourced from the wind induced gauge undercatch wetting and evaporation losses and underestimation of trace precipitation ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2020a moreover as shown in fig 1 the rain gauges are unevenly distributed over the chinse mainland i e biased toward the low elevation and coastal areas the uncertainties associated with rain gauges would propagate to the precipitation merging results considering that the gauge based observations serve as the target or response variable for the ml algorithms lastly only the topographical and geographical covariates and the spatial autocorrelation information were incorporated into the precipitation merging framework other predictors such as the satellite based surface soil moisture kumar et al 2019 and the cloud properties sharifi et al 2019 could also provide valuable information for the precipitation estimates but they were not considered in the study this opens for further investigations in the future 6 conclusions a novel double machine learning dml approach was proposed to merge multiple spps i e imerg sm2rain ascat perisann and gsmap and gauge observations over the chinese mainland the classification model of random forest rf was used together with the regression models of rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm to develop the dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm the traditional single machine learning sml approach developed based solely on the regression models of rf ann svm and elm and three linear merging methods were also adopted in the study for the comparison purpose we totally produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm four of the sml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm three of the linear merging methods i e iewv oora and owa and another one product generated via the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation algorithm the gauge only interpolated product and the original spps serve as the benchmarks for the evaluations of the added value of the merged products the gauge observation at 697 gauges were obtained over the chinese mainland of which 70 i e 493 gauges were used for the training of the ml algorithm or for the interpolation while the remaining 30 i e 204 gauges for the performance evaluations the continuous and categorical metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge the probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi were adopted for the performance assessments results indicate that the dml algorithms achieves a better performance than the other merging methods the gauge only interpolation and the original spps over the chinese mainland the median kge range 0 67 0 71 for the merged products of the dml algorithms while they range 0 31 0 54 0 62 0 54 0 55 and 0 47 0 65 respectively for the original spps the gauge only interpolated product the linear merged products and the sml based products at the subregional scale the dml based products could achieve increments of the keg by up to 0 32 or 249 94 and 0 22 or 135 26 6 78 or more than 10 times respectively in comparison to the best performed spp the interpolated product and the sml based products the better performance of dml than sml is mainly due to that the former could achieve a higher capability in describing the temporal variations of precipitation regarding to the detectability of precipitation events the dml based products also outperform the other products with the threshold of 1 mm day and perform better than the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds the increase of the median csi threshold 1 mm day could be up to 0 19 or 60 01 0 08 or 27 56 and 0 25 or 378 04 respectively in comparison to the best performed spp the gauge only interpolated product and the sml based products over the chinese mainland further analyses indicate that the dml based products could perform better than the original spps even with a small training dataset size meanwhile the added value of the merged product of dml relative to the original spps shows an upward trend with increasing rain gauge densities while that relative to the gauge only interpolated product exhibits a downward in addition the ensemble of the dml algorithms proves to have little potential for the further improvements of the precipitation estimates the comparisons of the ml algorithms demonstrate that rf performs best among the four sml methods and rf rf and rf ann perform better than the other two dml algorithms i e rf svm and rf elm the major contribution of the study lies in two aspects one is that we proposed a novel dml approach to merge multiple spps and gauge observations and tested its reliability and validity over the chinese mainland the other is that to our best knowledge this is the first attempt to compare the performances of different ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation especially with the consideration of the influence of rain gauge density 7 codes availability codes of the dml and sml algorithms used to merge spps and gauge observations are freely available at https github

4869,this study proposed a novel double machine learning dml approach to merge multiple satellite based precipitation products spps and gauge observations and tested its reliability and validity over the chinese mainland the dml approach was mainly developed based on the classification model of random forest rf in combination with the regression models of the machine learning ml algorithms including rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm this led to four dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf lm the performance of the dml algorithms were compared to the single machine learning sml algorithms developed based solely on the regression models of rf ann svm and elm and to the liner merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting the one outlier removed average and the optimized weight average in total we produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms four of the sml algorithms three of the liner merging methods and another one generated via the gauge only interpolation the precipitation observations at 697 gauges were spatially and randomly divided into two parts i e 70 and 30 one was used for the training of the ml algorithms or for the interpolation while the other for the performance evaluations results indicate that the dml algorithms outperform the other merging methods the gauge only interpolation and the original spps over the chinese mainland the median kling gupta efficiency kge ranges 0 67 0 71 for the merged products of dml which are obviously higher than the original spps 0 31 0 54 the linear merged product 0 54 0 55 gauge only interpolated product 0 62 and the sml based products 0 47 0 65 the dml based products also exhibit better performances than the other products in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day and outperform the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds further analyses imply that i the dml based products could outperform the original spps even with a small training dataset size ii the superiority of the dml approach to sml is mainly due to that the former can better capture the temporal dynamics of precipitation iii the added values of the merged products of dml relative to the original spps and the gauge only product vary with the sizes of the training dataset and iv the ensemble of the dml algorithms could not further improve the accuracy of the precipitation estimates this study not only provided an effective and robust tool for the fusion of multiple spps and gauge observations but also for the first time compared the performance of various ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation keywords precipitation merging satellite based precipitation product machine learning gauge density chinese mainland 1 introduction precipitation is one of the key components in the hydrological and atmospheric cycles it is essential not only to the understanding of water balance and climate variability markonis et al 2019 du et al 2020 but also to a wide range of applications such as flood forecasting breugem et al 2020 drought monitoring zhong et al 2019 water resource managements brodeur and steinschneider 2020 and hydrological and earth system modeling tesfa et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b however it is very challenging to obtain high quality precipitation estimates at fine spatial temporal resolutions xie and xiong 2011 rain gauges are the traditional and reliable tools used to measure point scale precipitation which typically serve as the benchmark for the evaluation of various precipitation products however they are scarcely and unevenly distributed in most regions of the world sharifi et al 2019 beck et al 2020 and the spatial continuous precipitation estimates based solely on gauge based observations are subjected to large uncertainties baez villanueva test et al 2020 over the last few decades the rapid development of remote sensing techniques provides an unprecedented opportunity for estimating spatial continuous precipitation at the global scale satellite based precipitation products spps are increasingly available to the public which significantly improved our understanding of the precipitation characteristics chen and gao 2018 gupta et al 2019 markonis et al 2019 and promoted a variety of hydrometeorological applications munier et al 2014 belabid et al 2019 pellet et al 2019 especially over the gauge sparse regions nevertheless the spps are inherently subjected to large uncertainties and biases arising from the retrieval algorithms the indirect measurements and the deficiencies of the sensors e g the false precipitation detections by infrared sensors if cold nonprecipitating clouds exist and the undervalue of localized storm events by microwave sensors bharti and singh 2015 ebrahimi et al 2017 they typically have trouble in estimating heavy and solid rainfall xu et al 2017 as well as the local orographic precipitation bharti and singh 2015 the gauge based precipitation observations have high accuracy but with limited coverages and uneven distributions on the other hand the spps have continuous and large coverages but with large biases hence in recent years many efforts have been made to merge spps and gauge observations to improve the accuracy and spatial coverage of the precipitation estimates nie et al 2015 yang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 beck et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 xu et al 2020 a variety of methods have been proposed to merge satellite and gauge based precipitation including i the simplest linear merging methods e g the one outlier removed average shen et al 2014 the inverse error variance weighting mastrantonas et al 2019 and the inverse root mean square error weighting yang et al 2017 ii the bias correction or residual based methods e g the probability mapping method zhang and tang 2015 the geographical difference ratio analysis duan and bastiaanssen 2013 bai et al 2019 and the kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 iii the intermediate complexity approaches e g the geographically weighted regression gwr chao et al 2018 and the optimal interpolation technique xie and xiong 2011 nie et al 2015 and iv some other more complex methods such as the bayesian model averaging bma scheme ma et al 2018 rahman et al 2020 and the kriging based algorithms manz et al 2016 chen et al 2020a these merging methods have proved to be effective in improving the accuracy of precipitation estimates nevertheless most of them are subjected to strong ad hoc assumptions that may not hold true in reality wu et al 2020 more specifically i the linear average method assumes a linear relationship between the output and the merging members ii the optimal interpolation technique assumes a sole dependence of the error variance on precipitation intensity iii the geographically weighted regression method hypothesizes a non linear correlation between the dependent variables iv the bias correction method assumes an unbiased estimation of the precipitation background field by the spps and v the bma and kriging based methods assume a normal gaussian distribution of precipitation moreover many of the methods are applicable to blending gauge based observations with only one single spp as we know each spp could have its own pros and cons and might show varying performance for different regions and timescales for instance zhang et al 2020a found that the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg early run product outperforms the sm2rain ascat product in the humid subregions of china while the contrary is the case in the semi arid subregions the fusion of gauge based observations with multiple spps instead of one single spp might be more favorable for the improvement of the precipitation estimates chen et al 2020b lastly to our best knowledge there are few studies devoted to compare the performance of the merged precipitation products with the gauge only interpolated product especially in the conditions of different rain gauge densities these few exceptions include the studies of wang and lin 2015 and bai et al 2019 a comparison to the gauge only interpolated precipitation however is very important for the evaluation of the added value of the merged products and could provide valuable information to the data users for instance the gauge only interpolated precipitation might be more preferred than the spps or the merged precipitation products for hydrological modeling providing it shows a higher performance zhang et al 2020b the machine learning ml algorithms known as data driven methods have received increasing popularity in hydrology and climate sciences sharifi et al 2019 wang et al 2019 boucher et al 2020 lin et al 2020 merz et al 2020 many studies have been carried out to bias correct or merge spps by taking the advantages of the ml techniques yang and luo 2014 corrected the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa product by using a back propagation bp neural network bhuiyan et al 2018 and ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 investigated the use of the quantile regression forests qrf for blending multiple spps with the atmospheric reanalysis precipitation dataset and evaluated its performance over the tropical regions with complex terrains kumar et al 2019 corrected the near real time tmpa product by combining it with nrt soil moisture through a nonlinear support vector machine based regression svr model recently baez villanueva et al 2020 proposed a rf based approach to combine multiple spps with the gauge observations in chile wu et al 2020 presented a spatiotemporal deep fusion model to merge satellite and gauge based precipitation in china bhuiyan et al 2020 employed two ml algorithms i e the rf and neural networks to generate an error corrected imerg product over the brahmaputra river basin wehbe et al 2020 adopted the artificial neural networks anns to derived a multi source precipitation product by fusing weather radar satellite retrievals and surface parameters previous studies demonstrated a great potential of the ml algorithms in correcting and merging spps the ml technique has at least the following advantages relative to the traditional precipitation merging methods hengl et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2020 wu et al 2020 i it can deal well with the complex and non linear relationships between inputs and output ii it contains no rigid assumption iii it is of great flexibility to incorporate multiple types of explanatory variables iv it has the capability of blending gauge observations with multiple spps and v it is easy to implement nevertheless few of the previous studies incorporated the spatial autocorrelation information of the gauge based observations into the precipitation merging framework moreover typically the regression model of the ml algorithm was solely used for the precipitation fusion the combined use of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms which could improve the rain no rain detection skill chen et al 2010 however has rarely been reported in the previous studies in addition to our best knowledge few efforts were made to compare the performance of different ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation and to assess the added value of their merged products relative to the gauge only product especially with the consideration of the influence of rain gauge density in the study we proposed a novel double machine learning dml approach developed based on the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms to merge multiple spps and gauge observations the reliability and validity of the new precipitation merging method were tested over the chinese mainland our major objectives are threefold i to evaluate the effectiveness of the dml algorithms ii to compare the performance of dml to the traditional single machine learning sml methods the linear merging methods and the gauge only interpolation and iii to assess the added value of the merged products of dml relative to the original spps and the gauge only interpolated product the rest of the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the study region and data are briefly introduced in section 2 section 3 describes the methodology of the study the results and discussion are presented in section 4 and section 5 respectively the conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the chinese mainland which covers a large geographical area of about 9 6 million km2 was selected as the study region in this research as depicted in fig 1 the chinese mainland exhibits a strong variability of the elevations ranging from 152 m below the sea level in eastern china to 7528 m above the sea level on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp according to the gradients of elevations and the precipitation patterns eight subregions can be subdivided from the chinese mainland chen et al 2013 chen and li 2016 including xinjiang xj qinghai tibetan plateau qtp northeast china nec north china nc southeast china sec northwest china nwc the middle and downstream areas of yangtze river basin yz and the southwest yungui plateau ygp the subregions xj and nwc have an arid and semi arid climate with scarce precipitation and intensive evaporation yz ygp and sec have a tropical and sub tropical climate nec and nc have a temperate monsoon climate of medium latitudes with hot and wet summer and cold and dry winter and qtp has a distinct plateau climate with strong radiation low temperature and highly variable precipitation 2 2 data 2 2 1 gauge observations the precipitation observations at 697 rain gauges were used for training and testing the ml algorithms as plotted in fig 1 the rain gauges are unevenly distributed over the chinese mainland with an obvious lower density in the subregions xj nwc and qtp than the remaining subregions we collected the half daily precipitation observations for the period 2007 2011 from the china meteorological data service center cmdsc http data cma cn the half daily precipitation are the accumulated data between 20 00 8 00 and 8 00 20 00 beijing time utc 8 respectively the dataset have been subjected to strict quality controls shen et al 2010 zhao and yatagai 2014 including i the manual inspection and correction ii the extreme values check iii the spatio temporal consistency check and iv the internal consistency check e g the duplicated data and incorrect units 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation products as listed in table 1 three near real time spps including imerg persiann precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks and gsmap global satellite mapping of precipitation and one bottom up spp generated from the ascat soil moisture product i e sm2rain ascat were selected in this study the spatial resolutions of these products were unified to 0 1 0 1 by using the nearest neighboring interpolation algorithm to ensure a spatial consistency the daily precipitation of the selected spps are consistently the accumulated data for the period 00 00 24 00 utc which however are different from the gauge observations that represent the accumulations between 20 00 and 20 00 utc 8 in the study we recalculated the daily precipitation observations by adding the accumulated data between 8 00 and 20 00 utc 8 in the current day to that between 20 00 and 8 00 utc 8 in the next day as done in our previous study zhang et al 2020a the recalculations would lead the gauge observations to be the accumulated precipitation data between 0 00 and 24 00 utc or 8 00 and 8 00 utc 8 which is in line with the spps the imerg product was generated through the intercalibration interpolation and integration of all microwave satellite based precipitation estimates precipitation gauge analyses microwave calibrated infrared ir satellite estimates and other precipitation estimators huffman et al 2014 it currently covers the quasi global areas ranging 60 n 60 s with a 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution huffman et al 2019 the daily accumulated imerg early run product version 6 simply referred to as imerg was used in this study the data was downloaded from the national aeronautics and space administration at the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc https disc gsfc nasa gov the persiann product was produced using the network function classification approximation procedures based on the geostationary ir brightness temperature image and daytime visible imagery sorooshian et al 2000 nguyen et al 2019 it covers 60 s to 60 n globally with a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution from 2000 to present the data released in a near real time manner with 2 day delay was developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine uci we collected the data from the chrs data portal at the website http chrsdata eng uci edu the gsmap product was produced using the japan science and technology agency jaxa global rainfall watch system based on the combined mw ir algorithm using extensive satellite data from both passive microwave pmw and infrared ir sensors kubota et al 2007 it has a quasi global coverage 60 s 60 n with high spatial and temporal resolutions 0 1 0 1 1 h the daily accumulated gsmap early run product gsmap nrt simply referred to as gsmap was used in this research the data was obtained from the earth observation research center of jaxa at the website https hokusai eorc jaxa jp the sm2rain ascat product were generated by applying the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2013 to the ascat soil moisture product brocca et al 2019 it was provided at the global scale with a high spatial resolution of 12 5 km and a daily temporal resolution the data was selected because it was generated form the satellite based soil moisture product in a bottom up manner and could compensate the deficiency of the top down spps zhang et al 2020a the newly released version of sm2rain ascat version 1 1 simply referred to as sm2rain was collected from zenodo at the website https zenodo org record 3405563 3 methodology the workflow of the study is briefly illustrated in fig 2 we adopted four traditional sml schemes and four newly proposed dml algorithms to merge multiple spps i e imerg sm2rain perisann and gsmap and gauge observations the sml algorithms were developed based solely on the regression models of random forest rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm the dml algorithms however were developed based on the classification model of the random forest rf in combination with the regression models of rf ann svm and elm this leads to four different dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm moreover the linear satellite gauge merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting ievw the one outlier removed average oora and the optimized weight average owa were also adopted in the study for the comparison with the ml based precipitation methods details about the sml and dml algorithms will be presented in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 respectively and those about the liner merging methods in section 3 2 in addition a gauge only precipitation product was generated by using the simple but robust idw i e inverse distance weighting interpolation algorithm camera et al 2014 it was used together with the original spps as the benchmarks for the evaluation of the added value of the merged products of dml in the study the gauge observations were randomly and spatially subdivided into two parts i e 70 and 30 one was used as the training dataset while the other as the test dataset this is done by randomly sampling 70 of all the available gauges in each subregion separately considering the uneven distribution of the rain gauges if the sampling was performed for the entire chinese mainland the training and test dataset would be biased toward the southeastern regions due to the higher rain gauge densities in total this study produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms four of the sml algorithms three of the linear merging methods and one additional gauge only interpolated product these products and the original spps were evaluated based on the test dataset by using both the continuous and categorical metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi 3 1 machine learning based satellite gauge merging methods fig 3 presents the framework of the ml based methods used to merge spps and gauge observations a critical and preliminary step is to choose informative auxiliary variables the geographical and topographical covariates including latitude longitude subregion id and altitude were selected to account for the spatial variations of precipitation and the influences of topography on precipitation patterns the other topographical variables including slope aspect terrain shadows and roughness were tested to have minimal impacts on the merged results and they were excluded from the ml models in addition the geographical correlation information i e the spatial autocorrelation of the precipitation observations were incorporated into the precipitation merging framework following the previous studies li et al 2017 hengl et al 2018 baez villanueva et al 2020 the rationale behind this is that the nearer observations are more informative than the farther ones for the precipitation estimates we defined two covariates i e ne and pop to account for the spatial autocorrelation between the gauge observations 1 ne i 1 n w i p i i 1 n w i w i 1 d i 2 2 pop i 1 n w i po i i 1 n w i w i 1 d i 2 po i 0 p i 0 1 p i 0 where ne is the precipitation estimates from the neighbor observations di is the distance to the i th neighbor gauge pop is the probability of precipitation occurrence thornton et al 1997 poi is the binary variable related to occurrence of observed precipitation and pi is the precipitation at the i th neighbor gauge after the determination of the auxiliary variables the sml section 3 1 1 and dml section 3 1 2 algorithms were trained and calibrated at each day of the period 2007 2011 by using the training dataset i e the observations at 493 gauges fig 1 the day to day training strategy was tested to be more effective and computationally efficient than the periodic training strategy e g month to month and year to year afterwards the trained ml algorithms were used to predict daily precipitation at the test gauges for the same period i e 2007 2011 the observations at the test gauges which are completely independent from the training dataset would benefit a robust performance evaluation of the ml algorithms the assessments were carried out at the daily scale over the entire study period 2007 2011 with some attention paid to the seasonal and subregional variations of the performance 3 1 1 single machine learning approach the principle of the sml based merging method is to build a transfer function between the predictors and the output based on the regression model of the ml algorithm as 3 p merg f x s x a e r r o r where pmerg is the output which represents the gauge based and merged precipitation respectively at the training and test prediction stages f is the transfer function built with the ml regression model xs and xa are the predictors of which the former represents the precipitation estimates of spps while the later represents the auxiliary variables in the study the popular ml algorithms including rf ann svm and elm were used to construct the transfer functions which leads to four different sml based precipitation merging methods 1 random forest rf the rf algorithm is an ensemble ml approach that aggregates the results of multiple decision tree models breiman 2001 the randomness of rf mainly reflects in two aspects one is the random samples and the other is the random features or predictors the bootstrap method is used to generate the random samples from the training dataset which are further adopted to construct a number of decision trees at each decision tree the internal splits are generated according to the randomly selected features rf could substantially alleviate the overfitting problems and improve the generalization capability owing to the random selections of the input samples and predictors and the use of ensemble predictions this study implemented the rf algorithm using the matlab treebagger function as shown in table 2 the hyperparameters including the ntree and minobs were determined for the rf algorithm through the trial and error procedures they were identified as 50 and 5 respectively the hyperparameter nsplit i e the number of variables randomly sampled at each decision split was set to one third of the number of the input variables following the previous studies beck et al 2019 baez villanueva test et al 2020 the treebagger has a built in function to measure the relative importance of the different predictors this is done through the method based on permutation feature importance pfi by using the out of bag oob samples i e the samples not selected by the bootstrap approach he et al 2016 schmidt et al 2020 the underlying principle of pfi is to broke the ties between the target and one of the predictors and then estimate the prediction accuracy deterioration schmidt et al 2020 the stronger of the deterioration the more important of the predictor for the model s prediction more specifically pfi is estimated with the following steps i calculating the original prediction error i e the mean squared error for the regression tree and the misclassification probability for the classification tree across the oob observations for the j th decision tree i e erroobj ii generating the permuted predictor matrix by shuffling the i th predictor while keeping the others fixed and re estimating the prediction error for the j th decision tree i e erroobi j iii calculating the increase in the prediction error increerrori j after shuffling the i th predictor using the eq 4 and lastly iv estimating pfi of the i th predictor pfii by averaging the increerrori j and dividing it by the standard deviation σ over the decision trees using eq 5 4 increerrori i j erroobi i j erroob j 5 pfi i 1 ntree j ntree increerrori i j σ increerrori i j i 1 2 3 10 2 artificial neural network ann the ann algorithm is an information processing paradigm inspired by the biological neural networks gardner and dorling 1998 the basic elements of ann are the neurons or units which are interconnected by the weighted links at each unit the output is computed by a transfer or active function of the weighted summation of the inputs the multilayer perceptron mlp with a three layer structure i e the input hidden and output layers which are one of the widely used forms of the ann algorithms was used in the study we implemented the ann algorithm using the matlab fitnet function this study setted the transfer functions tranfunc as tansig for both the hidden and output layers of ann as presented in table 2 the hyperparameters including the nnh and iw were optimized through a parallel computing based and grid research pc gr approach more specifically we considered 3 nnh i e 10 20 30 and 10 random iw i e 30 grids and searched the best 10 grids through the cross validation the searching processes were implemented via the parallel computing technique to improve the computational efficiency the ensemble average of the precipitation estimations with the best 10 parameter sets were used as the final predictions 3 support vector machine svm the svm is a popular ml algorithm widely used for both classification and regression purposes vapnik 1998 the classification model of the svm aims to find a hyperplane whereby the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible on the other hand the regression model aims to find a hyperplane expressed by a regression function that best describes the observed outputs with an error tolerance in addition to linear problems svms can also deal efficiently with non linear problems by using the kernel function to map the non linear inputs to linearly separable and high dimensional feature spaces in this study the svm algorithm was implemented by using the libsvm package chang and lin 2011 the kernel function kernfunc was set as the radial basis function rbf through the trial and error procedure the two stage pc gr approach was applied to optimize the two hyperparameters of svm including c and γ we first determined the best parameter set c1 and γ1 from the coarse grids c γ 810 2 10 through the cross validation and then searched the fine grids centered on c1 and γ1 i e c1 2 0 2 c1 2 γ1 2 0 2 γ1 2 to identify the final best parameter set similarly the parallel computing technique was used to accelerate the optimization and training processes 4 extreme learning machine elm the elm algorithm proposed by huang et al 2012 has the similar structure as the mlp with one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer after randomly initializing the weights and bias between the input and hidden layers the weights between the hidden and output layers are directly estimated as the product of the moore penrose generalized inverse of the output matrix of the hidden layer and the target variable this is quite different from the mlp that estimates the weights between the hidden and output layers via an iterative learning process the distinct feature leads to a high computational efficiency of the elm algorithm the codes of elm are available at https www ntu edu sg home egbhuang elm codes html we modified the original codes to get an ensemble prediction of the 10 best estimates of elm through the parallel computing based optimization process similar to ann these efforts are mainly devoted to ameliorate the impact of the random initial weights and biases between the input and hidden layers and the influence of different number of nodes in the hidden layer 3 1 2 double machine learning approach inspired by the work of chen et al 2010 this study proposed a novel dml approach based the classification and regression models of the ml algorithm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations as presented in fig 4 we first developed a classification model by using one of the ml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm the precipitation observations that are greater than zero were classified as wet day while those are equal to zero as dry day the classified precipitation observations were used together with the input variables to train and optimize the classification model of each ml algorithm which refers to the first ml the training and optimization processes are similar to the regression models of the ml algorithms section 3 1 1 with the difference that the optimization objectives are the classification accuracy of the precipitation events afterwards the classification accuracy of dry wet day for each ml algorithm was evaluated based on the independent test dataset fig 1 and the best performed ml algorithm was identified the classification accuracy ca was defined as 6 ca 1 n i 1 n w i d i t i where wi and di are the total number of days correctly classified as wet day and dry day respectively at the i th gauge ti is the total number of days over the evaluation period i e 2007 2011 and n is the total number of gauges in the test dataset i e 204 in our case at the second stage we trained the regression model of each ml algorithm to estimate precipitation at the day that was predicted as wet day similar to the sml approach which refers to the second ml the amount of precipitation was set to zero if the day was predicted as dry day by the classification model of the ml algorithm hence the merged products of dml were generated by combining the predictions of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms at the two separate stages the wet dry day classification accuracy of the classification and regression models of the ml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm are listed in table 3 the classification models show very comparable classification accuracy 0 888 0 889 which are obviously higher than the regression models 0 286 0 450 the preliminary analysis indicates that the inclusion a classification model into the precipitation merging framework is reasonable and could improve the rain no rain detection skill in this study we selected the classification model of rf for the classification purpose due to its slightly better performance and higher computational efficiency relative to the other ml algorithms this led to four different dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm 3 2 linear satellite gauge merging methods this study adopted three linear precipitation merging methods including the inverse error variance weighting ievw the optimized weight average owa and the one outlier removed average oora which are described in eqs 7 8 and 9 respectively 7 p merg 1 i 1 n 1 e i 2 i 1 n 1 e i 2 s i 8 p merg i 1 n wopt i s i 9 p merg 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 s i where pmerg is the merged precipitation n is the number of spps si is the i th spp e is the error variance and wopt is the optimized weight the error variance and weight of each spp were calculated for the ievw method based on the training dataset and the weights of spps were optimized for the owa method with the objective of minimizing the root mean square error rmse between the precipitation estimates and the observations in the training dataset afterwards the weights were used by the ievw and owa methods to predict precipitation at the test gauges regarding to the oora method one of the spps that has the largest rmse was removed and regarded as the outlier and the arithmetic average of the precipitation estimates of the remaining spps was used as the merged results 3 3 performance evaluation the kling gupta efficiency kge proposed by gupta et al 2009 was used for the performance evaluations as shown in eq 10 the kge is a multi component performance metric that includes the correlation coefficient cc the bias ratio beta and the variability ratio gama which measure the correlation bias and relative temporal variability between the precipitation estimates and the gauge observations respectively 10 kge 1 1 c c 2 1 b e t a 2 1 g a m a 2 11 cc i 1 n p i merg p mean merg o i o mean i 1 n p i merg p mean merg 2 i 1 n o i o mean 2 12 beta μ merg μ o 13 gama σ merg σ o where p and o are the merged precipitation and the observations respectively at the test gauges µ is the mean value σ is the standard deviation i is the time step and n is the total number of time steps in the study following kling et al 2012 we calculated the gama by using eq 14 instead of e q 13 to ensure the variability and bias ratios are not cross correlated 14 gama σ merg μ merg σ o μ o the ranges of the kge cc beta and gama are 1 1 1 0 and 0 respectively the closer of the kge and its components to unity the better the performance of the precipitation products in addition we adopted four categorical metrics to assess the capability of the products in detecting precipitation events they are the probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi which are defined as in eqs 15 16 17 and 18 respectively 15 p o d a a c 16 s r a a b 17 b s p o d s r a b a c 18 c s i a a b c where a is the number of precipitation events correctly detected b is the number of non events that are incorrectly detected i e event was detected to occur but not observed to occur c is the number of the missing events i e event was not detected to occur but observed to occur the four metrics were mapped on a single diagram proposed by roebber 2009 to better visualize the evaluation results the closer of the metrics to the upper right of the diagram the better detectability of precipitation events the perfect performance is reached when pod sr csi bs 1 the categorical metrics were computed at each test gauge for the precipitation thresholds of 1 5 10 and 15 mm day respectively 3 4 sensitivity analysis of training dataset size a sensitivity analysis was additionally conducted to investigate the impacts of training dataset size on the performance of the dml algorithms and the gauge only interpolation this is done by reducing the size of the original training dataset and analyzing the changes of the accuracy of the precipitation estimates at the test gauges specifically speaking the size of the training dataset i e the proportions of rain gauges in the training dataset was first randomly reduced to 80 60 40 and 20 of its original size that includes 493 gauges the reduction processes were implemented for each subregion separately to ensure the condensed training dataset is representative over the chinese mainland afterwards we repeated the dml based merging process and the interpolation process with the different sizes of the training dataset lastly we analyzed the variations of the performance of the dml algorithms and the gauge only interpolation with the decreasing sizes of the training dataset the sensitivity analysis would facilitate an evaluation of the robustness and reliability of the dml algorithms 4 results 4 1 performance assessment over the chinese mainland 4 1 1 overall performance fig 5 shows the boxplots of the kge and its components cc beta and gama for the sixteen precipitation products over the chinese mainland the median kge values are relatively small for gsmap perisann and sm2rain which are 0 39 0 31 and 0 32 respectively fig 5 a the imerg product performs the best among the original spps with a median kge of 0 54 the merged products produced by the three sml algorithms i e rf ann and elm achieve higher median kge values than the original spps which are 0 65 0 60 and 0 60 respectively the median kge of the merged product generated by svm however is smaller than the imerg product the products of the linear merging methods i e oora owa and ievw show comparable performances to the imerg product in terms of kge regarding to the gauge only interpolated product i e idw interestingly it provides a comparable and even higher median kge than the products of the sml algorithms and the linear merging methods the merged products of the dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm have consistently higher median kge 0 67 0 71 than the other precipitation products fig 5 b shows the boxplots of the correlation coefficients cc for the different precipitation products the merged products of sml and dml give comparable median cc which are higher than other products the original spps have the lowest cc ranging 0 46 0 64 among the sixteen precipitation products the median bias ratios beta as show in fig 5 c are closer to unity with smaller ranges for the dml based and rf based products and the gauge only interpolated product in comparison to other products as present in fig 5 d the median variability ratio gama for the products of dml range from 0 83 to 0 90 which are apparently higher than those of sml 0 66 0 76 and the linear merged and gauge only interpolated products 0 70 0 72 the median gama of imerg gsmap and perisann are close to unity but with large ranges in comparison to the other products overall the merged products of the dml algorithms outperform the other merged products and the gauge only interpolated product in terms of kge fig 6 shows the roebber s performance diagrams for the sixteen precipitation products with different precipitation thresholds over the chinese mainland the merged products of the dml algorithms exhibit the best performance in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day followed by the rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product the linear merged products and the products of ann svm and elm achieve comparable median csi values but larger bs to the imerg and gsmap products with respect to the precipitation events higher than 5 mm day i e precipitation threshold 5 mm day the merged products of the dml algorithms perform comparable to those of the sml algorithms except svm they consistently perform better than the other products as shown in fig 6a c and d comparing the results for different precipitation thresholds all the products tend to show lower detectability of the precipitation events with larger magnitudes as indicated by the decreasing csi values regardless the merged products of the dml algorithms outperform the other products in detecting precipitation events with the threshold of 1 mm day and perform better than the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds 4 1 2 seasonal performance fig 7 presents the boxplots of the kge and csi for the 16 precipitation products in the seasons of spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february in terms of kge the original spps consistently perform worse than the products of the dml algorithms in all of the seasons the linear merged products obviously outperform gsmap sm2rain and persiann in spring autumn and winter while they perform worse than the gauge only interpolated product the imerg product shows a comparable performance to the merged product in spring and summer although it exhibits a lower performance in autumn and winter the products of the sml algorithms including elm svm and ann generally perform better than the original spps but they perform worse than the gauge only interpolated product in the different seasons the products of the dml algorithms show higher performances than other products in terms of kge in spring summer and autumn in winter the products of the dml and rf algorithms and the gauge only interpolation achieve comparable higher performances than the other products in terms of csi the products of the dml algorithms outperform all the other products in spring summer and autumn with the precipitation threshold of 1 mm day followed by rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product as shown in fig 7e f and g in winter the products of the dml rf and ann algorithms perform comparable to the gauge only interpolated product but outperform the remaining products 4 2 performance assessment at the subregional scale fig 8 shows the boxplots of the kge for the sixteen precipitation products over the eight subregions of the chinese mainland the merged products of the dml algorithms perform better than the other products in most of the subregions including sec yz nc ygp nec and nwc in the subregion qtp the product of rf rf performs best among the sixteen precipitation products followed by those of rf ann rf and rf svm the products of rf rf rf ann and rf svm perform better than the other products in the subregion xj while the product of rf elm perform worse than sm2rain and the gauge only interpolated product fig 9 presents the roebber s performance diagrams for the different precipitation products over the different subregions the products of dml outperform the other products in detecting precipitation events threshold 1 mm day in all the subregions especially in the subregion xj the rf based product and the gauge only interpolated product show higher performances than the other products except those of dml all of the precipitation products tend to perform worse in xj than in the other subregions the performances for the merged and interpolated products can vary substantially over the eight subregions this can be explained by the varying densities of the rain gauges used for the training of the ml algorithms or for the interpolation and the varying complexities of the spatial temporal variabilities of precipitation nevertheless our results indicate that in terms of kge and csi the merged products of the dml algorithms generally perform better than the other precipitation products at the sub regional scale 4 3 influence of training dataset size on the performance of the dml algorithms fig 10 shows the boxplots of the kge for the dml based precipitation products i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm and the gauge only interpolated product i e idw at the test gauges with the different sizes of the training dataset the kge ranges of the best performed spp i e imerg which is independent of the size of the training dataset were also provided for the comparison purpose we can observe the decreasing trends of the performances for the merged and gauge only interpolated products when the size of the training dataset i e the proportions of rain gauges in the training dataset reduces from 100 to 20 nevertheless the deteriorations of the performance are more significant for the gauge only interpolated product than the dml based product taking a close look we can note that the performance of the interpolated product is comparable and even worse than the best spp when the proportion of gauges in the training dataset drops below 40 the dml based products however consistently perform better than the best spp regardless of the size of the training dataset meanwhile the performances of the dml based products only show slight decreases when the size of the training dataset drop from 100 to 60 the sensitive analysis implies that the newly proposed dml approach is robust and has obvious advantages over the gauge only interpolation in the condition of low training dataset size 5 discussion 5 1 relative importance of the predictors an analysis of the relative importance of the predictors could help to better understand and interpret the ml algorithm in this study the relative importance of the selected predictors i e permuted feature importance pfi for the classification and regression models of the rf algorithm which are employed by the dml approach i e rf rf were estimated using the matlab treebagger function as shown in fig 11 all the predictors achieve the pfi higher than 0 15 for both the classification and regression models indicating that they could contribute useful information to the precipitation merging results the spatial autocorrelation predictors i e ne and pop and the spps including gsmap sm2rain and imerg exhibit higher importance than the other predictors this indicates that it is very important to include the spatial autocorrelation information of the gauge observations in the ml based precipitation merging framework which could help to incorporate the geographical laws into ml yuan et al 2020 the persiann product shows an obviously lower importance than the other spps i e gsmap sm2rain and imerg which might be explained by its coarser spatial resolution the time invariant covariates including altitude longitude attitude and region id present are of relatively low importance which is consistent with the previous reports bhuiyan et al 2018 2020 baez villanueva test et al 2020 5 2 added value of the merged products of the dml algorithms a quantitative assessment of the added value of the merged products relative to the merging members is of great importance for evaluating the effectiveness of the satellite gauge merging method in the study we further analyzed the variations of the added value i e the increase in kge δkge of the dml based products i e rf ann and rf rf relative to the gauge only interpolated product i e idw and the best performed spp i e imerg with increasing rain gauge densities i e the number of gauges per 106 km2 in the training dataset the analyses were performed for the chinese mainland and its five subregions the remaining subregions including the qtp xj and nwc were excluded for the analyses due to the low rain gauge densities as shown in fig 12 the added value of the merged product relative to the best spp consistently exhibits an upward trend with increasing rain gauge densities while that relative to the gauge only interpolated product shows a downward trend the relationships between δkge and the rain gauge densities could be well represented by the logarithmic curves with the coefficients of determination r2 higher than 0 70 in most of the cases the finding agrees well with that reported by bai et al 2019 we can observe from fig 12 that the δkge values are consistently greater than zero in the chinese mainland and its subregions including yz nz nec and ygp with different gauge densities in the training dataset meanwhile they range from 0 09 to 0 54 or 0 06 to 0 55 and 0 11 to 0 98 or 0 07 to 0 97 respectively for the merged product of rf rf or rf ann relative to the best spp and the gauge only interpolated product in the subregions qtp xj and nwc which are shown here the improvement of the precipitation estimates over the different subregions with varying rain gauge densities overall demonstrate the transferability of the proposed dml algorithm in a variety of situations nevertheless we admit the new precipitation merging method is more effective in the regions with scarce or medium rain gauge densities than those with extremely low or high rain gauge densities as reported by wang and lin 2015 and bai et al 2019 the extremely low gauge density would result in a poor representation of the training dataset which might even induce a decrease in the performance of the merged product relative to the original spps as shown in fig 12b on the other hand if the rain gauge density is high enough the precipitation patterns could already be well captured by the gauge based precipitation observations and the incorporation of the precipitation information from the spps would have a limited ability to further improve the precipitation estimates it should be noted that the condition rain gauge density is extreme low or high enough would vary with region to region depending on the topographic and climatic features as well as the selected ml algorithm for instance the added value of merged product of rf ann relative to the gauge only interpolated product will converge to zero in the subregion nc if the rain gauge density is higher than 403 gauges per 106 km2 according to the logarithmic curves shown in fig 12d however it needs to exceed 1000 gauges per 106 km2 in ygp as mentioned before typically the performance of the merged precipitation product is compared solely to the original spps yang et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 chen et al 2020b wu et al 2020 our results however imply that a comparison made to the gauge only interpolated product is of equal importance considering that the added value of the merged product relative to the interpolated product would decrease or even converge to zero with the increasing rain gauge densities moreover we argue that more efforts are needed to investigate whether the added value of the merged product relative to the original spps and to the gauge only interpolated product could be propagated to hydrological modeling liu et al 2016 ur rahman et al 2020 5 3 comparison of the machine learning algorithms this study adopted four sml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm and four dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to compare the performances of different ml algorithms for blending satellite and gauge based precipitation in terms of kge rf performs best while svm performs worst among the sml algorithms over the chinese mainland the superiority of rf to the other sml algorithms tends to be more obvious in the gauge scarce subregions i e nwc qtp and xj than in the other subregions regarding to the dml algorithms rf rf and rf ann perform better than rf svm and rf elm nevertheless there seems no consistent results at the sub regional scale and the performances of the sml and dml algorithms could vary with the subregions the dml algorithms consistently perform better than the sml algorithms in terms of kge and csi precipitation threshold 1 mm day over the chinese mainland the median kge for the dml based products would increase by the ranges from 0 04 to 0 20 or 6 09 to 41 62 relative to the sml based products meanwhile the median csi would increase by the ranges from 0 04 to 0 22 or 7 05 and 52 51 at the sub regional level the increases in the median kge could be up to 6 78 or more than 10 times and the increased in the median csi up to 0 28 or 378 04 the better performance of dml than sml is mainly due to the fact that the former could provide a higher classification accuracy of the dry wet day see table 3 which leads to a better capability in describing the temporal dynamics of precipitation as indicated by the obviously higher beta values see fig 5 d the increase in the median kge could approach to 31 48 for the merged product of rf ann relative to the best spp over the chinese mainland baez villanueva test et al 2020 reported an improvement of their blended product of rf by about 43 in terms of kge in comparison to the best performed merging member the greater improvement could be explained by the fact their rain gauges are apparently denser than ours as shown in fig 12 higher rain gauge densities would lead to more added value of the merged product relative to the merging members in the study of wu et al 2020 the performance improvement of their ml based merged product is about 9 in terms of cc over the chinese mainland which is lower than ours that could be up to 21 the improvement of the precipitation estimates achieved by the dml algorithms also tends to be higher than some other related studies conducted in china ma et al 2018 bai et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a which adopted the non machine learning methods such as the linear merging approach the geographical difference ratio analysis and the bma method the comparisons made to the previous studies prove the effectiveness of our new satellite gauge merging method nevertheless we admit that the dml approach is subjected to some deficiencies as mentioned before it might not be effective in the regions with extremely low or high rain gauge densities moreover it might not facilitate the fusion of real time near real time data due to the fact the gauge based observations are typically unavailable in a real time or near real time manner additionally the approach as well as some other ml based methods have limited abilities to capture extreme precipitation as pointed out by he et al 2016 and bhuiyan et al 2020 5 4 ensemble of the dml algorithms this study developed and adopted four dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm to merge multiple spps and gauge observations it is easy to raise an interesting question i e whether the ensemble of the dml algorithms could further improve the precipitation estimates in order to answer the question we additionally produced three ensemble precipitation products based on the predictions of the four dml algorithms by using the ievw oora and oml optimal machine leaning methods the ievw and oora methods are similar to the linear precipitation merging approaches see section 3 2 with the difference that the spps are replaced by the ensemble members i e the predictions of the dml algorithms the oml method is to select the best performed dml algorithm to predict precipitation the training dataset can t be simultaneously used to train and evaluate the performance of the dml algorithms due to the issue of overfitting and each dml algorithm can provide equally good precipitation estimates in the training process we separated the original training data into two parts one 80 is used to train the dml algorithms and the other 20 to estimate the ensemble weights of the ievw method and to determine the outlier and the best dml algorithm for the oora and oml methods as shown in fig 13 the ensemble precipitation products perform very comparable to the original products of the dml algorithms this indicates that the ensemble of the dml algorithms shows little potential for the further improvement of the precipitation estimates this might be explained by the following reasons one is that the performance of dml is not spatially uniform and can vary significantly over different locations the ensemble weights the outlier and the optimal dml algorithm determined by the 20 of the training dataset might not be applicable to the gauges in the test dataset the other is that the condensed training data 80 will impair the performance of the dml algorithms see section 4 3 which will in turn affect the performance of the ensemble precipitation products 5 5 limitations and uncertainties the spatial scale mismatch between the spps and gauge observations was neglected in the study we assumed the point scale and gauge based precipitation are equal to the grid scale and satellite based precipitation as done in many other studies ebrahimi et al 2017 bai et al 2019 kumar et al 2019 baez villanueva et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a the hypothesis however might not hold true especially over the regions of complex topography which would affect the satellite gauge merging results and meanwhile bring some biases to the performance assessments of the precipitation products in recent years some researchers have attempted to first downscale the grid scale spps to the point scale via the approaches such as the kriging and gwr chen et al 2018 2020a or to first upscale the point scale observation to the grid scale yang et al 2017 and then carried out the satellite gauge merging task these operations might help to ameliorate the influences of the spatial scale mismatch although they would produce additional uncertainties the training and test dataset were sampled for each subregion separately due to the fact the rain gauges are more densely distributed in southeast china than in northwest china the region by region sampling method would benefit a better representation of the training and test dataset over the chinese mainland but not ensure a good representation in all of its subregions this is because the sampling was conducted via a random manner at the subregional scale the random sampling method widely adopted in many previous researches ehsan bhuiyan et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 baez villanueva test et al 2020 wehbe et al 2020 might not be able to generate satisfactory samples if the rain gauges have a skewed distribution e g qtp this might bring some uncertainties to the subregional scale results further efforts are needed to investigate the impacts of the sampling methods on the precipitation merging results this study produced a gauge only product using the idw interpolation algorithm to better evaluate the added value of the merged precipitation products although the idw method is a popular and computationally efficient interpolation method it has several deficiencies such as the neglection of the influence of topography on precipitation xu et al 2015 and the generation of the bull s eyes phenomenon achilleos 2008 which limits its precipitation estimation accuracy especially in the mountainous areas with complex terrains such as the subregion qtp hence the findings of the study might not be applicable if some other more advanced interpolation algorithms e g micromet liston and elder 2006 are used for the development of the gauge only product the gauge based precipitation observations even subjected to the quality control might still have biases sourced from the wind induced gauge undercatch wetting and evaporation losses and underestimation of trace precipitation ye et al 2004 zhang et al 2020a moreover as shown in fig 1 the rain gauges are unevenly distributed over the chinse mainland i e biased toward the low elevation and coastal areas the uncertainties associated with rain gauges would propagate to the precipitation merging results considering that the gauge based observations serve as the target or response variable for the ml algorithms lastly only the topographical and geographical covariates and the spatial autocorrelation information were incorporated into the precipitation merging framework other predictors such as the satellite based surface soil moisture kumar et al 2019 and the cloud properties sharifi et al 2019 could also provide valuable information for the precipitation estimates but they were not considered in the study this opens for further investigations in the future 6 conclusions a novel double machine learning dml approach was proposed to merge multiple spps i e imerg sm2rain ascat perisann and gsmap and gauge observations over the chinese mainland the classification model of random forest rf was used together with the regression models of rf artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm and extreme learning machine elm to develop the dml algorithms including rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm the traditional single machine learning sml approach developed based solely on the regression models of rf ann svm and elm and three linear merging methods were also adopted in the study for the comparison purpose we totally produced twelve precipitation products including four of the dml algorithms i e rf rf rf ann rf svm and rf elm four of the sml algorithms i e rf ann svm and elm three of the linear merging methods i e iewv oora and owa and another one product generated via the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation algorithm the gauge only interpolated product and the original spps serve as the benchmarks for the evaluations of the added value of the merged products the gauge observation at 697 gauges were obtained over the chinese mainland of which 70 i e 493 gauges were used for the training of the ml algorithm or for the interpolation while the remaining 30 i e 204 gauges for the performance evaluations the continuous and categorical metrics including the kling gupta efficiency kge the probability of detection pod success ratio sr bias score bs and critical success index csi were adopted for the performance assessments results indicate that the dml algorithms achieves a better performance than the other merging methods the gauge only interpolation and the original spps over the chinese mainland the median kge range 0 67 0 71 for the merged products of the dml algorithms while they range 0 31 0 54 0 62 0 54 0 55 and 0 47 0 65 respectively for the original spps the gauge only interpolated product the linear merged products and the sml based products at the subregional scale the dml based products could achieve increments of the keg by up to 0 32 or 249 94 and 0 22 or 135 26 6 78 or more than 10 times respectively in comparison to the best performed spp the interpolated product and the sml based products the better performance of dml than sml is mainly due to that the former could achieve a higher capability in describing the temporal variations of precipitation regarding to the detectability of precipitation events the dml based products also outperform the other products with the threshold of 1 mm day and perform better than the original spps regardless of the precipitation thresholds the increase of the median csi threshold 1 mm day could be up to 0 19 or 60 01 0 08 or 27 56 and 0 25 or 378 04 respectively in comparison to the best performed spp the gauge only interpolated product and the sml based products over the chinese mainland further analyses indicate that the dml based products could perform better than the original spps even with a small training dataset size meanwhile the added value of the merged product of dml relative to the original spps shows an upward trend with increasing rain gauge densities while that relative to the gauge only interpolated product exhibits a downward in addition the ensemble of the dml algorithms proves to have little potential for the further improvements of the precipitation estimates the comparisons of the ml algorithms demonstrate that rf performs best among the four sml methods and rf rf and rf ann perform better than the other two dml algorithms i e rf svm and rf elm the major contribution of the study lies in two aspects one is that we proposed a novel dml approach to merge multiple spps and gauge observations and tested its reliability and validity over the chinese mainland the other is that to our best knowledge this is the first attempt to compare the performances of different ml algorithms in merging satellite and gauge based precipitation especially with the consideration of the influence of rain gauge density 7 codes availability codes of the dml and sml algorithms used to merge spps and gauge observations are freely available at https github
