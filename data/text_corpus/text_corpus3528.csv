17640,an improved understanding of the diversity and composition of microbial communities carrying antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence genes vgs in aquifers recharged with stormwater is essential to comprehend potential human health risks from water reuse a high throughput functional gene array was used to study the prevalence of args and vgs in aquifer biofilms n 27 taken from three boreholes over three months bacterial genera annotated as opportunistic pathogens such as aeromonas burkholderia pseudomonas shewanella and vibrio were ubiquitous and abundant in all biofilms bacteria from clinically relevant genera campylobacter enterobacter klebsiella mycobacterium mycoplasma and salmonella were detected in biofilms the mean travel time of stormwater from the injection well to p1 and p3 boreholes was 260 and 360 days respectively the presence of args and vgs in the biofilms from these boreholes suggest a high spatial movement of args and vgs in the aquifer the args with the highest abundance were small multidrug resistance efflux pumps smr and multidrug efflux mex followed by β lactamase c genes β lactamase c encoding genes were primarily detected in enterobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae bacillaceae and rhodobacteraceae families the vgs encoding siderophores including aerobactin iro and iuc genes followed by pilin hemolysin and type iii secretion were ubiquitous canonical correspondence analysis suggested that total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc turbidity and fe concentration has a significant impact on the microbial community structure of

alternative water sources such as stormwater surface water and treated sewage effluent is increasingly used for the production of non potable and indirect potable water in australia usa and europe dillon et al 2010 the presence of pathogens antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in stormwater has been reported previously garner et al 2017 sidhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the environmental resistome comprises both the natural antibiotic resistance gene pool the intrinsic resistome and that resulting from anthropogenic activities the introduction of arb and args into groundwater via recharge water may pose a potential threat to water security and public health which remains un quantified bacterial pathogens even present in low numbers in the recharge water may get embedded in the biofilms which may in turn prolong their survival by providing enhanced resistance to adverse environmental conditions wingender and flemming 2011 the presence of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria in the groundwater and biofilms have been reported previously richards et al 2018 biofilms have been suggested as an ideal setting for horizontal gene transfer hgt due to the presence of high bacterial cell density increased genetic competence and accumulation of mobile genetic elements mges fux et al 2005 however the extent of transfer of args originating from anthropogenic sources to groundwater autochthonous microorganisms in biofilms remains unknown intrinsic antibiotic resistance in bacteria comprises a diverse range of mechanisms related to structural physiological and biochemical functions of bacteria such as insensitivity or reduced permeability to antibiotics efflux systems and metabolic functions baquero et al 2013 multidrug resistance mdr efflux pumps encoded by gram positive and gram negative bacteria have been known to impart resistance to aminoglycosides β lactams macrolides phenicols lincosamides quinolones streptogramins and tetracyclines davies and davies 2010 mges including plasmids insertion sequences transposons integrons genomic islands integrating conjugative elements and bacteriophages are also involved in hgt among bacteria in clinical and environmental settings frost et al 2005 the presence of args and vgs on mges enables their horizontal transfer the spatial and temporal distribution of bacteria carrying args and vgs in aquifers and biofilms is essential to determine the extent of potential human health risks from abstracted water use recent advances in molecular methods such as microarrays and next generation sequencing have ushered in new opportunities for the assessment of antibiotic resistome in the environment functional gene arrays fgas are a high throughput tool that allows a specific sensitive and quantitative profiling of microbial community diversity structure composition and metabolic activity he et al 2010 fgas have been previously used to analyze arg profiles in different environments such as urban watershed low et al 2016 and wastewater zhang et al 2013 to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of clinically relevant bacteria args and vgs in groundwater biofilm samples from aquifer recharged with stormwater were screened with geochip 4 2 the main aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and diversity of bacteria carrying args and vgs in the biofilms developed in a subsurface aquifer environment in particular we were interested in i temporal and spatial distribution and abundance of arb and args in the aquifer recharged with stormwater ii environmental gene pool of clinically relevant virulence factors iii influence of biogeochemical factors on the distribution and abundance of args and vgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 stormwater catchment and aquifer recharge the investigated parafield stormwater harvesting and managed aquifer recharge mar site is located at parafield in adelaide south australia the parafield stormwater catchment has an area of 1 590 ha and is primarily urban 73 it is composed of mainly residential 36 but also has vacant land 13 and industrial areas 8 page et al 2014 the urban stormwater collected from the catchment through the weir on the parafield drain passes through a series of two 50 ml detention basins and a 2 ha constructed wetland prior to direct injection into the tertiary aquifer t2 two separate mar and water recovery options are available at this site i aquifer storage and recovery asr where recharged water is recovered from the injection boreholes ii aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr systems where recharged water is recovered from four separate recovery boreholes fig 1 a detailed description of the operational parameters of the asr and astr scheme was reported previously page et al 2014 there are three observation boreholes p1 p2 and p3 at the astr site located 10 m 20 m and 30 m respectively from the injection borehole iw the mean travel time of injected stormwater from iw to p1 and p3 is 260 and 360 days respectively page et al 2014 we used borehole p1 p3 and asr for the experimental work the aquifer was constantly recharged during the investigation period 91 days 2 2 groundwater water quality profiling groundwater geochemical parameters ph temperature redox potential dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and turbidity were measured in the field using a field lab analyzer tps 90fl tps pty ltd australia groundwater geochemical parameters were recorded at the beginning of the experiment then at a monthly interval at the time of retrieving chambers from the boreholes groundwater grab samples 1l were also collected at the monthly intervals and sent to a commercial laboratory australian water quality centre south australia for chemical analysis nutrients metals toc and doc 2 3 in situ biofilm study set up teflon chambers 25 mm diameter filled with sterile silica wool sc0006 sercon crewe uk were used to provide a physical matrix for the development of biofilm and colonization of microorganisms fig 2 the teflon chambers were fitted with metal mesh discs 3 mm pore diameter which allowed the free flow of water through the silica wool inside the chamber as outlined in our previous study sidhu and toze 2012 prior to the assembly of chambers all parts of the diffusion chambers were sterilized by autoclaving 20 min diffusion chambers n 27 were assembled in a laminar flow cabinet and nine chambers were suspended on a stainless steel wire and lowered into each of the three boreholes p1 p3 and asr so that the uppermost chambers were suspended at 1 m below the water table at a depth of 170 m in the slotted section of the borehole to intercept the flow of groundwater three chambers from each of the three boreholes were removed at 1 2 and 3 months respectively that allowed the development of biofilms and colonization of biofilms by the bacteria from recharged stormwater collected chambers three from each borehole were placed in zip lock bags for transportation to the laboratory in an insulated container at 4 c the silica wool from each chamber was removed aseptically weighed and transferred into sterile tubes and stored at 80 c till dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction from biofilms dna was extracted from the biofilm developed over the silica wool 4 5 g using a powermax soil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc following the manufacturer s protocol extracted dna from replicate chambers was pooled which resulted in a total of nine samples three samples at a monthly interval from each of the three boreholes lyophilised dna was then shipped to the institute of environmental genomics the university of oklahoma for microarray analysis 2 5 microarray analysis of biofilm samples the geochip 4 2 has very high hybridization specificity containing 83 992 50 mer oligo probes covering 152 414 gene variants in 410 gene categories involved in biogeochemical cellular and ecological processes metal resistance antibiotic resistance and virulence wang et al 2014 the geochip 4 2 analysis was performed as outlined previously cong et al 2015 lyophilised dna was re hydrated in sterile milliq water and the dna was quantified using a picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen ca usa to produce consistent hybridizations from all samples whole community genome amplification was used to generate approximately 3 0 µg of dna from 50 ng of template dna using the templiphi kit ge healthcare piscataway nj and following a modified protocol wu et al 2006 for each sample 500 ng of amplified dna was labeled with the fluorescent dye cy 3 ge healthcare ca usa by random priming as described previously he et al 2010 samples were then hybridized on a maui hybridization station biomicro systems salt lake city ut usa at 42 c and 40 formamide for 16 hours the hybridized arrays were scanned with a nimblegen ms 200 microarray scanner images were extracted and quantified using nimblescan software roche nimblegen madison wi usa followed by data processing as outlined previously azarbad et al 2015 the genes detected in only one of three replicates samples were removed before further analysis 2 6 data analysis the scanned images of hybridized geochips were processed using nimblescan software roche nimblegen madison wi usa microarray data manager http ieg ou edu microarray was used for the statistical analyses of geochip data as described previously cong et al 2015 statistical differences in the functional categories and subcategories across sites were analyzed by a one way anova p 0 05 followed up with tukey s test as a post hoc test the sum of the normalized signal intensity values total abundance for each gene category was used for anova the args and vgs diversity was calculated by using the shannon index and simpson index bray curtis coefficient was used to construct dissimilarity matrices of communities and nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination was used to visualize bray curtis similarities significant differences in community structure were tested for different borehole biofilms with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2001 and analysis of similarity anosim clarke and ainsworth 1993 using hellinger transformed data and a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix constructed using primer e primer e v7 www primer e com we also analyzed the abundances of bacteria families top 50 and distribution of args and vgs categories in response to fixed variables site and maturity of biofilms with multivariate generalized linear models using the function manyglm and anova within the mvabund v3 13 1 wang et al 2012 package of r v1 0 143 team 2013 p values were calculated using 500 resampling iterations via pit trap resampling to account for correlation in testing canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to determine the args and vgs distribution and abundance that can be explained by the measured groundwater geochemical parameters in p1 p3 and asr boreholes 3 results 3 1 groundwater characteristics groundwater water samples were collected on a monthly interval from p1 p3 and asr boreholes and tested for the geochemical parameters the average water temperature across three boreholes varied from 15 60 19 80 c ph from 7 35 8 00 and dissolved oxygen of remained low at 0 8 mg l table 1 toc and doc were highest in the asr borehole 6 35 and 3 85 mg l respectively the turbidity of water was highest in the asr boreholes 29 ntu and reduced with distance from the injection boreholes p1 19 ntu and p3 3 ntu groundwater was fresh with the lowest ec in the asr 317 µs cm and highest 592 µs cm in the p1 boreholes 3 2 overview of microbial diversity based on geo chip 4 2 a total of 954 probes out of 3334 provided a positive signal for args and 1025 probes out of 3738 for vgs from the biofilm samples collected from all three boreholes to assess the α diversity of microbial communities carrying args and vgs shannon weaver index h simpson s index and evenness were calculated table s1 the value of h was very similar across all sites and within the sample ranging from 7 28 to 7 42 simpson s index and evenness also did not show significant differences among sites a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot of bray curtis similarities for the args and vgs gene profiles suggests similar diversity within sub samples figure s1 the relative overlap of args and vgs across sites varied between 66 76 whereas high similarity 80 among the biofilm samples collected from the same borehole was observed 3 3 taxonomic identity of bacteria carrying args and vgs geochip 4 2 utilizes highly specific probes targeting functional gene dna gyrase subunit b gyrb for determining diversity the gyrb gene has been reported to have higher evolutional rates than 16s rrna genes in bacteria and hence more useful to achieve higher taxonomic resolution at the species strain level scheler et al 2014 at a high taxonomic level of phylum or class proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the major carriers of args and vgs in the biofilms top ten bacterial families carrying args and vgs included enterobacteriaceae burkholderiaceae pseudomonadaceae vibrionaceae rhodobacteraceae streptomycetaceae rhizobiaceae comamonadaceae neisseriaceae and bacillaceae fig 3 the following genera of putative pathogenic bacteria were identified in the biofilms acinetobacter aeromonas bacillus bacteroides bartonella bordetella brucella burkholderia campylobacter carnobacterium chlamydia citrobacter clostridium corynebacterium edwardsiella enterobacter enterococcus escherichia gordonia haemophilus helicobacter klebsiella lactococcus legionella leptospira listeria micrococcus mycobacterium neisseria nocardia ochrobactrum pasteurella photobacterium propionibacterium proteus pseudomonas rhodococcus salmonella serratia shewanella shigella staphylococcus stenotrophomonas streptococcus vibrio and yersinia to determine the influence of sites on the occurrence of args and vgs data were subjected to anosim and follow on permanova analysis the influence of the site on the occurrence of args and vgs was significant anosim r 1 p 0 004 10 of the observed variation was due to sites permanova as evident from the heatmap in fig 3 bacterial populations carrying args and vgs were influenced by the site the dominant bacterial families at site p1 were distinctly different compared to the sites p3 and asr similarly at site p1 bacteria carrying β lactamase c mfs and abc efflux iron oxidation and hemolysin genes were more prevalent fig 4 3 4 antibiotic resistome of biofilms out of 3334 probes specific for 12 args categories 987 probes showed positive hybridization signals including five transporter genes atp binding cassette abc multidrug and toxic compound extrusion mate major facilitator superfamily mfs multidrug efflux mex and small multidrug resistance efflux pumps smr on average 790 726 and 720 positive probes were detected from the biofilm samples taken from the p1 p3 and asr boreholes respectively the major phyla which carried args across all three sites p1 p3 and asr included proteobacteria 63 64 actinobacteria 14 16 firmicutes 9 11 and bacteroidetes 3 3 3 table s2 bacteria and archaea belonging to 138 families carrying args were detected in the biofilms table s3 enterobacteriaceae 13 14 followed by burkholderiaceae 6 7 7 5 streptomycetaceae 5 5 1 rhodobacteraceae 4 70 5 50 rhizobiaceae 4 6 5 1 pseudomonadaceae 3 6 4 4 mycobacteriaceae 2 1 2 5 and vibrionaceae 2 2 2 5 the relative abundances and numbers of all detected args were similar within the site but some variation across sites was observed fig 5 a among the significantly changed p 0 05 args categories across three sites were smr mfs and β lactamase c antimicrobial efflux transporters genes encoding for the smr family were widely distributed across sites 89 families with high prevalence in medically important genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus fig 6 the genes encoding for the mfs family were frequently detected in bacteria 45 families with prevalence recorded in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia klebsiella vibrio yersinia and bacillus the mate family genes were less abundant 22 families and primarily detected in genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia yersinia vibrio klebsiella and bacillus similarly abc transporter genes were also less frequently detected 16 families and often found in the genera streptomyces escherichia enterobacter citrobacter and klebsiella the genes encoding for the rnd family mex genes were less frequently detected and were most prevalent in the genera pseudomonas among β lactamase resistance genes β lactamase c encoding genes were frequently detected 42 families in the biofilms with an observed high prevalence in the members of genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia citrobacter klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus the genes encoding for β lactamase a were the second most common and prevalent in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia streptomyces yersinia vibrio clostridium and mycobacterium the genes encoding for β lactamase d were comparatively rare and mostly detected in the genera pseudomonas and aeromonas of the 324 tetracycline resistance genes probes on the geochip 70 genes from 25 families were detected in the biofilm samples across sites p1 p3 and asr tetracycline resistance encoding genes were more frequently detected in the genera burkholderia streptomyces yersinia clostridium and bacillus the genes encoding for vancomycin resistance had very low prevalence with three genes detected in the families clostridiaceae and paenibacillaceae 3 5 prevalence of virulence genes out of 3729 probes specific for 13 vgs categories in total 1011 probes showed positive hybridization signals belonging to three major phyla including proteobacteria 72 76 actinobacteria 8 9 and firmicutes 6 9 table s4 bacteria and archaea belonging to 140 families carrying vgs were detected in the biofilms members of the family enterobacteriaceae 11 burkholderiaceae 10 pseudomonadaceae 9 vibrionaceae 8 comamonadaceae 4 7 and neisseriaceae 3 were the major carriers of vgs table s5 the relative abundances and numbers of all detected vgs were similar within the site but some variation across sites was observed fig 5b among the significantly changed p 0 05 vgs categories across three sites were toxins pilins adhesions invasions and fimbriae genes encoding siderophores including aerobactin iro and iuc genes followed by pilin hemolysin and type iii secretion were more commonly detected in all samples whereas vgs linked to colonization factor toxins and virulence were less abundant siderophore related genes were widely distributed in bacteria from the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter klebsiella and neisseria fig 7 the hyl genes were most commonly associated with the members of genera pseudomonas aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio mycobacterium and neisseria pilin genes were widely prevalent in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella clostridium mycobacterium neisseria type iii secretion related genes were associated with the genera pseudomonas burkholderia shewanella vibrio citrobacter proteus and clostridium adhesion genes pap were carried by the genera burkholderia escherichia yersinia vibrio citrobacter and proteus virulence proteins genes vip were less prevalent and carried by bacteria in the genera pseudomonas enterobacter and vibrio 3 6 relationship between args vgs and physicochemical factors pearson s correlation analysis of args and vgs data from p1 p3 and asr sites showed several strong positive correlations r 0 8 table s6 the most noticeable correlation r 0 8 was between β lactamase c and hyl iro pilin and type iii secretion genes β lactamase c also had a strong correlation r 0 8 with efflux pumps mex mfs and smr virulence gene pilin also showed a noticeable strong correlation r 0 8 with β lactamase a β lactamase c mfs hyl and iro genes a siderophore related iro gene exhibited a strong correlation r 0 8 with antibiotic transporters abc mfs smr and β lactamase c genes the hyl genes also exhibited a strong correlation r 0 8 with iro antibiotic transporters mex smr and β lactamase c genes results from cca analysis of normalized signal intensity data indicated the environmental variables that best explained patterns of similarity in args and vgs profiles among the three boreholes p1 p2 and asr fig 8 the first two axes of the cca described 67 30 and 32 37 of the variation respectively and the model was significant p 0 05 temperature do ph and mg concentration showed a strong negative correlation with both the first and second axes whereas turbidity toc doc and fe concentration showed a strong positive correlation with both the first and second axes ec so4 and k concentration showed a positive correlation with the second axis and a negative correlation with the first axis the presence of bacteria carrying args and vgs in the asr borehole had a positive relationship with toc doc turbidity and fe concentration whereas in the boreholes p1 a positive relationship with so4 and k concentration was observed 4 discussion at a high taxonomic level of phylum or class bacteria belonging to phyla proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were ubiquitous in all biofilms this is in agreement with the previously reported dominance of bacteria belonging to the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the aquatic environment chen et al 2018 smith et al 2012 the α diversity analysis of microbial communities carrying args and vgs in the biofilm samples from the p1 p3 and asr boreholes showed a high degree of similarity h 7 20 7 40 high similarity in args and vgs 80 in time separated 1 3 months biofilm samples from the same borehole suggest a relatively quick formation of the biofilm i e within one month and relatively stable bacterial population afterward the relative overlap of args and vgs across sites 66 76 suggests that the presence of temporal variability of the bacterial communities within the aquifer this is expected as diversity and functional capacity of microbial communities in aquifers vary in response to bio available nutrients and geochemistry smith et al 2012 which is influenced by the anthropogenic activities griebler and lueders 2009 cca indicated a positive correlation between args vgs and biogeochemical factors fe toc doc and turbidity which is potentially due to the influence of stormwater with high turbidity bio available carbon and fe on the groundwater microbial communities closer to the injection boreholes a positive relationship between so4 and k concentration and args and vgs in borehole p1 which is located 260 m from the injection boreholes could be explained by the low level of available nutrients and prevailing reducing conditions as recharged water moves from the injection boreholes table 1 at the genera level putative pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter enterobacter klebsiella mycobacterium mycoplasma salmonella and staphylococcus were detected in all biofilms the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the stormwater sidhu et al 2012 steele et al 2018 aquifers levantesi et al 2010 and biofilms emtiazi et al 2004 sun et al 2014 is well documented the present study however suggests that bacteria carrying args and vgs can find their way into the groundwater via recharge water it is worth mentioning that the travel time for the stormwater from the injection borehole iw to p1 and p3 is 260 and 360 days respectively this also suggests that bacteria normally present in the mammalian gut such as from the family enterobacteriaceae could survive in the groundwater for a long time embedded in the biofilms long term survival of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water biofilms has also been reported previously flemming et al 2016 wingender and flemming 2011 medically relevant genera including klebsiella escherichia citrobacter enterobacter pseudomonas campylobacter enterobacter mycobacterium mycoplasma and salmonella were ubiquitous in the biofilms bacteria belonging to these genera have been previously reported as carriers and potential vectors for args and virulence factor transfer vaz moreira et al 2014 consequently there is always a potential for args and vgs residing within mges to be transferred to pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria resulting in an in situ development of arb boehm et al 2009 transfer of ndm encoding plasmids from enterobacteriaceae to p aeruginosa and a baumannii has been demonstrated in biofilms tanner et al 2017 in this study we did not directly explore the occurrence of hgt in the groundwater biofilm the role of bacteria carrying args and vgs within biofilms as potential disseminators of antibiotic resistance is not clear and needs to be further investigated the observed high prevalence of mdr efflux pumps in the biofilms can be attributed to their presence in many microorganisms sometimes in multiple copies within a single cell lubelski et al 2007 moreover efflux pumps associated with mdr are reported in both pathogenic and opportunistic pathogens piddock 2006 webber and piddock 2003 the high prevalence of bacteria carrying genes coding for mdr efflux pumps in the aquatic environment has also been reported previously low et al 2016 ng et al 2017 also bacterial cells can carry multiple efflux pumps e g the presence of more than one type of mex efflux pump in a single p aeruginosa cell and expression of more than one type of acr efflux pump in a single of e coli has been reported previously piddock 2006 the smr family encoding genes have been reported in a range of bacteria including human pathogens bay et al 2008 and can be easily disseminated due to their presence on r plasmids schuldiner et al 2001 the smr family efflux pumps are reported to provide resistance to a variety of antibiotics including aminoglycosides chloramphenicol erythromycin and tetracyclines bay et al 2008 the observed high prevalence of smr efflux pumps from bacteria in the medically relevant genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus suggested the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the biofilms mfs efflux pumps are known to be ubiquitously distributed in bacteria reddy et al 2012 and involved in mdr in particular fluoroquinolone lincosamides novobiocin and rifampin resistance mokracka et al 2012 in this study mfs efflux pumps were the second most prevalent efflux systems among bacteria belonging to the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia and klebsiella mfs efflux pumps e g emrab of e coli which are associated with macrolides resistance have been previously reported in groundwater bockelmann et al 2009 and surface water stoll et al 2012 the mate family efflux pumps are the most recently categorized among the five multidrug efflux transporter families and believed to be universally present in all living organisms poole 2007 the genes encoding for the mate family were less abundant 22 families and primarily detected in bacteria from genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia yersinia vibrio and klebsiella β lactams most commonly administered to humans and in animal husbandry account for approximately two thirds of total antibiotics use worldwide lachmayr et al 2009 the high prevalence of β lactamase genes in the groundwater biofilms suggest that external input via stormwater recharge is potentially the path of flow of β lactamase genes high prevalence of β lactamase genes in confined caltagirone et al 2017 and unconfined aquifers smith et al 2012 has been reported previously β lactamase genes are frequently located on mges and are reported to coexist with other args working on other classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones marti et al 2014 the ubiquitous presence of β lactamase c and a genes in a wide range of gram negative bacteria including members of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae families combined with a high probability of transfer to a range of bacteria via plasmids or other transferable elements poole 2004 is the most likely reason for their high occurrence in biofilms the role of biofilm bound bacteria in the dissemination of β lactamase genes remains unclear and needs further investigation tetracycline resistance is mediated by three mechanisms antibiotic efflux pumps target modification with ribosomal protection proteins and antibiotic inactivation roberts 2005 in this study tetracycline resistance genes were detected in all biofilms in a diverse range of bacteria from the genera burkholderia streptomyces yersinia clostridium and bacillus suggesting diverse gene pool of tetracycline resistance previous reports suggest a high prevalence of tet genes in the aquatic environment stoll et al 2012 tao et al 2010 and abstracted water from the aquifer bockelmann et al 2009 pathogenicity in bacteria is determined by several virulence factors such as adherence colonization invasion secretion system immune evasion toxin production and iron uptake kaper et al 2004 in gram negative bacteria pili and s fimbriae are crucial virulence factors hospenthal et al 2017 the results of this study are in agreement with the previously reported wide prevalence of pili in gram negative bacteria from the pseudomonadaceae burkholderiaceae vibrionaceae and neisseriaceae families hospenthal et al 2017 production of siderophores is considered essential for the acquisition and transport of iron across the cell membrane in many pathogenic and environmental bacteria dobrindt et al 2004 bacteria belonging to the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter klebsiella and neisseria were the main carriers of siderophore encoding genes including aerobactin production the observed high prevalence of genes coding for siderophores and aerobactin production is expected due to the high prevalence of siderophores in both pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria miethke and marahiel 2007 exotoxins such as α hemolysin and enterotoxins are important virulence factors in gram negative bacteria that result in host cell lysis gal mor and finlay 2006 hemolytic genes are widely reported in both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains of bacteria kim et al 2015 sidhu et al 2013 hemolysin encoding genes were most commonly associated with members of the genera pseudomonas aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio mycobacterium and neisseria the type iii secretion system t3ss a crucial virulence factor in the gram negative bacteria and reported in several pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria including salmonella shigella yersinia p aeruginosa and b pseudomallei kuhle and hensel 2004 thibault et al 2004 the observed high prevalence of t3ss encoding genes in biofilms is most likely due to the high prevalence of bacteria belonging to genera pseudomonas and burkholderia mdr efflux pumps have been reported to not only export antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells but also virulence determinants such as toxins adhesions and colonization proteins which are important for the infection and colonization of human and animal cells piddock 2006 for instance in v cholerae the activity of the rnd efflux pumps is vital for antimicrobial resistance production of toxins and colonization factors bina et al 2008 moreover args and vgs can also be carried on the same plasmid e g in klebsiella pneumoniae r plasmid carries extended spectrum β lactamases tem 5 along with the non fimbrial protein cf29k gene aerobactin hennequin and robin 2016 therefore the correlation between args and vgs is expected to a certain extent several strong correlations between efflux pumps and virulence factors were detected e g a strong correlation r 0 80 was observed between hemolysin and iron uptake which is expected as previously demonstrated in the case of e coli where hemolysis of erythrocyte can make iron available for absorption opal et al 1990 in p aeruginosa overexpression of efflux pumps and β lactamase genes along with porin loss has been reported to lead to high levels of drug resistance tomas et al 2010 a strong correlation r 0 80 was also observed between β lactamase c and efflux pumps mex mfs and smr similar results have been reported previously in the aquatic environment escudeiro et al 2019 liang et al 2020 in the case of k pneumoniae extended spectrum β lactamases genes aerobactin and its ferric aerobactin receptor and non fimbrial protein cf29k gene are located on a relatively large r plasmid hennequin and robin 2016 the observed strong correlation r 0 80 between β lactamase c and several virulence factors such as hyl iro pilin and type iii secretion genes may be due to co existence of these genes on mges 5 conclusions a better understanding of the diversity and ecology of bacteria carrying args and vgs in freshwater aquatic ecosystems may provide a better understanding of the dissemination pathways of antibiotic resistance to and from humans the presence of bacteria non native to the aquatic environment belonging to putative pathogenic bacterial genera in the biofilms underscores the importance of stormwater as a source of human and animal derived resistomes in the groundwater despite some inherent limitations analysis for pre defined sequences and an inability to distinguish between active and inactive genes fgas are an indispensable molecular tool for large scale screening of resistome in the aquatic environment the use of high throughput fga allowed relative quantification of args and vgs biofilm samples this study highlights the diversity and abundance of putative pathogens args and vgs in groundwater biofilms which together offer a higher probability of dispersal and hgt the role of such bacteria as potential disseminators of args and vgs remains unclear and needs further investigation the presence of putative pathogens and bacteria carrying args and vgs in the biofilms can contaminate potable reuse water and pose a public health

17640,an improved understanding of the diversity and composition of microbial communities carrying antibiotic resistance genes args and virulence genes vgs in aquifers recharged with stormwater is essential to comprehend potential human health risks from water reuse a high throughput functional gene array was used to study the prevalence of args and vgs in aquifer biofilms n 27 taken from three boreholes over three months bacterial genera annotated as opportunistic pathogens such as aeromonas burkholderia pseudomonas shewanella and vibrio were ubiquitous and abundant in all biofilms bacteria from clinically relevant genera campylobacter enterobacter klebsiella mycobacterium mycoplasma and salmonella were detected in biofilms the mean travel time of stormwater from the injection well to p1 and p3 boreholes was 260 and 360 days respectively the presence of args and vgs in the biofilms from these boreholes suggest a high spatial movement of args and vgs in the aquifer the args with the highest abundance were small multidrug resistance efflux pumps smr and multidrug efflux mex followed by β lactamase c genes β lactamase c encoding genes were primarily detected in enterobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae bacillaceae and rhodobacteraceae families the vgs encoding siderophores including aerobactin iro and iuc genes followed by pilin hemolysin and type iii secretion were ubiquitous canonical correspondence analysis suggested that total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc turbidity and fe concentration has a significant impact on the microbial community structure of

pathogens stormwater antibiotic resistance genes virulence genes groundwater biofilms managed aquifer recharge 1 introduction groundwater replenishment via managed aquifer recharge mar with alternative water sources such as stormwater surface water and treated sewage effluent is increasingly used for the production of non potable and indirect potable water in australia usa and europe dillon et al 2010 the presence of pathogens antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args in stormwater has been reported previously garner et al 2017 sidhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the environmental resistome comprises both the natural antibiotic resistance gene pool the intrinsic resistome and that resulting from anthropogenic activities the introduction of arb and args into groundwater via recharge water may pose a potential threat to water security and public health which remains un quantified bacterial pathogens even present in low numbers in the recharge water may get embedded in the biofilms which may in turn prolong their survival by providing enhanced resistance to adverse environmental conditions wingender and flemming 2011 the presence of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria in the groundwater and biofilms have been reported previously richards et al 2018 biofilms have been suggested as an ideal setting for horizontal gene transfer hgt due to the presence of high bacterial cell density increased genetic competence and accumulation of mobile genetic elements mges fux et al 2005 however the extent of transfer of args originating from anthropogenic sources to groundwater autochthonous microorganisms in biofilms remains unknown intrinsic antibiotic resistance in bacteria comprises a diverse range of mechanisms related to structural physiological and biochemical functions of bacteria such as insensitivity or reduced permeability to antibiotics efflux systems and metabolic functions baquero et al 2013 multidrug resistance mdr efflux pumps encoded by gram positive and gram negative bacteria have been known to impart resistance to aminoglycosides β lactams macrolides phenicols lincosamides quinolones streptogramins and tetracyclines davies and davies 2010 mges including plasmids insertion sequences transposons integrons genomic islands integrating conjugative elements and bacteriophages are also involved in hgt among bacteria in clinical and environmental settings frost et al 2005 the presence of args and vgs on mges enables their horizontal transfer the spatial and temporal distribution of bacteria carrying args and vgs in aquifers and biofilms is essential to determine the extent of potential human health risks from abstracted water use recent advances in molecular methods such as microarrays and next generation sequencing have ushered in new opportunities for the assessment of antibiotic resistome in the environment functional gene arrays fgas are a high throughput tool that allows a specific sensitive and quantitative profiling of microbial community diversity structure composition and metabolic activity he et al 2010 fgas have been previously used to analyze arg profiles in different environments such as urban watershed low et al 2016 and wastewater zhang et al 2013 to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of clinically relevant bacteria args and vgs in groundwater biofilm samples from aquifer recharged with stormwater were screened with geochip 4 2 the main aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence and diversity of bacteria carrying args and vgs in the biofilms developed in a subsurface aquifer environment in particular we were interested in i temporal and spatial distribution and abundance of arb and args in the aquifer recharged with stormwater ii environmental gene pool of clinically relevant virulence factors iii influence of biogeochemical factors on the distribution and abundance of args and vgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 stormwater catchment and aquifer recharge the investigated parafield stormwater harvesting and managed aquifer recharge mar site is located at parafield in adelaide south australia the parafield stormwater catchment has an area of 1 590 ha and is primarily urban 73 it is composed of mainly residential 36 but also has vacant land 13 and industrial areas 8 page et al 2014 the urban stormwater collected from the catchment through the weir on the parafield drain passes through a series of two 50 ml detention basins and a 2 ha constructed wetland prior to direct injection into the tertiary aquifer t2 two separate mar and water recovery options are available at this site i aquifer storage and recovery asr where recharged water is recovered from the injection boreholes ii aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr systems where recharged water is recovered from four separate recovery boreholes fig 1 a detailed description of the operational parameters of the asr and astr scheme was reported previously page et al 2014 there are three observation boreholes p1 p2 and p3 at the astr site located 10 m 20 m and 30 m respectively from the injection borehole iw the mean travel time of injected stormwater from iw to p1 and p3 is 260 and 360 days respectively page et al 2014 we used borehole p1 p3 and asr for the experimental work the aquifer was constantly recharged during the investigation period 91 days 2 2 groundwater water quality profiling groundwater geochemical parameters ph temperature redox potential dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and turbidity were measured in the field using a field lab analyzer tps 90fl tps pty ltd australia groundwater geochemical parameters were recorded at the beginning of the experiment then at a monthly interval at the time of retrieving chambers from the boreholes groundwater grab samples 1l were also collected at the monthly intervals and sent to a commercial laboratory australian water quality centre south australia for chemical analysis nutrients metals toc and doc 2 3 in situ biofilm study set up teflon chambers 25 mm diameter filled with sterile silica wool sc0006 sercon crewe uk were used to provide a physical matrix for the development of biofilm and colonization of microorganisms fig 2 the teflon chambers were fitted with metal mesh discs 3 mm pore diameter which allowed the free flow of water through the silica wool inside the chamber as outlined in our previous study sidhu and toze 2012 prior to the assembly of chambers all parts of the diffusion chambers were sterilized by autoclaving 20 min diffusion chambers n 27 were assembled in a laminar flow cabinet and nine chambers were suspended on a stainless steel wire and lowered into each of the three boreholes p1 p3 and asr so that the uppermost chambers were suspended at 1 m below the water table at a depth of 170 m in the slotted section of the borehole to intercept the flow of groundwater three chambers from each of the three boreholes were removed at 1 2 and 3 months respectively that allowed the development of biofilms and colonization of biofilms by the bacteria from recharged stormwater collected chambers three from each borehole were placed in zip lock bags for transportation to the laboratory in an insulated container at 4 c the silica wool from each chamber was removed aseptically weighed and transferred into sterile tubes and stored at 80 c till dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction from biofilms dna was extracted from the biofilm developed over the silica wool 4 5 g using a powermax soil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc following the manufacturer s protocol extracted dna from replicate chambers was pooled which resulted in a total of nine samples three samples at a monthly interval from each of the three boreholes lyophilised dna was then shipped to the institute of environmental genomics the university of oklahoma for microarray analysis 2 5 microarray analysis of biofilm samples the geochip 4 2 has very high hybridization specificity containing 83 992 50 mer oligo probes covering 152 414 gene variants in 410 gene categories involved in biogeochemical cellular and ecological processes metal resistance antibiotic resistance and virulence wang et al 2014 the geochip 4 2 analysis was performed as outlined previously cong et al 2015 lyophilised dna was re hydrated in sterile milliq water and the dna was quantified using a picogreen dsdna assay kit invitrogen ca usa to produce consistent hybridizations from all samples whole community genome amplification was used to generate approximately 3 0 µg of dna from 50 ng of template dna using the templiphi kit ge healthcare piscataway nj and following a modified protocol wu et al 2006 for each sample 500 ng of amplified dna was labeled with the fluorescent dye cy 3 ge healthcare ca usa by random priming as described previously he et al 2010 samples were then hybridized on a maui hybridization station biomicro systems salt lake city ut usa at 42 c and 40 formamide for 16 hours the hybridized arrays were scanned with a nimblegen ms 200 microarray scanner images were extracted and quantified using nimblescan software roche nimblegen madison wi usa followed by data processing as outlined previously azarbad et al 2015 the genes detected in only one of three replicates samples were removed before further analysis 2 6 data analysis the scanned images of hybridized geochips were processed using nimblescan software roche nimblegen madison wi usa microarray data manager http ieg ou edu microarray was used for the statistical analyses of geochip data as described previously cong et al 2015 statistical differences in the functional categories and subcategories across sites were analyzed by a one way anova p 0 05 followed up with tukey s test as a post hoc test the sum of the normalized signal intensity values total abundance for each gene category was used for anova the args and vgs diversity was calculated by using the shannon index and simpson index bray curtis coefficient was used to construct dissimilarity matrices of communities and nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds ordination was used to visualize bray curtis similarities significant differences in community structure were tested for different borehole biofilms with permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2001 and analysis of similarity anosim clarke and ainsworth 1993 using hellinger transformed data and a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix constructed using primer e primer e v7 www primer e com we also analyzed the abundances of bacteria families top 50 and distribution of args and vgs categories in response to fixed variables site and maturity of biofilms with multivariate generalized linear models using the function manyglm and anova within the mvabund v3 13 1 wang et al 2012 package of r v1 0 143 team 2013 p values were calculated using 500 resampling iterations via pit trap resampling to account for correlation in testing canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to determine the args and vgs distribution and abundance that can be explained by the measured groundwater geochemical parameters in p1 p3 and asr boreholes 3 results 3 1 groundwater characteristics groundwater water samples were collected on a monthly interval from p1 p3 and asr boreholes and tested for the geochemical parameters the average water temperature across three boreholes varied from 15 60 19 80 c ph from 7 35 8 00 and dissolved oxygen of remained low at 0 8 mg l table 1 toc and doc were highest in the asr borehole 6 35 and 3 85 mg l respectively the turbidity of water was highest in the asr boreholes 29 ntu and reduced with distance from the injection boreholes p1 19 ntu and p3 3 ntu groundwater was fresh with the lowest ec in the asr 317 µs cm and highest 592 µs cm in the p1 boreholes 3 2 overview of microbial diversity based on geo chip 4 2 a total of 954 probes out of 3334 provided a positive signal for args and 1025 probes out of 3738 for vgs from the biofilm samples collected from all three boreholes to assess the α diversity of microbial communities carrying args and vgs shannon weaver index h simpson s index and evenness were calculated table s1 the value of h was very similar across all sites and within the sample ranging from 7 28 to 7 42 simpson s index and evenness also did not show significant differences among sites a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot of bray curtis similarities for the args and vgs gene profiles suggests similar diversity within sub samples figure s1 the relative overlap of args and vgs across sites varied between 66 76 whereas high similarity 80 among the biofilm samples collected from the same borehole was observed 3 3 taxonomic identity of bacteria carrying args and vgs geochip 4 2 utilizes highly specific probes targeting functional gene dna gyrase subunit b gyrb for determining diversity the gyrb gene has been reported to have higher evolutional rates than 16s rrna genes in bacteria and hence more useful to achieve higher taxonomic resolution at the species strain level scheler et al 2014 at a high taxonomic level of phylum or class proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the major carriers of args and vgs in the biofilms top ten bacterial families carrying args and vgs included enterobacteriaceae burkholderiaceae pseudomonadaceae vibrionaceae rhodobacteraceae streptomycetaceae rhizobiaceae comamonadaceae neisseriaceae and bacillaceae fig 3 the following genera of putative pathogenic bacteria were identified in the biofilms acinetobacter aeromonas bacillus bacteroides bartonella bordetella brucella burkholderia campylobacter carnobacterium chlamydia citrobacter clostridium corynebacterium edwardsiella enterobacter enterococcus escherichia gordonia haemophilus helicobacter klebsiella lactococcus legionella leptospira listeria micrococcus mycobacterium neisseria nocardia ochrobactrum pasteurella photobacterium propionibacterium proteus pseudomonas rhodococcus salmonella serratia shewanella shigella staphylococcus stenotrophomonas streptococcus vibrio and yersinia to determine the influence of sites on the occurrence of args and vgs data were subjected to anosim and follow on permanova analysis the influence of the site on the occurrence of args and vgs was significant anosim r 1 p 0 004 10 of the observed variation was due to sites permanova as evident from the heatmap in fig 3 bacterial populations carrying args and vgs were influenced by the site the dominant bacterial families at site p1 were distinctly different compared to the sites p3 and asr similarly at site p1 bacteria carrying β lactamase c mfs and abc efflux iron oxidation and hemolysin genes were more prevalent fig 4 3 4 antibiotic resistome of biofilms out of 3334 probes specific for 12 args categories 987 probes showed positive hybridization signals including five transporter genes atp binding cassette abc multidrug and toxic compound extrusion mate major facilitator superfamily mfs multidrug efflux mex and small multidrug resistance efflux pumps smr on average 790 726 and 720 positive probes were detected from the biofilm samples taken from the p1 p3 and asr boreholes respectively the major phyla which carried args across all three sites p1 p3 and asr included proteobacteria 63 64 actinobacteria 14 16 firmicutes 9 11 and bacteroidetes 3 3 3 table s2 bacteria and archaea belonging to 138 families carrying args were detected in the biofilms table s3 enterobacteriaceae 13 14 followed by burkholderiaceae 6 7 7 5 streptomycetaceae 5 5 1 rhodobacteraceae 4 70 5 50 rhizobiaceae 4 6 5 1 pseudomonadaceae 3 6 4 4 mycobacteriaceae 2 1 2 5 and vibrionaceae 2 2 2 5 the relative abundances and numbers of all detected args were similar within the site but some variation across sites was observed fig 5 a among the significantly changed p 0 05 args categories across three sites were smr mfs and β lactamase c antimicrobial efflux transporters genes encoding for the smr family were widely distributed across sites 89 families with high prevalence in medically important genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus fig 6 the genes encoding for the mfs family were frequently detected in bacteria 45 families with prevalence recorded in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia klebsiella vibrio yersinia and bacillus the mate family genes were less abundant 22 families and primarily detected in genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia yersinia vibrio klebsiella and bacillus similarly abc transporter genes were also less frequently detected 16 families and often found in the genera streptomyces escherichia enterobacter citrobacter and klebsiella the genes encoding for the rnd family mex genes were less frequently detected and were most prevalent in the genera pseudomonas among β lactamase resistance genes β lactamase c encoding genes were frequently detected 42 families in the biofilms with an observed high prevalence in the members of genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia citrobacter klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus the genes encoding for β lactamase a were the second most common and prevalent in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia streptomyces yersinia vibrio clostridium and mycobacterium the genes encoding for β lactamase d were comparatively rare and mostly detected in the genera pseudomonas and aeromonas of the 324 tetracycline resistance genes probes on the geochip 70 genes from 25 families were detected in the biofilm samples across sites p1 p3 and asr tetracycline resistance encoding genes were more frequently detected in the genera burkholderia streptomyces yersinia clostridium and bacillus the genes encoding for vancomycin resistance had very low prevalence with three genes detected in the families clostridiaceae and paenibacillaceae 3 5 prevalence of virulence genes out of 3729 probes specific for 13 vgs categories in total 1011 probes showed positive hybridization signals belonging to three major phyla including proteobacteria 72 76 actinobacteria 8 9 and firmicutes 6 9 table s4 bacteria and archaea belonging to 140 families carrying vgs were detected in the biofilms members of the family enterobacteriaceae 11 burkholderiaceae 10 pseudomonadaceae 9 vibrionaceae 8 comamonadaceae 4 7 and neisseriaceae 3 were the major carriers of vgs table s5 the relative abundances and numbers of all detected vgs were similar within the site but some variation across sites was observed fig 5b among the significantly changed p 0 05 vgs categories across three sites were toxins pilins adhesions invasions and fimbriae genes encoding siderophores including aerobactin iro and iuc genes followed by pilin hemolysin and type iii secretion were more commonly detected in all samples whereas vgs linked to colonization factor toxins and virulence were less abundant siderophore related genes were widely distributed in bacteria from the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter klebsiella and neisseria fig 7 the hyl genes were most commonly associated with the members of genera pseudomonas aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio mycobacterium and neisseria pilin genes were widely prevalent in the genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella clostridium mycobacterium neisseria type iii secretion related genes were associated with the genera pseudomonas burkholderia shewanella vibrio citrobacter proteus and clostridium adhesion genes pap were carried by the genera burkholderia escherichia yersinia vibrio citrobacter and proteus virulence proteins genes vip were less prevalent and carried by bacteria in the genera pseudomonas enterobacter and vibrio 3 6 relationship between args vgs and physicochemical factors pearson s correlation analysis of args and vgs data from p1 p3 and asr sites showed several strong positive correlations r 0 8 table s6 the most noticeable correlation r 0 8 was between β lactamase c and hyl iro pilin and type iii secretion genes β lactamase c also had a strong correlation r 0 8 with efflux pumps mex mfs and smr virulence gene pilin also showed a noticeable strong correlation r 0 8 with β lactamase a β lactamase c mfs hyl and iro genes a siderophore related iro gene exhibited a strong correlation r 0 8 with antibiotic transporters abc mfs smr and β lactamase c genes the hyl genes also exhibited a strong correlation r 0 8 with iro antibiotic transporters mex smr and β lactamase c genes results from cca analysis of normalized signal intensity data indicated the environmental variables that best explained patterns of similarity in args and vgs profiles among the three boreholes p1 p2 and asr fig 8 the first two axes of the cca described 67 30 and 32 37 of the variation respectively and the model was significant p 0 05 temperature do ph and mg concentration showed a strong negative correlation with both the first and second axes whereas turbidity toc doc and fe concentration showed a strong positive correlation with both the first and second axes ec so4 and k concentration showed a positive correlation with the second axis and a negative correlation with the first axis the presence of bacteria carrying args and vgs in the asr borehole had a positive relationship with toc doc turbidity and fe concentration whereas in the boreholes p1 a positive relationship with so4 and k concentration was observed 4 discussion at a high taxonomic level of phylum or class bacteria belonging to phyla proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were ubiquitous in all biofilms this is in agreement with the previously reported dominance of bacteria belonging to the phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the aquatic environment chen et al 2018 smith et al 2012 the α diversity analysis of microbial communities carrying args and vgs in the biofilm samples from the p1 p3 and asr boreholes showed a high degree of similarity h 7 20 7 40 high similarity in args and vgs 80 in time separated 1 3 months biofilm samples from the same borehole suggest a relatively quick formation of the biofilm i e within one month and relatively stable bacterial population afterward the relative overlap of args and vgs across sites 66 76 suggests that the presence of temporal variability of the bacterial communities within the aquifer this is expected as diversity and functional capacity of microbial communities in aquifers vary in response to bio available nutrients and geochemistry smith et al 2012 which is influenced by the anthropogenic activities griebler and lueders 2009 cca indicated a positive correlation between args vgs and biogeochemical factors fe toc doc and turbidity which is potentially due to the influence of stormwater with high turbidity bio available carbon and fe on the groundwater microbial communities closer to the injection boreholes a positive relationship between so4 and k concentration and args and vgs in borehole p1 which is located 260 m from the injection boreholes could be explained by the low level of available nutrients and prevailing reducing conditions as recharged water moves from the injection boreholes table 1 at the genera level putative pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter enterobacter klebsiella mycobacterium mycoplasma salmonella and staphylococcus were detected in all biofilms the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the stormwater sidhu et al 2012 steele et al 2018 aquifers levantesi et al 2010 and biofilms emtiazi et al 2004 sun et al 2014 is well documented the present study however suggests that bacteria carrying args and vgs can find their way into the groundwater via recharge water it is worth mentioning that the travel time for the stormwater from the injection borehole iw to p1 and p3 is 260 and 360 days respectively this also suggests that bacteria normally present in the mammalian gut such as from the family enterobacteriaceae could survive in the groundwater for a long time embedded in the biofilms long term survival of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water biofilms has also been reported previously flemming et al 2016 wingender and flemming 2011 medically relevant genera including klebsiella escherichia citrobacter enterobacter pseudomonas campylobacter enterobacter mycobacterium mycoplasma and salmonella were ubiquitous in the biofilms bacteria belonging to these genera have been previously reported as carriers and potential vectors for args and virulence factor transfer vaz moreira et al 2014 consequently there is always a potential for args and vgs residing within mges to be transferred to pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria resulting in an in situ development of arb boehm et al 2009 transfer of ndm encoding plasmids from enterobacteriaceae to p aeruginosa and a baumannii has been demonstrated in biofilms tanner et al 2017 in this study we did not directly explore the occurrence of hgt in the groundwater biofilm the role of bacteria carrying args and vgs within biofilms as potential disseminators of antibiotic resistance is not clear and needs to be further investigated the observed high prevalence of mdr efflux pumps in the biofilms can be attributed to their presence in many microorganisms sometimes in multiple copies within a single cell lubelski et al 2007 moreover efflux pumps associated with mdr are reported in both pathogenic and opportunistic pathogens piddock 2006 webber and piddock 2003 the high prevalence of bacteria carrying genes coding for mdr efflux pumps in the aquatic environment has also been reported previously low et al 2016 ng et al 2017 also bacterial cells can carry multiple efflux pumps e g the presence of more than one type of mex efflux pump in a single p aeruginosa cell and expression of more than one type of acr efflux pump in a single of e coli has been reported previously piddock 2006 the smr family encoding genes have been reported in a range of bacteria including human pathogens bay et al 2008 and can be easily disseminated due to their presence on r plasmids schuldiner et al 2001 the smr family efflux pumps are reported to provide resistance to a variety of antibiotics including aminoglycosides chloramphenicol erythromycin and tetracyclines bay et al 2008 the observed high prevalence of smr efflux pumps from bacteria in the medically relevant genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas streptomyces escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter proteus salmonella klebsiella mycobacterium and bacillus suggested the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the biofilms mfs efflux pumps are known to be ubiquitously distributed in bacteria reddy et al 2012 and involved in mdr in particular fluoroquinolone lincosamides novobiocin and rifampin resistance mokracka et al 2012 in this study mfs efflux pumps were the second most prevalent efflux systems among bacteria belonging to the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia and klebsiella mfs efflux pumps e g emrab of e coli which are associated with macrolides resistance have been previously reported in groundwater bockelmann et al 2009 and surface water stoll et al 2012 the mate family efflux pumps are the most recently categorized among the five multidrug efflux transporter families and believed to be universally present in all living organisms poole 2007 the genes encoding for the mate family were less abundant 22 families and primarily detected in bacteria from genera pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas escherichia yersinia vibrio and klebsiella β lactams most commonly administered to humans and in animal husbandry account for approximately two thirds of total antibiotics use worldwide lachmayr et al 2009 the high prevalence of β lactamase genes in the groundwater biofilms suggest that external input via stormwater recharge is potentially the path of flow of β lactamase genes high prevalence of β lactamase genes in confined caltagirone et al 2017 and unconfined aquifers smith et al 2012 has been reported previously β lactamase genes are frequently located on mges and are reported to coexist with other args working on other classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones marti et al 2014 the ubiquitous presence of β lactamase c and a genes in a wide range of gram negative bacteria including members of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae families combined with a high probability of transfer to a range of bacteria via plasmids or other transferable elements poole 2004 is the most likely reason for their high occurrence in biofilms the role of biofilm bound bacteria in the dissemination of β lactamase genes remains unclear and needs further investigation tetracycline resistance is mediated by three mechanisms antibiotic efflux pumps target modification with ribosomal protection proteins and antibiotic inactivation roberts 2005 in this study tetracycline resistance genes were detected in all biofilms in a diverse range of bacteria from the genera burkholderia streptomyces yersinia clostridium and bacillus suggesting diverse gene pool of tetracycline resistance previous reports suggest a high prevalence of tet genes in the aquatic environment stoll et al 2012 tao et al 2010 and abstracted water from the aquifer bockelmann et al 2009 pathogenicity in bacteria is determined by several virulence factors such as adherence colonization invasion secretion system immune evasion toxin production and iron uptake kaper et al 2004 in gram negative bacteria pili and s fimbriae are crucial virulence factors hospenthal et al 2017 the results of this study are in agreement with the previously reported wide prevalence of pili in gram negative bacteria from the pseudomonadaceae burkholderiaceae vibrionaceae and neisseriaceae families hospenthal et al 2017 production of siderophores is considered essential for the acquisition and transport of iron across the cell membrane in many pathogenic and environmental bacteria dobrindt et al 2004 bacteria belonging to the genera including pseudomonas burkholderia aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio citrobacter klebsiella and neisseria were the main carriers of siderophore encoding genes including aerobactin production the observed high prevalence of genes coding for siderophores and aerobactin production is expected due to the high prevalence of siderophores in both pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria miethke and marahiel 2007 exotoxins such as α hemolysin and enterotoxins are important virulence factors in gram negative bacteria that result in host cell lysis gal mor and finlay 2006 hemolytic genes are widely reported in both pathogenic and non pathogenic strains of bacteria kim et al 2015 sidhu et al 2013 hemolysin encoding genes were most commonly associated with members of the genera pseudomonas aeromonas shewanella escherichia enterobacter yersinia vibrio mycobacterium and neisseria the type iii secretion system t3ss a crucial virulence factor in the gram negative bacteria and reported in several pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria including salmonella shigella yersinia p aeruginosa and b pseudomallei kuhle and hensel 2004 thibault et al 2004 the observed high prevalence of t3ss encoding genes in biofilms is most likely due to the high prevalence of bacteria belonging to genera pseudomonas and burkholderia mdr efflux pumps have been reported to not only export antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells but also virulence determinants such as toxins adhesions and colonization proteins which are important for the infection and colonization of human and animal cells piddock 2006 for instance in v cholerae the activity of the rnd efflux pumps is vital for antimicrobial resistance production of toxins and colonization factors bina et al 2008 moreover args and vgs can also be carried on the same plasmid e g in klebsiella pneumoniae r plasmid carries extended spectrum β lactamases tem 5 along with the non fimbrial protein cf29k gene aerobactin hennequin and robin 2016 therefore the correlation between args and vgs is expected to a certain extent several strong correlations between efflux pumps and virulence factors were detected e g a strong correlation r 0 80 was observed between hemolysin and iron uptake which is expected as previously demonstrated in the case of e coli where hemolysis of erythrocyte can make iron available for absorption opal et al 1990 in p aeruginosa overexpression of efflux pumps and β lactamase genes along with porin loss has been reported to lead to high levels of drug resistance tomas et al 2010 a strong correlation r 0 80 was also observed between β lactamase c and efflux pumps mex mfs and smr similar results have been reported previously in the aquatic environment escudeiro et al 2019 liang et al 2020 in the case of k pneumoniae extended spectrum β lactamases genes aerobactin and its ferric aerobactin receptor and non fimbrial protein cf29k gene are located on a relatively large r plasmid hennequin and robin 2016 the observed strong correlation r 0 80 between β lactamase c and several virulence factors such as hyl iro pilin and type iii secretion genes may be due to co existence of these genes on mges 5 conclusions a better understanding of the diversity and ecology of bacteria carrying args and vgs in freshwater aquatic ecosystems may provide a better understanding of the dissemination pathways of antibiotic resistance to and from humans the presence of bacteria non native to the aquatic environment belonging to putative pathogenic bacterial genera in the biofilms underscores the importance of stormwater as a source of human and animal derived resistomes in the groundwater despite some inherent limitations analysis for pre defined sequences and an inability to distinguish between active and inactive genes fgas are an indispensable molecular tool for large scale screening of resistome in the aquatic environment the use of high throughput fga allowed relative quantification of args and vgs biofilm samples this study highlights the diversity and abundance of putative pathogens args and vgs in groundwater biofilms which together offer a higher probability of dispersal and hgt the role of such bacteria as potential disseminators of args and vgs remains unclear and needs further investigation the presence of putative pathogens and bacteria carrying args and vgs in the biofilms can contaminate potable reuse water and pose a public health

17641,algogenic organic matter aom produced by microcystis cells inhibits coagulation harvesting however the harvesting inhibitory mechanisms at the functional groups level remain to be determined this study fractionated extracellular organic matter eom and intercellular organic matter iom from microcystis flos aquae into five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and investigated their inhibition of chitosan coagulation harvesting the proton active functional groups in the inhibitory fractions were further analysed by potentiometric titration and the interaction between these functional groups and chitosan was elucidated the results showed that the harvesting inhibition of m flos aquae cells was dominated by hpi in aom due to its high charge density which resulted in greater consumption of coagulant potentiometric titration results suggested that the proton active functional groups of both hpieom and hpiiom consist mainly of phosphodiester carboxylic phosphoryl and amine hydroxyl functional groups and the harvesting inhibition of hpi on m flos aquae cells at ph 6 5 was mainly due to the deprotonation of phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups moreover carboxylic functional groups with stronger polarity could enhance the intermolecular interaction between hpi and chitosan more effectively than phosphodiester at ph 6 5 preventing the deprotonation of carboxylic functional groups by adjusting the ph to 4 3 could effectively alleviate the harvesting inhibition caused by hpi these findings revealed the inhibition mechanism of aom on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells from the perspective of deprotonation of proton active functional groups which may provide important insights for assessing the role of aom in the

2010 the frequent outbreak of microcystis blooms in eutrophic freshwaters is a global issue that poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and water resources shi et al 2016 zurawell et al 2005 lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china has been plagued by blooms over the last two decades with microcystis flos aquae as one of the main species chen et al 2003 these blooms seriously deteriorate the water ecological environment and reduce its functionality harvesting microcystis spp not only helps bloom mitigation but also removes nutrient loading in lake and reservoir water which is considered one of the most effective methods for microcystis bloom control chen et al 2012 huang et al 2018 peng et al 2017 small cell size low biomass concentration high cell dispersion stability and density similar to that of water make the harvesting of microcystis spp an extremely difficult task barros et al 2015 gerardo et al 2015 ummalyma et al 2017 coagulation in which small cells form larger aggregates that can be separated from water by gravity sedimentation has been a popular method to harvest microalgae due to its fine separation efficiency and simple operation das et al 2016 lama et al 2016 mata et al 2010 however when harvesting microcystis spp by in situ coagulation in taihu lake we found noticeable differences in harvesting efficiency and coagulant demand with harvesting time or harvesting location previous studies showed that the presence of algogenic organic matter aom generated by microalgal cells decreased microalgal coagulation efficiency and increased coagulant demand henderson et al 2010 vandamme et al 2012 the degree of inhibition of coagulation by aom is most likely related to the quantity and composition of aom present in the coagulation system vandamme et al 2012 therefore a possible explanation was that different concentrations and compositions of aom present in taihu lake have a major influence on harvesting performance aom consists mainly of polysaccharides proteins lipids rna and small molecules and is released during the growth of microalgae as extracellular organic matter eom due to metabolic processes or as intracellular organic matter iom due to cell lysis guo et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2006 takaara et al 2010 the complexity of the composition of aom complicates the understanding of the interaction between aom and coagulants efforts have been made to explore the interaction mechanisms between some fractions separated from aom and coagulants for example pivokonsky et al 2012 demonstrated that the coagulation of peptides and proteins isolated from the iom of m aeruginosa using ferric coagulant was influenced by the formation of fe peptide protein surface complexes at ph 6 7 naceradska et al 2019 concluded that the prevailing coagulation mechanism of nonproteinaceous fractions in the aom of chlorella vulgaris using aluminum sulfate and polyaluminium chloride was the adsorption of nonproteinaceous matter onto aluminum hydroxide precipitates additionally vandamme et al 2012 found that aom interfered with flocculation using cationic biopolymers such as chitosan and cationic starch because cationic biopolymer flocculants may interact with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes within the aom such as carbohydrates and proteins these studies indicated that some fractions in aom would interfere with microalgal coagulation due to surface complex adsorption and or charge neutralization between the aom and coagulant the influence of aom on the coagulation process was associated with the physicochemical characteristics of the fractions such as charge density hydrophobicity protein content and molecular weight henderson et al 2010 some studies have indicated that charge neutralization played an important role in the interaction between aom and coagulant chekli et al 2017 henderson et al 2010 aom extracted from microalgae is negatively charged henderson et al 2008 and the charge density of aom occurs as a result of charged organic matter in aom sun et al 2020 takaara et al 2010 charged organic matter usually contains a certain amount of proton active functional groups i e carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups and the deprotonation of these functional groups is a primary source of negative charge dittrich and sibler 2005 therefore the proton active functional group composition in aom may be an essential factor in the influence of aom on the coagulation process this was supported by pivokonsky et al 2012 who reported that m aeruginosa peptides and proteins were coagulated by the attractive interaction between deprotonized carboxyl groups of peptides proteins and positively charged hydrolysis products of ferric coagulant at ph 4 6 ai et al 2020 investigated the coagulation of humic acid ha in metal ion solutions and found that the coagulation process of has is directly influenced by the protonation state of the functional groups in has these previous studies provided direct insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of the coagulation behaviour of organic matter and its complexation with coagulants however thus far little attention has been given to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of proton active functional groups in aom and their roles in the coagulation process have not been quantitatively evaluated the qualitative and quantitative relationships between proton active functional groups in aom and coagulants remain to be explored the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the influences of eom iom and their hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions on chitosan coagulation harvesting 2 to determine whether the harvesting inhibitions of different fractions of aom on microcystis cells were related to their charge densities and 3 to reveal the harvesting inhibition mechanisms of aom from the perspective of protonation and deprotonation of pro active functional groups this study improves our understanding of the role of proton active functional groups in aom on coagulation harvesting and reveals the differential impacts of different aom compositions and different coagulation conditions on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcystis flos aquae cultivation and eom iom extraction a strain of m flos aquae fachb 1028 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china axenic cultures were prepared in a 10 l photobioreactor with bg11 medium at 25 c with illumination of 8000 lx provided for 14 h every day a carbon dioxide and air mixture 2 0 5 0 co2 was continuously aerated into the photobioreactor to maintain the optimal growth of m flos aquae microcystis cells were continuously counted for 40 consecutive days with a microscope olympus bx53 japan the growth of m flos aquae is presented in fig a1 m flos aquae was harvested in its stationary period after a culture time of 18 days and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min eom was extracted by filtering the supernatant through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes using the method described by qu et al 2012 the separated m flos aquae cells were re suspended in milli q water and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to wash off the remaining eom the washing process was repeated three times until the toc in the supernatant was less than 0 50 mg l the cells were then broken up at 4 c with a high pressure of 1 8 105 kpa using a cryogenic ultrahigh pressure cell fragmentation apparatus jnb10 guangzhou juneng biology technology co ltd china the cell fragmentation rate was measured by a mastersizer 3000 malvern uk and was nearly 89 as shown in fig a2 most cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and the organic matter in the filtrate was referred to as iom 2 2 fractionation of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions an automatic hydrophilic and hydrophobic fraction separation and collection device hydrofractor s4f5 accurate co wuhan china was used to fractionate the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions from eom and iom in fig a 3 an xad 7hp xad 4 column was used to fractionate the eom iom into hydrophobic neutral hpon hydrophobic acid hpoa transphilic neutral tpin transphilic acid tpia and hydrophilic hpi fractions following established methods aiken et al 1992 chow et al 2006 and the specific separation steps are shown in fig a 3 a uv detector was used to automatically detect the collection endpoint of each fraction acetonitrile was removed from the acetonitrile containing fractions hpon and tpin by spinning 30 c 3 kpa the dissolved organic carbon doc in different fractions was quantified using a toc l series analyser shimadzu kyoto japan before measurement samples were adjusted to ph 7 the recovery rates of doc after separation were 90 8 and 92 4 respectively for eom and iom the separation results are shown in fig a 5 and the presented percentages are normalized to 100 2 3 coagulation harvesting experiment the coagulation experiment was performed using a six paddle jar test apparatus with 100 ml beakers phipps bird richmond va 23230 usa m flos aquae culture 8 107 cells ml was diluted with milli q water to achieve a final cell density of 2 107 cells ml to simulate an algal bloom in a highly algae laden period the coagulant used for the coagulation process was chitosan cts which was dissolved in a 1 0 hydrochloric acid solution to obtain a 1 0 g l stock solution unless otherwise stated all coagulation experiments were performed three times at a ph of 6 5 0 1 referred to our pre experimental results previous studies also reported chitosan presented good coagulation at ph 6 5 ravi divakaran 2002 zeng 2013 chitosan was quickly added to the beaker with rapid mixing 200 rpm for 1 min followed by slow stirring 50 rpm for 5 min and then the suspension was allowed to settle for 20 min ten millilitres of clarified liquid 20 mm s below the surface was collected to measure the separation efficiency quantified as the optical density od at 681 nm with a uv spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa separation efficiency o d i o d f o d i 100 where odi and odf are the od before and after coagulation settling respectively to investigate the effects of eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting the harvesting efficiencies of eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in di water m flos aquae cells di water eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in eom m flos aquae cells eom and eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in iom m flos aquae cells iom at different chitosan dosages were investigated in addition the harvesting efficiencies of eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in di water m flos aquae cells di water and eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in bg11 medium m flos aquae cells bg11 were compared to evaluate the influence of residual bg11 in eom on coagulation harvesting moreover coagulation experiments with eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in different hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions of eom and iom were performed to identify the harvesting inhibitory fractions of aom according to our potentiometric titration results in table 2 there are three ph ranges that differ from the protonation state of proton active groups in hpieom and hpiiom at ph of 6 5 which are ph 2 79 3 05 2 79 3 05 ph 4 81 5 05 and ph 6 84 6 85 considering chitosan works under neutral or acidic conditions and the tolerance ph of microcystis cells ph of 4 3 was selected to compare with ph 6 5 to explore the influence of the protonation state of proton active functional groups in hydrophilic fractions on coagulation to simulate the actual influences of eom iom and their different hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions on coagulation harvesting the concentrations of different types of organic matter used in this study were adjusted to the actual concentrations contained in the m flos aquae suspension 2 107 cells ml the specific concentrations are shown in table 1 2 4 characterization of inhibitory fractions 2 4 1 charge density measurement charge titration was carried out to quantify the charge density of eom iom and their different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions the method is based on the stoichiometric reaction between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and the end point where charge neutralization has just occurred kam and gregory 1999 a standard cationic polyelectrolyte 0 001 eq l polydadmac and standard anionic solution 0 001 eq l pvs na were used to perform the titration experiment the charge titration process was carried out at ph 6 5 which was adjusted by nah2po4 na2hpo4 buffer solutions 1 mmol l kam and gregory 2001 first 150 ml of buffer solution was titrated with pvs na to charge neutrality then 10 ml of the sample eom iom or their different fractions to be measured was added to the buffer solution and polydadmac was used to make the solution charge neutral again a coagulant charge analyser cca3100 usa was used to monitor the titration endpoint the charge density was calculated according to the consumption of polydadmac q μ eq l δ v p q p v 1 000 000 where q is the charge density charge of the sample to be measured μeq l δvp is the consumption of polydadmac ml qp is the charge density of polydadmac eq l and v is the volume of the sample to be measured ml 2 4 2 fluorescence analysis probing fluorescent properties can provide valuable insights into the chemical composition of organic matter jin et al 2017 excitation emission matrices eems of hpieom and hpiiom were acquired using a fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies selango malaysia which has a maximal emission intensity of 1000 arbitrary units au an emission intensity of 800 au was used for all samples the excitation and emission slits were set to a 10 nm bandpass excitation wavelengths between 200 nm and 450 nm were used with increments of 5 nm emissions at longer wavelengths were detected in 2 nm increments sha et al 2019 the data were analysed using matlab mathworks inc natick ma and the figures were drawn by originpro 9 0 2 4 3 identification of proton active functional groups potentiometric titration was performed in a glass vessel with a lid as part of a titrando metrohm 907 switzerland unit interfaced with tiamo software to a personal computer to identify proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom a 50 ml sample was transferred to the titration vessel which was immediately attached to the lid setup connected to a n2 gas line a magnetic stir bar was also added to the vessel the whole system was degassed for 120 min to exclude co2 the sample was then titrated quickly to ph 2 5 with 0 1 m hcl the burette exchange unit was subsequently changed and titration with 0 1 m naoh was performed until reaching ph 11 the titration data were modelled using the data optimization program protofit 2 1 to obtain acidity constants pka and the concentrations of proton active functional groups zhang et al 2012 in this study fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis using an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 thermo electron usa was performed to further identify the existence of proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom the measured wavenumbers were between 4000 and 400 cm 1 before measurement the hpieom and hpiiom solutions were treated with dialysis tubes 1 kda for 48 h to remove salt ions from the solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting fig 1 a shows the harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells di water m flos aquae cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom at different chitosan dosages the highest harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells di water microcystis cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom were 95 2 0 6 94 4 2 9 and 89 6 2 1 at chitosan dosages of 4 1 mg g 5 5 mg g and 13 7 mg g respectively both m flos aquae cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom needed more chitosan than m flos aquae cells di water to achieve the same approximate harvesting efficiency these results indicate that eom and iom inhibited coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells and that the inhibition can be alleviated to a great extent by increasing the amount of chitosan a study by henderson et al 2010 supported the idea that a significant proportion of the coagulant demand when harvesting m aeruginosa by coagulation is generated by the aom to exclude the interference of residual bg11 in eom the influence of bg11 on harvesting efficiency was also studied fig a 4 paired sample tests showed no significant difference in harvesting efficiency between m flos aquae cells di water and m flos aquae cells bg11 p 0 086 which indicated that the bg11 residue in eom has no significant inhibitory effect on coagulation the concentration of aom is an important factor affecting coagulant consumption baresova et al 2017 vandamme et al 2012 fig 1 b shows the effect of the concentrations of eom and iom on the consumption of chitosan at 90 harvesting efficiency both the eom and iom concentrations had obvious linear relationships with chitosan dosage when the harvesting efficiency was 90 and the correlation coefficients were 0 92 and 0 99 respectively the slopes of the line fits of eom and iom were 0 022 and 0 105 respectively which indicated that the increase in chitosan consumption caused by the increase in iom was 4 7 times that caused by the increase in eom takaara et al 2007 also reported that iom exhibited stronger coagulation inhibition than eom although the doc content of iom was lower than that of eom in this study the doc contents of eom and iom extracted from the m flos aquae suspension of 2 107 cells ml were 63 9 mg l and 96 0 mg l 89 4 cell fragmentation rate respectively according to the concentrations of eom and iom and their chitosan dosages at 90 0 harvesting efficiency when the cell fragmentation rate was more than 12 5 iom played a major inhibitory role otherwise eom was the main harvesting inhibitory component the secretion of eom and the release of iom depend mainly on the growth phase growth conditions and harvesting conditions pivokonsky et al 2014 zhao et al 2015a therefore the selection of an appropriate harvesting period or mild coagulation conditions could decrease the coagulant dosage and increase the coagulation efficiency 3 2 influences of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of eom and iom eom and iom extracted from m flos aquae were fractionated into five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and the results are shown in fig a5 hpon hpoa tpin tpia and hpi accounted for 8 0 25 0 11 4 13 7 and 52 9 of eom and 4 7 25 0 3 6 2 8 and 64 0 of iom respectively the hpi fractions of eom and iom accounted for more than half of the total eom and iom which was similar to the results of li et al 2012 in which hpi accounted for 53 0 and 76 0 of eom and iom for m aeruginosa respectively fig 2 presents the influences of different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions from eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting when the chitosan dosage was 11 mg g m flos aquae cells eom had a higher harvesting efficiency of 93 5 0 6 than did m flos aquae cells iom with a value of 78 9 5 7 among m flos aquae cells the five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions in eom m flos aquae cells hpieom had the lowest harvesting efficiency of 68 3 2 6 while the harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells other fractions were higher than 90 0 similarly for the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells the five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions in iom the lowest harvesting efficiency was 15 7 5 1 for m flos aquae cells hpiiom and m flos aquae cells other fractions had harvesting efficiencies of more than 90 0 these results suggested that hpieom and hpiiom were the main harvesting inhibitory fractions pivokonsky et al 2006 also reported that a high percentage of the hydrophilic fraction would decrease the coagulation efficiency fig 3 shows the charge densities of eom iom and their different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions the charge density q of eom was 86 2 3 1 μeq l while that of iom was 543 7 18 7 μeq l henderson et al henderson et al 2010 analyzed the relationship between the charge density of some algal systems and coagulant demand and found a significant positive correlation between them therefore the finding that iom has a higher charge density than eom could explain the phenomenon that iom increased chitosan demand more than eom did at the same concentration moreover among the different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions hpiiom had the highest charge density which was 401 6 44 2 μeq l and the second highest q was 49 5 3 3 μeq l for hpieom this result is supported by henderson et al 2008 who observed that charge density increased as hydrophilicity increased in the aom of m aeruginosa hydrophilic substances usually contain large amounts of hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups ghernaout 2014 and deprotonation of these functional groups results in a high negative charge dittrich and sibler 2005 the differences in charge densities for the five fractions in aom were caused by the differences in their concentrations and component characteristics the q c μeq mg results in fig 3 indicate the contribution of component characteristics in different fractions to the negative charge compared with other fractions hpieom and hpiiom had high q c values of 3 2 0 2 μeq mg and 5 8 1 3 μeq mg respectively therefore both the concentration and characteristics of hydrophilic fractions contributed to their high charge density based on the simplified dlvo theory wu et al 2009 evaluated the coagulation mechanisms of silica suspensions induced by alum and pacl in terms of interaction forces it was demonstrated that the between particles is greatly decreased because the adsorbing coagulants decrease the negative charges on their surface leading to a sharp reduction in electrical repulsion similarly the effects of eom iom and their different fractions on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells can also be well explained by this theory according to the charge density results eom and iom contained large negative charges which increased the energy barrier when the m flos aquae suspension contains a large amount of eom and iom more coagulant is needed to overcome the energy barrier to form cell eom iom cell flocs compared with other fractions hydrophilic fractions hpieom and hpiiom with higher negative charges resulted in higher energy barriers to be overcome during coagulation harvesting therefore the hydrophilic fraction hpi of eom and iom was the main inhibitory fractions due to its high negative charges 3 3 coagulation inhibitory mechanism of proton active functional groups from the hpi fraction 3 3 1 identification and quantification of proton active functional groups the proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom were identified and the results are shown in table 2 through comparison of the mean pka values of the four groups with those of known functional groups from previous studies henderson et al 2010 zhao et al 2015b sites with pk1 3 05 2 79 can be assigned to phosphodiester groups while those with pk2 5 05 and 4 81 are assigned to carboxylic groups pk3 6 85 6 84 are within the range of phosphoryl groups the remaining values of pk4 8 85 9 64 are within the range of amine hydroxyl groups the ftir spectra shown in fig a 6 further revealed the presence of phosphodiester carboxylic phosphoryl and amine hydroxyl functional groups in both hpieom and hpiiom a report by zhao et al 2015b also identified phosphodiester carboxylic phosphate and amino functional groups from the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps of some bacterial surfaces additionally according to the fluorescent properties of hpieom and hpiiom characterized by eem spectroscopy fig a 7 humic acid like substances and protein like substances were found in hpieom and hpiiom respectively protein contains proton active amino and carboxyl groups pivokonsky et al 2012 while ha contains proton active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups ai et al 2020 therefore protein like substances and humic like substances may be important sources of some proton active functional groups in aom the concentrations of proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom are presented in fig 4 for hpieom the concentration of carboxyl functional groups was 0 7 0 1 mmol g and the concentrations of the other three functional groups were close to 1 mmol g the concentrations of functional groups in hpiiom decreased in the order hydroxyl amine 16 2 4 3 mmol g phosphoryl 5 7 1 5 mmol g phosphodiester 2 8 0 5 mmol g carboxyl 2 7 1 0 mmol g moreover fig 4 shows that the total concentration of phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpieom was 1 7 mmol g while the total concentration of phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpiiom was 5 5 mmol g approximately 3 3 times that in hpieom similarly the q c of hpiiom 7 1 1 3 μeq mg was approximately 3 to 4 times that of hpieom 1 6 0 1 μeq mg as shown in fig 3 these results indicate that both phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups were primary causes of electronegativity in hpieom hpiiom at ph 6 5 3 3 2 inhibitory mechanism of proton active functional groups the deprotonation of proton active functional groups is a primary source of negative charge in organic polymers ai et al 2020 in this study according to the results of potentiometric titration for hpieom hpiiom when 5 05 4 81 ph 6 85 6 84 phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups were deprotonated similarly zhao et al 2015b found that both phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups from the cell surface of bacillus subtilis were deprotonated when 4 74 ph 6 81 fig 5 shows the effects of hpieom and hpiiom on the harvesting efficiencies at ph 4 3 and ph 6 5 in fig 5 a when hpieom increased from 0 to 41 0 mg l the harvesting efficiencies at ph 4 3 and ph 6 5 decreased previous studies also reported that elevated aom concentrations would disturb coagulation and increase coagulant demand baresova et al 2017 vandamme et al 2012 for coagulation at ph 6 5 the harvesting efficiency at 0 mg l hpieom was 94 2 0 001 and that at 41 0 mg l hpieom was 56 1 2 9 compared with coagulation harvesting at ph 6 5 coagulation at ph 4 3 resulted in a lower initial harvesting efficiency of 79 7 3 0 and a higher final harvesting efficiency of 64 4 4 3 similarly fig 5 b shows that with an increase in hpiiom from 0 to 22 1 mg l the harvesting efficiencies at ph 6 5 and ph 4 3 decreased and the rate of decrease in the harvesting efficiency at ph 6 5 was higher than that at ph 4 3 this result was supported by das et al 2016 who investigated the influence of ph on the harvesting efficiency of scenedesmus sp and found that reducing the culture ph below 6 5 can greatly improve the harvesting efficiency according to the results of potentiometric titration of hpi when the ph was adjusted from 6 5 to 4 3 carboxyl groups were protonated and therefore these functional groups no longer participated in the consumption of chitosan in the coagulation system therefore compared with coagulation at ph 6 5 coagulation at ph 4 3 can decrease the consumption of chitosan this explanation is supported by baresova et al 2017 who observed that if the ph drops close to or below the dissociation constants of carboxyl groups cellular organic matter is progressively protonated and the electrostatic repulsions with cells consequently decrease the harvesting inhibition caused by deprotonated functional groups depends on their characteristics and concentrations fig 6 presents the influences of deprotonated phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups on coagulation harvesting coagulation inhibition increased with increases in deprotonated phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups originating from hpieom hpiiom for hpieom carboxylic functional groups had stronger coagulation inhibition than phosphodiester at the same concentration similarly carboxylic functional groups originating from hpiiom also had stronger coagulation inhibition than phosphodiester these results indicate that carboxyl groups presented higher affinity for chitosan than phosphodiester zhang et al 2014 found that the electrostatic interaction between two organic molecules was determined by the polarity of the functional groups and strong polarity resulted in high electrostatic interactions therefore carboxyl could enhance the intermolecular interaction between hpi and chitosan more than phosphodiester due to its stronger polarity in addition fig 6 shows that the inhibitory effects of carboxylic functional groups from hpieom and hpiiom were different and the inhibitory effects of phosphodiester from hpieom and hpiiom on coagulation were also different a possible explanation is that in addition to the polarity of functional groups the harvesting inhibition of deprotonated functional groups may also be related to the chemical structure of organic matter hermosilla et al 2012 and the effect of the chemical structure needs to be further analysed in future studies a schematic in fig 7 illustrates the inhibition mechanism of aom on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells at ph 6 5 the phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups of aom are deprotonated and present negative charges while chitosan is positively charged due to the protonation of the amine functional group chitosan and aom interact by coordinate electrostatic bonds between deprotonated phosphodiester carboxylic functional groups and protonated amine functional groups which results in less interaction between chitosan and m flos aquae cells therefore when the coagulation system contained a large amount of aom more chitosan was needed to overcome the effect of aom to achieve an optimal harvesting efficiency of m flos aquae cells 4 conclusion in this study both eom and iom extracted from m flos aquae could inhibit the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells and iom exhibited a stronger inhibitory capacity than eom the hydrophilic fractions in eom and iom were the main inhibitory fractions due to their high negative charge density phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom were the functional groups that caused harvesting inhibition at ph 6 5 moreover coagulation inhibition was dominated by carboxyl functional groups due to their strong polarity carboxyl functional groups were protonated when the ph was adjusted from 6 5 to 4 3 which effectively mitigated the harvesting inhibition caused by hpi these findings revealed the inhibitory mechanism of aom on chitosan based coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae from the perspective of the deprotonation of proton active functional groups in aom

17641,algogenic organic matter aom produced by microcystis cells inhibits coagulation harvesting however the harvesting inhibitory mechanisms at the functional groups level remain to be determined this study fractionated extracellular organic matter eom and intercellular organic matter iom from microcystis flos aquae into five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and investigated their inhibition of chitosan coagulation harvesting the proton active functional groups in the inhibitory fractions were further analysed by potentiometric titration and the interaction between these functional groups and chitosan was elucidated the results showed that the harvesting inhibition of m flos aquae cells was dominated by hpi in aom due to its high charge density which resulted in greater consumption of coagulant potentiometric titration results suggested that the proton active functional groups of both hpieom and hpiiom consist mainly of phosphodiester carboxylic phosphoryl and amine hydroxyl functional groups and the harvesting inhibition of hpi on m flos aquae cells at ph 6 5 was mainly due to the deprotonation of phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups moreover carboxylic functional groups with stronger polarity could enhance the intermolecular interaction between hpi and chitosan more effectively than phosphodiester at ph 6 5 preventing the deprotonation of carboxylic functional groups by adjusting the ph to 4 3 could effectively alleviate the harvesting inhibition caused by hpi these findings revealed the inhibition mechanism of aom on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells from the perspective of deprotonation of proton active functional groups which may provide important insights for assessing the role of aom in the

2010 the frequent outbreak of microcystis blooms in eutrophic freshwaters is a global issue that poses serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and water resources shi et al 2016 zurawell et al 2005 lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china has been plagued by blooms over the last two decades with microcystis flos aquae as one of the main species chen et al 2003 these blooms seriously deteriorate the water ecological environment and reduce its functionality harvesting microcystis spp not only helps bloom mitigation but also removes nutrient loading in lake and reservoir water which is considered one of the most effective methods for microcystis bloom control chen et al 2012 huang et al 2018 peng et al 2017 small cell size low biomass concentration high cell dispersion stability and density similar to that of water make the harvesting of microcystis spp an extremely difficult task barros et al 2015 gerardo et al 2015 ummalyma et al 2017 coagulation in which small cells form larger aggregates that can be separated from water by gravity sedimentation has been a popular method to harvest microalgae due to its fine separation efficiency and simple operation das et al 2016 lama et al 2016 mata et al 2010 however when harvesting microcystis spp by in situ coagulation in taihu lake we found noticeable differences in harvesting efficiency and coagulant demand with harvesting time or harvesting location previous studies showed that the presence of algogenic organic matter aom generated by microalgal cells decreased microalgal coagulation efficiency and increased coagulant demand henderson et al 2010 vandamme et al 2012 the degree of inhibition of coagulation by aom is most likely related to the quantity and composition of aom present in the coagulation system vandamme et al 2012 therefore a possible explanation was that different concentrations and compositions of aom present in taihu lake have a major influence on harvesting performance aom consists mainly of polysaccharides proteins lipids rna and small molecules and is released during the growth of microalgae as extracellular organic matter eom due to metabolic processes or as intracellular organic matter iom due to cell lysis guo et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2006 takaara et al 2010 the complexity of the composition of aom complicates the understanding of the interaction between aom and coagulants efforts have been made to explore the interaction mechanisms between some fractions separated from aom and coagulants for example pivokonsky et al 2012 demonstrated that the coagulation of peptides and proteins isolated from the iom of m aeruginosa using ferric coagulant was influenced by the formation of fe peptide protein surface complexes at ph 6 7 naceradska et al 2019 concluded that the prevailing coagulation mechanism of nonproteinaceous fractions in the aom of chlorella vulgaris using aluminum sulfate and polyaluminium chloride was the adsorption of nonproteinaceous matter onto aluminum hydroxide precipitates additionally vandamme et al 2012 found that aom interfered with flocculation using cationic biopolymers such as chitosan and cationic starch because cationic biopolymer flocculants may interact with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes within the aom such as carbohydrates and proteins these studies indicated that some fractions in aom would interfere with microalgal coagulation due to surface complex adsorption and or charge neutralization between the aom and coagulant the influence of aom on the coagulation process was associated with the physicochemical characteristics of the fractions such as charge density hydrophobicity protein content and molecular weight henderson et al 2010 some studies have indicated that charge neutralization played an important role in the interaction between aom and coagulant chekli et al 2017 henderson et al 2010 aom extracted from microalgae is negatively charged henderson et al 2008 and the charge density of aom occurs as a result of charged organic matter in aom sun et al 2020 takaara et al 2010 charged organic matter usually contains a certain amount of proton active functional groups i e carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups and the deprotonation of these functional groups is a primary source of negative charge dittrich and sibler 2005 therefore the proton active functional group composition in aom may be an essential factor in the influence of aom on the coagulation process this was supported by pivokonsky et al 2012 who reported that m aeruginosa peptides and proteins were coagulated by the attractive interaction between deprotonized carboxyl groups of peptides proteins and positively charged hydrolysis products of ferric coagulant at ph 4 6 ai et al 2020 investigated the coagulation of humic acid ha in metal ion solutions and found that the coagulation process of has is directly influenced by the protonation state of the functional groups in has these previous studies provided direct insights into the intrinsic mechanisms of the coagulation behaviour of organic matter and its complexation with coagulants however thus far little attention has been given to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of proton active functional groups in aom and their roles in the coagulation process have not been quantitatively evaluated the qualitative and quantitative relationships between proton active functional groups in aom and coagulants remain to be explored the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the influences of eom iom and their hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions on chitosan coagulation harvesting 2 to determine whether the harvesting inhibitions of different fractions of aom on microcystis cells were related to their charge densities and 3 to reveal the harvesting inhibition mechanisms of aom from the perspective of protonation and deprotonation of pro active functional groups this study improves our understanding of the role of proton active functional groups in aom on coagulation harvesting and reveals the differential impacts of different aom compositions and different coagulation conditions on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae 2 materials and methods 2 1 microcystis flos aquae cultivation and eom iom extraction a strain of m flos aquae fachb 1028 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china axenic cultures were prepared in a 10 l photobioreactor with bg11 medium at 25 c with illumination of 8000 lx provided for 14 h every day a carbon dioxide and air mixture 2 0 5 0 co2 was continuously aerated into the photobioreactor to maintain the optimal growth of m flos aquae microcystis cells were continuously counted for 40 consecutive days with a microscope olympus bx53 japan the growth of m flos aquae is presented in fig a1 m flos aquae was harvested in its stationary period after a culture time of 18 days and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min eom was extracted by filtering the supernatant through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes using the method described by qu et al 2012 the separated m flos aquae cells were re suspended in milli q water and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to wash off the remaining eom the washing process was repeated three times until the toc in the supernatant was less than 0 50 mg l the cells were then broken up at 4 c with a high pressure of 1 8 105 kpa using a cryogenic ultrahigh pressure cell fragmentation apparatus jnb10 guangzhou juneng biology technology co ltd china the cell fragmentation rate was measured by a mastersizer 3000 malvern uk and was nearly 89 as shown in fig a2 most cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and the organic matter in the filtrate was referred to as iom 2 2 fractionation of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions an automatic hydrophilic and hydrophobic fraction separation and collection device hydrofractor s4f5 accurate co wuhan china was used to fractionate the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions from eom and iom in fig a 3 an xad 7hp xad 4 column was used to fractionate the eom iom into hydrophobic neutral hpon hydrophobic acid hpoa transphilic neutral tpin transphilic acid tpia and hydrophilic hpi fractions following established methods aiken et al 1992 chow et al 2006 and the specific separation steps are shown in fig a 3 a uv detector was used to automatically detect the collection endpoint of each fraction acetonitrile was removed from the acetonitrile containing fractions hpon and tpin by spinning 30 c 3 kpa the dissolved organic carbon doc in different fractions was quantified using a toc l series analyser shimadzu kyoto japan before measurement samples were adjusted to ph 7 the recovery rates of doc after separation were 90 8 and 92 4 respectively for eom and iom the separation results are shown in fig a 5 and the presented percentages are normalized to 100 2 3 coagulation harvesting experiment the coagulation experiment was performed using a six paddle jar test apparatus with 100 ml beakers phipps bird richmond va 23230 usa m flos aquae culture 8 107 cells ml was diluted with milli q water to achieve a final cell density of 2 107 cells ml to simulate an algal bloom in a highly algae laden period the coagulant used for the coagulation process was chitosan cts which was dissolved in a 1 0 hydrochloric acid solution to obtain a 1 0 g l stock solution unless otherwise stated all coagulation experiments were performed three times at a ph of 6 5 0 1 referred to our pre experimental results previous studies also reported chitosan presented good coagulation at ph 6 5 ravi divakaran 2002 zeng 2013 chitosan was quickly added to the beaker with rapid mixing 200 rpm for 1 min followed by slow stirring 50 rpm for 5 min and then the suspension was allowed to settle for 20 min ten millilitres of clarified liquid 20 mm s below the surface was collected to measure the separation efficiency quantified as the optical density od at 681 nm with a uv spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa separation efficiency o d i o d f o d i 100 where odi and odf are the od before and after coagulation settling respectively to investigate the effects of eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting the harvesting efficiencies of eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in di water m flos aquae cells di water eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in eom m flos aquae cells eom and eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in iom m flos aquae cells iom at different chitosan dosages were investigated in addition the harvesting efficiencies of eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in di water m flos aquae cells di water and eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in bg11 medium m flos aquae cells bg11 were compared to evaluate the influence of residual bg11 in eom on coagulation harvesting moreover coagulation experiments with eom free m flos aquae cells re suspended in different hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions of eom and iom were performed to identify the harvesting inhibitory fractions of aom according to our potentiometric titration results in table 2 there are three ph ranges that differ from the protonation state of proton active groups in hpieom and hpiiom at ph of 6 5 which are ph 2 79 3 05 2 79 3 05 ph 4 81 5 05 and ph 6 84 6 85 considering chitosan works under neutral or acidic conditions and the tolerance ph of microcystis cells ph of 4 3 was selected to compare with ph 6 5 to explore the influence of the protonation state of proton active functional groups in hydrophilic fractions on coagulation to simulate the actual influences of eom iom and their different hydrophobic hydrophilic fractions on coagulation harvesting the concentrations of different types of organic matter used in this study were adjusted to the actual concentrations contained in the m flos aquae suspension 2 107 cells ml the specific concentrations are shown in table 1 2 4 characterization of inhibitory fractions 2 4 1 charge density measurement charge titration was carried out to quantify the charge density of eom iom and their different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions the method is based on the stoichiometric reaction between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and the end point where charge neutralization has just occurred kam and gregory 1999 a standard cationic polyelectrolyte 0 001 eq l polydadmac and standard anionic solution 0 001 eq l pvs na were used to perform the titration experiment the charge titration process was carried out at ph 6 5 which was adjusted by nah2po4 na2hpo4 buffer solutions 1 mmol l kam and gregory 2001 first 150 ml of buffer solution was titrated with pvs na to charge neutrality then 10 ml of the sample eom iom or their different fractions to be measured was added to the buffer solution and polydadmac was used to make the solution charge neutral again a coagulant charge analyser cca3100 usa was used to monitor the titration endpoint the charge density was calculated according to the consumption of polydadmac q μ eq l δ v p q p v 1 000 000 where q is the charge density charge of the sample to be measured μeq l δvp is the consumption of polydadmac ml qp is the charge density of polydadmac eq l and v is the volume of the sample to be measured ml 2 4 2 fluorescence analysis probing fluorescent properties can provide valuable insights into the chemical composition of organic matter jin et al 2017 excitation emission matrices eems of hpieom and hpiiom were acquired using a fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies selango malaysia which has a maximal emission intensity of 1000 arbitrary units au an emission intensity of 800 au was used for all samples the excitation and emission slits were set to a 10 nm bandpass excitation wavelengths between 200 nm and 450 nm were used with increments of 5 nm emissions at longer wavelengths were detected in 2 nm increments sha et al 2019 the data were analysed using matlab mathworks inc natick ma and the figures were drawn by originpro 9 0 2 4 3 identification of proton active functional groups potentiometric titration was performed in a glass vessel with a lid as part of a titrando metrohm 907 switzerland unit interfaced with tiamo software to a personal computer to identify proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom a 50 ml sample was transferred to the titration vessel which was immediately attached to the lid setup connected to a n2 gas line a magnetic stir bar was also added to the vessel the whole system was degassed for 120 min to exclude co2 the sample was then titrated quickly to ph 2 5 with 0 1 m hcl the burette exchange unit was subsequently changed and titration with 0 1 m naoh was performed until reaching ph 11 the titration data were modelled using the data optimization program protofit 2 1 to obtain acidity constants pka and the concentrations of proton active functional groups zhang et al 2012 in this study fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis using an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 thermo electron usa was performed to further identify the existence of proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom the measured wavenumbers were between 4000 and 400 cm 1 before measurement the hpieom and hpiiom solutions were treated with dialysis tubes 1 kda for 48 h to remove salt ions from the solutions 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting fig 1 a shows the harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells di water m flos aquae cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom at different chitosan dosages the highest harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells di water microcystis cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom were 95 2 0 6 94 4 2 9 and 89 6 2 1 at chitosan dosages of 4 1 mg g 5 5 mg g and 13 7 mg g respectively both m flos aquae cells eom and m flos aquae cells iom needed more chitosan than m flos aquae cells di water to achieve the same approximate harvesting efficiency these results indicate that eom and iom inhibited coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells and that the inhibition can be alleviated to a great extent by increasing the amount of chitosan a study by henderson et al 2010 supported the idea that a significant proportion of the coagulant demand when harvesting m aeruginosa by coagulation is generated by the aom to exclude the interference of residual bg11 in eom the influence of bg11 on harvesting efficiency was also studied fig a 4 paired sample tests showed no significant difference in harvesting efficiency between m flos aquae cells di water and m flos aquae cells bg11 p 0 086 which indicated that the bg11 residue in eom has no significant inhibitory effect on coagulation the concentration of aom is an important factor affecting coagulant consumption baresova et al 2017 vandamme et al 2012 fig 1 b shows the effect of the concentrations of eom and iom on the consumption of chitosan at 90 harvesting efficiency both the eom and iom concentrations had obvious linear relationships with chitosan dosage when the harvesting efficiency was 90 and the correlation coefficients were 0 92 and 0 99 respectively the slopes of the line fits of eom and iom were 0 022 and 0 105 respectively which indicated that the increase in chitosan consumption caused by the increase in iom was 4 7 times that caused by the increase in eom takaara et al 2007 also reported that iom exhibited stronger coagulation inhibition than eom although the doc content of iom was lower than that of eom in this study the doc contents of eom and iom extracted from the m flos aquae suspension of 2 107 cells ml were 63 9 mg l and 96 0 mg l 89 4 cell fragmentation rate respectively according to the concentrations of eom and iom and their chitosan dosages at 90 0 harvesting efficiency when the cell fragmentation rate was more than 12 5 iom played a major inhibitory role otherwise eom was the main harvesting inhibitory component the secretion of eom and the release of iom depend mainly on the growth phase growth conditions and harvesting conditions pivokonsky et al 2014 zhao et al 2015a therefore the selection of an appropriate harvesting period or mild coagulation conditions could decrease the coagulant dosage and increase the coagulation efficiency 3 2 influences of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions of eom and iom eom and iom extracted from m flos aquae were fractionated into five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and the results are shown in fig a5 hpon hpoa tpin tpia and hpi accounted for 8 0 25 0 11 4 13 7 and 52 9 of eom and 4 7 25 0 3 6 2 8 and 64 0 of iom respectively the hpi fractions of eom and iom accounted for more than half of the total eom and iom which was similar to the results of li et al 2012 in which hpi accounted for 53 0 and 76 0 of eom and iom for m aeruginosa respectively fig 2 presents the influences of different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions from eom and iom on chitosan coagulation harvesting when the chitosan dosage was 11 mg g m flos aquae cells eom had a higher harvesting efficiency of 93 5 0 6 than did m flos aquae cells iom with a value of 78 9 5 7 among m flos aquae cells the five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions in eom m flos aquae cells hpieom had the lowest harvesting efficiency of 68 3 2 6 while the harvesting efficiencies of m flos aquae cells other fractions were higher than 90 0 similarly for the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells the five different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions in iom the lowest harvesting efficiency was 15 7 5 1 for m flos aquae cells hpiiom and m flos aquae cells other fractions had harvesting efficiencies of more than 90 0 these results suggested that hpieom and hpiiom were the main harvesting inhibitory fractions pivokonsky et al 2006 also reported that a high percentage of the hydrophilic fraction would decrease the coagulation efficiency fig 3 shows the charge densities of eom iom and their different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions the charge density q of eom was 86 2 3 1 μeq l while that of iom was 543 7 18 7 μeq l henderson et al henderson et al 2010 analyzed the relationship between the charge density of some algal systems and coagulant demand and found a significant positive correlation between them therefore the finding that iom has a higher charge density than eom could explain the phenomenon that iom increased chitosan demand more than eom did at the same concentration moreover among the different hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions hpiiom had the highest charge density which was 401 6 44 2 μeq l and the second highest q was 49 5 3 3 μeq l for hpieom this result is supported by henderson et al 2008 who observed that charge density increased as hydrophilicity increased in the aom of m aeruginosa hydrophilic substances usually contain large amounts of hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups ghernaout 2014 and deprotonation of these functional groups results in a high negative charge dittrich and sibler 2005 the differences in charge densities for the five fractions in aom were caused by the differences in their concentrations and component characteristics the q c μeq mg results in fig 3 indicate the contribution of component characteristics in different fractions to the negative charge compared with other fractions hpieom and hpiiom had high q c values of 3 2 0 2 μeq mg and 5 8 1 3 μeq mg respectively therefore both the concentration and characteristics of hydrophilic fractions contributed to their high charge density based on the simplified dlvo theory wu et al 2009 evaluated the coagulation mechanisms of silica suspensions induced by alum and pacl in terms of interaction forces it was demonstrated that the between particles is greatly decreased because the adsorbing coagulants decrease the negative charges on their surface leading to a sharp reduction in electrical repulsion similarly the effects of eom iom and their different fractions on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells can also be well explained by this theory according to the charge density results eom and iom contained large negative charges which increased the energy barrier when the m flos aquae suspension contains a large amount of eom and iom more coagulant is needed to overcome the energy barrier to form cell eom iom cell flocs compared with other fractions hydrophilic fractions hpieom and hpiiom with higher negative charges resulted in higher energy barriers to be overcome during coagulation harvesting therefore the hydrophilic fraction hpi of eom and iom was the main inhibitory fractions due to its high negative charges 3 3 coagulation inhibitory mechanism of proton active functional groups from the hpi fraction 3 3 1 identification and quantification of proton active functional groups the proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom were identified and the results are shown in table 2 through comparison of the mean pka values of the four groups with those of known functional groups from previous studies henderson et al 2010 zhao et al 2015b sites with pk1 3 05 2 79 can be assigned to phosphodiester groups while those with pk2 5 05 and 4 81 are assigned to carboxylic groups pk3 6 85 6 84 are within the range of phosphoryl groups the remaining values of pk4 8 85 9 64 are within the range of amine hydroxyl groups the ftir spectra shown in fig a 6 further revealed the presence of phosphodiester carboxylic phosphoryl and amine hydroxyl functional groups in both hpieom and hpiiom a report by zhao et al 2015b also identified phosphodiester carboxylic phosphate and amino functional groups from the loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps of some bacterial surfaces additionally according to the fluorescent properties of hpieom and hpiiom characterized by eem spectroscopy fig a 7 humic acid like substances and protein like substances were found in hpieom and hpiiom respectively protein contains proton active amino and carboxyl groups pivokonsky et al 2012 while ha contains proton active hydroxyl and carboxyl groups ai et al 2020 therefore protein like substances and humic like substances may be important sources of some proton active functional groups in aom the concentrations of proton active functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom are presented in fig 4 for hpieom the concentration of carboxyl functional groups was 0 7 0 1 mmol g and the concentrations of the other three functional groups were close to 1 mmol g the concentrations of functional groups in hpiiom decreased in the order hydroxyl amine 16 2 4 3 mmol g phosphoryl 5 7 1 5 mmol g phosphodiester 2 8 0 5 mmol g carboxyl 2 7 1 0 mmol g moreover fig 4 shows that the total concentration of phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpieom was 1 7 mmol g while the total concentration of phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpiiom was 5 5 mmol g approximately 3 3 times that in hpieom similarly the q c of hpiiom 7 1 1 3 μeq mg was approximately 3 to 4 times that of hpieom 1 6 0 1 μeq mg as shown in fig 3 these results indicate that both phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups were primary causes of electronegativity in hpieom hpiiom at ph 6 5 3 3 2 inhibitory mechanism of proton active functional groups the deprotonation of proton active functional groups is a primary source of negative charge in organic polymers ai et al 2020 in this study according to the results of potentiometric titration for hpieom hpiiom when 5 05 4 81 ph 6 85 6 84 phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups were deprotonated similarly zhao et al 2015b found that both phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups from the cell surface of bacillus subtilis were deprotonated when 4 74 ph 6 81 fig 5 shows the effects of hpieom and hpiiom on the harvesting efficiencies at ph 4 3 and ph 6 5 in fig 5 a when hpieom increased from 0 to 41 0 mg l the harvesting efficiencies at ph 4 3 and ph 6 5 decreased previous studies also reported that elevated aom concentrations would disturb coagulation and increase coagulant demand baresova et al 2017 vandamme et al 2012 for coagulation at ph 6 5 the harvesting efficiency at 0 mg l hpieom was 94 2 0 001 and that at 41 0 mg l hpieom was 56 1 2 9 compared with coagulation harvesting at ph 6 5 coagulation at ph 4 3 resulted in a lower initial harvesting efficiency of 79 7 3 0 and a higher final harvesting efficiency of 64 4 4 3 similarly fig 5 b shows that with an increase in hpiiom from 0 to 22 1 mg l the harvesting efficiencies at ph 6 5 and ph 4 3 decreased and the rate of decrease in the harvesting efficiency at ph 6 5 was higher than that at ph 4 3 this result was supported by das et al 2016 who investigated the influence of ph on the harvesting efficiency of scenedesmus sp and found that reducing the culture ph below 6 5 can greatly improve the harvesting efficiency according to the results of potentiometric titration of hpi when the ph was adjusted from 6 5 to 4 3 carboxyl groups were protonated and therefore these functional groups no longer participated in the consumption of chitosan in the coagulation system therefore compared with coagulation at ph 6 5 coagulation at ph 4 3 can decrease the consumption of chitosan this explanation is supported by baresova et al 2017 who observed that if the ph drops close to or below the dissociation constants of carboxyl groups cellular organic matter is progressively protonated and the electrostatic repulsions with cells consequently decrease the harvesting inhibition caused by deprotonated functional groups depends on their characteristics and concentrations fig 6 presents the influences of deprotonated phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups on coagulation harvesting coagulation inhibition increased with increases in deprotonated phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups originating from hpieom hpiiom for hpieom carboxylic functional groups had stronger coagulation inhibition than phosphodiester at the same concentration similarly carboxylic functional groups originating from hpiiom also had stronger coagulation inhibition than phosphodiester these results indicate that carboxyl groups presented higher affinity for chitosan than phosphodiester zhang et al 2014 found that the electrostatic interaction between two organic molecules was determined by the polarity of the functional groups and strong polarity resulted in high electrostatic interactions therefore carboxyl could enhance the intermolecular interaction between hpi and chitosan more than phosphodiester due to its stronger polarity in addition fig 6 shows that the inhibitory effects of carboxylic functional groups from hpieom and hpiiom were different and the inhibitory effects of phosphodiester from hpieom and hpiiom on coagulation were also different a possible explanation is that in addition to the polarity of functional groups the harvesting inhibition of deprotonated functional groups may also be related to the chemical structure of organic matter hermosilla et al 2012 and the effect of the chemical structure needs to be further analysed in future studies a schematic in fig 7 illustrates the inhibition mechanism of aom on the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells at ph 6 5 the phosphodiester and carboxylic functional groups of aom are deprotonated and present negative charges while chitosan is positively charged due to the protonation of the amine functional group chitosan and aom interact by coordinate electrostatic bonds between deprotonated phosphodiester carboxylic functional groups and protonated amine functional groups which results in less interaction between chitosan and m flos aquae cells therefore when the coagulation system contained a large amount of aom more chitosan was needed to overcome the effect of aom to achieve an optimal harvesting efficiency of m flos aquae cells 4 conclusion in this study both eom and iom extracted from m flos aquae could inhibit the coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae cells and iom exhibited a stronger inhibitory capacity than eom the hydrophilic fractions in eom and iom were the main inhibitory fractions due to their high negative charge density phosphodiester and carboxyl functional groups in hpieom and hpiiom were the functional groups that caused harvesting inhibition at ph 6 5 moreover coagulation inhibition was dominated by carboxyl functional groups due to their strong polarity carboxyl functional groups were protonated when the ph was adjusted from 6 5 to 4 3 which effectively mitigated the harvesting inhibition caused by hpi these findings revealed the inhibitory mechanism of aom on chitosan based coagulation harvesting of m flos aquae from the perspective of the deprotonation of proton active functional groups in aom

unmodified or electrodes modified with hydrophobic groups c2h5 in addition early stage films formed on hydrophilic electrodes are dominated by the gram negative sulfur reducing bacterium desulfuromonas acetexigens while geobacter sp dominates on c2h5 and unmodified electrodes as biofilms mature current generation becomes similar and d acetexigens dominates in all biofilms irrespective of surface chemistry electrochemistry of pure culture d acetexigens biofilms reveal that this microbe is capable of forming electroactive biofilms producing considerable current density of 9 a m2 in a short period of potential induced growth 19 h following inoculation using acetate as an electron donor the inability of d acetexigens biofilms to use h2 as a sole source electron donor for current

which utilize microbial biofilms formed at a polarized electrode anode and or cathode to drive electrochemical reaction s rittmann 2018 an electrochemical potential established at the anode can induce the formation of thick electron conducting biofilms composed of special microbial communities known as electroactive bacteria schröder et al 2015 such biofilms predominately composed of anaerobic microbes respire by utilizing an electrode as a terminal electron acceptor in place of natural oxidants such as iron oxide potential electroactive bacteria can be found in diverse environments ranging from the stratosphere zhang et al 2012 to deep red sea brine pools marine sediments shehab et al 2017 including sewage patil et al 2010 sludge composts soil manure sediments rumen and agro industrial wastes koch and harnisch 2016 known and or novel electroactive bacteria thrive geographically in a wide range of ecosystems such as marshes lake sediments saline microbial mats anaerobic soils etc miceli et al 2012 thus identifying operational parameters to explore novel electroactive bacteria from mixed culture inoculums with useful metabolic capacities is important for advancing met research for niche specific applications for example the application of mets has been demonstrated in recovery of bioenergy bioelectricity and h2 from wastewaters katuri et al 2019 katuri et al 2018 anoxic nh4 removal shaw et al 2019 vilajeliu pons et al 2018 water reclamation through integration of mets with membrane filtration processes katuri et al 2018 katuri et al 2014 ma et al 2015 malaeb et al 2013 etc in order to further develop this technology it is imperative to maximize the interaction and to enable efficient electron transfer between the electroactive communities and the electrodes understanding the physiology of anodic electroactive bacteria tuning electrode properties to affect the composition of electroactive bacteria and tethering and structuring of electroactive communities from different sources at electrodes continues to be a challenge and is the subject of research for the advancement of mes technology several approaches have been developed to establish and improve electrochemical communication between the electroactive bacteria and the anode these include chemical treatment of anodes dumitru and scott 2016 and modification of anode surfaces with mediators dumitru and scott 2016 park et al 2000 and with chemical functional groups artyushkova et al 2015 cornejo et al 2015 dumitru and scott 2016 guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 lapinsonnière et al 2013 picot et al 2011 saito et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 scott et al 2007 studies show that the chemical and physical properties of the groups introduced at electrodes can promote or impede electroactive biofilm formation and activity compared to unmodified electrodes depending on the surface chemistry employed in general electrodes modified with charged hydrophilic functional groups enhanced biofilm attachment decreased start up times and improved microbial fuel cell mfc or microbial electrolysis cell mec performance guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 picot et al 2011 saito et al 2011 however the presence of non polar hydrophobic groups proved detrimental to biofilm formation and current generation guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 most studies on the effect of electrode modification on biofilms focus on current generation at an electrode and on power production in mfc assemblies few studies to date investigate the effect of electrode modification on biofilm microbial composition it has been established that electrode modification can influence microbial composition within biofilms at anodes guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 for example picot et al reported that biofilms predominately composed of bacteria from geobacter sp develop on positively charged electrodes picot et al 2011 whereas low cell attachment and geobacter sp proportion is observed on negatively charged electrodes with a mixed community evident on neutral electrodes guo et al found abundance of two geobacter sp highly similar to g psychrophilus and g sulfurreducens in matured biofilms 53 day aged developed on a range of functionalized anode surfaces guo et al 2013 the geobacter relative abundance was found to be higher on anodes functionalized with n ch3 3 so3 and oh terminal groups compared to those functionalized with ch3 in addition a higher relative abundance of g psychrophilus to g sulfurreducens was found in all biofilms revealing that surface chemistry supported the dominance of electroactive bacteria other than g sulfurreducens the electroactive bacterium expected to be dominant in anodic biofilms during acetate fed conditions however it should be noted that the inoculum consisted of effluent from the anodic chamber of an existing acetate fed microbial electrochemical reactor which may be enriched in geobacter species using a non enriched inoculum santoro et al reported development of a more diverse consortia consisting of various classes of clostridia and proteobacteria species on functionalized gold electrodes after 45 days santoro et al 2015 although such studies provide important insights into the influence of electrode functionalization on microbial community composition they have been limited to community analysis of consortia in thick biofilms at the end of relatively long growth periods information related to the effect of surface chemistry on the early stage of microbial biofilm formation its electromicrobiology and adaptability is lacking here we examine the microbial community composition at modified electrodes nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 terminal groups for both early after 90 h growth and mature multilayered biofilm after 340 h growth stage using a non enriched inoculum providing insight into biofilm adaptability and maturation we show that microbial communities can change significantly over time in addition we present electrochemical characterization of a pure culture of desulfuromonas acetexigens a gram negative bacterium which was found to dominate in the mature mixed culture biofilms developed at the electrodes using this inoculum 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode preparation custom built graphite rod electrodes 0 3 cm diameter goodfellow uk were prepared by shrouding rod lengths extending out of glass tubes using heat shrink plastic tubing alphawire uk and establishing an electrical connection at the rear with a 0 3 cm diameter copper rod farnell electronics ireland and silver epoxy adhesive radionics ireland the final exposed geometric surface area of the electrode was 3 8 cm2 prior to use these electrodes were sterilized by placement in boiling water for 15 min and washed several times with distilled water surface functionalization of electrodes to produce nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 terminal groups was achieved by electrochemical reduction of the diazonium cation generated in situ from the arylamine using either p phenylenediamine 3 4 aminophenyl propionic acid 4 aminobenzyl alcohol or 4 ethylaniline respectively briefly 8 mm of nano2 was added into a 10 mm acidic solution 0 5 m hcl of the appropriate arylamine to generate the diazonium cation followed by electrochemical reduction of the generated aryldiazonium salt by scanning from 0 4 v to 0 4 v vs ag agcl at 20 mv s for four cycles as described previously boland et al 2008 the resulting modified electrodes were removed and rinsed with large volumes of distilled water followed by ultrasonication for 1 min to remove any loosely bound species 2 2 mixed culture biofilm formation and analysis the growth medium for forming mixed culture biofilms was based on g sulfurreducens medium http www dsmz de medium no 826 lacking sodium fumarate and containing 10 mm acetate as electron donor the medium was purged with n2 co2 80 20 gas mix for 60 min at 10 ml min gas flow rate to prepare an oxygen free solution and then subjected to autoclaving 121 c 15 min after autoclaving bottles were transferred into an anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa to maintain an anaerobic environment for the medium mixed culture

the sludge was crushed and graded by sieving ø 0 4 mm and subsequently concentrated centrifuge 7000 g 10 min at 20 c washed and re suspended in 100 ml of sterile de gassed growth medium fresh acetate electron donor to provide 10 mm concentration was added to the reactor after 45 h operation after 90 h at the end of the batch feed operation the reactor was completely drained and electrode samples taken for analysis the reactor was then filled with fresh growth medium containing 10 mm acetate with no additional inoculum and the reactor conditions switched to continuous mode by pumping culture medium containing 10 mm acetate culture medium was maintained in sterile and anaerobic conditions in a reservoir with a working volume of 1 l the reservoir was equipped with several ports for continuous purging with n2 for pumping culture medium into the reactor and for sampling culture medium sterile 0 2 mm gas filters were placed on all gas and liquid handling ports except that for pumping the medium from reservoir to reactor all inoculations were carried out in a sterile anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa and all incubations were performed at 30 c in a controlled temperature room all electrodes 1 cm2 sampled after the batch feed period 90 h growth were transferred to separate 15 ml vials containing 3 ml of sterile extraction solution phosphate buffer ph 7 0 50 mm following biofilm extraction through vigorous vortex 2 ml of the solution was transferred separately to individual vials for molecular microbial ecology and cell counts analysis the remainder of the solution i e 1 ml was filtered through 0 2 µm sterile filter to obtain a cell free solution for screening of the presence of soluble mediators in the biofilm matrix using cv analysis a miniature custom built three electrode electrochemical cell used to conduct voltammetry in the small volume electrolyte using a graphite disc 6 mm diameter and platinum wire as working and counter electrodes respectively in addition 0 5 cm length of each electrode was sampled and fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde solution for subsequent microscopy analysis the remaining length of each electrode was transferred to a new electrochemical cell containing fresh growth medium but with no acetate as electron donor in order to perform non turnover voltammetry a similar sample analysis protocol was adopted for electrodes collected at the end of the continuous feed growth period at 340 h 2 3 d acetexigens biofilm formation and analysis the d acetexigens strain dsm 1397 was cultured at 30 c in 50 ml air tight rubber septa sealed anaerobic syringe bottles containing 45 ml of growth medium dsm 148 and subsequently sub cultured three times each batch incubated for 3 days in fumarate containing growth medium prior to inoculation in the electrochemical cell the cell pellet collected through centrifugation at 8000x for 5 min was used as an inoculum 10 w v cell density 3 2 108 cells ml for the tests d acetexigens biofilms were developed on graphite rod 4 8 cm2 electrodes by application of constant potential 0 1 v vs ag agcl in a three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using d acetoexigens growth medium lacking fumarate resazurin and na2s as electrolyte with 10 mm sodium acetate as electron donor four reactors were operated in parallel in fed batch mode under the same operational conditions all inoculations batch changes were carried out in a sterile anaerobic glove box labconco usa and incubations were performed at 30 c in a controlled temperature room the interaction and growth of d acetexigens cells on functionalized nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 anodes during early stage of growth was studied by placing electrodes in a custom built glass electrochemical reactor and application of constant potential 0 1 v vs ag agcl using a multi channel potentiostat ch instruments usa a common platinum gauze 5 cm 6 cm counter electrode and ag agcl reference electrode

ml with growth terminated at 25 h after inoculation to measure biomass density on the electrodes 3 results 3 1 electrode modification graphite electrodes were modified through in situ formation and subsequent electroreduction of aryldiazonium salts from arylamines as previously described boland et al 2008 selection of arylamines containing terminal nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 functional groups results in formation of surfaces presenting such groups voltammograms for the aryldiazonium salt electroreduction process are presented in fig s1 showing reduction currents for the salts at 0 13 v for nh2 0 17 v for cooh 0 08 v for oh and 0 02 v for c2h5 electrodes v vs ag agcl the decrease in reduction peak current on the second voltammetric scan is indicative of coupled layer formation boland et al 2008 zeta potential and contact angle for these electrodes measured in growth media are presented in table s1 electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh groups display surface zeta potential values that are similar with the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized electrodes showing more negative zeta potentials in the growth medium similarly the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized electrodes have the highest contact angles indicative of surfaces of more hydrophobic character compared to the surfaces functionalized to introduce groups capable of hydrogen bonding such as the nh2 cooh and oh groups the cell mats prepared using biofilms of g sulfurreducens or d acetexigens display a relatively low negative zeta potential and low contact angles indicating material that is hydrophilic and relatively easily wetted 3 2 electrochemical characterization of biofilms induction of growth of electroactive bacteria and bacterial biofilms on the electrode surfaces was implemented by polarization of all electrodes in duplicate at 0 1 v vs ag agcl in a three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using an anaerobic sludge mixed culture inoculum and acetate as carbon and energy source initial start up of bacterial biofilm growth was undertaken in a batch reactor configuration with removal of inoculum and replenishment of acetate feed at 45 h when the current started to fall following a period of growth fig 1 a in contrast to other studies lapinsonnière et al 2013 electrode modification did not appear to dramatically affect the time taken for current generation to occur onset of a rapid growth in current for all electrodes commences between 60 65 h after initial inoculation which is 20 25 h after removal of inoculum and introduction of fresh acetate as feed in the batch mode configuration however consistent with earlier studies cornejo et al 2015 guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 santoro et al 2015 the magnitude of the maximum current density during this early batch feed cycle is influenced by surface chemistry anode surfaces functionalized with chemical functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding and therefore more hydrophilic nh2 cooh and oh yield higher currents compared to the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized surfaces fig 1b following this initial period 90 h of electrochemically induced growth in a batch fed system a set of electrodes was removed for cyclic voltammetric cv microscopic and sequencing analysis the other set of electrodes was placed in the reactor and continuous flow of acetate containing cell culture medium commenced at a flow rate of 1 l day followed by switching to 0 5 l day after approximately 40 h of continuous feed operation fig 1c black arrow during 1 l day continuous feed operation all electrodes produced similar current profiles with the exception of the c2h5 functionalized electrode which produced significantly lower current decreasing the flow rate of acetate feed to 0 5 l day at 135 h after initial inoculation of the electrodes see fig 1c resulted in lower magnitude of current output for all electrodes except for the c2h5 functionalized electrode which produced now a similar current to that produced by all other electrodes the decrease in current as a function of flow rate in this study is indicative of acetate mass transport controlled current production continuous feed was maintained up to 340 h after inoculation fig s2 with similar current profiles observed for biofilms developed on all electrodes regardless of flow rate or interruption interruption of current generation was implemented to enable recording of cv at several intervals during the continuous feed period with these cvs compared to cvs for early stage biofilms taken at the end of the batch feed period 90 h the slow scan cv response of the early stage biofilms 90 h after initial inoculation when recorded under substrate limited conditions all display a well defined redox couple centered at 0 43 v and an oxidation peak at 0 12 v vs ag agcl as exemplified by the response obtained at the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2 a the non turnover analysis of these early stage biofilms by transfer into growth medium lacking acetate as electron donor show three redox responses centered at 0 53 v 0 36 v and 0 28 v vs ag agcl shown for the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2a the cv analysis of the filtered medium harvested from the reactor after 90 h shows a redox couple with an oxidation peak at 0 13 v fig s3 that is similar to the oxidation peak 0 12 v observed for the cvs recorded in the growth medium under substrate limited conditions and to one of the oxidation peaks observed under non turnover conditions the slow scan cvs recorded in the presence of 10 mm acetate as electron donor in the electrochemical cell when flow was halted show typical sigmoidal shape expected for electrocatalytic oxidation of acetate fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 as shown for the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2b there is an increase in the catalytic oxidation current as a function of time after inoculation despite evidence of uncompensated resistance effect in the cv responses the sigmoidal shaped cv obtained at 250 h after inoculation fig 2b when fit to a simple model for steady state voltammetry jana et al 2014 indicates that electron transfer is dominated by a redox species with an estimated half wave potential of 0 45 v vs ag agcl once the approximately 60 ω uncompensated resistance is accounted for by correcting at each applied potential to achieve the best fit between model and recorded cv as noted previously jana et al 2014 torres et al 2010 this uncompensated resistance is because of cell configuration distance between working and reference electrode conductivity of medium etc and probably not a function of low electronic conductivity within the biofilm dhar et al 2017 the half wave potential of the catalytic cv response 0 45 v vs ag agcl correlates well with the potential for the redox couple observed under substrate limited conditions and the major redox peak under non turnover conditions fig 2a while the current density of 4 a m2 is of the same order of magnitude as that observed for multi layered films of electroactive bacteria on anodes jana et al 2014 katuri et al 2012 marsili et al 2008 3 3 microscopy the sem images captured at electrodes after early stage growth 90 h compared to those captured at a later stage 340 h after initial inoculation provide additional evidence that the observed amperometric and cv current generation is associated with formation and growth of electrode attached biofilms the sems after early stage growth show sparsely and irregularly distributed bacterial cells along with some cell aggregates fig 3 a compared to the presence of thicker and densely packed biofilms with heterogeneous topography evident in the sems of electrodes sampled at 340 h fig 3b all the biofilms sampled at 340 h display similar estimated biofilm thickness of 22 µm with no statistically significant p 0 05 t test difference between electrodes estimated from clsm imaging fig s4 3 4 microbial community composition the early stage 90 h and later stage 340 h biofilms as well as the initial anaerobic sludge inoculum were subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing to probe the variation of microbial communities within films prior to and over the growth period relative abundance of microbes within the biofilms fig 4 a show significant variations as a function of electrode terminal group chemistry and incubation time the early stage biofilms have a higher abundance of a genus closely related 98 sequence similarity to desulfuromonas sp dominant otu on the electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh groups compared to those of the c2h5 functionalized and control unmodified electrodes there is evidence of the presence of known electroactive bacteria i e geobacter sp only for the early stage biofilms grown on nh2 c2h5 and control unmodified electrodes both species were not detected in the inoculum selective enrichment of both species and differences in their relative abundance as a function of anode surface chemistry indicates that the anode local environment provides a niche specific selective pressure for enrichment of a functionally stable bacterial community by growth on the anode surface rather than a random attachment of bacterial cells for these early stage biofilms a clear correlation is evident between current density at the sampling time 90 h see fig 1b and measured cell density on the anodes fig 4b in addition there is a clear trend of higher relative abundance of desulfuromonas sp and current generation as a function of the estimated zeta potential of the electrodes fig 4c this observation is supported by the principal components analysis pca of the microbial community in the films fig 4d showing a clear distinction between the community in the inoculum and the early stage biofilm samples as well as a distinction between hydrophilic surfaces dominated by desulfuromonas sp and the unmodified and hydrophobic c2h5 surfaces dominated by geobacter sp for the later stage biofilms sampled after 340 h of reactor operation when the current density is similar for all electrodes the biofilm composition for all electrodes shifts to become dominated by desulfuromonas sp 65 90 fig 4a the remarkable dominance of desulfuromonas sp prompted further investigation into its role since the sequences were not long enough 400 bp to confidently classify reads down to the species level subsequent cloning and sequencing of the early stage biofilm sampled from the electrode functionalized to introduce cooh terminal groups revealed the dominance of an otu closely related 99 sequence similarity to desulfuromonas acetexigens strain 2873 fig s5 although d acetexigens has been previously identified in electrode attached biofilms ishii et al 2012 ketep et al 2013a the specific localization of d acetexigens in biofilms and its role in microbial electrochemical systems has yet to be investigated our attempts failed to isolate d acetexigens strain from mixed culture biofilms using its natural electron acceptors such as fumarate and elemental sulfur through both solid liquid growth approach thus the pure culture of d acetexigens dsm 1397 purchased from dsmz was used for conducting further electromicrobiology experiments induction of growth of d acetexigens bacterial biofilms on an unmodified graphite rod electrode surface was implemented by polarization of electrodes at 0 1 v vs ag agcl in three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using d acetexigens culture as inoculum and batch feeding with acetate as substrate and energy source in an appropriate cell culture medium see experimental details the evolution of current over time in this reactor is similar to that observed for other pure culture electroactive bacteria under a continuous applied potential such as g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 jana et al 2014 katuri et al 2010 liu et al 2008 marsili et al 2008 i e cycles of a rapid rise in current when acetate is introduced and then a relatively sharp fall as a consequence of acetate substrate depletion as shown in fig 5 a remarkably relatively rapid initial current is observed without a substantial lag phase during the first batch of operation with a peak in the current density of 9 2 0 4 a m2 obtained only 19 3 0 4 h following initial inoculation into the reactor little significant further improvement to the maximum current density during the batch feed cycles is observed with peak current density reaching a maximum of 10 a m2 over the 210 h growth period in the reactor in situ recording of slow scan cvs at specific intervals 20 h 74 h and 195 h after initial inoculation provides the characteristic sigmoidal shape indicative of microbial electrocatalytic oxidation of acetate substrate by a d acetexigens biofilm on the electrode surface fig 5b as observed for the mixed culture biofilms examination of the first derivative of the cvs indicates the presence of a dominant redox transition with a half wave potential of approximately 0 42 v vs ag agcl inset of fig 5c the cvs in the presence of acetate show an increase in steady state currents in progressing from the early stage 20 h biofilm to those recorded at later stages of growth 74 h and 195 h an increase that is also observed in the fixed potential amperometric response at those sampling times fig 5a the non turnover analysis of the later stage biofilm 210 h after inoculation by transfer into ph 7 0 phosphate buffer electrolyte lacking acetate as electron donor shows three clear redox responses centered at 0 58 v 0 37 v and 0 20 v vs ag agcl fig 5d no discernible redox response is observed in cvs recorded for the reactor bulk liquid the catalytic activity of d acetexigens with formate or h2 intermediates of anaerobic digestion process as an electron donor was tested separately in a three electrode electrochemical cell under 0 1 v vs ag agcl fixed anode potential a maximum current density of 4 4 0 3 a m2 was generated over a growth period of 26 h following inoculation fig 6 using formate as electron donor when the reactor feed was altered to include acetate as an electron donor instead of formate maximum current density of 10 6 ma m2 over a short period of reactor operation resulted in a parallel experiment current generation practically ceased when feed was altered to include h2 as an electron donor instead of formate also no h2 consumption is observed during the test period a similar behavior is observed for biofilms developed initially using acetate which is then altered to h2 as the electron donor data not shown 4 discussion electroactive bacteria attachment and biofilm formation is considered as a primary step in the microbial electrode enrichment process the key selective pressure for this electricigen enrichment in mes is extracellular electron transfer eet with the anode acting as an electron acceptor the eet in electroactive biofilms is proposed to occur through production of exogenous mediators by the biofilms or through self exchange between outer membrane bound c type cytochromes present on certain microbial cell surfaces facilitating electron transport through the film to the solid electrode surface and between cells at the interface between the biofilm and the solid state anode nevin et al 2009 with some postulating eet occurring by electronic conduction along structured protein channels pili sure et al 2016 however the crucial factors that control initial electrochemical current generation by interaction between the external bacterial cell surface and solid anodes is not yet clearly elucidated achieving insight into conditions that control this interaction is therefore crucial for shaping the anodic microbial community and improving mes technology results presented here demonstrate that terminal group chemistry on graphite electrodes influences the microbial community composition and relative abundance during the early stage of biofilm formation and growth fig 1b and fig 4 for biofilms grown under fixed applied potential in a single chamber electrochemical cell using an inoculum harvested from an anaerobic digester treating dairy plant wastewaters confirming observations by others using a range of inocula and conditions guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 the majority of electroactive bacteria reported to be present in anodic biofilms are gram negative read et al 2010 possessing negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces santoro et al 2015 thus positively charged electrode surfaces are thought to promote strong electrostatic interactions between the electrode surface and the negatively charged electroactive bacteria guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 lapinsonnière et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 however guo et al reported that start up of current generation is more rapid on glassy carbon electrodes functionalized to introduce hydrophilic n ch3 3 oh and so3 groups regardless of the charge on the functional group guo et al 2013 compared to start up on ch3 terminated surfaces and this was confirmed by santoro et al using self assembled monolayers on gold santini et al 2015 we find that graphite electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh display higher currents during initial stage of biofilm growth under batch feeding of acetate as electron donor compared to electrodes functionalized to introduce c2h5 and unmodified graphite electrodes under the same operating conditions fig 1 fig 4 b c the capacity to permit cell growth and to generate current is clearly related to the surface charge on the electrodes as represented by the zeta potential measured in the growth medium fig 4c with the c2h5 and bare electrodes displaying the more negative zeta potentials it does not appear that the current generation is related to the sign of the charge on the surface terminal group as the nh2 and oh groups are expected to be neutral while the cooh groups are expected to be de protonated and negative under the cell culture medium conditions ph 6 8 the ability to promote preferential electroactive bacteria attachment during the initial phase of colonization may therefore be through capacity to interact electrostatically for example through formation of hydrogen bonds with the bacterial cell surface noting that the dipole moment of each of aniline phenylpropionic acid and benzylalcohol presumed to be the dominant terminal molecules at the nh2 and cooh and oh functionalized electrodes is above 1 5 d while the dipole moment for ethylbenzene present at the c2h5 functionalized electrode is 0 58 d ray 2017 it has been highlighted that shewanella loihica pv 4 has capability to generate five fold higher current on a hydrophilic compared to that on a hydrophobic electrode under fixed anode potential growth conditions ding et al 2015 thus local polarity is a crucial factor in inducing preferential colonization of electrodes by electroactive bacteria enhancing current during the early stage of electroactive biofilm growth the voltammetric analysis at low or absent acetate levels for early stage biofilms show a redox signal centered at potential of 0 43 v vs ag agcl similar to that observed for biofilms induced to grow from pure culture of g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 or g anodireducens sun et al 2014 as well as a signal at 0 2 v vs ag agcl that resembles the redox peak observed with the filtered biofilm extracted solution indicating that the biofilms produce an extracellular water soluble mediator the redox potential of the detected mediator is comparable to that of phenazine type redox mediators secreted by a range of microbes wang et al 2010 including pseudomonadaceae microbes which have been detected to be present in the biofilms fig 4a the effect of experimental conditions such as inoculum selection anode surface charge guo et al 2013 electrode nano micro scale topography champigneux et al 2018 and cell surface polarizability wang et al 2019 on the microbial composition in electroactive biofilms is not as yet widely understood for example guo et al studied the microbial community composition of anodic biofilms developed on a range of surface functionalized glassy carbon electrodes n ch3 3 oh so3 and ch3 and found predominance of geobacter sp in the biofilms after 52 days of operation irrespective of functionalized anode tested but with a lower predominance in ch3 functionalized electrodes guo et al 2013 this is presumably because of seeding of reactor with effluent from an actively operating more than a year acetate fed microbial electrochemical system however in our study noticeable differences in the relative abundance of desulfuromonas sp cooh oh nh2 control c2h5 and geobacter sp control c2h5 nh2 cooh oh is found for the early stage anodic biofilms formed on functionalized electrodes fig 4a suggesting that the micro environment i e polarity hydrophilicity charge etc can stimulate adhesion as well as viability of desulfuromonas sp over that of geobacter sp when the biofilms are matured over the 340 h growth period there is greater similarity in the communities detected within the films fig 4a d as well as in the currents generated fig 1 due to convergence of biofilm microbial composition predominantly to desulfuromonas sp this result strongly signifies that a single bacterial genus i e desulfuromonas sp is the major contributor to current generation in these biofilms subsequent cloning and sequencing of the early stage biofilm sampled from the electrode functionalized to introduce cooh groups revealed the dominant species as d acetexigens colonization by d acetexigens in the early stage of biofilm formation could limit species diversity within the biofilms over the growth period by competing for the space and electron donor on the polarized anode surfaces perhaps because of a superior anode respiring capability over geobacter sp a similar trend was reported by ishii et al with a shift in dominance from geobacter sp towards a phylotype closely related to d acetexigens in the anodic biofilm after long term operation 200 days of single chamber air cathode mfcs using primary clarifier effluent as a source of feed and inoculum and carbon cloth as anode ishii et al 2012 the same team ishii et al 2014 had reported that the relative abundance of d acetexigens over geobacter sp in an anodic biofilm increased over 3 months of acetate feed operation in a mfc inoculated with a sediment slurry from a lagoon d acetexigens is a gram negative bacterium belonging to the family desulfuromonadaceae class deltaproteobacteria it has been detected in freshwater sediments and digester sludge of wastewater treatment plants and links acetate oxidation to sulfur reduction finster et al 1994 the existence of desulfuromonas sp at low relative abundance has been reported in the anodic biofilms where domestic sewage ishii et al 2012 ketep et al 2013a raw paper mill effluents ketep et al 2013a b and lagoon sediment ishii et al 2014 were used as the source of inoculum there have been no reports to date characterizing the performance of biofilms of pure d acetexigens induced to grow on electrodes the electrochemical activity of d acetexigens films induced to grow from a pure culture inoculum on graphite electrodes is reported here fig 5a c the amperometric and voltammetric signals confirm that d acetexigens has the ability to use a graphite anode as an electron acceptor in the presence of acetate as electron donor respiring on the anode providing evidence that this bacterium is responsible for such signals observed for biofilms in previous reports ishii et al 2012 ishii et al 2014 ketep et al 2013a b the slow scan voltammetry of biofilms in the presence of acetate display a half wave redox potential of 0 42 v vs ag agcl comparable to that observed for the biofilms grown using the anaerobic sludge as inoculum on the graphite electrode fig 2 and to redox potentials reported for membrane bound redox proteins expressed by other electroactive bacteria katuri et al 2010 non turnover voltammetry of d acetexigens biofilms fig 5d show redox peaks centered at 0 58 v 0 37 v and 0 20 v vs ag agcl representing presence of a number of redox moieties at potentials comparable to those reported for biofilms of g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2012 remarkably rapid onset of current to generate 9 a m2 in less than 20 h after start up is observed with formation of a thin layer of adhered cells fig 5b however further improvement in biofilm growth followed by fed batch operation did not significantly improve the magnitude of the current generation a current density of 9 7 a m2 is observed for a 60 h aged biofilm having a thickness of 10 µm fig 5e although comparisons are difficult because of different conditions cell configuration electrodes medium inoculum and its cell density and growth phase etc the start up of d acetexigens for current generation is faster than using pure cultures of g sulfurreducens for example for g sulfurreducens current density of up to 5 a m2 is achieved after 72 hours of growth at an applied potential of 0 v vs ag agcl at graphite electrodes using a high proportion of inoculum in a batch feed mode marsili et al 2008 while a current density of 9 a m2 is generated only after 142 h katuri et al 2012 or 85 h jana et al 2014 of repeated batch mode experiments at an applied potential of 0 v vs ag agcl at graphite electrodes the current generation using formate as electron donor fig 6 confirms that d acetexigens can link formate oxidation with anode respiration however a 2 5 fold increase in current density generation achieved for d acetexigens biofilms when formate is replaced with the same electron equivalent acetate concentration suggests that d acetexigens biofilms are more active with acetate as the electron donor recycling of h2 as the electron donor by g sulfurreducens a well studied electroactive bacteria can adversely affect the energy harnessed in a single chambered mec the inability of d acetexigens biofilms to use h2 for current generation provides opportunity to maximize recovery of wastewater energy as h2 using met 5 conclusion results show a clear influence of functionalization of anodes on primary adhesion of microbes during the early stage of biofilm formation for electricigenesis providing differences in onset of current and time to achieve maximum steady state current although we do not yet know whether functionalized electrodes can be used to differentially stimulate enrichment of one electroactive bacterium over another or rate of anodic biofilm formation from different inoculum sources the results obtained in this study using anaerobic sludge as inoculum suggest that biomass adhesion as well as its activity biofilm morphology i e spatial distribution of cells and relative abundance of electroactive bacteria during the early stage of biofilm formation are clearly affected by the anode surface characteristics more importantly the hydrophilic surfaces promote rapid start up of current generation although the underlying mechanism is unclear anodes functionalized with hydrophilic terminal groups result in the enrichment of a desulfuromonas sp in the biofilm compared to initial dominance of geobacter sp on more hydrophobic electrodes this desulfuromonas sp is identified to be d acetexigens and the study of early stage biofilms of this species is presented confirming its electroactive response superior electrocatalytic performance with distinct anode respiring properties of d acetexigens biofilms will prove advantageous for microbial anode performance in mets identification of selection pressure to increase the abundance of d acetexigens in anodic biofilms perhaps through bio augmentation or identifying the optimal differential growth conditions can maximize resource recovery from the wastes for example metabolic activities of d acetexigens biofilms such as efficient eet properties and absence of h2 recycling as an electron donor will favor maximum recovery of energy as h2 in single chambered mec

17642,surface chemistry is known to influence the formation composition and electroactivity of electron conducting biofilms however understanding of the evolution of microbial composition during biofilm development and its impact on the electrochemical response is limited here we present voltammetric microscopic and microbial community analysis of biofilms formed under fixed applied potential for modified graphite electrodes during early 90 h and mature 340 h growth phases electrodes modified to introduce hydrophilic groups nh2 cooh and oh enhance early stage biofilm formation compared to unmodified or electrodes modified with hydrophobic groups c2h5 in addition early stage films formed on hydrophilic electrodes are dominated by the gram negative sulfur reducing bacterium desulfuromonas acetexigens while geobacter sp dominates on c2h5 and unmodified electrodes as biofilms mature current generation becomes similar and d acetexigens dominates in all biofilms irrespective of surface chemistry electrochemistry of pure culture d acetexigens biofilms reveal that this microbe is capable of forming electroactive biofilms producing considerable current density of 9 a m2 in a short period of potential induced growth 19 h following inoculation using acetate as an electron donor the inability of d acetexigens biofilms to use h2 as a sole source electron donor for current generation shows promise for maximizing h2 recovery in single chambered microbial electrolysis cell systems treating wastewaters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell electroactive bacteria functionalized anode biofilm anode desulfuromonas acetexigens hydrogen 1 introduction microbial electrochemical technologies mets are electrochemical devices which utilize microbial biofilms formed at a polarized electrode anode and or cathode to drive electrochemical reaction s rittmann 2018 an electrochemical potential established at the anode can induce the formation of thick electron conducting biofilms composed of special microbial communities known as electroactive bacteria schröder et al 2015 such biofilms predominately composed of anaerobic microbes respire by utilizing an electrode as a terminal electron acceptor in place of natural oxidants such as iron oxide potential electroactive bacteria can be found in diverse environments ranging from the stratosphere zhang et al 2012 to deep red sea brine pools marine sediments shehab et al 2017 including sewage patil et al 2010 sludge composts soil manure sediments rumen and agro industrial wastes koch and harnisch 2016 known and or novel electroactive bacteria thrive geographically in a wide range of ecosystems such as marshes lake sediments saline microbial mats anaerobic soils etc miceli et al 2012 thus identifying operational parameters to explore novel electroactive bacteria from mixed culture inoculums with useful metabolic capacities is important for advancing met research for niche specific applications for example the application of mets has been demonstrated in recovery of bioenergy bioelectricity and h2 from wastewaters katuri et al 2019 katuri et al 2018 anoxic nh4 removal shaw et al 2019 vilajeliu pons et al 2018 water reclamation through integration of mets with membrane filtration processes katuri et al 2018 katuri et al 2014 ma et al 2015 malaeb et al 2013 etc in order to further develop this technology it is imperative to maximize the interaction and to enable efficient electron transfer between the electroactive communities and the electrodes understanding the physiology of anodic electroactive bacteria tuning electrode properties to affect the composition of electroactive bacteria and tethering and structuring of electroactive communities from different sources at electrodes continues to be a challenge and is the subject of research for the advancement of mes technology several approaches have been developed to establish and improve electrochemical communication between the electroactive bacteria and the anode these include chemical treatment of anodes dumitru and scott 2016 and modification of anode surfaces with mediators dumitru and scott 2016 park et al 2000 and with chemical functional groups artyushkova et al 2015 cornejo et al 2015 dumitru and scott 2016 guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 lapinsonnière et al 2013 picot et al 2011 saito et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 scott et al 2007 studies show that the chemical and physical properties of the groups introduced at electrodes can promote or impede electroactive biofilm formation and activity compared to unmodified electrodes depending on the surface chemistry employed in general electrodes modified with charged hydrophilic functional groups enhanced biofilm attachment decreased start up times and improved microbial fuel cell mfc or microbial electrolysis cell mec performance guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 picot et al 2011 saito et al 2011 however the presence of non polar hydrophobic groups proved detrimental to biofilm formation and current generation guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 most studies on the effect of electrode modification on biofilms focus on current generation at an electrode and on power production in mfc assemblies few studies to date investigate the effect of electrode modification on biofilm microbial composition it has been established that electrode modification can influence microbial composition within biofilms at anodes guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 for example picot et al reported that biofilms predominately composed of bacteria from geobacter sp develop on positively charged electrodes picot et al 2011 whereas low cell attachment and geobacter sp proportion is observed on negatively charged electrodes with a mixed community evident on neutral electrodes guo et al found abundance of two geobacter sp highly similar to g psychrophilus and g sulfurreducens in matured biofilms 53 day aged developed on a range of functionalized anode surfaces guo et al 2013 the geobacter relative abundance was found to be higher on anodes functionalized with n ch3 3 so3 and oh terminal groups compared to those functionalized with ch3 in addition a higher relative abundance of g psychrophilus to g sulfurreducens was found in all biofilms revealing that surface chemistry supported the dominance of electroactive bacteria other than g sulfurreducens the electroactive bacterium expected to be dominant in anodic biofilms during acetate fed conditions however it should be noted that the inoculum consisted of effluent from the anodic chamber of an existing acetate fed microbial electrochemical reactor which may be enriched in geobacter species using a non enriched inoculum santoro et al reported development of a more diverse consortia consisting of various classes of clostridia and proteobacteria species on functionalized gold electrodes after 45 days santoro et al 2015 although such studies provide important insights into the influence of electrode functionalization on microbial community composition they have been limited to community analysis of consortia in thick biofilms at the end of relatively long growth periods information related to the effect of surface chemistry on the early stage of microbial biofilm formation its electromicrobiology and adaptability is lacking here we examine the microbial community composition at modified electrodes nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 terminal groups for both early after 90 h growth and mature multilayered biofilm after 340 h growth stage using a non enriched inoculum providing insight into biofilm adaptability and maturation we show that microbial communities can change significantly over time in addition we present electrochemical characterization of a pure culture of desulfuromonas acetexigens a gram negative bacterium which was found to dominate in the mature mixed culture biofilms developed at the electrodes using this inoculum 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode preparation custom built graphite rod electrodes 0 3 cm diameter goodfellow uk were prepared by shrouding rod lengths extending out of glass tubes using heat shrink plastic tubing alphawire uk and establishing an electrical connection at the rear with a 0 3 cm diameter copper rod farnell electronics ireland and silver epoxy adhesive radionics ireland the final exposed geometric surface area of the electrode was 3 8 cm2 prior to use these electrodes were sterilized by placement in boiling water for 15 min and washed several times with distilled water surface functionalization of electrodes to produce nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 terminal groups was achieved by electrochemical reduction of the diazonium cation generated in situ from the arylamine using either p phenylenediamine 3 4 aminophenyl propionic acid 4 aminobenzyl alcohol or 4 ethylaniline respectively briefly 8 mm of nano2 was added into a 10 mm acidic solution 0 5 m hcl of the appropriate arylamine to generate the diazonium cation followed by electrochemical reduction of the generated aryldiazonium salt by scanning from 0 4 v to 0 4 v vs ag agcl at 20 mv s for four cycles as described previously boland et al 2008 the resulting modified electrodes were removed and rinsed with large volumes of distilled water followed by ultrasonication for 1 min to remove any loosely bound species 2 2 mixed culture biofilm formation and analysis the growth medium for forming mixed culture biofilms was based on g sulfurreducens medium http www dsmz de medium no 826 lacking sodium fumarate and containing 10 mm acetate as electron donor the medium was purged with n2 co2 80 20 gas mix for 60 min at 10 ml min gas flow rate to prepare an oxygen free solution and then subjected to autoclaving 121 c 15 min after autoclaving bottles were transferred into an anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa to maintain an anaerobic environment for the medium mixed culture

electron donor to provide 10 mm concentration was added to the reactor after 45 h operation after 90 h at the end of the batch feed operation the reactor was completely drained and electrode samples taken for analysis the reactor was then filled with fresh growth medium containing 10 mm acetate with no additional inoculum and the reactor conditions switched to continuous mode by pumping culture medium containing 10 mm acetate culture medium was maintained in sterile and anaerobic conditions in a reservoir with a working volume of 1 l the reservoir was equipped with several ports for continuous purging with n2 for pumping culture medium into the reactor and for sampling culture medium sterile 0 2 mm gas filters were placed on all gas and liquid handling ports except that for pumping the medium from reservoir to reactor all inoculations were carried out in a sterile anaerobic glove box coy laboratory usa and all incubations were performed at 30 c in a controlled temperature room all electrodes 1 cm2 sampled after the batch feed period 90 h growth were transferred to separate 15 ml vials containing 3 ml of sterile extraction solution phosphate buffer ph 7 0 50 mm following biofilm extraction through vigorous vortex 2 ml of the solution was transferred separately to individual vials for molecular microbial ecology and cell counts analysis the remainder of the solution i e 1 ml was filtered through 0 2 µm sterile filter to obtain a cell free solution for screening of the presence of soluble mediators in the biofilm matrix using cv analysis a miniature custom built three electrode electrochemical cell used to conduct voltammetry in the small volume electrolyte using a graphite disc 6 mm diameter and platinum wire as working and counter electrodes respectively in addition 0 5 cm length of each electrode was sampled and fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde solution for subsequent microscopy analysis the remaining length of each electrode was transferred to a new electrochemical cell containing fresh growth medium but with no acetate as electron donor in order to perform non turnover voltammetry a similar sample analysis protocol was adopted for electrodes collected at the end of the continuous feed growth period at 340 h 2 3 d acetexigens biofilm formation and analysis the d acetexigens strain dsm 1397 was cultured at 30 c in 50 ml air tight rubber septa sealed anaerobic syringe bottles containing 45 ml of growth medium dsm 148 and subsequently sub cultured three times each batch incubated for 3 days in fumarate containing growth medium prior to inoculation in the electrochemical cell the cell pellet collected through centrifugation at 8000x for 5 min was used as an inoculum 10 w v cell density 3 2 108 cells ml for the tests d acetexigens biofilms were developed on graphite rod 4 8 cm2 electrodes by application of constant potential 0 1 v vs ag agcl in a three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using d acetoexigens growth medium lacking fumarate resazurin and na2s as electrolyte with 10 mm sodium acetate as electron donor four reactors were operated in parallel in fed batch mode under the same operational conditions all inoculations batch changes were carried out in a sterile anaerobic glove box labconco usa and incubations were performed at 30 c in a controlled temperature room the interaction and growth of d acetexigens cells on functionalized nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 anodes during early stage of growth was studied by placing electrodes in a custom built glass electrochemical reactor and application of constant potential 0 1 v vs ag agcl using a multi channel potentiostat ch instruments usa a common platinum gauze 5 cm 6 cm counter electrode and ag agcl reference electrode

ml with growth terminated at 25 h after inoculation to measure biomass density on the electrodes 3 results 3 1 electrode modification graphite electrodes were modified through in situ formation and subsequent electroreduction of aryldiazonium salts from arylamines as previously described boland et al 2008 selection of arylamines containing terminal nh2 cooh oh and c2h5 functional groups results in formation of surfaces presenting such groups voltammograms for the aryldiazonium salt electroreduction process are presented in fig s1 showing reduction currents for the salts at 0 13 v for nh2 0 17 v for cooh 0 08 v for oh and 0 02 v for c2h5 electrodes v vs ag agcl the decrease in reduction peak current on the second voltammetric scan is indicative of coupled layer formation boland et al 2008 zeta potential and contact angle for these electrodes measured in growth media are presented in table s1 electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh groups display surface zeta potential values that are similar with the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized electrodes showing more negative zeta potentials in the growth medium similarly the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized electrodes have the highest contact angles indicative of surfaces of more hydrophobic character compared to the surfaces functionalized to introduce groups capable of hydrogen bonding such as the nh2 cooh and oh groups the cell mats prepared using biofilms of g sulfurreducens or d acetexigens display a relatively low negative zeta potential and low contact angles indicating material that is hydrophilic and relatively easily wetted 3 2 electrochemical characterization of biofilms induction of growth of electroactive bacteria and bacterial biofilms on the electrode surfaces was implemented by polarization of all electrodes in duplicate at 0 1 v vs ag agcl in a three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using an anaerobic sludge mixed culture inoculum and acetate as carbon and energy source initial start up of bacterial biofilm growth was undertaken in a batch reactor configuration with removal of inoculum and replenishment of acetate feed at 45 h when the current started to fall following a period of growth fig 1 a in contrast to other studies lapinsonnière et al 2013 electrode modification did not appear to dramatically affect the time taken for current generation to occur onset of a rapid growth in current for all electrodes commences between 60 65 h after initial inoculation which is 20 25 h after removal of inoculum and introduction of fresh acetate as feed in the batch mode configuration however consistent with earlier studies cornejo et al 2015 guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 santoro et al 2015 the magnitude of the maximum current density during this early batch feed cycle is influenced by surface chemistry anode surfaces functionalized with chemical functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding and therefore more hydrophilic nh2 cooh and oh yield higher currents compared to the unmodified and c2h5 functionalized surfaces fig 1b following this initial period 90 h of electrochemically induced growth in a batch fed system a set of electrodes was removed for cyclic voltammetric cv microscopic and sequencing analysis the other set of electrodes was placed in the reactor and continuous flow of acetate containing cell culture medium commenced at a flow rate of 1 l day followed by switching to 0 5 l day after approximately 40 h of continuous feed operation fig 1c black arrow during 1 l day continuous feed operation all electrodes produced similar current profiles with the exception of the c2h5 functionalized electrode which produced significantly lower current decreasing the flow rate of acetate feed to 0 5 l day at 135 h after initial inoculation of the electrodes see fig 1c resulted in lower magnitude of current output for all electrodes except for the c2h5 functionalized electrode which produced now a similar current to that produced by all other electrodes the decrease in current as a function of flow rate in this study is indicative of acetate mass transport controlled current production continuous feed was maintained up to 340 h after inoculation fig s2 with similar current profiles observed for biofilms developed on all electrodes regardless of flow rate or interruption interruption of current generation was implemented to enable recording of cv at several intervals during the continuous feed period with these cvs compared to cvs for early stage biofilms taken at the end of the batch feed period 90 h the slow scan cv response of the early stage biofilms 90 h after initial inoculation when recorded under substrate limited conditions all display a well defined redox couple centered at 0 43 v and an oxidation peak at 0 12 v vs ag agcl as exemplified by the response obtained at the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2 a the non turnover analysis of these early stage biofilms by transfer into growth medium lacking acetate as electron donor show three redox responses centered at 0 53 v 0 36 v and 0 28 v vs ag agcl shown for the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2a the cv analysis of the filtered medium harvested from the reactor after 90 h shows a redox couple with an oxidation peak at 0 13 v fig s3 that is similar to the oxidation peak 0 12 v observed for the cvs recorded in the growth medium under substrate limited conditions and to one of the oxidation peaks observed under non turnover conditions the slow scan cvs recorded in the presence of 10 mm acetate as electron donor in the electrochemical cell when flow was halted show typical sigmoidal shape expected for electrocatalytic oxidation of acetate fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 as shown for the electrode functionalized to introduce oh terminal groups fig 2b there is an increase in the catalytic oxidation current as a function of time after inoculation despite evidence of uncompensated resistance effect in the cv responses the sigmoidal shaped cv obtained at 250 h after inoculation fig 2b when fit to a simple model for steady state voltammetry jana et al 2014 indicates that electron transfer is dominated by a redox species with an estimated half wave potential of 0 45 v vs ag agcl once the approximately 60 ω uncompensated resistance is accounted for by correcting at each applied potential to achieve the best fit between model and recorded cv as noted previously jana et al 2014 torres et al 2010 this uncompensated resistance is because of cell configuration distance between working and reference electrode conductivity of medium etc and probably not a function of low electronic conductivity within the biofilm dhar et al 2017 the half wave potential of the catalytic cv response 0 45 v vs ag agcl correlates well with the potential for the redox couple observed under substrate limited conditions and the major redox peak under non turnover conditions fig 2a while the current density of 4 a m2 is of the same order of magnitude as that observed for multi layered films of electroactive bacteria on anodes jana et al 2014 katuri et al 2012 marsili et al 2008 3 3 microscopy the sem images captured at electrodes after early stage growth 90 h compared to those captured at a later stage 340 h after initial inoculation provide additional evidence that the observed amperometric and cv current generation is associated with formation and growth of electrode attached biofilms the sems after early stage growth show sparsely and irregularly distributed bacterial cells along with some cell aggregates fig 3 a compared to the presence of thicker and densely packed biofilms with heterogeneous topography evident in the sems of electrodes sampled at 340 h fig 3b all the biofilms sampled at 340 h display similar estimated biofilm thickness of 22 µm with no statistically significant p 0 05 t test difference between electrodes estimated from clsm imaging fig s4 3 4 microbial community composition the early stage 90 h and later stage 340 h biofilms as well as the initial anaerobic sludge inoculum were subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing to probe the variation of microbial communities within films prior to and over the growth period relative abundance of microbes within the biofilms fig 4 a show significant variations as a function of electrode terminal group chemistry and incubation time the early stage biofilms have a higher abundance of a genus closely related 98 sequence similarity to desulfuromonas sp dominant otu on the electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh groups compared to those of the c2h5 functionalized and control unmodified electrodes there is evidence of the presence of known electroactive bacteria i e geobacter sp only for the early stage biofilms grown on nh2 c2h5 and control unmodified electrodes both species were not detected in the inoculum selective enrichment of both species and differences in their relative abundance as a function of anode surface chemistry indicates that the anode local environment provides a niche specific selective pressure for enrichment of a functionally stable bacterial community by growth on the anode surface rather than a random attachment of bacterial cells for these early stage biofilms a clear correlation is evident between current density at the sampling time 90 h see fig 1b and measured cell density on the anodes fig 4b in addition there is a clear trend of higher relative abundance of desulfuromonas sp and current generation as a function of the estimated zeta potential of the electrodes fig 4c this observation is supported by the principal components analysis pca of the microbial community in the films fig 4d showing a clear distinction between the community in the inoculum and the early stage biofilm samples as well as a distinction between hydrophilic surfaces dominated by desulfuromonas sp and the unmodified and hydrophobic c2h5 surfaces dominated by geobacter sp for the later stage biofilms sampled after 340 h of reactor operation when the current density is similar for all electrodes the biofilm composition for all electrodes shifts to become dominated by desulfuromonas sp 65 90 fig 4a the remarkable dominance of desulfuromonas sp prompted further investigation into its role since the sequences were not long enough 400 bp to confidently classify reads down to the species level subsequent cloning and sequencing of the early stage biofilm sampled from the electrode functionalized to introduce cooh terminal groups revealed the dominance of an otu closely related 99 sequence similarity to desulfuromonas acetexigens strain 2873 fig s5 although d acetexigens has been previously identified in electrode attached biofilms ishii et al 2012 ketep et al 2013a the specific localization of d acetexigens in biofilms and its role in microbial electrochemical systems has yet to be investigated our attempts failed to isolate d acetexigens strain from mixed culture biofilms using its natural electron acceptors such as fumarate and elemental sulfur through both solid liquid growth approach thus the pure culture of d acetexigens dsm 1397 purchased from dsmz was used for conducting further electromicrobiology experiments induction of growth of d acetexigens bacterial biofilms on an unmodified graphite rod electrode surface was implemented by polarization of electrodes at 0 1 v vs ag agcl in three electrode electrochemical cell configuration using d acetexigens culture as inoculum and batch feeding with acetate as substrate and energy source in an appropriate cell culture medium see experimental details the evolution of current over time in this reactor is similar to that observed for other pure culture electroactive bacteria under a continuous applied potential such as g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 jana et al 2014 katuri et al 2010 liu et al 2008 marsili et al 2008 i e cycles of a rapid rise in current when acetate is introduced and then a relatively sharp fall as a consequence of acetate substrate depletion as shown in fig 5 a remarkably relatively rapid initial current is observed without a substantial lag phase during the first batch of operation with a peak in the current density of 9 2 0 4 a m2 obtained only 19 3 0 4 h following initial inoculation into the reactor little significant further improvement to the maximum current density during the batch feed cycles is observed with peak current density reaching a maximum of 10 a m2 over the 210 h growth period in the reactor in situ recording of slow scan cvs at specific intervals 20 h 74 h and 195 h after initial inoculation provides the characteristic sigmoidal shape indicative of microbial electrocatalytic oxidation of acetate substrate by a d acetexigens biofilm on the electrode surface fig 5b as observed for the mixed culture biofilms examination of the first derivative of the cvs indicates the presence of a dominant redox transition with a half wave potential of approximately 0 42 v vs ag agcl inset of fig 5c the cvs in the presence of acetate show an increase in steady state currents in progressing from the early stage 20 h biofilm to those recorded at later stages of growth 74 h and 195 h an increase that is also observed in the fixed potential amperometric response at those sampling times fig 5a the non turnover analysis of the later stage biofilm 210 h after inoculation by transfer into ph 7 0 phosphate buffer electrolyte lacking acetate as electron donor shows three clear redox responses centered at 0 58 v 0 37 v and 0 20 v vs ag agcl fig 5d no discernible redox response is observed in cvs recorded for the reactor bulk liquid the catalytic activity of d acetexigens with formate or h2 intermediates of anaerobic digestion process as an electron donor was tested separately in a three electrode electrochemical cell under 0 1 v vs ag agcl fixed anode potential a maximum current density of 4 4 0 3 a m2 was generated over a growth period of 26 h following inoculation fig 6 using formate as electron donor when the reactor feed was altered to include acetate as an electron donor instead of formate maximum current density of 10 6 ma m2 over a short period of reactor operation resulted in a parallel experiment current generation practically ceased when feed was altered to include h2 as an electron donor instead of formate also no h2 consumption is observed during the test period a similar behavior is observed for biofilms developed initially using acetate which is then altered to h2 as the electron donor data not shown 4 discussion electroactive bacteria attachment and biofilm formation is considered as a primary step in the microbial electrode enrichment process the key selective pressure for this electricigen enrichment in mes is extracellular electron transfer eet with the anode acting as an electron acceptor the eet in electroactive biofilms is proposed to occur through production of exogenous mediators by the biofilms or through self exchange between outer membrane bound c type cytochromes present on certain microbial cell surfaces facilitating electron transport through the film to the solid electrode surface and between cells at the interface between the biofilm and the solid state anode nevin et al 2009 with some postulating eet occurring by electronic conduction along structured protein channels pili sure et al 2016 however the crucial factors that control initial electrochemical current generation by interaction between the external bacterial cell surface and solid anodes is not yet clearly elucidated achieving insight into conditions that control this interaction is therefore crucial for shaping the anodic microbial community and improving mes technology results presented here demonstrate that terminal group chemistry on graphite electrodes influences the microbial community composition and relative abundance during the early stage of biofilm formation and growth fig 1b and fig 4 for biofilms grown under fixed applied potential in a single chamber electrochemical cell using an inoculum harvested from an anaerobic digester treating dairy plant wastewaters confirming observations by others using a range of inocula and conditions guo et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 the majority of electroactive bacteria reported to be present in anodic biofilms are gram negative read et al 2010 possessing negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces santoro et al 2015 thus positively charged electrode surfaces are thought to promote strong electrostatic interactions between the electrode surface and the negatively charged electroactive bacteria guo et al 2013 kumar et al 2013 lapinsonnière et al 2013 picot et al 2011 santoro et al 2015 however guo et al reported that start up of current generation is more rapid on glassy carbon electrodes functionalized to introduce hydrophilic n ch3 3 oh and so3 groups regardless of the charge on the functional group guo et al 2013 compared to start up on ch3 terminated surfaces and this was confirmed by santoro et al using self assembled monolayers on gold santini et al 2015 we find that graphite electrodes functionalized to introduce nh2 cooh and oh display higher currents during initial stage of biofilm growth under batch feeding of acetate as electron donor compared to electrodes functionalized to introduce c2h5 and unmodified graphite electrodes under the same operating conditions fig 1 fig 4 b c the capacity to permit cell growth and to generate current is clearly related to the surface charge on the electrodes as represented by the zeta potential measured in the growth medium fig 4c with the c2h5 and bare electrodes displaying the more negative zeta potentials it does not appear that the current generation is related to the sign of the charge on the surface terminal group as the nh2 and oh groups are expected to be neutral while the cooh groups are expected to be de protonated and negative under the cell culture medium conditions ph 6 8 the ability to promote preferential electroactive bacteria attachment during the initial phase of colonization may therefore be through capacity to interact electrostatically for example through formation of hydrogen bonds with the bacterial cell surface noting that the dipole moment of each of aniline phenylpropionic acid and benzylalcohol presumed to be the dominant terminal molecules at the nh2 and cooh and oh functionalized electrodes is above 1 5 d while the dipole moment for ethylbenzene present at the c2h5 functionalized electrode is 0 58 d ray 2017 it has been highlighted that shewanella loihica pv 4 has capability to generate five fold higher current on a hydrophilic compared to that on a hydrophobic electrode under fixed anode potential growth conditions ding et al 2015 thus local polarity is a crucial factor in inducing preferential colonization of electrodes by electroactive bacteria enhancing current during the early stage of electroactive biofilm growth the voltammetric analysis at low or absent acetate levels for early stage biofilms show a redox signal centered at potential of 0 43 v vs ag agcl similar to that observed for biofilms induced to grow from pure culture of g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 or g anodireducens sun et al 2014 as well as a signal at 0 2 v vs ag agcl that resembles the redox peak observed with the filtered biofilm extracted solution indicating that the biofilms produce an extracellular water soluble mediator the redox potential of the detected mediator is comparable to that of phenazine type redox mediators secreted by a range of microbes wang et al 2010 including pseudomonadaceae microbes which have been detected to be present in the biofilms fig 4a the effect of experimental conditions such as inoculum selection anode surface charge guo et al 2013 electrode nano micro scale topography champigneux et al 2018 and cell surface polarizability wang et al 2019 on the microbial composition in electroactive biofilms is not as yet widely understood for example guo et al studied the microbial community composition of anodic biofilms developed on a range of surface functionalized glassy carbon electrodes n ch3 3 oh so3 and ch3 and found predominance of geobacter sp in the biofilms after 52 days of operation irrespective of functionalized anode tested but with a lower predominance in ch3 functionalized electrodes guo et al 2013 this is presumably because of seeding of reactor with effluent from an actively operating more than a year acetate fed microbial electrochemical system however in our study noticeable differences in the relative abundance of desulfuromonas sp cooh oh nh2 control c2h5 and geobacter sp control c2h5 nh2 cooh oh is found for the early stage anodic biofilms formed on functionalized electrodes fig 4a suggesting that the micro environment i e polarity hydrophilicity charge etc can stimulate adhesion as well as viability of desulfuromonas sp over that of geobacter sp when the biofilms are matured over the 340 h growth period there is greater similarity in the communities detected within the films fig 4a d as well as in the currents generated fig 1 due to convergence of biofilm microbial composition predominantly to desulfuromonas sp this result strongly signifies that a single bacterial genus i e desulfuromonas sp is the major contributor to current generation in these biofilms subsequent cloning and sequencing of the early stage biofilm sampled from the electrode functionalized to introduce cooh groups revealed the dominant species as d acetexigens colonization by d acetexigens in the early stage of biofilm formation could limit species diversity within the biofilms over the growth period by competing for the space and electron donor on the polarized anode surfaces perhaps because of a superior anode respiring capability over geobacter sp a similar trend was reported by ishii et al with a shift in dominance from geobacter sp towards a phylotype closely related to d acetexigens in the anodic biofilm after long term operation 200 days of single chamber air cathode mfcs using primary clarifier effluent as a source of feed and inoculum and carbon cloth as anode ishii et al 2012 the same team ishii et al 2014 had reported that the relative abundance of d acetexigens over geobacter sp in an anodic biofilm increased over 3 months of acetate feed operation in a mfc inoculated with a sediment slurry from a lagoon d acetexigens is a gram negative bacterium belonging to the family desulfuromonadaceae class deltaproteobacteria it has been detected in freshwater sediments and digester sludge of wastewater treatment plants and links acetate oxidation to sulfur reduction finster et al 1994 the existence of desulfuromonas sp at low relative abundance has been reported in the anodic biofilms where domestic sewage ishii et al 2012 ketep et al 2013a raw paper mill effluents ketep et al 2013a b and lagoon sediment ishii et al 2014 were used as the source of inoculum there have been no reports to date characterizing the performance of biofilms of pure d acetexigens induced to grow on electrodes the electrochemical activity of d acetexigens films induced to grow from a pure culture inoculum on graphite electrodes is reported here fig 5a c the amperometric and voltammetric signals confirm that d acetexigens has the ability to use a graphite anode as an electron acceptor in the presence of acetate as electron donor respiring on the anode providing evidence that this bacterium is responsible for such signals observed for biofilms in previous reports ishii et al 2012 ishii et al 2014 ketep et al 2013a b the slow scan voltammetry of biofilms in the presence of acetate display a half wave redox potential of 0 42 v vs ag agcl comparable to that observed for the biofilms grown using the anaerobic sludge as inoculum on the graphite electrode fig 2 and to redox potentials reported for membrane bound redox proteins expressed by other electroactive bacteria katuri et al 2010 non turnover voltammetry of d acetexigens biofilms fig 5d show redox peaks centered at 0 58 v 0 37 v and 0 20 v vs ag agcl representing presence of a number of redox moieties at potentials comparable to those reported for biofilms of g sulfurreducens fricke et al 2008 katuri et al 2012 remarkably rapid onset of current to generate 9 a m2 in less than 20 h after start up is observed with formation of a thin layer of adhered cells fig 5b however further improvement in biofilm growth followed by fed batch operation did not significantly improve the magnitude of the current generation a current density of 9 7 a m2 is observed for a 60 h aged biofilm having a thickness of 10 µm fig 5e although comparisons are difficult because of different conditions cell configuration electrodes medium inoculum and its cell density and growth phase etc the start up of d acetexigens for current generation is faster than using pure cultures of g sulfurreducens for example for g sulfurreducens current density of up to 5 a m2 is achieved after 72 hours of growth at an applied potential of 0 v vs ag agcl at graphite electrodes using a high proportion of inoculum in a batch feed mode marsili et al 2008 while a current density of 9 a m2 is generated only after 142 h katuri et al 2012 or 85 h jana et al 2014 of repeated batch mode experiments at an applied potential of 0 v vs ag agcl at graphite electrodes the current generation using formate as electron donor fig 6 confirms that d acetexigens can link formate oxidation with anode respiration however a 2 5 fold increase in current density generation achieved for d acetexigens biofilms when formate is replaced with the same electron equivalent acetate concentration suggests that d acetexigens biofilms are more active with acetate as the electron donor recycling of h2 as the electron donor by g sulfurreducens a well studied electroactive bacteria can adversely affect the energy harnessed in a single chambered mec the inability of d acetexigens biofilms to use h2 for current generation provides opportunity to maximize recovery of wastewater energy as h2 using met 5 conclusion results show a clear influence of functionalization of anodes on primary adhesion of microbes during the early stage of biofilm formation for electricigenesis providing differences in onset of current and time to achieve maximum steady state current although we do not yet know whether functionalized electrodes can be used to differentially stimulate enrichment of one electroactive bacterium over another or rate of anodic biofilm formation from different inoculum sources the results obtained in this study using anaerobic sludge as inoculum suggest that biomass adhesion as well as its activity biofilm morphology i e spatial distribution of cells and relative abundance of electroactive bacteria during the early stage of biofilm formation are clearly affected by the anode surface characteristics more importantly the hydrophilic surfaces promote rapid start up of current generation although the underlying mechanism is unclear anodes functionalized with hydrophilic terminal groups result in the enrichment of a desulfuromonas sp in the biofilm compared to initial dominance of geobacter sp on more hydrophobic electrodes this desulfuromonas sp is identified to be d acetexigens and the study of early stage biofilms of this species is presented confirming its electroactive response superior electrocatalytic performance with distinct anode respiring properties of d acetexigens biofilms will prove advantageous for microbial anode performance in mets identification of selection pressure to increase the abundance of d acetexigens in anodic biofilms perhaps through bio augmentation or identifying the optimal differential growth conditions can maximize resource recovery from the wastes for example metabolic activities of d acetexigens biofilms such as efficient eet properties and absence of h2 recycling as an electron donor will favor maximum recovery of energy as h2 in single chambered mec

17643,elevated concentrations of ammonium and methane in groundwater are often associated with microbiological chemical and sanitary problems during drinking water production and distribution to avoid their accumulation raw water in the netherlands and many other countries is purified by sand filtration these drinking water filtration systems select for microbial communities that mediate the biodegradation of organic and inorganic compounds in this study the top layers and wall biofilm of a dutch drinking water treatment plant dwtp were sampled from the filtration units of the plant over three years we used high throughput sequencing in combination with differential coverage and sequence composition based binning to recover 56 near complete metagenome assembled genomes mags with an estimated completion of 70 and with 10 redundancy these mags were used to characterize the microbial communities involved in the conversion of ammonia and methane the methanotrophic microbial communities colonizing the wall biofilm wb and the granular material of the primary rapid sand filter p rsf were dominated by members of the methylococcaceae and methylophilaceae the abundance of these bacteria drastically decreased in the secondary rapid sand filter s rsf samples in all samples complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira were the most abundant nitrifying guild clade a comammox nitrospira dominated the p rsf while clade b was most abundant in wb and s rsf where ammonium concentrations were much lower in conclusion the knowledge obtained in this study contributes to understanding the role of microorganisms in the removal of carbon and nitrogen compounds during drinking water production we furthermore found that drinking water treatment plants represent valuable

global freshwater exists as ground and surface water that is available for drinking water production according to the european commission ec 2016 about 50 of drinking water in europe is produced from

from the groundwater through gas exchange systems trussell et al 2012 the increased dissolved oxygen in the water caused by this mechanical aeration step serves as an electron acceptor in microbially

plants dwtp ammonium removal is achieved by the activity of nitrifying microorganisms that oxidize ammonia to nitrate via a series of intermediates while canonical nitrifying guilds perform ammonia

van kessel et al 2015 nitrifying microbial communities of rapid sand filters have been studied before and seem to be represented by different groups of nitrifiers albers et al 2015 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2016 oh et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 van der wielen et al 2009 in these systems nitrification can be limited by the availability of vital nutrients for this process such as phosphate and copper this can cause incomplete nitrification de vet et al 2012 wagner et al 2016 leading to incomplete ammonium removal and or nitrite accumulation wilczak et al 1996 and microbial after growth in the distribution network rittmann et al 2012 methane is a colorless and odorless gas that usually does not present a health risk in drinking water however methane gas is highly flammable and can be explosive at elevated concentrations and it also can serve as substrate for growth of microorganisms in distribution systems most of the methane is removed by the mechanical aeration step and remaining amounts are oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs within the sand beds of the filter units correspondingly a number of studies reported methane oxidizing bacteria colonizing the granular material of the sand filters albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 however in contrast to nitrifying microbial communities methanotrophs in these engineered systems are traditionally less well studied methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 co2 equivalents over 100 years stocker et al 2013 and the removal of most methane from the drinking water via aeration causes methane emissions to the atmosphere contributing to global warming and climate change maksimavičius and roslev 2020 like in many european countries groundwater is the primary source 65 for drinking water production in the netherlands geudens and van grootveld 2017 in this study we used genome resolved metagenomics and gene centric approaches to analyze microbial communities in rapid sand filters of a dutch dwtp with a special focus on ammonia and methane oxidizing microorganisms the groundwater entering this dwtp contains elevated concentrations of organic ch4 5 2 mg l and inorganic nh4 0 64 mg l fe2 8 5 mg l mn2 0 16 mg l nutrients which are removed in two sequential rapid sand filters thus this dwtp represents an interesting model system to study microbial communities involved in the conversion and removal of these compounds metagenomic analysis of samples taken at different stages within this dwtp revealed the key microorganisms involved in ammonia and methane oxidation including novel methanotrophic bacteria from the methylophilaceae family which were assumed previously to comprise only methylotrophic bacteria 2 materials

total of 125 million paired end illumina sequencing reads for each sample location more than 70 of the respective reads could be co assembled into 413 184 and 249 mb sequencing data for wb p rsf and s rsf respectively table s1 in addition p rsf samples were also sequenced using the oxford nanopore long read platform to improve the assembly of the most abundant microorganisms overall binning of 4 individual metagenome assemblies based on sequence composition and differential coverage patterns resulted in 78 near complete illumina and 7 nanopore mags table s2 all mags obtained from illumina co

that were used for downstream analyses given the high number of single nucleotide variants observed during bin refinement using the anvi o interactive interface 15 mags were categorized as population level genomes table 2 all mags were classified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using gtdb tk parks et al 2018 indicating affiliation with 1 archaeal and 12 different bacterial phyla fig 2 table 2 3 2 distribution and taxonomic composition of the dwtp microbiome the influence of sampling location sampling time and dna extraction method on the distribution of recovered mags was analyzed by hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance metrics with a ward linkage algorithm allowing grouping of the mags based on their occurrence patterns in the different samples fig 2 overall the choice of a dna extraction method had no pronounced influence on the distribution of mags across samples except for the sample from p rsf in 2016 in this specific sample the normalized coverage values indicated a strong extraction bias for dna extracted using the power soil p rsf16 ps compared to the blood and tissue kit p rsf16 bt table s2 notably this bias was not observed for the 2016 s rsf samples extracted with the same kits or for any other dna extraction performed using the power soil kit it thus is difficult to conceive that the extraction method was affecting specific members only in the 2016 p rsf microbial community and the reason for the observed bias remains unclear overall the sampling location had the most substantial effect on microbial diversity and abundance recovered in our study while some mags obtained from wb and p rsf were also present in s rsf the overall community of the s rsf community clearly differed from the other sampling locations fig 2 the microbial communities of wb and p rsf were generally more similar but sampling location and time influenced the relative abundance of mags across all samples to gain insights into the overall microbial community structure and diversity of the dwtp breehei 16s rrna gene sequences were retrieved directly from the metagenomic assemblies both full length and partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used for further analyses since only 21 to 32 of 16s rrna reads were fully assembled figure s2 subsequently microbial community composition was analyzed at the phylum and family levels figure s3 although changes in abundance were observed phylum level classification revealed no differences in microbial community composition between the sampling locations figure s3a at the family level the s rsf microbial community was clearly distinct from the wb and p rsf community figure s3b corroborating the mag co occurrence pattern based observations when samples were organized using euclidian distance and ward ordination fig 2 16s rrna gene based taxonomic profiling identified 14 phyla with relative abundances 1 figure s3a gammaproteobacteria 17 67 bacteroidota 5 17 acidobacteria 2 15 alphaproteobacteria 4 12 planctomycetota 2 10 ca patescibacteria cpr 1 7 and nitrospirota 2 6 were the most dominant phyla identified in all samples figure s3a in most cases this 16s rrna gene based analysis corroborated the community structure found based on the taxonomic affiliation of the recovered mags additionally one mag belonging to the candidatus phylum ca eisenbacteria and one crenarchaeota thaumarchaeota mag were obtained from wb and s rsf fig 1 but were of low abundance in the 16s rrna datasets 3 3 genome functional profiling during the drinking water treatment process contaminants like iron manganese reduced sulfur species ammonium and methane are removed however our understanding of the microbial and geochemical processes contributing to the removal of these compounds during sand filtration is still limited to learn more about the microorganisms driving the removal of methane and ammonium in this rapid sand filtration system all recovered mags were screened for functional marker proteins involved in nitrification and methane and other one carbon c1 compound oxidation fig 3 table s3 using custom build hmm models details on microorganisms involved in iron and sulfur cycling are given in the supplementary material 3 3 1 ammonia and nitrite oxidation 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the presence of nitrifying bacteria affiliated with the families nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonadaceae in the dwtp breehei nitrospiraceae dominated the nitrifying microbial community in all samples but their abundance patterns differed along the different sampling locations with the lowest abundance in p rsf in contrast canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob affiliated with the nitrosomonaceae showed very low abundance in all samples figure s3 metagenomic consensus binning allowed the recovery of five nitrospira mags from wb and p rsf and one mag of an ammonia oxidizing archaeum aoa affiliated with the genus nitrosoarchaeum despite the detection of nitrosomonadaceae in wb and s rsf samples in 16s rrna based analyses no metagenomic bin of this taxonomic group was recovered all mags were screened for key genes of autotrophic nitrification including the gene sets encoding ammonia monooxygenase amo and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr amoa is often used as a functional and phylogenetic marker for ammonia oxidizing microorganisms junier et al 2008 pester et al 2012 pjevac et al 2017 and thus was used to examine the full ammonia oxidation potential in the dwtp breehei phylogenetic analysis placed our metagenome derived amoa sequences into five divergent groups fig 4 a the observed variations in the nitrifying microbial community structure and abundance between the different samples might be influenced by seasonality with the largest relative abundance in spring 2016 and the lowest during fall 2018 fig 4b however to confirm this trend more frequent samples across a longer time span would be required also considering variations in physicochemical parameters of the five nitrospira mags recovered in this study one p rsf il 20 contained amoa genes affiliated with clade a and two wb il 04 wb il 16 with clade b fig 3a table s3 in protein based phylogenetic analyses most of the clade a and b comammox amoa sequences most closely clustered with sequences derived from dwtp metagenomes figure s4 clade a comammox amoa genes were detected in all samples from the dwtp breehei 0 1 3 6 of the total community and were the most abundant amoa type in p rsf the clade a comammox nitrospira mag p rsf il 20 had the highest coverage in the 2016 p rsf sample extracted with the blood tissue kit while this coverage decreased drastically with another dna extraction method indicating a strong extraction bias as discussed above table s2 consequently the average coverage of this mag was higher in s rsf than in p rsf in contrast clade b comammox amoa recruited the largest number of all assembled reads in wb 0 8 5 9 and s rsf samples 1 7 4 1 fig 6a but none of the two clade b affiliated mags was detected in s rsf suggesting that not all clade b comammox nitrospira genomes were recovered the low abundance of clade b comammox amoa in p rsf fig 4b indicates an adaptation of clade b comammox nitrospira to specific niches except for one mag p rsf il 22 all nitrospira mags contained a nxrab gene cluster encoding for the alpha and beta subunit of the nxr complex fig 3a table s3 mag p rsf il 22 was of medium quality 74 4 estimated completeness table 2 and did not contain any of the genes required for nitrification table s3 consistent with previous studies palomo et al 2019 poghosyan et al 2019 phylogenomic analysis using a concatenated alignment of 91 single copy core genes showed that clade a and b comammox nitrospira formed monophyletic clades within nitrospira lineage ii and all amoa containing mags were correctly affiliated with their respective comammox clade fig 5 a one mag wb il 22 affiliated with the genus nitrosoarchaeum aoa fig 5b was retrieved from the wb metagenome however it lacked an amoa sequence since a contig 1200 bp containing a nitrosoarchaeum like amoa was identified in the metagenome the gene most likely is missing from this mag due to the size cutoff used during binning 1500 bp consistent with gene based analyses 0 1 1 7 fig 4b the nitrosoarchaeum mag was found solely in wb where it accounted for merely 0 2 of all the assembled reads in the wb datasets fig 2 table s2 the recovered archaeal amoa sequence had high similarities to nitrosarchaeum koreense and sequences derived from metagenomic analyses of diverse habitats figure s4 betaproteobacterial amoa sequences of members of the genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were identified in all samples but were of low abundance in addition to the characterized ammonia oxidizing clades recently the unclassified gammaproteobacteria mbae14 genome was found to contain putative amo genes mori et al 2019 from the dwtp breehei metagenomes three putative amoa sequences clustered in this novel sequence group albeit with low similarities to the putative enzyme of mbae14 fig 4a s4 the nxr belongs to the type ii dimethyl sulfoxide dmso reductase enzyme family lücker et al 2010 meincke et al 1992 which also contains respiratory nitrate reductases nars simon and klotz 2013 consequently many hmm profiling approaches fail to differentiate the two homologous groups therefore a phylogenetic tree was constructed to classify the catalytic alpha subunits nxra narg identified in the dwtp metagenomes fig 6 besides the nitrospira genomes six additional mags contained nxr nar gene clusters fig 3a phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences derived from alphaproteobacterial mags p rsf il 15 p rsf il 21 s rsf il 04 were closely affiliated with narg sequences of known nitrate reducers figure s5 the sequences from a mag affiliated with the pedosphaeraceae wb il 17 and two planctomycetota mags wb il 13 s rsf il 06 shared low similarities with known nxrs but clustered with nitrospira nitrospina and anammox bacteria figure s5 while the catalytic nxra subunit of wb il 13 contains one fe s domain typical for dmso reductase family molybdoproteins lücker et al 2010 this binding motif for fe s clusters is absent from the wb il 17 and s rsf il 04 nxr like proteins similar to other periplasmic nxrs lücker et al 2013 lücker et al 2010 spieck et al 1998 these putative nxrs contain n terminal twin arginine motifs for protein translocation into the periplasmic space putative genes encoding the nxr gamma subunit nxrc were found to be co localized with nxrab in the wb il 13 and wb il 17 mags similar to nitrospina gracilis lücker et al 2013 and ca nitrotoga fabula kitzinger et al 2018 these putative nxrcs contain n terminal signal peptides necessary for translocation via the sec pathway the pedosphaeraceae wb il 17 and one of the planctomycetota mags that affiliated with the phycisphaerales wb il 13 were present in wb samples but of low abundance fig 2 table s1 the second unclassified planctomycetota mag s rsf il 06 was detected only in s rsf and accounted for 0 5 2 of all assembled reads in the s rsf datasets table s1 additionally some of the metagenome derived nxr nar sequences were placed into the clade containing the novel nxr type of ca nitrotoga fabula figure s4b kitzinger et al 2018 3 3 2 methane and one carbon metabolism water analyses indicated that most of the methane present in the incoming groundwater was removed during the aeration step and the remainder was oxidized in the p rsf table 1 consequently we determined microbial methane uptake rates in the p rsf and wb samples complete methane oxidation was achieved in all samples within 5 to 8 days of incubation except for the control containing only raw water figure s1 as expected methane consumption in the p rsf sample increased with an increasing amount of sand material whereas no significant difference in methane uptake was detected between the incubations with 1 and 2 5 g of wb biomass figure s1 these identical oxidation rates in the wb incubations seem counterintuitive but may be caused by sample inhomogeneity and uneven distribution of methanotrophic bacteria within the biofilm taxonomic profiling of the extracted 16s rrna genes figure s3 identified gammaproteobacteria as the most dominant taxa in wb 40 55 and p rsf 61 67 samples on the family level methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae formed the most abundant groups in wb and p rsf figure s3b in total 14 mags belonging to these two phylogenetic groups were recovered which were mainly present in wb and p rsf samples fig 2 phylogenomic analysis of the 14 methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae affiliated mags using a concatenated alignment of 92 single copy core genes showed that three of the seven methylomonadaceae mags were affiliated with the genus methyloglobulus fig 7 a of the remaining mags two p rsf il 13 and wb il 06 were distantly related to methylobacter and one wb il 19 to crenothrix while p rsf il 24 clustered separately from the known genera within this family fig 7a six out of seven methylophilaceae mags were affiliated with the genus methylotenera whereas p rsf np 02 formed a separate branch within the methylophilaceae family fig 7b the relative coverage of the methylophilaceae mags was much higher than for the methylomonadaceae fig 2 table s1 these results are consistent with 16s rrna gene profiling where methylophilaceae constituted the most abundant family in wb 6 27 and p rsf 28 47 samples and disappeared in s rsf samples figure s3 particularly the mag p rsf np 02 had extremely high coverage and relative abundance in the wb 1 6 179 0 1 9 6 and p rsf 27 744 1 9 35 8 metagenomes table s1 based on 16s rrna gene similarity ca methylosemipumilus turicensis mms 10a 171 salcher et al 2019 is the closest described relative of p rsf np 02 95 7 sequence identity this value is below the similarity cutoff for species delineation stackebrandt and ebers 2006 which in combination with the distinct clustering in the phylogenomic analysis fig 7b indicates that p rsf np 02 probably belongs to a novel genus within the methylophilaceae the estimated genomic average nucleotide identity value ani 77 26 also indicated a novel species distinct from ca m turicensis the breehei dwtp metagenomes and the recovered mags furthermore were screened for genes encoding the soluble smmo or particulate pmmo methane monooxygenases table s3 notably a complete operon encoding smmo mmox1x2ybzdc was identified in the highly covered methylophilaceae mag p rsf np 02 fig 3 table s3 this was surprising as no previously described member of the family methylophilaceae contains any methane monooxygenase salcher et al 2019 p rsf np 02 harbors two additional copies of the mmox gene encoding the alpha subunit of the smmo table s3 the two orphan mmox copies share high sequence identities on amino acid level with the operonal mmox1 99 8 100 while mmox2 has 97 identity to mmox1 and the two orphan mmox within the ncbi refseq database the most similar proteins to the mmox copies of p rsf np 02 belong to methylomicrobium buryatense with similarities of 83 84 kaluzhnaya et al 2001 the abundance of methanotrophs in the total community was estimated based on pmoa pxma and mmox gene coverages fig 4c the smmo containing methanotrophs were present at high abundances in the 2018 wb 6 11 and p rsf 2 5 56 samples fig 4c where mag p rsf np 02 also dominated the total microbial communities fig 2 the remaining samples were dominated by pmmo containing methanotrophs fig 4c the gene cluster encoding the structural pmmo subunits pmocab was identified in all methylomonadaceae genomes furthermore five mags also harbored the highly divergent pxmabc gene cluster encoding for pxmo fig 3 tavormina et al 2011 phylogenetic analysis of the pmmo alpha subunits pmoa pxma revealed that all sequences recovered in this study including the metagenome derived ones were affiliated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs figure s4 besides pmmo the three methylomonadaceae mags wb il 19 p rsf il 13 p rsf il 24 also possessed smmo fig 3 table s3 in both methanotrophs and non methanotrophic methylotrophs methanol oxidation to formaldehyde is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone dependent pqq methanol dehydrogenases mdh keltjens et al 2014 in this study the rare earth element dependent mdh ln mdh was detected in all methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae in one deltaproteobacteria s rsf il 11 and one hyphomicrobium p rsf np 07 mag in contrast the calcium dependent mdh ca mdh was found only in few genomes fig 3a table s2 thus all analyzed methanotrophs and methylotrophs can oxidize methanol either to formaldehyde by ca mdh or possibly directly to formate by ln mdh fig 3b pol et al 2014 four formaldehyde oxidizing pathways were identified including oxidation by single aldehyde dehydrogenases as well as via tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt tetrahydrofolate h4f or glutathione gsh linked pathways fig 3 all the mags contained formate dehydrogenases fdhs necessary for the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide 4 discussion 4 1 dwtp microbiome the dwtp breehei microbiome was evaluated over a time period of three years and characterized using genome resolved and gene centric metagenomic approaches the microbial community structure was studied for the filter material of two sequential rapid sand filters and the biofilm formed on the walls of the primary sand filter fig 1 similar to some danish dwtps gülay et al 2016 the microbial community composition of the two sequential sand filters differed substantially in total 56 dereplicated near complete mags were recovered comprising 23 64 and 14 of the total assembled reads for wb p rsf and s rsf respectively table s1 these mags expand our knowledge on the genomic inventory of the main microorganisms involved in contaminant removal from groundwater to produce drinking water however assembly statistics indicated that the obtained metagenomic information especially for wb and s rsf only covers a part of the diversity in general the genome centric approach is a powerful tool to analyze the functional potential of an environmental sample based on recovered mags however due to low abundance or strain diversity it often is difficult to obtain good quality genomes for many microorganisms sczyrba et al 2017 thus to examine the full ammonia and methane oxidation potential we also used a gene centric approach see below more information on the microorganisms involved in the removal of other contaminants is given in the supplementary results and discussion 4 2 ammonia and nitrite metabolism the removal of ammonium and nitrite is a vital step in drinking water treatment although the drinking water produced in dwtp breehei is of high quality and free of any nitrogen compounds the ranges of nitrite concentrations in the effluents of the p rsf and s rsf indicate intermediate nitrite accumulation which can be caused by incomplete nitrification de vet et al 2012 wagner et al 2016 thus profound insights into the microbial key players and their metabolic capabilities and limitations are crucial for optimizing and stabilizing n removal in these systems the genomic potential for nitrification was mainly identified in mags affiliated with the genus nitrospira which however did not display as high abundances as observed in other dwtp systems albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 comammox nitrospira were the most abundant nitrifying guild in all dwtp breehei samples fig 4b corroborating previous findings of nitrospira dominating the nitrifying microbial community in dwtps albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 until recently the dominance of this groupwas puzzling since nitrospira were always regarded as strictly nitrite oxidizing bacteria by now this imbalance in abundance of nitrospira and canonical aob can be explained by the presence of complete nitrifying nitrospira in many sand filtration systems palomo et al 2018 pinto et al 2015 wang et al 2017 notably complete nitrifiers are the most abundant nitrifying group in several danish rsfs fowler et al 2018 and were identified as key drivers of ammonia and nitrite oxidation in these systems gülay et al 2019 consistent with these previous results comammox nitrospira also apparently outcompeted canonical aob and aoa in dwtp breehei comammox clade a was found to dominate in p rsf samples and clade b in wb and s rsf fig 4b thus sampling location substantially influenced the abundance of the two comammox clades indicating potential niche partitioning between them the habitat preferences of different nitrifiers might be explained by their ammonia oxidation kinetics and substrate affinities kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2012 according to the kinetic theory of optimal pathway length costa et al 2006 and physiological analyses of n inopinata kits et al 2017 comammox nitrospira are k strategists that have a competitive advantage in environments with very low ammonium fluxes however since no comammox clade b enrichment culture is currently available we can only speculate about the niche defining metabolic capabilities of this group it has been shown that in danish groundwater and chinese surface water treating sand filters with influent ammonium concentrations ranging from 0 01 0 53 mg n l and 0 01 0 035 mg n l respectively clade b comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying microbial populations fowler et al 2018 hu et al 2020 a recent study also reported that nitrification activity in forest and paddy soils when subjected to ammonium limitation is associated with clade b rather than clade a comammox nitrospira wang et al 2019 comammox clade b appeared to dominate also in forest soil under increasing nitrogen load and decreasing ph shi et al 2018 under acidic conditions ammonia nh3 is increasingly protonated to ammonium nh4 resulting in extremely low concentrations of bioavailable ammonia the substrate of amo the higher abundance of clade b comammox nitrospira in s rsf compared to p rsf observed here also suggests their adaptation to ammonium depleted environments these results indicate that clade b comammox nitrospira may exhibit an even lower half saturation constant ks and higher substrate affinities than clade a species and thrive at extremely low ammonium concentrations however it will be required to obtain clade b comammox nitrospira in culture to ascertain the physiology of these enigmatic bacteria in addition to comammox nitrospira also two canonical nitrospira mags were retrieved from the breehei dwtp metagenomes indicating that these nitrite oxidizers can interact with canonical ammonia oxidizers as well as with complete nitrifiers moreover we identified mags affiliated with the verrucomicrobiota and planctomycetota phyla fig 3 that contained nxr like sequences with similarity to the enzymes of known nobs in phylogenetic analyses of nxra they clustered with nitrospira nitrospina and anammox bacteria figure s4b the apparent periplasmic orientation of the nxra and the lack of transmembrane helices in the nxrc subunit suggests that the nxr of these putative nobs may be soluble as has also been proposed for nitrospina gracilis lücker et al 2013 and ca nitrotoga fabula kitzinger et al 2018 however further studies are needed to analyze the potential nitrite oxidizing capacity of these bacteria although in a very low abundances nitrobacter species are also detected in some rsfs tatari et al 2017 which we however did not observe in dwtp breehei 4 3 methane and one carbon metabolism in dwtps methane stripping via aeration is preferred over bacterial methane oxidation since microbial activity and growth cause accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances that lead to clogging of the biofilter material streese and stegmann 2003 however both wb and p rsf samples showed high methane oxidizing capacity figure s1 especially the wall biofilm might counteract methane blowout by oxidizing methane before it leaves the filter and thus reduce methane emissions to the atmosphere in the global carbon cycle methane oxidizing microorganisms play a significant role cicerone and oremland 1988 as they represent the only known biological methane sink aronson et al 2013 these organisms are able to grow with methane as sole carbon and energy source the first step of methane oxidation methane activation and conversion to methanol is catalyzed either by soluble smmo or particulate pmmo methane monooxygenases tavormina et al 2011 trotsenko and murrell 2008 especially the smmo is not universal to methanotrophs and only certain phylogenetic groups are known to encode this methane monooxygenase type verbeke et al 2019 usually together with pmmo several studies have shown that the majority of the methane oxidizing bacteria colonizing the granular material of rsfs are affiliated with the gammaproteobacterial methylococcaceae family albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 recently this family was reclassified and split into the methylomonadaceae methylococcaceae and methylothermaceae parks et al 2017 especially members of the methylomonadaceae have been found in many natural and engineered systems flynn et al 2016 hoefman et al 2014 kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 kits et al 2013 ogisoet al 2012 oswald et al 2017 parks et al 2017 svenning et al 2011 in this study all recovered methylomonadaceae mags contained pmmo and some of them additionally smmo fig 3 table s2 in addition several methanotrophic mags also contained the highly divergent pxmo enzyme complex encoded by the pxmabc gene cluster tavormina et al 2011 previous studies have shown that pxmo is involved in methane oxidation under hypoxic denitrifying conditions in methylomonadaceae strains kits et al 2015a 2015b but its exact function in the sand filters remains to be determined methane oxidation results in the production of various c1 intermediates including methanol and formate which can be used as substrates by methylotrophic bacteria in dwtp breehei the p rsf samples were dominated by members of the methylophilaceae family which was assumed to accommodate only methylotrophic bacteria incapable of growth on methane surprisingly one of the methylophilaceae mags p rsf np 02 harbored a complete operon encoding a smmo fig 3 table s2 indicating a methanotrophic potential this finding is substantiated by an earlier study which demonstrated that a member of methylotrophic genus methyloceanibacter can become methanotrophic by acquiring smmo vekeman et al 2016 the phylogenomic analysis and low ani value to other members of this family 77 26 suggest that p rsf np 02 represents a novel species within the methylophilaceae fig 7b and the extremely high coverage of this mag indicates a major role in methane removal in the dwtp breehei the high abundance of this potential new novel methane oxidizing bacterium in the p rsf will be facilitated by the high iron content of the influent water as the smmo contains a diiron cluster in the active site jasniewski and que 2018 wallar and lipscomb 1996 5 conclusion metagenomic analyses enabled us to identify key microbial populations involved in the removal of ammonium and methane while we did not analyze the influence of physicochemical parameters like temperature ph or organic carbon content we found the location within the dwtp breehei to be a major influential factor shaping the microbial community clade a comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying microbial community in p rsf while clade b was most abundant in s rsf where ammonium concentrations are the lowest and in the biofilm wb which is a predicted niche for comammox bacteria the methanotrophic community was dominated by smmo containing bacteria particularly by one novel methylophilaceae member which might be facilitated by a high iron concentration in the groundwater author contributions lp

17643,elevated concentrations of ammonium and methane in groundwater are often associated with microbiological chemical and sanitary problems during drinking water production and distribution to avoid their accumulation raw water in the netherlands and many other countries is purified by sand filtration these drinking water filtration systems select for microbial communities that mediate the biodegradation of organic and inorganic compounds in this study the top layers and wall biofilm of a dutch drinking water treatment plant dwtp were sampled from the filtration units of the plant over three years we used high throughput sequencing in combination with differential coverage and sequence composition based binning to recover 56 near complete metagenome assembled genomes mags with an estimated completion of 70 and with 10 redundancy these mags were used to characterize the microbial communities involved in the conversion of ammonia and methane the methanotrophic microbial communities colonizing the wall biofilm wb and the granular material of the primary rapid sand filter p rsf were dominated by members of the methylococcaceae and methylophilaceae the abundance of these bacteria drastically decreased in the secondary rapid sand filter s rsf samples in all samples complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira were the most abundant nitrifying guild clade a comammox nitrospira dominated the p rsf while clade b was most abundant in wb and s rsf where ammonium concentrations were much lower in conclusion the knowledge obtained in this study contributes to understanding the role of microorganisms in the removal of carbon and nitrogen compounds during drinking water production we furthermore found that drinking water treatment plants represent valuable

groundwater and 37 from surface water groundwater has a relatively constant composition and may contain high concentrations of iron fe2 7 8 mg l manganese mn2 0 56 mg l ammonium nh4 0 5 mg l and some organic compounds such as methane ch4 37 mg l albers et al 2015 li and carlson 2014 osborn et al 2011 elevated concentrations of these compounds in groundwater can cause severe problems during

from the groundwater through gas exchange systems trussell et al 2012 the increased dissolved oxygen in the water caused by this mechanical aeration step serves as an electron acceptor in microbially

mg l who 2003 however excessive fertilization can lead to increased ammonium concentrations and contamination of groundwater kabala et al 2017 in engineered systems such as drinking water treatment plants dwtp ammonium removal is achieved by the activity of nitrifying microorganisms that oxidize ammonia to nitrate via a series of intermediates while canonical nitrifying guilds perform ammonia and nitrite oxidation in a tight interplay complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria of the genus nitrospira possess all proteins necessary to perform nitrification on their own daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 nitrifying microbial communities of rapid sand filters have been studied before and seem to be represented by different groups of nitrifiers albers et al 2015 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2016 oh et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 van der wielen et al 2009 in these systems nitrification can be limited by the availability of vital nutrients for this process such as phosphate and copper this can cause incomplete nitrification de vet et al 2012 wagner et al 2016 leading to incomplete ammonium removal and or nitrite accumulation wilczak et al 1996 and microbial after growth in the distribution network rittmann et al 2012 methane is a colorless and odorless gas that usually does not present a health risk in drinking water however methane gas is highly flammable and can be explosive at elevated concentrations and it also can serve as substrate for growth of microorganisms in distribution systems most of the methane is removed by the mechanical aeration step and remaining amounts are oxidized by aerobic methanotrophs within the sand beds of the filter units correspondingly a number of studies reported methane oxidizing bacteria colonizing the granular material of the sand filters albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 however in contrast to nitrifying microbial communities methanotrophs in these engineered systems are traditionally less well studied methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 co2 equivalents over 100 years stocker et al 2013 and the removal of most methane from the drinking water via aeration causes methane emissions to the atmosphere contributing to global warming and climate change maksimavičius and roslev 2020 like in many european countries groundwater is the primary source 65 for drinking water production in the netherlands geudens and van grootveld 2017 in this study we used genome resolved metagenomics and gene centric approaches to analyze microbial communities in rapid sand filters of a dutch dwtp with a special focus on ammonia and methane oxidizing microorganisms the groundwater entering this dwtp contains elevated concentrations of organic ch4 5 2 mg l and inorganic nh4 0 64 mg l fe2 8 5 mg l mn2 0 16 mg l nutrients which are removed in two sequential rapid sand filters thus this dwtp represents an interesting model system to study microbial communities involved in the conversion and removal of these compounds metagenomic analysis of samples taken at different stages within this dwtp revealed the key microorganisms involved in ammonia and methane oxidation including novel methanotrophic bacteria from the methylophilaceae family which were assumed previously to comprise only methylotrophic bacteria 2 materials

obtained from the 2018 p rsf sample 2 7 metagenome binning differential coverage information was determined by separately mapping the sequencing reads from each sample and dna extraction method

assignment of the final mags phyla are named according to the recently suggested nomenclature whitman et al 2018 using standardized phylum suffix ota 2 8 abundance estimation of mags to calculate the relative abundance of the dereplicated mags in each sample reads from all samples were individually mapped to each co assembly using bwa v0 7 15 li and durbin 2010 as described above the coverage of each mag was calculated using checkm v1 01 11 minimum alignment length 0 95 parks et al 2015 and was normalized by multiplying this coverage with a normalization factor sequencing depth of the largest sample divided by the sequencing depth of each individual sample the distribution of mags was calculated as percentages by dividing a mag s coverage in each sample by the total coverage of the respective mag in all samples 2 9 functional analysis for the gene centric approach co assembly across all samples was performed using megahit v1 1 1 2 li et al 2015 open reading frames orfs in the new co assembly and the mags obtained above were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt 2010 which was set to include partial orfs custom build hidden markov models hmms eddy 2011 of specific marker proteins were used supplementary methods to annotate all orfs using hmmsearch hmmer v3 1b2 http hmmer org the hmm for rna polymerase subunit beta rpob was downloaded from fungene fish et al 2013

databases subcellular localization of the proteins was predicted by signalp 5 0 armenteros et al 2019 and tmhmm 2 0 krogh et al 2001 functional gene based abundances of ammonia and methane oxidizing microorganisms were estimated using competitive metagenomic read recruitment to ensure unique mapping for this reads from each metagenomic sample were mapped using bowtie2 v2 3 1 langmead and salzberg 2012 in very sensitive mode against extracted partial and complete sequences of rpob and the ammonia as well as the particulate and soluble methane monooxygenase subunit a genes amoa pmoa and mmox respectively samtools v1 6 li et al 2009 was used to obtain the number of mapped reads reads per kilo base per million mapped reads rpkm values were used to correct for differences in sequencing depth and gene length to estimate the relative abundance of microorganisms encoding ammonia and methane monooxygenases in each sample the normalized read counts were calculated as fraction of the normalized read counts of the identified rpob genes 2 10 phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses the up to date bacterial core gene ubcg pipeline na et al 2018 with default parameters was used to extract and concatenate bacterial core gene sets to infer the phylogeny of the archaeal mags the anvi o phylogenomic workflow http merenlab org 2017 06 07 phylogenomics was used to individually align and concatenate 162 archaeal single copy genes maximum likelihood trees were calculated using raxml version 8 2 10 stamatakis 2014 on the cipres science gateway miller et al 2010 for details see supplementary methods amino acid sequences of type ii dmso reductase family enzymes and of ammonia and methane monooxygenases were aligned using arb v5 5 ludwig et al 2004 the maximum likelihood trees were calculated using raxml hpchybrid v 8 2 12 on the cipres and iq tree webserver trifinopoulos et al 2016 as described in supplementary methods all phylogenetic trees were visualized in itol letunic and bork 2016 2 11 data visualization manuscript figures were generated using ggplot2 wickham 2016 rstudio racine 2012 and the anvi o interactive interface http merenlab org 2016 02 27 the anvio interactive interface 3 results 3 1 recovery of metagenome assembled genomes over the period 2016 to 2018 a total of 7 samples from dwtp breehei were collected fig 1 and sequenced this resulted in a total of 125 million paired end illumina sequencing reads for each sample location more than 70 of the respective reads could be co assembled into 413 184 and 249 mb sequencing data for wb p rsf and s rsf respectively table s1 in addition p rsf samples were also sequenced using the oxford nanopore long read platform to improve the assembly of the most abundant microorganisms overall binning of 4 individual metagenome assemblies based on sequence composition and differential coverage patterns resulted in 78 near complete illumina and 7 nanopore mags table s2 all mags obtained from illumina co assemblies as well as the nanopore assembly were dereplicated at strain level 99 ani which yielded 50 medium and 6 high quality mimag standards bowers et al 2017 non redundant mags table 2 table s2 that were used for downstream analyses given the high number of single nucleotide variants observed during bin refinement using the anvi o interactive interface 15 mags were categorized as population level genomes table 2 all mags were classified at the lowest possible taxonomic level using gtdb tk parks et al 2018 indicating affiliation with 1 archaeal and 12 different bacterial phyla fig 2 table 2 3 2 distribution and taxonomic composition of the dwtp microbiome the influence of sampling location sampling time and dna extraction method on the distribution of recovered mags was analyzed by hierarchical clustering using euclidean distance metrics with a ward linkage algorithm allowing grouping of the mags based on their occurrence patterns in the different samples fig 2 overall the choice of a dna extraction method had no pronounced influence on the distribution of mags across samples except for the sample from p rsf in 2016 in this specific sample the normalized coverage values indicated a strong extraction bias for dna extracted using the power soil p rsf16 ps compared to the blood and tissue kit p rsf16 bt table s2 notably this bias was not observed for the 2016 s rsf samples extracted with the same kits or for any other dna extraction performed using the power soil kit it thus is difficult to conceive that the extraction method was affecting specific members only in the 2016 p rsf microbial community and the reason for the observed bias remains unclear overall the sampling location had the most substantial effect on microbial diversity and abundance recovered in our study while some mags obtained from wb and p rsf were also present in s rsf the overall community of the s rsf community clearly differed from the other sampling locations fig 2 the microbial communities of wb and p rsf were generally more similar but sampling location and time influenced the relative abundance of mags across all samples to gain insights into the overall microbial community structure and diversity of the dwtp breehei 16s rrna gene sequences were retrieved directly from the metagenomic assemblies both full length and partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used for further analyses since only 21 to 32 of 16s rrna reads were fully assembled figure s2 subsequently microbial community composition was analyzed at the phylum and family levels figure s3 although changes in abundance were observed phylum level classification revealed no differences in microbial community composition between the sampling locations figure s3a at the family level the s rsf microbial community was clearly distinct from the wb and p rsf community figure s3b corroborating the mag co occurrence pattern based observations when samples were organized using euclidian distance and ward ordination fig 2 16s rrna gene based taxonomic profiling identified 14 phyla with relative abundances 1 figure s3a gammaproteobacteria 17 67 bacteroidota 5 17 acidobacteria 2 15 alphaproteobacteria 4 12 planctomycetota 2 10 ca patescibacteria cpr 1 7 and nitrospirota 2 6 were the most dominant phyla identified in all samples figure s3a in most cases this 16s rrna gene based analysis corroborated the community structure found based on the taxonomic affiliation of the recovered mags additionally one mag belonging to the candidatus phylum ca eisenbacteria and one crenarchaeota thaumarchaeota mag were obtained from wb and s rsf fig 1 but were of low abundance in the 16s rrna datasets 3 3 genome functional profiling during the drinking water treatment process contaminants like iron manganese reduced sulfur species ammonium and methane are removed however our understanding of the microbial and geochemical processes contributing to the removal of these compounds during sand filtration is still limited to learn more about the microorganisms driving the removal of methane and ammonium in this rapid sand filtration system all recovered mags were screened for functional marker proteins involved in nitrification and methane and other one carbon c1 compound oxidation fig 3 table s3 using custom build hmm models details on microorganisms involved in iron and sulfur cycling are given in the supplementary material 3 3 1 ammonia and nitrite oxidation 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed the presence of nitrifying bacteria affiliated with the families nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonadaceae in the dwtp breehei nitrospiraceae dominated the nitrifying microbial community in all samples but their abundance patterns differed along the different sampling locations with the lowest abundance in p rsf in contrast canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob affiliated with the nitrosomonaceae showed very low abundance in all samples figure s3 metagenomic consensus binning allowed the recovery of five nitrospira mags from wb and p rsf and one mag of an ammonia oxidizing archaeum aoa affiliated with the genus nitrosoarchaeum despite the detection of nitrosomonadaceae in wb and s rsf samples in 16s rrna based analyses no metagenomic bin of this taxonomic group was recovered all mags were screened for key genes of autotrophic nitrification including the gene sets encoding ammonia monooxygenase amo and nitrite oxidoreductase nxr amoa is often used as a functional and phylogenetic marker for ammonia oxidizing microorganisms junier et al 2008 pester et al 2012 pjevac et al 2017 and thus was used to examine the full ammonia oxidation potential in the dwtp breehei phylogenetic analysis placed our metagenome derived amoa sequences into five divergent groups fig 4 a the observed variations in the nitrifying microbial community structure and abundance between the different samples might be influenced by seasonality with the largest relative abundance in spring 2016 and the lowest during fall 2018 fig 4b however to confirm this trend more frequent samples across a longer time span would be required also considering variations in physicochemical parameters of the five nitrospira mags recovered in this study one p rsf il 20 contained amoa genes affiliated with clade a and two wb il 04 wb il 16 with clade b fig 3a table s3 in protein based phylogenetic analyses most of the clade a and b comammox amoa sequences most closely clustered with sequences derived from dwtp metagenomes figure s4 clade a comammox amoa genes were detected in all samples from the dwtp breehei 0 1 3 6 of the total community and were the most abundant amoa type in p rsf the clade a comammox nitrospira mag p rsf il 20 had the highest coverage in the 2016 p rsf sample extracted with the blood tissue kit while this coverage decreased drastically with another dna extraction method indicating a strong extraction bias as discussed above table s2 consequently the average coverage of this mag was higher in s rsf than in p rsf in contrast clade b comammox amoa recruited the largest number of all assembled reads in wb 0 8 5 9 and s rsf samples 1 7 4 1 fig 6a but none of the two clade b affiliated mags was detected in s rsf suggesting that not all clade b comammox nitrospira genomes were recovered the low abundance of clade b comammox amoa in p rsf fig 4b indicates an adaptation of clade b comammox nitrospira to specific niches except for one mag p rsf il 22 all nitrospira mags contained a nxrab gene cluster encoding for the alpha and beta subunit of the nxr complex fig 3a table s3 mag p rsf il 22 was of medium quality 74 4 estimated completeness table 2 and did not contain any of the genes required for nitrification table s3 consistent with previous studies palomo et al 2019 poghosyan et al 2019 phylogenomic analysis using a concatenated alignment of 91 single copy core genes showed that clade a and b comammox nitrospira formed monophyletic clades within nitrospira lineage ii and all amoa containing mags were correctly affiliated with their respective comammox clade fig 5 a one mag wb il 22 affiliated with the genus nitrosoarchaeum aoa fig 5b was retrieved from the wb metagenome however it lacked an amoa sequence since a contig 1200 bp containing a nitrosoarchaeum like amoa was identified in the metagenome the gene most likely is missing from this mag due to the size cutoff used during binning 1500 bp consistent with gene based analyses 0 1 1 7 fig 4b the nitrosoarchaeum mag was found solely in wb where it accounted for merely 0 2 of all the assembled reads in the wb datasets fig 2 table s2 the recovered archaeal amoa sequence had high similarities to nitrosarchaeum koreense and sequences derived from metagenomic analyses of diverse habitats figure s4 betaproteobacterial amoa sequences of members of the genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira were identified in all samples but were of low abundance in addition to the characterized ammonia oxidizing clades recently the unclassified gammaproteobacteria mbae14 genome was found to contain putative amo genes mori et al 2019 from the dwtp breehei metagenomes three putative amoa sequences clustered in this novel sequence group albeit with low similarities to the putative enzyme of mbae14 fig 4a s4 the nxr belongs to the type ii dimethyl sulfoxide dmso reductase enzyme family lücker et al 2010 meincke et al 1992 which also contains respiratory nitrate reductases nars simon and klotz 2013 consequently many hmm profiling approaches fail to differentiate the two homologous groups therefore a phylogenetic tree was constructed to classify the catalytic alpha subunits nxra narg identified in the dwtp metagenomes fig 6 besides the nitrospira genomes six additional mags contained nxr nar gene clusters fig 3a phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences derived from alphaproteobacterial mags p rsf il 15 p rsf il 21 s rsf il 04 were closely affiliated with narg sequences of known nitrate reducers figure s5 the sequences from a mag affiliated with the pedosphaeraceae wb il 17 and two planctomycetota mags wb il 13 s rsf il 06 shared low similarities with known nxrs but clustered with nitrospira nitrospina and anammox bacteria figure s5 while the catalytic nxra subunit of wb il 13 contains one fe s domain typical for dmso reductase family molybdoproteins lücker et al 2010 this binding motif for fe s clusters is absent from the wb il 17 and s rsf il 04 nxr like proteins similar to other periplasmic nxrs lücker et al 2013 lücker et al 2010 spieck et al 1998 these putative nxrs contain n terminal twin arginine motifs for protein translocation into the periplasmic space putative genes encoding the nxr gamma subunit nxrc were found to be co localized with nxrab in the wb il 13 and wb il 17 mags similar to nitrospina gracilis lücker et al 2013 and ca nitrotoga fabula kitzinger et al 2018 these putative nxrcs contain n terminal signal peptides necessary for translocation via the sec pathway the pedosphaeraceae wb il 17 and one of the planctomycetota mags that affiliated with the phycisphaerales wb il 13 were present in wb samples but of low abundance fig 2 table s1 the second unclassified planctomycetota mag s rsf il 06 was detected only in s rsf and accounted for 0 5 2 of all assembled reads in the s rsf datasets table s1 additionally some of the metagenome derived nxr nar sequences were placed into the clade containing the novel nxr type of ca nitrotoga fabula figure s4b kitzinger et al 2018 3 3 2 methane and one carbon metabolism water analyses indicated that most of the methane present in the incoming groundwater was removed during the aeration step and the remainder was oxidized in the p rsf table 1 consequently we determined microbial methane uptake rates in the p rsf and wb samples complete methane oxidation was achieved in all samples within 5 to 8 days of incubation except for the control containing only raw water figure s1 as expected methane consumption in the p rsf sample increased with an increasing amount of sand material whereas no significant difference in methane uptake was detected between the incubations with 1 and 2 5 g of wb biomass figure s1 these identical oxidation rates in the wb incubations seem counterintuitive but may be caused by sample inhomogeneity and uneven distribution of methanotrophic bacteria within the biofilm taxonomic profiling of the extracted 16s rrna genes figure s3 identified gammaproteobacteria as the most dominant taxa in wb 40 55 and p rsf 61 67 samples on the family level methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae formed the most abundant groups in wb and p rsf figure s3b in total 14 mags belonging to these two phylogenetic groups were recovered which were mainly present in wb and p rsf samples fig 2 phylogenomic analysis of the 14 methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae affiliated mags using a concatenated alignment of 92 single copy core genes showed that three of the seven methylomonadaceae mags were affiliated with the genus methyloglobulus fig 7 a of the remaining mags two p rsf il 13 and wb il 06 were distantly related to methylobacter and one wb il 19 to crenothrix while p rsf il 24 clustered separately from the known genera within this family fig 7a six out of seven methylophilaceae mags were affiliated with the genus methylotenera whereas p rsf np 02 formed a separate branch within the methylophilaceae family fig 7b the relative coverage of the methylophilaceae mags was much higher than for the methylomonadaceae fig 2 table s1 these results are consistent with 16s rrna gene profiling where methylophilaceae constituted the most abundant family in wb 6 27 and p rsf 28 47 samples and disappeared in s rsf samples figure s3 particularly the mag p rsf np 02 had extremely high coverage and relative abundance in the wb 1 6 179 0 1 9 6 and p rsf 27 744 1 9 35 8 metagenomes table s1 based on 16s rrna gene similarity ca methylosemipumilus turicensis mms 10a 171 salcher et al 2019 is the closest described relative of p rsf np 02 95 7 sequence identity this value is below the similarity cutoff for species delineation stackebrandt and ebers 2006 which in combination with the distinct clustering in the phylogenomic analysis fig 7b indicates that p rsf np 02 probably belongs to a novel genus within the methylophilaceae the estimated genomic average nucleotide identity value ani 77 26 also indicated a novel species distinct from ca m turicensis the breehei dwtp metagenomes and the recovered mags furthermore were screened for genes encoding the soluble smmo or particulate pmmo methane monooxygenases table s3 notably a complete operon encoding smmo mmox1x2ybzdc was identified in the highly covered methylophilaceae mag p rsf np 02 fig 3 table s3 this was surprising as no previously described member of the family methylophilaceae contains any methane monooxygenase salcher et al 2019 p rsf np 02 harbors two additional copies of the mmox gene encoding the alpha subunit of the smmo table s3 the two orphan mmox copies share high sequence identities on amino acid level with the operonal mmox1 99 8 100 while mmox2 has 97 identity to mmox1 and the two orphan mmox within the ncbi refseq database the most similar proteins to the mmox copies of p rsf np 02 belong to methylomicrobium buryatense with similarities of 83 84 kaluzhnaya et al 2001 the abundance of methanotrophs in the total community was estimated based on pmoa pxma and mmox gene coverages fig 4c the smmo containing methanotrophs were present at high abundances in the 2018 wb 6 11 and p rsf 2 5 56 samples fig 4c where mag p rsf np 02 also dominated the total microbial communities fig 2 the remaining samples were dominated by pmmo containing methanotrophs fig 4c the gene cluster encoding the structural pmmo subunits pmocab was identified in all methylomonadaceae genomes furthermore five mags also harbored the highly divergent pxmabc gene cluster encoding for pxmo fig 3 tavormina et al 2011 phylogenetic analysis of the pmmo alpha subunits pmoa pxma revealed that all sequences recovered in this study including the metagenome derived ones were affiliated with gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs figure s4 besides pmmo the three methylomonadaceae mags wb il 19 p rsf il 13 p rsf il 24 also possessed smmo fig 3 table s3 in both methanotrophs and non methanotrophic methylotrophs methanol oxidation to formaldehyde is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone dependent pqq methanol dehydrogenases mdh keltjens et al 2014 in this study the rare earth element dependent mdh ln mdh was detected in all methylomonadaceae and methylophilaceae in one deltaproteobacteria s rsf il 11 and one hyphomicrobium p rsf np 07 mag in contrast the calcium dependent mdh ca mdh was found only in few genomes fig 3a table s2 thus all analyzed methanotrophs and methylotrophs can oxidize methanol either to formaldehyde by ca mdh or possibly directly to formate by ln mdh fig 3b pol et al 2014 four formaldehyde oxidizing pathways were identified including oxidation by single aldehyde dehydrogenases as well as via tetrahydromethanopterin h4mpt tetrahydrofolate h4f or glutathione gsh linked pathways fig 3 all the mags contained formate dehydrogenases fdhs necessary for the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide 4 discussion 4 1 dwtp microbiome the dwtp breehei microbiome was evaluated over a time period of three years and characterized using genome resolved and gene centric metagenomic approaches the microbial community structure was studied for the filter material of two sequential rapid sand filters and the biofilm formed on the walls of the primary sand filter fig 1 similar to some danish dwtps gülay et al 2016 the microbial community composition of the two sequential sand filters differed substantially in total 56 dereplicated near complete mags were recovered comprising 23 64 and 14 of the total assembled reads for wb p rsf and s rsf respectively table s1 these mags expand our knowledge on the genomic inventory of the main microorganisms involved in contaminant removal from groundwater to produce drinking water however assembly statistics indicated that the obtained metagenomic information especially for wb and s rsf only covers a part of the diversity in general the genome centric approach is a powerful tool to analyze the functional potential of an environmental sample based on recovered mags however due to low abundance or strain diversity it often is difficult to obtain good quality genomes for many microorganisms sczyrba et al 2017 thus to examine the full ammonia and methane oxidation potential we also used a gene centric approach see below more information on the microorganisms involved in the removal of other contaminants is given in the supplementary results and discussion 4 2 ammonia and nitrite metabolism the removal of ammonium and nitrite is a vital step in drinking water treatment although the drinking water produced in dwtp breehei is of high quality and free of any nitrogen compounds the ranges of nitrite concentrations in the effluents of the p rsf and s rsf indicate intermediate nitrite accumulation which can be caused by incomplete nitrification de vet et al 2012 wagner et al 2016 thus profound insights into the microbial key players and their metabolic capabilities and limitations are crucial for optimizing and stabilizing n removal in these systems the genomic potential for nitrification was mainly identified in mags affiliated with the genus nitrospira which however did not display as high abundances as observed in other dwtp systems albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 comammox nitrospira were the most abundant nitrifying guild in all dwtp breehei samples fig 4b corroborating previous findings of nitrospira dominating the nitrifying microbial community in dwtps albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 until recently the dominance of this groupwas puzzling since nitrospira were always regarded as strictly nitrite oxidizing bacteria by now this imbalance in abundance of nitrospira and canonical aob can be explained by the presence of complete nitrifying nitrospira in many sand filtration systems palomo et al 2018 pinto et al 2015 wang et al 2017 notably complete nitrifiers are the most abundant nitrifying group in several danish rsfs fowler et al 2018 and were identified as key drivers of ammonia and nitrite oxidation in these systems gülay et al 2019 consistent with these previous results comammox nitrospira also apparently outcompeted canonical aob and aoa in dwtp breehei comammox clade a was found to dominate in p rsf samples and clade b in wb and s rsf fig 4b thus sampling location substantially influenced the abundance of the two comammox clades indicating potential niche partitioning between them the habitat preferences of different nitrifiers might be explained by their ammonia oxidation kinetics and substrate affinities kits et al 2017 martens habbena et al 2009 prosser and nicol 2012 according to the kinetic theory of optimal pathway length costa et al 2006 and physiological analyses of n inopinata kits et al 2017 comammox nitrospira are k strategists that have a competitive advantage in environments with very low ammonium fluxes however since no comammox clade b enrichment culture is currently available we can only speculate about the niche defining metabolic capabilities of this group it has been shown that in danish groundwater and chinese surface water treating sand filters with influent ammonium concentrations ranging from 0 01 0 53 mg n l and 0 01 0 035 mg n l respectively clade b comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying microbial populations fowler et al 2018 hu et al 2020 a recent study also reported that nitrification activity in forest and paddy soils when subjected to ammonium limitation is associated with clade b rather than clade a comammox nitrospira wang et al 2019 comammox clade b appeared to dominate also in forest soil under increasing nitrogen load and decreasing ph shi et al 2018 under acidic conditions ammonia nh3 is increasingly protonated to ammonium nh4 resulting in extremely low concentrations of bioavailable ammonia the substrate of amo the higher abundance of clade b comammox nitrospira in s rsf compared to p rsf observed here also suggests their adaptation to ammonium depleted environments these results indicate that clade b comammox nitrospira may exhibit an even lower half saturation constant ks and higher substrate affinities than clade a species and thrive at extremely low ammonium concentrations however it will be required to obtain clade b comammox nitrospira in culture to ascertain the physiology of these enigmatic bacteria in addition to comammox nitrospira also two canonical nitrospira mags were retrieved from the breehei dwtp metagenomes indicating that these nitrite oxidizers can interact with canonical ammonia oxidizers as well as with complete nitrifiers moreover we identified mags affiliated with the verrucomicrobiota and planctomycetota phyla fig 3 that contained nxr like sequences with similarity to the enzymes of known nobs in phylogenetic analyses of nxra they clustered with nitrospira nitrospina and anammox bacteria figure s4b the apparent periplasmic orientation of the nxra and the lack of transmembrane helices in the nxrc subunit suggests that the nxr of these putative nobs may be soluble as has also been proposed for nitrospina gracilis lücker et al 2013 and ca nitrotoga fabula kitzinger et al 2018 however further studies are needed to analyze the potential nitrite oxidizing capacity of these bacteria although in a very low abundances nitrobacter species are also detected in some rsfs tatari et al 2017 which we however did not observe in dwtp breehei 4 3 methane and one carbon metabolism in dwtps methane stripping via aeration is preferred over bacterial methane oxidation since microbial activity and growth cause accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances that lead to clogging of the biofilter material streese and stegmann 2003 however both wb and p rsf samples showed high methane oxidizing capacity figure s1 especially the wall biofilm might counteract methane blowout by oxidizing methane before it leaves the filter and thus reduce methane emissions to the atmosphere in the global carbon cycle methane oxidizing microorganisms play a significant role cicerone and oremland 1988 as they represent the only known biological methane sink aronson et al 2013 these organisms are able to grow with methane as sole carbon and energy source the first step of methane oxidation methane activation and conversion to methanol is catalyzed either by soluble smmo or particulate pmmo methane monooxygenases tavormina et al 2011 trotsenko and murrell 2008 especially the smmo is not universal to methanotrophs and only certain phylogenetic groups are known to encode this methane monooxygenase type verbeke et al 2019 usually together with pmmo several studies have shown that the majority of the methane oxidizing bacteria colonizing the granular material of rsfs are affiliated with the gammaproteobacterial methylococcaceae family albers et al 2015 gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 recently this family was reclassified and split into the methylomonadaceae methylococcaceae and methylothermaceae parks et al 2017 especially members of the methylomonadaceae have been found in many natural and engineered systems flynn et al 2016 hoefman et al 2014 kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 kits et al 2013 ogisoet al 2012 oswald et al 2017 parks et al 2017 svenning et al 2011 in this study all recovered methylomonadaceae mags contained pmmo and some of them additionally smmo fig 3 table s2 in addition several methanotrophic mags also contained the highly divergent pxmo enzyme complex encoded by the pxmabc gene cluster tavormina et al 2011 previous studies have shown that pxmo is involved in methane oxidation under hypoxic denitrifying conditions in methylomonadaceae strains kits et al 2015a 2015b but its exact function in the sand filters remains to be determined methane oxidation results in the production of various c1 intermediates including methanol and formate which can be used as substrates by methylotrophic bacteria in dwtp breehei the p rsf samples were dominated by members of the methylophilaceae family which was assumed to accommodate only methylotrophic bacteria incapable of growth on methane surprisingly one of the methylophilaceae mags p rsf np 02 harbored a complete operon encoding a smmo fig 3 table s2 indicating a methanotrophic potential this finding is substantiated by an earlier study which demonstrated that a member of methylotrophic genus methyloceanibacter can become methanotrophic by acquiring smmo vekeman et al 2016 the phylogenomic analysis and low ani value to other members of this family 77 26 suggest that p rsf np 02 represents a novel species within the methylophilaceae fig 7b and the extremely high coverage of this mag indicates a major role in methane removal in the dwtp breehei the high abundance of this potential new novel methane oxidizing bacterium in the p rsf will be facilitated by the high iron content of the influent water as the smmo contains a diiron cluster in the active site jasniewski and que 2018 wallar and lipscomb 1996 5 conclusion metagenomic analyses enabled us to identify key microbial populations involved in the removal of ammonium and methane while we did not analyze the influence of physicochemical parameters like temperature ph or organic carbon content we found the location within the dwtp breehei to be a major influential factor shaping the microbial community clade a comammox nitrospira dominated the nitrifying microbial community in p rsf while clade b was most abundant in s rsf where ammonium concentrations are the lowest and in the biofilm wb which is a predicted niche for comammox bacteria the methanotrophic community was dominated by smmo containing bacteria particularly by one novel methylophilaceae member which might be facilitated by a high iron concentration in the groundwater author contributions lp

17644,wastewater treatment plants are major point sources of micro pollutant emissions and advanced wastewater treatment technologies can improve their removal capacity while abundant data on individual advanced treatment technologies is available there is limited knowledge regarding the removal performance of ozonation combined with multiple post treatments and stand alone membrane bioreactors this is especially true for the removal of in vitro and in vivo toxicity therefore we investigated the removal of 40 micropollutants and toxicity by a pilot scale ozonation with four post treatments non aerated and aerated granular activated carbon and biological filtration in addition two stand alone membrane bioreactors fed with untreated wastewater and one mbr operating with ozonated partial flow recirculation were analysed aqueous and extracted samples were analysed in vitro for anti estrogenic anti androgenic and mutagenic effects to assess in vivo effects the mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum was exposed in an on site flow through system multiple in vitro effects were detected in conventionally treated wastewater including estrogenic and anti androgenic activity ozonation largely removed these effects while anti estrogenic and mutagenic effects increased suggesting the formation of toxic transformation products these effects were significantly reduced by granular activated carbon being more effective than biological filtration the membrane bioreactor performed similarly to the conventional treatment while the membrane bioreactor with ozonation had a comparable removal performance like ozonation conventionally treated wastewater increased the growth of p antipodarum ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic transformation products in the post treatments these effects were compensated or remained unaffected the effluents of the membrane bioreactors induced reproductive toxicity our results show that ozonation is effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutant concentrations however the formation of toxicity requires a post treatment here ozonation coupled to granular activated carbon

specific ozone consumption 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are main entry points for the emission of chemicals to aquatic ecosystems including pollutants of emerging concern loos et al 2013 and micropollutants schwarzenbach et al 2006 wwtps are known to incompletely remove different micropollutants during conventional biological wastewater treatment such as using activated sludge reasons for this are low biodegradability and or high polarity of chemicals knopp et al 2016 certain micropollutants have been detected throughout the water cycle including nanogram per liter concentrations in drinking water benotti et al 2009 and have been characterised as relevant risk to ecosystem integrity and drinking water resources malaj et al 2014 chemical contamination resulted in the establishment of environmental quality standards eqs in many countries including their integration into different waste water policies e g european parliament and council 2008 2013 and the implementation of technical mitigation measures one major measure is the development and implementation of advanced wastewater treatment awwt technologies bui et al 2016 key awwt include advanced oxidation processes aops e g ozonation in combination with uv radiation activated carbon treatments e g granular activated carbon gac or powdered activated carbon pac or pressure driven membranes e g reverse osmosis these technologies demonstrated additional removal of micro pollutants from biologically treated wastewater however each technology has certain weaknesses such as the formation of potentially toxic transformation products tps during aop or an insufficient sorption of polar chemicals to activated carbon rizzo 2011 accordingly the addition of a post treatment i e filtration after ozonation and optimised parameter settings e g ozone o3 doses and hydraulic retention times hrts have been recommended völker et al 2019 the present study investigates an innovative process combination for the further reduction of relevant micro pollutants and toxicity the focus was the upgrade of a municipal wwtp with activated sludge treatment in hesse germany with a pilot scale ozonation in combination with subsequent non aerated and aerated gac biofilter bf fig 1 ozonation was chosen because the chemical oxidation induces a transformation of micro pollutants in the wastewater and thus increases the accessibility to and degradation in the biological treatment these transformation processes and the resulting tps can result in the formation of in vitro and in vivo toxicity völker et al 2019 therefore ozonation was combined with gac and biofilter as adsorptive techniques to reduce these effects this is novel because commonly gac filtration is used as a post treatment technology for activated sludge treatments but not in combination with other awwt technologies membrane bioreactors mbrs present a stand alone technology to treat raw wastewater such as hospital wastewater bui et al 2016 skouteris et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2010 the benefits of using mbrs are amongst others that a final sedimentation is not needed and that a higher solid content in the mbr results in smaller construction volumes and higher sludge ages that may positively affect micropollutant removal again little is known regarding their performance in reducing toxicity gehrmann et al 2018 maletzt et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 thus two mbrs fed with untreated wastewater one incorporating a partial flow recirculation of ozonated wastewater were examined fig 1 focusing on the combination of oxidation and biological treatment the aim was to test whether higher removal rates can be achieved with the lowest ozone concentration such an approach has not yet been investigated another benefit of the implementation of the recirculation concept was that it does not require an expansion of existing activated sludge treatment and thus lowers the operating costs as multiple awwt technologies and combinations thereof are available it is important to compare their performance in removing chemicals and toxicity so far most previous studies investigated only a single awwt technology often alone or less frequently in combination with one post treatment e g ozonation combined with sand filtration in addition most studies are performed at different wwtps complicating the comparison of technological performance and efficiency of multiple technologies studies comparing multiple process combinations at the same plant are rather scarce stalter et al 2010 völker et al 2016 however such studies are needed to assess the benefits of conventional and awwt technologies to evaluate the efficiency of awwt technologies chemical and ecotoxicological analysis are complementary because the former allows for determining the removal of priority compounds while the latter enables the assessment of toxicity removal caused by an overall mixture of chemicals cao et al 2009 this combination is particularly important because the removal of target compounds does not per se correlate to toxicity removal magdeburg et al 2014 case specific combinations of bioassays and chemical analyses were thus rated as gold standard ternes et al 2017 in the current study we used multiple in vitro bioassays and one in vivo bioassay with the new zealand mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum and quantified 28 representative micropollutants and twelve standard wastewater parameters the performance of a full scale conventional biological wastewater treatment bt combined with a subsequent pilot scale ozonation bt o3 followed by gac filtration or bf as well as two stand alone mbrs one mbr with partial flow ozonation mbr1 mbr1 o3 and mbr2 respectively were investigated the evaluation focused on the removal of target chemicals and toxicity compared to the activated sludge treatment o3 gac bf or raw wastewater mbrs in this context three hypotheses were tested 1 increasing the ozone dose and hrt increases the removal of micropollutants and in vitro toxicities 2 ozonation generates toxic tps that adversely affect different in vitro and or in vivo endpoints while a post treatment reduces these effects 3 the mbrs remove chemicals and toxicity with a performance comparable to an activated sludge treatment with a partial flow ozonation further increasing the performance the aim of this work was to compare the toxicity and micropollutant removal of the multiple combinations of awwt technologies implemented at the same wwtp and provide recommendations on which technologies perform best 2 material and methods 2 1 characterisation of the pilot wwtp with ozonation and post treatments the pilot plant investigated in this study received wastewater from a full scale wwtp in south hesse germany knopp et al 2016 table s1 the latter has about 40 000 population equivalents and an average discharge of 6400 m3 d composed of 70 municipal and 30 industrial sources the primary treatment pt consists of a mechanical screen and grit removal raw effluent the secondary treatment is a biological activated sludge process with denitrification nitrification and phosphorus removal chemical precipitation and final clarifiers in the pilot wwtp the wastewater from this secondary treatment was filtered with a micro sieve 10 μm rodisc huber se berching germany to further reduce

rate of 2 02 n 5 the sludge retention time was 55 days mbr2 served as reference and its wastewater was neither ozonated nor recirculated further technical details and process parameters are described in the supplementary information tables s1 s4 2 2 optimal ozone dose and hydraulic retention time prior to the on site experiment with p antipodarum 2 3 an experiment to determine the optimal ozone

mbr2 were on a comparable level to bt the spe extracts of the bt indicated a mean estrogen activity of 16 9 1 60 fig 5 a table s18 ozonation reduced the estrogenic activity by 96 5 to 0 59 0 11 the following gac filter and bf showed a reduction of the estrogen activity compared to the bt by 95 1 95 9 as well for the mbr systems this reduction ranged between 81 7 in mbr2 and 97 4 in mbr1 o3 ozonation of the bt increased the anti estrogenic activity of the extracts by 163 from 14 1 1 53 to 37 2 1 43 fig 5b table s18 post filtration reduced this anti estrogenic activity by 5 03 49 9 but the activity was still higher compared to the bt 31 8 gac 65 7 gaca 150 bf and 144 bfa the wastewater of the mbr1 mbr1 o3 and mbr2 indicated a higher anti estrogen activity compared to the bt with an

activity was detectable in the bt in the ames strain yg7108 fig 6 table s18 ozonation of the bt induced a high mutagenicity of 93 2 1 29 water treated with gac and gaca was not mutagenic in contrast to the bf and bfa with 50 8 2 29 and 52 9 4 87 respectively no mutagenicity was detected in mbr1 and mbr2 whereas mbr1 o3 showed a mutagenicity of 67 5 4 62 3 3 chemical analysis the chemical analysis was conducted in parallel to the ecotoxicological investigations and included 28 micropollutants mainly belonging to the group of pharmaceuticals such as radio opaque substances anticonvulsants antibiotics including metabolites such as of carbamazepine diclofenac or ibuprofen as well as nutrition related chemicals caffeine herbicides mecoprop and industrial chemicals benzotriazole and tolyltriazole in the pt caffeine was detected at the highest concentration of 162 23 2 μg l followed by carboxy ibuprofen 74 7 6 27 μg l 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 47 3 4 97 μg l and 1h benzotriazole 25 0 0 71 μg l the concentrations of the other substances were between 0 025 and 14 4 μg l table s19 the bt reduced the concentrations of 15 out of 28 chemicals by more than 50 highest reduction 99 8 for caffeine and carboxy ibuprofen for nine chemicals the reduction was low 25 for carbamazepine and carboxy acyclovir a concentration increase was detected ozonation led to a further reduction of 21 substances ranging from 11 1 iopamidol and 99 1 carboxy acyclovir compared to the bt fig 7a table s19 the concentrations of 18 substances decreased by more than 50 for another three compounds the concentrations decreased by between 10 and 50 two tps 3 hydroxy ibuprofen and tramadol n oxide indicated higher concentrations in the bt o3 than in the bt the post treatments further reduced the concentrations of most target substances figs s9 and s10 tables s19 and s20 for certain compounds for which ozonation did not achieve a complete removal e g 3 hydroxy ibuprofen diclofenac sulfamethoxazole a post filtration led to an overall removal of 75 0 90 7 compared to the bt o3 for a small set of compounds 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole carboxy acyclovir paracetamol a moderate additional removal between 31 1 and 42 9 occurred in the gac filters and bfs compared to the bt o3 gac filters showed a higher removal rate for seven compounds including 1h benzotrialzole amidotrizoic acid iomeprole iopromide tolytriazole and tramadol n oxide compared to the bfs certain compounds such as caffeine or mecoprop could however not be further removed by the gac filters and bfs compared to the bt o3 mbr1 and mbr2 had slightly lower removal efficacies regarding the 28 chemicals than the bt figs 7b and s11 tables s20 s21 the ozonation increased the removal in the mbr1 with efficiencies comparable to the bt o3 however the concentration of carboxy acyclovir increased in the bt 367 mbr1 and mbr2 146 and 343 respectively as well as mbr1 o3 39 3 the results for the water parameters can be found in the supplementary information s2 4 tables s22 s29 4 discussion 4 1 optimal ozone dose and hydraulic retention time 4 1 1 optimal ozone dose in line with previous research an additional ozonation of conventionally treated wastewater efficiently reduced the estrogenic activity völker et al 2019 the removal of estrogenicity increased with ozone dose and doses 0 44 g o3 g doc were most effective fig 2a supports hypothesis 1 interestingly we observed a marked increase of the anti estrogenic activity with higher ozone dosage falsifies hypothesis 1 a phenomenon that has been reported previously giebner et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2020 stalter et al 2011 one potential reason is the removal of estrogens masking the anti estrogenicity ihara et al 2014 leusch et al 2017 ma et al 2005 rao et al 2014 or the formation of anti estrogenic tps during ozonation compare hypothesis 2 knoop et al 2018 in contrast to previous studies that reported an effective removal of anti androgenic activity in biologically treated rao et al 2014 and ozonated stalter et al 2011 wastewater we detected a high anti androgenicity in the bt as well as the bt o3 samples fig 2b that was not fully removed by the applied ozone doses treatment with the highest dose 0 51 g o3 applied g doc led to a 35 1 reduction this indicated the presence of relatively stable anti androgenic substances itzel et al 2020 the ames ta100 was more suitable for detecting mutagenicity than the ames ta98 fig 2c again this is in line with previous research völker et al 2019 the mutagenicity ta100 increased at higher ozone doses indicating the formation of mutagenic tps higher mutagenicity in ozonated wastewater was previously reported chen et al 2017 giebner et al 2018 jia et al 2015 magdeburg et al 2014 these findings underline the importance of implementing ozonation post treatments 4 4 with regards to determining the optimal ozone dose it becomes obvious that a balance needs to be found between the removal of estrogenic and anti androgenic compounds on the one and the formation of anti estrogenic and mutagenic chemicals on the other side here a dose of 0 33 g o3 g doc might represent a good compromise 4 1 2 optimal hydraulic retention time the experiment with a high ozone dose and different hrts supports the results of the previous experiment the mean estrogenic activity was reduced in ozonated wastewater compared to the bt for all hrts fig 2d the anti estrogenic activity decreased at the lowest hrt but remained at the level of bt at higher hrts the results support the idea of a generation of anti estrogenic tps during ozonation because the estrogenic activity was on a comparable low level at all hrts again the anti androgenic activity was high in bt fig 2e and was reduced most at the shortest and longest hrt the lower removal in the intermediate hrts might be explained by anti androgenic tps hypothesis 2 the mutagenicity detected in the ames ta100 in the bt increased at particular longer hrts fig 2f this observation further substantiates the formation of mutagenic tps during ozonation hypothesis 2 4 2 in vivo effects in potamopyrgus antipodarum 4 2 1 growth and reproduction p antipodarum were larger when exposed to water from bt compared to the nc fig 3a which may be the result of a better nutrient supply in the bt containing additional organic matter furthermore a significantly lower shell height was detected in the mbr2 compared to the bt which may indicate a lower removal of general toxicity in mbr2 the reproduction of p antipodarum was increased in the bt and the pc fig 3b compared to the nc one reason for this could be a better nutrition compare above here several studies showed that gastropods with a better nutrient supply produced a higher number of eggs augusto et al 2012 keas and esch 1997 ter maat et al 2007 another reason might be the presence of residual endocrine disrupting substances duft et al 2007 stalter et al 2011 stange et al 2012 in wastewater the detected in vitro estrogenic activity in the bt fig 5a on the human estrogen receptor may tentatively point towards such chemicals the fecundity index fi ladewig et al 2006 schneider et al 2015 was used to further elaborate on these hypotheses the fi is calculated as the ratio of number of embryos and the shell height of each individual the fi of the pc and bt were not significantly higher compared to the nc fig s7 table s14 which illustrates that the mudsnails carried a normal number of embryos according to their size hence the higher number of embryos in the bt and the pt could not definitely be related to a higher shell height due to a better nutrient supply or to the detected estrogenic activity the reproduction decreased in snails exposed to ozonated wastewater bt o3 and to water from the post treatments gaca bfa as well as from mbr1 mbr1 o3 and mbr2 here the significantly decreased fi indicated a reproductive toxicity compared to the bt fig s7 table s14 the reproductive toxicity could be induced by unspecific toxicity of the ozonated wastewater and or toxic tps völker et al 2019 in a study by giebner et al 2018 the total number of embryos of p antipodarum also decreased after the awwt ozonation and activated carbon treatment the authors assumed that the decreased reproduction was caused by a general toxicity of the wastewater interestingly the reproductive toxicity in snails exposed to water from mbr2 implies that it does not remove toxicity as good as a conventional bt falsifies hypothesis 3 4 2 2 biomarkers for energy reserves glycogen protein and lipid content glycogen protein and lipid content have not been previously analysed in p antipodarum exposed to wastewater they are of interest because the energy content has an influence on reproduction of gastropods gust et al 2011 in the present study differences in biomarker sensitivity were observed in the order of lipid glycogen protein content after the exposure to the different wastewaters fig 4 gust et al 2011 reported that glycogen was the preferred energy invested in the reproduction of p antipodarum followed by lipids in this study exposure to differently treated wastewater did not affect the protein content but the glycogen content of the mudsnails exposed to water from gac this may indicate a better nutrition the lipid contents were reduced by exposure to water from bt and gaca for bt this does not support our hypothesis of a better nutrition for gaca this implies an energy depletion which might have been resulted in a lower reproduction in snails exposed to water from the bf the lipid content was increased but did not result in a higher reproduction the total energy content mirrors that picture because lipids are the dominant energy storage in p antipodarum 4 2 3 in vitro endocrine activity and mutagenicity the aqueous samples taken in parallel to the in vivo experiment did not induce any relevant estrogenic and anti androgenic activities in any sample fig s8 table s17 accordingly the removal capacity could not be evaluated for these two parameters in contrast high anti estrogenic and androgenic activities were detected in pt the androgenic activity was almost completely removed in the bt whereas the anti estrogenic activity was substantially reduced but remained on a relatively high level throughout all awwt technologies fig s8 table s17 hence the cleaning capacity of the bt seemed not sufficient in removing the latter which has been suggested in earlier studies on the present abbas et al 2019 and on other activated sludge treatments harth et al 2018 ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 tang et al 2014 regarding the 10 4 fold concentrated extracts the estrogenic activity in the bt was almost completely removed by ozonation fig 6 table s18 accordingly an additional removal by the post treatments could not be assessed in contrast the anti estrogenic activity increased markedly in bt o3 the bf and bfa did not reduce the anti estrogenic activity whereas gac and gaca were more effective one explanation might be that the activated carbon is better in adsorbing more polar ozonation tps than the more non polar bf ozonation led to a reduction of the anti androgenic activity but it remained on a relatively high level compared to previous reports gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2020 indicating an incomplete oxidative removal of anti androgenic compounds subsequent filtration incompletely reduced this activity whereby both gac filters were more effective than the bf this result was consistent with the result for the anti estrogenic activity compared to the bt the mbrs were much more effective in reducing estrogenic mbr1 and 2 and anti androgenic activity mbr1 whereas they release a much higher anti estrogenic activity an almost total reduction of estrogenic activity and simultaneous increase of anti estrogenic activity in the mbr1 o3 is consistent with the observation for the bt o3 compare above indicating an incomplete removal of substances with anti estrogenic activity the results of the ames test with the strain yg7108 fig 6 support previous hypotheses on mutagenic tps generated during ozonation bt o3 and mbr1 o3 interestingly water treated with bf was also mutagenic here the causes remain unknown again the gac treatments did not generate mutagenic activity these results again indicated a higher performance of the gac filters compared to the bfs 4 3 removal of micropollutants twenty eight micropollutants and twelve wastewater parameters were analysed in parallel to the on site experiment with p antipodarum to evaluate the performance of the awwt technologies the bt effectively reduced the cod doc nh4 n ptotal and sac254 these parameters were only minimally affected by ozonation except for the sac254 gac and bf achieved an additional reduction of the cod doc and sac254 whereby gac was more effective than bf tables s22 s29 the mbr systems decreased most of these parameters except for no3 n nh4 n and ptotal at comparable or higher effectivity than the bt mbr1 had a slightly higher effectivity than mbr2 which may have been the result of the recirculated ozonated wastewater from the mbr1 o3 generally the mbr1 o3 only showed a comparable sac254 or better cod doc no2 n removal than the bt o3 hypothesis 3 with a few exceptions the concentrations of 28 micropollutants and tps decreased with increasing treatment degree carboxy acyclovir was for instance found at higher concentration in the bt and mbrs compared to the pt because it is formed from acyclovir during biological treatment prasse et al 2012 ozonation decreases the concentration of carboxy acyclovir with an additional removal in the subsequent post treatments in general ozonation resulted in an additional removal of target compounds compared to the conventional treatment fig 7 with the exception of 3 hydroxy ibuprofen 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazol 4 nitro sulfmethoxazole carboxy ibuprofen caffeine paracetamol and mecoprop this is in line with a multitude of previous studies demonstrating the performance of ozone treatments in further reducing micropollutants prasse et al 2015 a post treatment with gac further reduced the concentrations of compounds detected after ozonation table s19 in most cases this reduction was to levels below the loq for both non aerated and aerated gac filtration this demonstrates that a combination of ozonation and activated carbon post treatments is very effective in removing micropollutants the two bf systems also reduced the concentrations of micropollutants further with no marked difference between non aerated and aerated bf they were however less effective in removing some compounds e g iopromide than the gac systems table s20 the mbr systems had a very similar performance in removing target chemicals like the conventional activated sludge treatment fig 7 this is in line with previous studies bertanza et al 2017 maletz et al 2013 the combination of an mbr with ozonation further improved the reduction of recalcitrant chemicals table s20 accordingly mbrs can be a suitable alternative for a conventional treatment in specific situations e g lack of space 4 4 what is the optimal wastewater treatment from an ecotoxicological point of view residual ecotoxicological effects and micropollutants were detected in the present full scale wwtp using an activated sludge treatment this highlights the need for alternative and or awwt treatment options and or optimisation of the activated sludge treatment here ozonation was effective in reducing the estrogenic activity but did not remove or even increased the anti estrogenic activity anti androgenic activity and mutagenicity we also observed a reduction in growth and reproduction of p antipodarum exposed on site to ozonated wastewater these findings support the idea that ozonation is effective in removing some specific toxicities while it generates toxic tps that induce other adverse effects völker et al 2019 hypothesis 2 accordingly a post treatment is needed to reduce these effects here gac filtration was more effective than the bfs in reducing the residual generated in vitro toxicity the same was true for some micropollutants no specific differences were observed for aerated versus non aerated systems as all post treatments were fed with the same wastewater we conclude that a gac post treatment is preferable to bf when improving the toxicity chemical removal of ozonated wastewater however other considerations e g energy demand available space carbon footprint need to be taken into account when deciding on a suitable post treatment mbr systems can be a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge processes bui et al 2016 in the present study mbr1 but not mbr2 had a similar removal performance for toxicity and micropollutants like the bt hypothesis 3 raw wastewater treated in mbr2 induced a marked reproductive toxicity in p antipodarum thus a combination with ozonation mbr1 might be preferable however the latter treatment generated a high mutagenicity which was removed by recirculating the ozonated water in the mbr accordingly a combination of mbr and ozonation technologies might represent a promising option for specific situations such as little available space for wwtp in urban settings 5 conclusions to determine optimal ozone doses and hrts maximum removal rates and generation of in vitro toxicity have to be balanced an ozone dose of 0 33 g o3 g doc and an hrt of 12 6 min seemed optimal while ozonation was effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutants it also formed toxic tps thus post treatment is needed activated carbon and biological post filtration further reduced most of the effect with gac being more effective than bf mbr systems as alternatives to an activated sludge treatment were similarly effective like the bt and even performed better e g removal of estrogenicity mbr o3 improved the removal performance but also generated mutagenicity the latter was reduced by recirculation to the mbr which might represent a promising option a significant anti estrogenic activity remained in all awwts which should be further investigated conventionally treated wastewater affected growth and reproduction of p antipodarum better nutrient supply or exposure of estrogenic chemicals ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic tps in the post treatments these effects were compensated or remained unaffected all mbr treatments induced reproductive toxicity ozonation of conventionally treated wastewater reduced micropollutants and improved wastewater parameters post treatment with gac bf resulted in an additional reduction mbrs were comparable to bt while mbr o3 was similarly effective like bt o3 for an optimised effect based assessment of wastewater quality of conventional and

17644,wastewater treatment plants are major point sources of micro pollutant emissions and advanced wastewater treatment technologies can improve their removal capacity while abundant data on individual advanced treatment technologies is available there is limited knowledge regarding the removal performance of ozonation combined with multiple post treatments and stand alone membrane bioreactors this is especially true for the removal of in vitro and in vivo toxicity therefore we investigated the removal of 40 micropollutants and toxicity by a pilot scale ozonation with four post treatments non aerated and aerated granular activated carbon and biological filtration in addition two stand alone membrane bioreactors fed with untreated wastewater and one mbr operating with ozonated partial flow recirculation were analysed aqueous and extracted samples were analysed in vitro for anti estrogenic anti androgenic and mutagenic effects to assess in vivo effects the mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum was exposed in an on site flow through system multiple in vitro effects were detected in conventionally treated wastewater including estrogenic and anti androgenic activity ozonation largely removed these effects while anti estrogenic and mutagenic effects increased suggesting the formation of toxic transformation products these effects were significantly reduced by granular activated carbon being more effective than biological filtration the membrane bioreactor performed similarly to the conventional treatment while the membrane bioreactor with ozonation had a comparable removal performance like ozonation conventionally treated wastewater increased the growth of p antipodarum ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic transformation products in the post treatments these effects were compensated or remained unaffected the effluents of the membrane bioreactors induced reproductive toxicity our results show that ozonation is effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutant concentrations however the formation of toxicity requires a post treatment here ozonation coupled to granular activated carbon

specific ozone consumption 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps are main entry points for the emission of chemicals to aquatic ecosystems including pollutants of emerging concern loos et al 2013 and micropollutants schwarzenbach et al 2006 wwtps are known to incompletely remove different micropollutants during conventional biological wastewater treatment such as using activated sludge reasons for this are low biodegradability and or high polarity of chemicals knopp et al 2016 certain micropollutants have been detected throughout the water cycle including nanogram per liter concentrations in drinking water benotti et al 2009 and have been characterised as relevant risk to ecosystem integrity and drinking water resources malaj et al 2014 chemical contamination resulted in the establishment of environmental quality standards eqs in many countries including their integration into different waste water policies e g european parliament and council 2008 2013 and the implementation of technical mitigation measures one major measure is the development and implementation of advanced wastewater treatment awwt technologies bui et al 2016 key awwt include advanced oxidation processes aops e g ozonation in combination with uv radiation activated carbon treatments e g granular activated carbon gac or powdered activated carbon pac or pressure driven membranes e g reverse osmosis these technologies demonstrated additional removal of micro pollutants from biologically treated wastewater however each technology has certain weaknesses such as the formation of potentially toxic transformation products tps during aop or an insufficient sorption of polar chemicals to activated carbon rizzo 2011 accordingly the addition of a post treatment i e filtration after ozonation and optimised parameter settings e g ozone o3 doses and hydraulic retention times hrts have been recommended völker et al 2019 the present study investigates an innovative process combination for the further reduction of relevant micro pollutants and toxicity the focus was the upgrade of a municipal wwtp with activated sludge treatment in hesse germany with a pilot scale ozonation in combination with subsequent non aerated and aerated gac biofilter bf fig 1 ozonation was chosen because the chemical oxidation induces a transformation of micro pollutants in the wastewater and thus increases the accessibility to and degradation in the biological treatment these transformation processes and the resulting tps can result in the formation of in vitro and in vivo toxicity völker et al 2019 therefore ozonation was combined with gac and biofilter as adsorptive techniques to reduce these effects this is novel because commonly gac filtration is used as a post treatment technology for activated sludge treatments but not in combination with other awwt technologies membrane bioreactors mbrs present a stand alone technology to treat raw wastewater such as hospital wastewater bui et al 2016 skouteris et al 2012 verlicchi et al 2010 the benefits of using mbrs are amongst others that a final sedimentation is not needed and that a higher solid content in the mbr results in smaller construction volumes and higher sludge ages that may positively affect micropollutant removal again little is known regarding their performance in reducing toxicity gehrmann et al 2018 maletzt et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 thus two mbrs fed with untreated wastewater one incorporating a partial flow recirculation of ozonated wastewater were examined fig 1 focusing on the combination of oxidation and biological treatment the aim was to test whether higher removal rates can be achieved with the lowest ozone concentration such an approach has not yet been investigated another benefit of the implementation of the recirculation concept was that it does not require an expansion of existing activated sludge treatment and thus lowers the operating costs as multiple awwt technologies and combinations thereof are available it is important to compare their performance in removing chemicals and toxicity so far most previous studies investigated only a single awwt technology often alone or less frequently in combination with one post treatment e g ozonation combined with sand filtration in addition most studies are performed at different wwtps complicating the comparison of technological performance and efficiency of multiple technologies studies comparing multiple process combinations at the same plant are rather scarce stalter et al 2010 völker et al 2016 however such studies are needed to assess the benefits of conventional and awwt technologies to evaluate the efficiency of awwt technologies chemical and ecotoxicological analysis are complementary because the former allows for determining the removal of priority compounds while the latter enables the assessment of toxicity removal caused by an overall mixture of chemicals cao et al 2009 this combination is particularly important because the removal of target compounds does not per se correlate to toxicity removal magdeburg et al 2014 case specific combinations of bioassays and chemical analyses were thus rated as gold standard ternes et al 2017 in the current study we used multiple in vitro bioassays and one in vivo bioassay with the new zealand mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum and quantified 28 representative micropollutants and twelve standard wastewater parameters the performance of a full scale conventional biological wastewater treatment bt combined with a subsequent pilot scale ozonation bt o3 followed by gac filtration or bf as well as two stand alone mbrs one mbr with partial flow ozonation mbr1 mbr1 o3 and mbr2 respectively were investigated the evaluation focused on the removal of target chemicals and toxicity compared to the activated sludge treatment o3 gac bf or raw wastewater mbrs in this context three hypotheses were tested 1 increasing the ozone dose and hrt increases the removal of micropollutants and in vitro toxicities 2 ozonation generates toxic tps that adversely affect different in vitro and or in vivo endpoints while a post treatment reduces these effects 3 the mbrs remove chemicals and toxicity with a performance comparable to an activated sludge treatment with a partial flow ozonation further increasing the performance the aim of this work was to compare the toxicity and micropollutant removal of the multiple combinations of awwt technologies implemented at the same wwtp and provide recommendations on which technologies perform best 2 material and methods 2 1 characterisation of the pilot wwtp with ozonation and post treatments the pilot plant investigated in this study received wastewater from a full scale wwtp in south

was conducted in parallel to the ecotoxicological investigations and included 28 micropollutants mainly belonging to the group of pharmaceuticals such as radio opaque substances anticonvulsants antibiotics including metabolites such as of carbamazepine diclofenac or ibuprofen as well as nutrition related chemicals caffeine herbicides mecoprop and industrial chemicals benzotriazole and tolyltriazole in the pt caffeine was detected at the highest concentration of 162 23 2 μg l followed by carboxy ibuprofen 74 7 6 27 μg l 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 47 3 4 97 μg l and 1h benzotriazole 25 0 0

caffeine and carboxy ibuprofen for nine chemicals the reduction was low 25 for carbamazepine and carboxy acyclovir a concentration increase was detected ozonation led to a further reduction of 21 substances ranging from 11 1 iopamidol and 99 1 carboxy acyclovir compared to the bt fig 7a table s19 the concentrations of 18 substances decreased by more than 50 for another three compounds the concentrations decreased by between 10 and 50 two tps 3 hydroxy ibuprofen and tramadol n oxide indicated higher concentrations in the bt o3 than in the bt the post treatments further reduced the concentrations of most target substances figs s9 and s10 tables s19 and s20 for certain compounds for which ozonation did not achieve a complete removal e g 3 hydroxy ibuprofen diclofenac sulfamethoxazole a post filtration led to an overall removal of 75 0 90 7 compared to the bt o3 for a small set of compounds 2 hydroxy ibuprofen 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole carboxy acyclovir paracetamol a moderate additional removal between 31 1 and 42 9 occurred in the gac filters and bfs compared to the bt o3 gac filters showed a higher removal rate for seven compounds including 1h benzotrialzole amidotrizoic acid iomeprole iopromide tolytriazole and tramadol n oxide compared to the bfs certain compounds such as caffeine or mecoprop could however not be further removed by the gac filters and bfs compared to the bt o3 mbr1 and mbr2 had slightly lower removal efficacies regarding the 28 chemicals than the bt figs 7b and s11 tables s20 s21 the ozonation increased the removal in the mbr1 with efficiencies comparable to the bt o3 however the concentration of carboxy acyclovir increased in the bt 367 mbr1 and mbr2 146 and 343 respectively as well as mbr1 o3 39 3 the results for the water parameters can be found in the supplementary information s2 4 tables s22 s29 4 discussion 4 1 optimal ozone dose and hydraulic retention time 4 1 1 optimal ozone dose in line with previous research an additional ozonation of conventionally treated wastewater efficiently reduced the estrogenic activity völker et al 2019 the removal of estrogenicity increased with ozone dose and doses 0 44 g o3 g doc were most effective fig 2a supports hypothesis 1 interestingly we observed a marked increase of the anti estrogenic activity with higher ozone dosage falsifies hypothesis 1 a phenomenon that has been reported previously giebner et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2020 stalter et al 2011 one potential reason is the removal of estrogens masking the anti estrogenicity ihara et al 2014 leusch et al 2017 ma et al 2005 rao et al 2014 or the formation of anti estrogenic tps during ozonation compare hypothesis 2 knoop et al 2018 in contrast to previous studies that reported an effective removal of anti androgenic activity in biologically treated rao et al 2014 and ozonated stalter et al 2011 wastewater we detected a high anti androgenicity in the bt as well as the bt o3 samples fig 2b that was not fully removed by the applied ozone doses treatment with the highest dose 0 51 g o3 applied g doc led to a 35 1 reduction this indicated the presence of relatively stable anti androgenic substances itzel et al 2020 the ames ta100 was more suitable for detecting mutagenicity than the ames ta98 fig 2c again this is in line with previous research völker et al 2019 the mutagenicity ta100 increased at higher ozone doses indicating the formation of mutagenic tps higher mutagenicity in ozonated wastewater was previously reported chen et al 2017 giebner et al 2018 jia et al 2015 magdeburg et al 2014 these findings underline the importance of implementing ozonation post treatments 4 4 with regards to determining the optimal ozone dose it becomes obvious that a balance needs to be found between the removal of estrogenic and anti androgenic compounds on the one and the formation of anti estrogenic and mutagenic chemicals on the other side here a dose of 0 33 g o3 g doc might represent a good compromise 4 1 2 optimal hydraulic retention time the experiment with a high ozone dose and different hrts supports the results of the previous experiment the mean estrogenic activity was reduced in ozonated wastewater compared to the bt for all hrts fig 2d the anti estrogenic activity decreased at the lowest hrt but remained at the level of bt at higher hrts the results support the idea of a generation of anti estrogenic tps during ozonation because the estrogenic activity was on a comparable low level at all hrts again the anti androgenic activity was high in bt fig 2e and was reduced most at the shortest and longest hrt the lower removal in the intermediate hrts might be explained by anti androgenic tps hypothesis 2 the mutagenicity detected in the ames ta100 in the bt increased at particular longer hrts fig 2f this observation further substantiates the formation of mutagenic tps during ozonation hypothesis 2 4 2 in vivo effects in potamopyrgus antipodarum 4 2 1 growth and reproduction p antipodarum were larger when exposed to water from bt compared to the nc fig 3a which may be the result of a better nutrient supply in the bt containing additional organic matter furthermore a significantly lower shell height was detected in the mbr2 compared to the bt which may indicate a lower removal of general toxicity in mbr2 the reproduction of p antipodarum was increased in the bt and the pc fig 3b compared to the nc one reason for this could be a better nutrition compare above here several studies showed that gastropods with a better nutrient supply produced a higher number of eggs augusto et al 2012 keas and esch 1997 ter maat et al 2007 another reason might be the presence of residual endocrine disrupting substances duft et al 2007 stalter et al 2011 stange et al 2012 in wastewater the detected in vitro estrogenic activity in the bt fig 5a on the human estrogen receptor may tentatively point towards such chemicals the fecundity index fi ladewig et al 2006 schneider et al 2015 was used to further elaborate on these hypotheses the fi is calculated as the ratio of number of embryos and the shell height of each individual the fi of the pc and bt were not significantly higher compared to the nc fig s7 table s14 which illustrates that the mudsnails carried a normal number of embryos according to their size hence the higher number of embryos in the bt and the pt could not definitely be related to a higher shell height due to a better nutrient supply or to the detected estrogenic activity the reproduction decreased in snails exposed to ozonated wastewater bt o3 and to water from the post treatments gaca bfa as well as from mbr1 mbr1 o3 and mbr2 here the significantly decreased fi indicated a reproductive toxicity compared to the bt fig s7 table s14 the reproductive toxicity could be induced by unspecific toxicity of the ozonated wastewater and or toxic tps völker et al 2019 in a study by giebner et al 2018 the total number of embryos of p antipodarum also decreased after the awwt ozonation and activated carbon treatment the authors assumed that the decreased reproduction was caused by a general toxicity of the wastewater interestingly the reproductive toxicity in snails exposed to water from mbr2 implies that it does not remove toxicity as good as a conventional bt falsifies hypothesis 3 4 2 2 biomarkers for energy reserves glycogen protein and lipid content glycogen protein and lipid content have not been previously analysed in p antipodarum exposed to wastewater they are of interest because the energy content has an influence on reproduction of gastropods gust et al 2011 in the present study differences in biomarker sensitivity were observed in the order of lipid glycogen protein content after the exposure to the different wastewaters fig 4 gust et al 2011 reported that glycogen was the preferred energy invested in the reproduction of p antipodarum followed by lipids in this study exposure to differently treated wastewater did not affect the protein content but the glycogen content of the mudsnails exposed to water from gac this may indicate a better nutrition the lipid contents were reduced by exposure to water from bt and gaca for bt this does not support our hypothesis of a better nutrition for gaca this implies an energy depletion which might have been resulted in a lower reproduction in snails exposed to water from the bf the lipid content was increased but did not result in a higher reproduction the total energy content mirrors that picture because lipids are the dominant energy storage in p antipodarum 4 2 3 in vitro endocrine activity and mutagenicity the aqueous samples taken in parallel to the in vivo experiment did not induce any relevant estrogenic and anti androgenic activities in any sample fig s8 table s17 accordingly the removal capacity could not be evaluated for these two parameters in contrast high anti estrogenic and androgenic activities were detected in pt the androgenic activity was almost completely removed in the bt whereas the anti estrogenic activity was substantially reduced but remained on a relatively high level throughout all awwt technologies fig s8 table s17 hence the cleaning capacity of the bt seemed not sufficient in removing the latter which has been suggested in earlier studies on the present abbas et al 2019 and on other activated sludge treatments harth et al 2018 ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 tang et al 2014 regarding the 10 4 fold concentrated extracts the estrogenic activity in the bt was almost completely removed by ozonation fig 6 table s18 accordingly an additional removal by the post treatments could not be assessed in contrast the anti estrogenic activity increased markedly in bt o3 the bf and bfa did not reduce the anti estrogenic activity whereas gac and gaca were more effective one explanation might be that the activated carbon is better in adsorbing more polar ozonation tps than the more non polar bf ozonation led to a reduction of the anti androgenic activity but it remained on a relatively high level compared to previous reports gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2020 indicating an incomplete oxidative removal of anti androgenic compounds subsequent filtration incompletely reduced this activity whereby both gac filters were more effective than the bf this result was consistent with the result for the anti estrogenic activity compared to the bt the mbrs were much more effective in reducing estrogenic mbr1 and 2 and anti androgenic activity mbr1 whereas they release a much higher anti estrogenic activity an almost total reduction of estrogenic activity and simultaneous increase of anti estrogenic activity in the mbr1 o3 is consistent with the observation for the bt o3 compare above indicating an incomplete removal of substances with anti estrogenic activity the results of the ames test with the strain yg7108 fig 6 support previous hypotheses on mutagenic tps generated during ozonation bt o3 and mbr1 o3 interestingly water treated with bf was also mutagenic here the causes remain unknown again the gac treatments did not generate mutagenic activity these results again indicated a higher performance of the gac filters compared to the bfs 4 3 removal of micropollutants twenty eight micropollutants and twelve wastewater parameters were analysed in parallel to the on site experiment with p antipodarum to evaluate the performance of the awwt technologies the bt effectively reduced the cod doc nh4 n ptotal and sac254 these parameters were only minimally affected by ozonation except for the sac254 gac and bf achieved an additional reduction of the cod doc and sac254 whereby gac was more effective than bf tables s22 s29 the mbr systems decreased most of these parameters except for no3 n nh4 n and ptotal at comparable or higher effectivity than the bt mbr1 had a slightly higher effectivity than mbr2 which may have been the result of the recirculated ozonated wastewater from the mbr1 o3 generally the mbr1 o3 only showed a comparable sac254 or better cod doc no2 n removal than the bt o3 hypothesis 3 with a few exceptions the concentrations of 28 micropollutants and tps decreased with increasing treatment degree carboxy acyclovir was for instance found at higher concentration in the bt and mbrs compared to the pt because it is formed from acyclovir during biological treatment prasse et al 2012 ozonation decreases the concentration of carboxy acyclovir with an additional removal in the subsequent post treatments in general ozonation resulted in an additional removal of target compounds compared to the conventional treatment fig 7 with the exception of 3 hydroxy ibuprofen 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazol 4 nitro sulfmethoxazole carboxy ibuprofen caffeine paracetamol and mecoprop this is in line with a multitude of previous studies demonstrating the performance of ozone treatments in further reducing micropollutants prasse et al 2015 a post treatment with gac further reduced the concentrations of compounds detected after ozonation table s19 in most cases this reduction was to levels below the loq for both non aerated and aerated gac filtration this demonstrates that a combination of ozonation and activated carbon post treatments is very effective in removing micropollutants the two bf systems also reduced the concentrations of micropollutants further with no marked difference between non aerated and aerated bf they were however less effective in removing some compounds e g iopromide than the gac systems table s20 the mbr systems had a very similar performance in removing target chemicals like the conventional activated sludge treatment fig 7 this is in line with previous studies bertanza et al 2017 maletz et al 2013 the combination of an mbr with ozonation further improved the reduction of recalcitrant chemicals table s20 accordingly mbrs can be a suitable alternative for a conventional treatment in specific situations e g lack of space 4 4 what is the optimal wastewater treatment from an ecotoxicological point of view residual ecotoxicological effects and micropollutants were detected in the present full scale wwtp using an activated sludge treatment this highlights the need for alternative and or awwt treatment options and or optimisation of the activated sludge treatment here ozonation was effective in reducing the estrogenic activity but did not remove or even increased the anti estrogenic activity anti androgenic activity and mutagenicity we also observed a reduction in growth and reproduction of p antipodarum exposed on site to ozonated wastewater these findings support the idea that ozonation is effective in removing some specific toxicities while it generates toxic tps that induce other adverse effects völker et al 2019 hypothesis 2 accordingly a post treatment is needed to reduce these effects here gac filtration was more effective than the bfs in reducing the residual generated in vitro toxicity the same was true for some micropollutants no specific differences were observed for aerated versus non aerated systems as all post treatments were fed with the same wastewater we conclude that a gac post treatment is preferable to bf when improving the toxicity chemical removal of ozonated wastewater however other considerations e g energy demand available space carbon footprint need to be taken into account when deciding on a suitable post treatment mbr systems can be a promising alternative to conventional activated sludge processes bui et al 2016 in the present study mbr1 but not mbr2 had a similar removal performance for toxicity and micropollutants like the bt hypothesis 3 raw wastewater treated in mbr2 induced a marked reproductive toxicity in p antipodarum thus a combination with ozonation mbr1 might be preferable however the latter treatment generated a high mutagenicity which was removed by recirculating the ozonated water in the mbr accordingly a combination of mbr and ozonation technologies might represent a promising option for specific situations such as little available space for wwtp in urban settings 5 conclusions to determine optimal ozone doses and hrts maximum removal rates and generation of in vitro toxicity have to be balanced an ozone dose of 0 33 g o3 g doc and an hrt of 12 6 min seemed optimal while ozonation was effective in further reducing toxicity and micropollutants it also formed toxic tps thus post treatment is needed activated carbon and biological post filtration further reduced most of the effect with gac being more effective than bf mbr systems as alternatives to an activated sludge treatment were similarly effective like the bt and even performed better e g removal of estrogenicity mbr o3 improved the removal performance but also generated mutagenicity the latter was reduced by recirculation to the mbr which might represent a promising option a significant anti estrogenic activity remained in all awwts which should be further investigated conventionally treated wastewater affected growth and reproduction of p antipodarum better nutrient supply or exposure of estrogenic chemicals ozonation reduced the reproduction indicating a potential formation of toxic tps in the post treatments these effects were compensated or remained unaffected all mbr treatments induced reproductive toxicity ozonation of conventionally treated wastewater reduced micropollutants and improved wastewater parameters post treatment with gac bf resulted in an additional reduction mbrs were comparable to bt while mbr o3 was similarly effective like bt o3 for an optimised effect based assessment of wastewater quality of conventional and
