5395,allochthonous inputs of species and nutrients and hydrodynamic disturbance induced by water diversion projects are two critical factors of ecohydrological effects in eutrophic lakes however identification and quantification of potential contributions of allochthonous inputs and physicochemical habitat shifts to variations in phytoplankton communities remain challenging the present study addresses this issue with a study of the water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu in china to explore the effects and contributions of seasonal water diversion activities on lacustrine phytoplankton communities the comparative analysis was conducted to compare the biotic and abiotic variables between the water diversion and non diversion periods in different seasons the results showed that seasonal water diversion activities in addition to significantly reducing organic pollutant concentrations definitely increased the average concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in the gonghu bay compared with the results in the gonghu bay on the non diversion days phytoplankton diversities increased and the community compositions were altered with the bacillariophyta species and non microcystis cyanophyta species dominating in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons the venn diagram analysis showed that the highest potential contribution of the allochthonous species to the increase in phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days was about 15 8 the physicochemical habitat disturbance induced by the water diversion contributed about 12 to 31 3 of the phytoplankton diversity and 23 3 to 31 3 of the phytoplankton community variations in the gonghu bay the allochthonous phytoplankton species may contribute directly to the lacustrine phytoplankton community variations however due to the high loads of nutrients from inflow rivers positive effects of water diversion shaping the phytoplankton communities were always short term pollutant control and multi objective operation considering flood control water supply and water environment improvement are indispensable for the long term management of water diversion projects keywords water diversion allochthonous input physicochemical habitat phytoplankton lake taihu 1 introduction lakes not only provide water resources and eco services for the human society but also reflect regional ecological health of the aquatic ecosystems scheffer 1997 due to the influences of anthropogenic activities ali et al 2019 and climate change the limnetic eutrophication process accelerates this brings about a series of ecological problems such as cyanobacterial blooms vegetation degradation and diversity reduction and threatens the water supply function and ecological balance of lakes paerl et al 2016 to cope with the harmful cyanobacterial blooms and restore lake ecosystems many countermeasures including mechanical salvage phytoremediation and fish predation cooke et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2007 qin 2009 and various engineering measures such as water diversion and ecological dredging hu et al 2008 lürling and faassen 2012 have and continue to be attempted among these measures water diversion from rivers to lakes has received significant interest from scientists and lake basin administrations because of the rapidity and effectiveness with which it relieves the cyanobacterial blooms it has also become a popular and quick measure to improve water quality and to prevent or mitigate the ecological deterioration of many lakes including lake green in usa oglebsy 1969 lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake moses in usa welch et al 1992 lake tega in japan amano et al 2010 lake xuanwu in china song et al 2018 and lake xihu in china zhang et al 2018 among others due to the ecological and drinking water crisis induced by harmful cyanobacterial blooms in large eutrophic lakes in china such as lake taihu lake hongze lake chaohu and lake dianchi water diversion projects have become a very commonly used engineering measure for alleviating water crisis in such lakes the ecohydrological effects of water diversion projects on large eutrophic lakes have also been attracting significant attention in recent years dai et al 2016 dai et al 2018 hu et al 2008 huang et al 2015 2016 li et al 2011 2013 liu et al 2014 yu et al 2018 much of the research in this area has focused on the hydrodynamic and environmental effects such as the effects on water level hu et al 2008 water age huang et al 2016 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 flow field hu et al 2008 li et al 2013 water quality dai et al 2016 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2014 and ecological health based on water quality zhai et al 2010 only a few studies have addressed the issues related to the biological effects of water diversion in large eutrophic lakes huang et al 2015 lin et al 2017 as an abundant and active biota in lakes phytoplankton are significantly sensitive to the lake conditions such as the trophic level and the hydrodynamic disturbance schwalb et al 2013 yang et al 2016 conversely the phytoplankton community structure can also reflect the environmental changes and can be considered as a suitable index to represent the evolution of aquatic ecosystems induced by external disturbance yang et al 2017 such as the disturbance by water diversion the ecohydrological effects of water diversion on lakes are mainly related to three main factors hydrodynamic disturbance of the inflow discharge allochthonous nutrient input and allochthonous biological species the inflow discharges could shorten the lake residence time li et al 2011 2013 and alter the lake currents which can influence the transportation transformation and distribution of nutrients and biological communities of some small lakes oglebsy 1969 jagtman et al 1992 welch et al 1992 hosper 1998 amano et al 2010 however for large eutrophic lakes the residence time is generally very long and only a limited inflow discharge of any water diversion cannot significantly shorten the lake residence time for instance for lake taihu the residence time is almost always longer than 200 days and an inflow discharge lower than 150 m3 s does not have much influence on the lake residence time li et al 2011 since the upstream rivers that divert water to lakes generally have great nutrient loads the allochthonous nutrients from the upstream rivers will play a more important role in structuring phytoplankton communities in lakes by considering the rapid in situ growth of the phytoplankton in eutrophic waters swarbrick et al 2019 moreover allochthonous phytoplankton species from rivers could also directly affect the phytoplankton communities in lakes in china there are often concerns regarding the ecohydrological effects of high allochthonous nutrient inputs induced by water diversion projects however to what extent the allochthonous inputs from water diversion projects contribute to variations in the phytoplankton communities remains unknown lake taihu is the third largest shallow eutrophic lake in china and is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river to cope with the frequent cyanobacterial blooms of lake taihu and meet the water demands of the taihu basin water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu wdyt was initiated in 2002 and has been operated regularly from 2007 qin et al 2019 the taihu basin authority tba has been responsible for the regulation of the wdyt project and has formulated the dispatching rule according to the average real time water level of lake taihu normally when the average real time water level of lake taihu is lower than the dispatching control water level the wangyu river will input allochthonous water from the yangtze river and then divert it into lake taihu through the wangyu river after the water quality of the wangyu river reaches or precedes the third level of surface water quality standards in china many past studies have demonstrated that the seasonal water diversion activities of the wdyt could improve the hydro environment of lake taihu but also increase the loading of nutrients such as the nitrate and total phosphorus in some regions dai et al 2018 hu et al 2008 2010 however only a few studies have addressed the influence of the physicochemical habitat variations induced by the seasonal water diversion activities on phytoplankton communities in the water receiving regions of lake taihu this provides the motivation for the present study in this study we consider the wdyt project as an example to investigate the phytoplankton communities and physicochemical parameters in the water receiving regions of lake taihu and to compare the biotic and abiotic variables between the water diversion and non diversion periods in different seasons for the latter we use the sourcing and multivariate statistical analysis based on these we examine three issues 1 responses of the lacustrine phytoplankton communities and physicochemical habitat to short term water diversion in different seasons 2 relationships between the physicochemical habitat shifts induced by water diversion and phytoplankton communities and 3 contributions of the allochthonous phytoplankton species and physicochemical habitat disturbance to lacustrine phytoplankton communities during the water diversion periods the outcomes of this study could help elucidate the positive and negative effects of water diversion on the cyanobacterial blooms in the large eutrophic lake taihu they could consequently provide useful hints to understand the short term ecohydrological effects of water diversion on large eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites a schematic diagram of the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 1 lake taihu is the geographic and hysteresis storage center of water resources for the taihu basin the wangyu river is one of the main water diversion channels of the wdyt and directly connects the yangtze river and lake taihu fig 2 the changshu and wangting hydro junctions are the two main operating sections regulating the importation of the yangtze river water and the inflow discharges into the gonghu bay from the wangyu river respectively gonghu bay is located in the northeastern part of lake taihu which covers an area of 150 km2 and has the multi year average water depth of 1 8 m zhong et al 2012 fig 2 the southwestern part of the gonghu bay connects the lake center and the meiliang bay which is the largest and hypereutrophic bay of lake taihu since 2005 large quantities of cyanobacterial blooms have begun to cover most water areas of the gonghu bay with a significant increase in 2007 qin et al 2010 in recent years with the improvement of water quality in the gonghu bay contributed by the integrated management of the whole basin gonghu bay has become one of the main drinking water sources for wuxi city and suzhou city in the taihu basin for the data considered in this study the sampling sites were located in the wangyu river sites r1 r3 gonghu bay sites a1 e1 a2 e2 and a3 e3 and the lake center sites l1 l3 of lake taihu fig 2 the sites r1 r3 were located in the upstream of the wangting hydro junction to investigate the inflow water characteristics the layout of the sites in the gonghu bay intended to investigate the gradients of the physicochemical and biological parameters from the wangyu river mouth to the lake center during the water diversion periods since the lake center is adjacent and open to the gonghu bay there are exchanges of hydraulics nutrients and phytoplankton species between the gonghu bay and the lake center the lake center is less influenced by water diversion than the gonghu bay the intention of laying the sampling sites in the lake center is to elucidate the potential contribution to the phytoplankton community variations in the gonghu bay the wangyu river and the lake center were the two adjacent regions to the gonghu bay to elucidate the potential contribution of the wangyu river we should also know the potential contribution of the lake center in lake regions the sampling sites were located with the same distance of 2 km between the two adjacent sites 2 2 sample collection and measurement of abiotic variables in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river january april august and november are always taken as the representative months for winter spring summer and autumn respectively according to the dispatching operation of the wdyt in 2013 2014 and 2015 august in 2013 and january and november in both 2014 and 2015 were all in the water diversion periods other months were all in the non diversion periods a 2 l of surface water sample 50 cm under water surface from each sampling site was collected on the middle day of each selected month during 2013 2015 table 1 of this 2 l water sample 1 l was fixed using 15 ml 1 mass concentration of lugol s iodine fixing reagent for identification of the phytoplankton community the water samples collected for each site were stored in the sterile plastic bottle and transported to the laboratory for analysis within 24 h the sampling time began at 9 00 on each day the data of inflow discharges of the wangyu river and the water level of lake taihu during the sampling days were collected from the annual reports of the wdyt project in 2013 2014 and 2015 tba 2013 2014 2015 wind direction and speed in each sampling site were measured in situ using the hand held anemometer nk 4500 kestrel nk

phosphorus tp ammonia nh3 n nitrate no3 n soluble reactive phosphorus srp permanganate index codmn dissolved silicate sio3 si and chlorophyll a chl a were all determined in the laboratory according to the method used by jin and tu 1990 2 3 identification of phytoplankton communities the 1 l lugol s iodine reagent fixed water sample for each site was transferred into a separating funnel after stewing for 24 h the 50 ml precipitated bottom sample was collected to store in the sterile glass bottle and kept in a dark place until the beginning of the phytoplankton identification jin and tu 1990 a 0 1 ml of the concentrated sample was injected into the algae counting box and put in the optical microscope axiovert 200 carl zeiss jena germany to uniformly capture 100 random views these random views were used to identify the phytoplankton species and to count the cell numbers with the help of the t300 algae smart identification software shineso hangzhou china this procedure was repeated three times for each sample the identification of the phytoplankton species was done according to the method used by hu and wei 2006 2 4 statistical analyses the phytoplankton diversity indexes of the species number and the shannon wiener index h for each sample were calculated using the primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand the differences in the physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton diversity indexes in the gonghu bay between the water diversion and non diversion periods were compared with the one way anova method using the spss 16 0 statistic software ibm armonk usa the venn diagram plotted using the vennpainter software lin et al 2016 was adopted to determine the potential contribution of allochthonous phytoplankton species of the wangyu river to that of the gonghu bay the gradients in the average relative proportions of the phytoplankton community composition from the wangyu river sites a1 a3 to the lake center sites l1 l3 were plotted using the sigmaplot 12 5 software systat software inc london uk the similarities between the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay among the same seasons in the three years 2013 2014 and 2015 were analyzed by the analysis of similarities anosim method fanini and lowry 2016 and plotted using the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds method with the primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand for the nmds analysis the matrix data constructed using the genera cell numbers of all samples were first log10 x 1 transformed and then reassembled using the bray curtis similarity index redundancy analysis rda was carried out to reveal the correlations and contributions of the investigated physicochemical parameters to lacustrine phytoplankton communities by using the canoco 5 software lai 2013 the significance p 0 05 of the calculated results was verified with an unrestricted monte carlo permutation 3 results 3 1 physicochemical parameters during the sampling days there was no rain in the sampling regions and most of the wind speeds on the lake surface were lower than 4 m s the cumulative inflow during the water diversion period in winter until the sampling day was higher than the annual average water storage of the gonghu bay about 2 70 108 m3 while that in the summer and autumn diversion periods until the sampling day were lower table 1 the average inflow 111 5 m3 s during the summer water diversion period was higher than that during the winter 85 4 and 73 5 m3 s and fall 41 6 and 58 8 m3 s water diversion periods significant differences in the concentrations of ph sio3 si tn no3 n tp and codmn were found between the diversion period and non diversion period in each season respectively one way anova p 0 05 fig 3 since there were significant differences in the physicochemical parameters between the wangyu river and the center of lake taihu water diversion activities in different seasons significantly decreased the values of ph and codmn and increased the contents of sio3 si tn no3 n and tp 3 2 phytoplankton diversities and overlaps of genera among three regions on water diversion days the average diversities in the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on different sampling days were respectively all significantly higher than those in the lake center fig 4 one way anova p 0 05 for the gonghu bay in the same season of different years the two diversity indexes i e phytoplankton species number and the shannon wiener index on the water diversion days were significantly higher than those on the non diversion days except for the diversities in january fig 4a and 4b one way anova p 0 05 whether between the diversion days or between the non diversion days there was also no significant divergence in both the two diversity indexes in this study fig 4 one way anova p 0 05 the unique genera only found in the gonghu bay accounted for 17 4 fig 5 a 12 fig 5b 23 1 fig 5c 15 8 fig 5d and 31 3 fig 5e of the total phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day in january of 2014 january of 2015 august of 2013 november of 2014 and november of 2015 respectively moreover the common genera only found between the wangyu river and gonghu bay on the water diversion days showed that the allochthonous genera from the wangyu river potentially accounted for 0 8 3 7 7 15 8 and 0 of the total phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the above mentioned water diversion days respectively the genera only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons were affiliated with the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta chrysophyta and xanthophyta however all of the relative proportions in the cell abundances of these genera were lower than 1 0 table 2 none of these was the dominant genera in the gonghu bay during the water diversion days there were several genera such as westella spp phacus spp arthrospira spp golenkinia spp neidium spp ankistrodsemus spp and synura spp overlapped only between the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons in january and november the relative proportions of aulacoseira granulate cyclotella spp and synedra spp in the wangyu river were evidently higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days and non diversion days respectively table 2 in august the arthrospira spp 46 7 and planktothrix spp 40 2 were the dominant bacillariophyta genera in the wangyu river which were significantly higher in relative proportions than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days and non diversion days respectively table 2 3 3 phytoplankton abundances and community compositions the spatial variations in the total phytoplankton cell abundances and community compositions on each sampling day are shown in fig 6 there were eight phytoplankton phyla recovered on the sampling days in different seasons including the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta pyrrophyta chrysophyta and the xanthophyta in january the average values of the total phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay on the non diversion day fig 6a were significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days fig 6b and c one way anova p 0 05 the bacillariophyta dominated in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days fig 6b and c whereas the cyanophyta was more abundant on the non diversion day fig 6a in april the cyanophyta predominated in the gonghu bay and the lake center on all the sampling days fig 6d 6e and 6f in august the average phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day in 2013 fig 6g and on the non diversion day in 2015 fig 6i were significantly lower than those on the non diversion day in 2014 fig 6h one way anova p 0 05 on both the water diversion and the non diversion days the cyanophyta predominated in all the three sampling regions fig 6g h and i for november there was no significant divergence in the total phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay among the three sampling days fig 6j k and l one way anova p 0 05 on the non diversion day in 2013 the average relative proportions of the bacillariophyta in the gonghu bay fig 6j were significantly lower than those on the two water diversion days in 2014 and 2015 fig 6k and l one way anova p 0 05 although the cyanophyta predominated in the water regions studied during both diversion and non diversion periods in august the dominant cyanophyta genera in the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on the water diversion day were different from those on the non diversion days fig s1 the planktothrix spp merismopedia spp and arthrospira spp were dominant in the wangyu river and in most of the regions in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day fig s1a while the microcystis spp was the absolute dominant genus in the three water regions studied during the non diversion days in summer fig s1b and c according to the nmds and anosim results there were significant differences in the phytoplankton community structures of the gonghu bay among the water diversion and non diversion days in each season fig 7 a b and c except for the comparison between the community structures in november 2013 and 2014 fig 7d however for january and august the r values of the anosim between the water diversion and non diversion days were relatively higher than those between the non diversion days in each season fig 7a and c 3 4 correlations between physicochemical habitats and phytoplankton communities in january the values of water temperature tn nh3 n and srp were significantly correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay fig s2a in august the ph tn water temperature and silicate were the significant physicochemical parameters correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay fig s2b as for november the values of water temperature tn srp ph and no3 n were significantly correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities of gonghu bay among the three sampling days fig s2c the physicochemical parameters studied herein explained 39 8 37 2 and 46 7 of the variances in the phytoplankton communities for the water diversion and non diversion days in january august and november respectively fig 8 a 8b and 8c the physicochemical parameters sensitive to the water diversion explained 23 3 fig 8a 24 5 fig 8b and 31 3 fig 8c of the variances in the phytoplankton communities in january august and november respectively 4 discussion 4 1 responses of phytoplankton diversity to wdyt in different seasons the lacustrine phytoplankton diversity as an important ecological indicator in lakes is sensitive to water diversion in different seasons see fig 4 the effects of water diversion on the phytoplankton diversity in lacustrine ecosystems has been reported in many previous studies fornarelli et al 2013 lin et al 2003 wang 2008 jiang 2013 most of these studies have observed an increase in the diversity in water receiving aquatic ecosystems lin et al 2003 wang 2008 jiang 2013 our study has also revealed that the phytoplankton diversity on the water diversion days was higher than that on the non diversion days in august and november see fig 4 however fornarelli et al 2013 reported significant positive correlations between the diversity indexes shannon weaver index and evenness of phytoplankton and the retention time in a reservoir influenced by inter basin water transfers this finding suggests that the increase in diversity induced by water diversion might be reasonable in the context of appropriate retention time the allochthonous species and physicochemical habitat variation are often regarded as the two critical contributors to variations in phytoplankton communities in freshwater ecosystems dai et al 2018 paerl et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the phytoplankton species only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were the main contributors to the increase in diversity induced by water diversion in different seasons see fig 4 and table 2 this result revealed that the variations in physicochemical habitat of the gonghu bay contributed more to the phytoplankton diversity increase on the water diversion days the lacustrine habitat disturbed by the water diversion was mainly reflected in the variations in the hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions since wdyt has been found to mainly influence the water age and circulate flow field in the gonghu bay under limited inflow discharges li et al 2011 lv 2013 the horizontal and vertical water exchange in the gonghu bay may be the dominant factor shaping the phytoplankton communities during the water diversion periods this was supported by the observation that most of the phytoplankton genera only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were affiliated with the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta see table 2 compared with the cyanophyta species most of the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta species have faster growth rates and are more adaptive to the turbulent flowing environment istvánovics and honti 2012 moreover the decrease in organic pollutants and increase in active silicate and nutrients during the water diversion periods can also provide beneficial physicochemical conditions for some of the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta species rao et al 2018 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however the phytoplankton species only found in the gonghu bay were not dominant i e most of them with relative proportions lower than 1 during the water diversion days in different seasons see table 2 which revealed that these species might be rare ones originally survived in lake taihu when the environmental conditions vary during the water diversion periods the cell abundances of these rare species will increase to the detectable level for microscopic counting additionally in january there was no pronounced difference in diversity among the three sampling days see fig 4 which was ascribed to the fact that the sampling day on the non diversion period was 10 days after the previous water diversion period tba 2013 and the influence of the previous water diversion on diversity may have remained to some extent 4 2 impacts of wdyt on lacustrine phytoplankton abundances and communities the efficacy of water diversion in reducing the phytoplankton cell abundance and primary productivity has been reported for some lakes such as lake green oglebsy 1969 and lake moses welch et al 1992 in the state of washington usa and lake nanhu in changchun city china wang 2008 the lower phytoplankton cell abundance especially of the microcystis spp in the turbulent flowing water environment of rivers is the main reason huisman et al 2004 li et al 2013 the water mixing of the wangyu river and the gonghu bay directly diluted the phytoplankton cell abundance in the gonghu bay in this study the planktonic cell abundances in the wangyu river were always lower than those in the lake regions in different seasons see fig 6 on the other hand it is also important to note that water diversion enhances the turbulent diffusivity of water receiving regions which could promote the vertical mixing of planktonic cells huisman et al 2004 since the buoyant microcystis spp is not well adaptable to the turbulent mixing environment paerl et al 2011 reynolds et al 1994 the proliferation of the microcystis spp could be precluded to reduce the phytoplankton cell abundance in the water receiving lake region the phytoplankton community composition is another index representing the planktonic response to biotic and abiotic disturbances ko et al 2017 yang et al 2017 due to the influences of climate warming and anthropogenic activities in the eutrophic lake taihu the microcystis spp predominated the northern regions for over ten months per year ma et al 2016 the stronger adaptation to water temperature and sufficient nutrients in lake taihu create opportunities for forming frequent microcystis blooms almost throughout the year qin et al 2018 in this study water diversions in different seasons were all found to be capable of decreasing the relative proportions of the microcystis spp and increasing the proportions of the other phyla e g bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in most regions of the gonghu bay see fig 6 and fig s1 this phenomenon i e shaping the phytoplankton communities of lakes by water diversion has also been reported for other eutrophic lakes such as lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake nanhu in china wang 2008 and lake tega in japan amano et al 2010 however in the case of lake taihu and under conditions of only limited inflow discharges i e average 90 m3 s during water diversion periods in the last 10 years tba 2015 this ecological effect was just limited to the gonghu bay and the lake center was marginally influenced by the water diversion however on the protection of the drinking water source in the gonghu bay the ecological effect has been found to be positive qin et al 2010 since many phytoplankton species have only a short life cycle period i e several days and are sensitive to physicochemical conditions e g the microcystis spp scenedesmus spp and cyclotella spp reynolds 2006 variations in the physicochemical habitat are the critical impetus to drive the succession of the phytoplankton communities in freshwater lakes li et al 2019 in the present study the physicochemical parameters studied in the gonghu bay explained about 40 of the variations in the phytoplankton communities among the water diversion and non diversion days in each season see fig 8 the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay were explained about 23 3 to 31 3 by the physicochemical habitat shifts induced by water diversion in different seasons see fig 8 as for november and january the dominant bacillariophyta in the gonghu bay can be partially explained by the increase in active silicate concentrations on the water diversion days zhang et al 2018 for august however the increase in the other cyanophyta species abundances except for the microcystis spp can be mainly attributed to the input of the allochthonous species from the wangyu river most of the variations i e about 60 in the phytoplankton communities between the water diversion days and the non diversion days cannot be explained by the variations in the physicochemical parameters studied see fig 8 therefore the allochthonous species as input from the wangyu river should be another reason for the variations in the phytoplankton communities induced by water diversion in this study the average relative proportions of the chlorella spp aulacoseira granulate cyclotella spp planktothrix spp aphanothece spp and others in the wangyu river of the five water diversion days were significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on both the water diversion and non diversion days see table 2 further because the average relative proportions of these genera in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were also higher than those in the gonghu bay on the non diversion days see table 2 the allochthonous species from the wangyu river definitely contributed to the increase of these genera at least to some extent however due to the only limited sampling time of each water diversion period quantitative assessment on the contributions of the allochthonous species to the variations in the phytoplankton community compositions in the gonghu bay on water diversion days requires further exploration for the water diversion day in summer the dominant groups of phytoplankton genera in the gonghu bay were merismopedia spp and planktothrix spp while microcystis spp predominated in the non diversion period table 2 it is worth noting that merismopedia spp belongs to the phytoplankton functional group l0 reynolds et al 2002 which is commonly found in the epilimnion of mesotrophic lakes the common habitat of the planktothrix spp is also the shallow lake with frequent hydrodynamic disturbance moreover it can be seen that diatoms predominated in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in autumn and winter see fig 6 among the diatom genera aulacoseira granulate and cyclotella spp were the dominant groups and belong to phytoplankton functional groups p and a respectively reynolds et al 2002 in general aulacoseira granulate is mostly found in shallow eutrophic lakes and has good adaptability to hydrodynamic disturbance cyclotella spp on the other hand is commonly found in well mixed clear water lakes and has good tolerance to lake habitats with nutrient limitation these genera dominant in the gonghu bay during the water diversion period imply the potential impact of water diversion on the habitat conditions of gonghu bay which might be more conducive to the health of the lake aquatic ecosystem 4 3 implications for water diversion management in the taihu basin during the past three decades over forty water diversion projects for national and regional water resource allocation have been constructed or under construction in china as a typical water diversion project for regional water supply the wdyt also provides the advantage for alleviating cyanobacterial blooms in the large eutrophic lake taihu hu et al 2008 li et al 2011 qin 2009 however the allochthonous nutrient input from the yangtze river and the tributaries of the wangyu river dai et al 2018 brings negative impacts on the water receiving lake regions the government has made investments on hydraulic engineering construction and ecological restoration to improve the water quality of the wangyu river in our study the concentrations of no3 n and tp in the wangyu river were found to be significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days see fig 3 since our monitoring data revealed that the concentrations of no3 n and tp in the western tributaries of the wangyu river were significantly higher than those in the yangtze river and lake taihu the construction projects controlling water pollution of the west bank of the wangyu river could offer benefits in improving the water quality of the wangyu river however if the government wants to enhance the use of the wdyt through importing water from the yangtze river by other water diversion channels such as the xinmeng river and the xingou river it would be very important to first investigate how to reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in these inflow channels in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river due to the anthropogenic influences the nutrient concentrations in most of the rivers are higher than that in lakes wang et al 2019 thus to reduce the ecological risks of water diversion projects controlling the pollutant afflux from tributaries and increasing the self purification capacity and time of the inflow river channels are two critical measures furthermore long term monitoring needs to be continuously carried out to assess the ecological effects of water diversion projects in china for the wdyt according to the dispatching control water level water diversion activities are always run in the fall and winter of each year supplying water for the basin tba 2013 2014 2015 during summer and spring due to the flood control requirement of the taihu basin water diversion activities are rare and always taken as the emergency measure to deal with the microcystis blooms aggregated in the drinking water sources in the gonghu bay tba 2013 in our study in the fall of 2015 the effect of decreasing the relative proportion of the cyanophyta in the gonghu bay was observed after 13 days of diversion with a 58 8 m3 s average inflow see table 1 although the effect of decreasing cyanophyta proportions in the winter of 2014 and 2015 was also evident allochthonous nutrient inputs from the wangyu river also increased with the higher inflow during the winter of 2014 and 2015 before resolving the problems associated with the high nutrient loads in the wangyu river controlling the inflow of the wangyu river can decrease the nutrient loads into lake taihu however how to coordinate the multiple objectives including the ecological restoration of lake taihu water supply of the taihu basin and flood control needs further exploration appropriate diversion discharges diversion duration times and diversion seasons should be evaluated to enhance the positive ecological effects and reduce the negative impacts 5 conclusions the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu wdyt reduced the organic pollutant concentrations in the water receiving gonghu bay in different seasons but the nitrate and phosphorus levels in the inflow to the wangyu river were significantly higher than those in lake taihu allochthonous nutrients from the yangtze river and the western tributaries of the wangyu river should be cut down with the help of water pollution control projects 2 water diversion activities can profoundly increase the phytoplankton diversity and alter the community composition of the gonghu bay in different seasons in fall and winter the bacillariophyta instead of the cyanophyta dominated in the water receiving gonghu bay while the relative proportions of the non microcystis cyanophyta species significantly increased in summer 3 allochthonous input of the phytoplankton species and the physicochemical habitat disturbance were identified to be the two major reasons for the variations in phytoplankton communities in the water receiving regions the physicochemical habitat disturbance induced by water diversion potentially contributed 23 3 to 31 3 of the community variations the highest potential contribution of the allochthonous species to the increase in phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay was about 15 8 while the physicochemical habitat disturbance contributed about 12 0 31 3 of the phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay 4 before resolving the widespread problem of high loads of allochthonous nutrients in river networks in the taihu basin the wdyt can only be taken as an urgent and temporary measure to alleviate cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu however due to the limitation in this field study how to conduct the ecological operation of the wdyt in different seasons remains unknown furtherly the extensive investigations in other similar lakes and the harmonization among the multiple objectives including flood control water supply and water environment improvement should be conducted for better management of water diversion projects in china credit

5395,allochthonous inputs of species and nutrients and hydrodynamic disturbance induced by water diversion projects are two critical factors of ecohydrological effects in eutrophic lakes however identification and quantification of potential contributions of allochthonous inputs and physicochemical habitat shifts to variations in phytoplankton communities remain challenging the present study addresses this issue with a study of the water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu in china to explore the effects and contributions of seasonal water diversion activities on lacustrine phytoplankton communities the comparative analysis was conducted to compare the biotic and abiotic variables between the water diversion and non diversion periods in different seasons the results showed that seasonal water diversion activities in addition to significantly reducing organic pollutant concentrations definitely increased the average concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in the gonghu bay compared with the results in the gonghu bay on the non diversion days phytoplankton diversities increased and the community compositions were altered with the bacillariophyta species and non microcystis cyanophyta species dominating in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons the venn diagram analysis showed that the highest potential contribution of the allochthonous species to the increase in phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days was about 15 8 the physicochemical habitat disturbance induced by the water diversion contributed about 12 to 31 3 of the phytoplankton diversity and 23 3 to 31 3 of the phytoplankton community variations in the gonghu bay the allochthonous phytoplankton species may contribute directly to the lacustrine phytoplankton community variations however due to the high loads of nutrients from inflow rivers positive effects of water diversion shaping the phytoplankton communities were always short term pollutant control and multi objective operation considering flood control water supply and water environment improvement are indispensable for the long term management of water diversion projects keywords water diversion allochthonous input physicochemical habitat phytoplankton lake taihu 1 introduction lakes not only provide water resources and eco services for the human society but also reflect regional ecological health of the aquatic ecosystems scheffer 1997 due to the influences of anthropogenic activities ali et al 2019 and climate change the limnetic eutrophication process accelerates this brings about a series of ecological problems such as cyanobacterial blooms vegetation degradation and diversity reduction and threatens the water supply function and ecological balance of lakes paerl et al 2016 to cope with the harmful cyanobacterial blooms and restore lake ecosystems many countermeasures including mechanical salvage phytoremediation and fish predation cooke et al 2016 jeppesen et al 2007 qin 2009 and various engineering measures such as water diversion and ecological dredging hu et al 2008 lürling and faassen 2012 have and continue to be attempted among these measures water diversion from rivers to lakes has received significant interest from scientists and lake basin administrations because of the rapidity and effectiveness with which it relieves the cyanobacterial blooms it has also become a popular and quick measure to improve water quality and to prevent or mitigate the ecological deterioration of many lakes including lake green in usa oglebsy 1969 lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake moses in usa welch et al 1992 lake tega in japan amano et al 2010 lake xuanwu in china song et al 2018 and lake xihu in china zhang et al 2018 among others due to the ecological and drinking water crisis induced by harmful cyanobacterial blooms in large eutrophic lakes in china such as lake taihu lake hongze lake chaohu and lake dianchi water diversion projects have become a very commonly used engineering measure for alleviating water crisis in such lakes the ecohydrological effects of water diversion projects on large eutrophic lakes have also been attracting significant attention in recent years dai et al 2016 dai et al 2018 hu et al 2008 huang et al 2015 2016 li et al 2011 2013 liu et al 2014 yu et al 2018 much of the research in this area has focused on the hydrodynamic and environmental effects such as the effects on water level hu et al 2008 water age huang et al 2016 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 flow field hu et al 2008 li et al 2013 water quality dai et al 2016 hu et al 2010 liu et al 2014 and ecological health based on water quality zhai et al 2010 only a few studies have addressed the issues related to the biological effects of water diversion in large eutrophic lakes huang et al 2015 lin et al 2017 as an abundant and active biota in lakes phytoplankton are significantly sensitive to the lake conditions such as the trophic level and the hydrodynamic disturbance schwalb et al 2013 yang et al 2016 conversely the phytoplankton community structure can also reflect the environmental changes and can be considered as a suitable index to represent the evolution of aquatic ecosystems induced by external disturbance yang et al 2017 such as the disturbance by water diversion the ecohydrological effects of water diversion on lakes are mainly related to three main factors hydrodynamic disturbance of the inflow discharge allochthonous nutrient input and allochthonous biological species the inflow discharges could shorten the lake residence time li et al 2011 2013 and alter the lake currents which can influence the transportation transformation and distribution of nutrients and biological communities of some small lakes oglebsy 1969 jagtman et al 1992 welch et al 1992 hosper 1998 amano et al 2010 however for large eutrophic lakes the residence time is generally very long and only a limited inflow discharge of any water diversion cannot significantly shorten the lake residence time for instance for lake taihu the residence time is almost always longer than 200 days and an inflow discharge lower than 150 m3 s does not have much influence on the lake residence time li et al 2011 since the upstream rivers that divert water to lakes generally have great nutrient loads the allochthonous nutrients from the upstream rivers will play a more important role in structuring phytoplankton communities in lakes by considering the rapid in situ growth of the phytoplankton in eutrophic waters swarbrick et al 2019 moreover allochthonous phytoplankton species from rivers could also directly affect the phytoplankton communities in lakes in china there are often concerns regarding the ecohydrological effects of high allochthonous nutrient inputs induced by water diversion projects however to what extent the allochthonous inputs from water diversion projects contribute to variations in the phytoplankton communities remains unknown lake taihu is the third largest shallow eutrophic lake in china and is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river to cope with the frequent cyanobacterial blooms of lake taihu and meet the water demands of the taihu basin water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu wdyt was initiated in 2002 and has been operated regularly from 2007 qin et al 2019 the taihu basin authority tba has been responsible for the regulation of the wdyt project and has formulated the dispatching rule according to the average real time water level of lake taihu normally when the average real time water level of lake taihu is lower than the dispatching control water level the wangyu river will input allochthonous water from the yangtze river and then divert it into lake taihu through the wangyu river after the water quality of the wangyu river reaches or precedes the third level of surface water quality standards in china many past studies have demonstrated that the seasonal water diversion activities of the wdyt could improve the hydro environment of lake taihu but also increase the loading of nutrients such as the nitrate and total phosphorus in some regions dai et al 2018 hu et al 2008 2010 however only a few studies have addressed the influence of the physicochemical habitat variations induced by the seasonal water diversion activities on phytoplankton communities in the water receiving regions of lake taihu this provides the motivation for the present study in this study we consider the wdyt project as an example to investigate the phytoplankton communities and physicochemical parameters in the water receiving regions of lake taihu and to compare the biotic and abiotic variables between the water diversion and non diversion periods in different seasons for the latter we use the sourcing and multivariate statistical analysis based on these we examine three issues 1 responses of the lacustrine phytoplankton communities and physicochemical habitat to short term water diversion in different seasons 2 relationships between the physicochemical habitat shifts induced by water diversion and phytoplankton communities and 3 contributions of the allochthonous phytoplankton species and physicochemical habitat disturbance to lacustrine phytoplankton communities during the water diversion periods the outcomes of this study could help elucidate the positive and negative effects of water diversion on the cyanobacterial blooms in the large eutrophic lake taihu they could consequently provide useful hints to understand the short term ecohydrological effects of water diversion on large eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites a schematic diagram of the methodology used in this study is shown in fig 1 lake taihu is the geographic and hysteresis storage center of water resources for the taihu basin the wangyu river is one of the main water diversion channels of the wdyt and directly connects the yangtze river and lake taihu fig 2 the changshu and wangting hydro junctions are the two main operating sections regulating the importation of the yangtze river water and the inflow discharges into the gonghu bay from the wangyu river respectively gonghu bay is located in the northeastern part of lake taihu which covers an area of 150 km2 and has the multi year average water depth of 1 8 m zhong et al 2012 fig 2 the southwestern part of the gonghu bay connects the lake center and the meiliang bay which is the largest and hypereutrophic bay of lake taihu since 2005 large quantities of cyanobacterial blooms have begun to cover most water areas of the gonghu bay with a significant increase in 2007 qin et al 2010 in recent years with the improvement of water quality in the gonghu bay contributed by the integrated management of the whole basin gonghu bay has become one of the main drinking water sources for wuxi city and suzhou city in the taihu basin for the data considered in this study the sampling sites were located in the wangyu river sites r1 r3 gonghu bay sites a1 e1 a2 e2 and a3 e3 and the lake center sites l1 l3 of lake taihu fig 2 the sites r1 r3 were located in the upstream of the wangting hydro junction to investigate the inflow water characteristics the layout of the sites in the gonghu bay intended to investigate the gradients of the physicochemical and biological parameters from the wangyu river mouth to the lake center during the water diversion periods since the lake center is adjacent and open to the gonghu bay there are exchanges of hydraulics nutrients and phytoplankton species between the gonghu bay and the lake center the lake center is less influenced by water diversion than the gonghu bay the intention of laying the sampling sites in the lake center is to elucidate the potential contribution to the phytoplankton community variations in the gonghu bay the wangyu river and the lake center were the two adjacent regions to the gonghu bay to elucidate the potential contribution of the wangyu river we should also know the potential contribution of the lake center in lake regions the sampling sites were located with the same distance of 2 km between the two adjacent sites 2 2 sample collection and measurement of abiotic variables in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river january april august and november are always taken as the representative months for winter spring summer and autumn respectively according to the dispatching operation of the wdyt in 2013 2014 and 2015 august in 2013 and january and november in both 2014 and 2015 were all in the water diversion periods other months were all in the non diversion periods a 2 l of surface water sample 50 cm under water surface from each sampling site was collected on the middle day of each selected month during 2013 2015 table 1 of this 2 l water sample 1 l was fixed using 15 ml 1 mass concentration of lugol s iodine fixing reagent for identification of the phytoplankton community the water samples collected for each site were stored in the sterile plastic bottle and transported to the laboratory for analysis within 24 h the sampling time began at 9 00 on each day the data of inflow discharges of the wangyu river and the water level of lake taihu during the sampling days were collected from the annual reports of the wdyt project in 2013 2014 and 2015 tba 2013 2014 2015 wind direction and speed in each sampling site were measured in situ using the hand held anemometer nk 4500 kestrel nk

phosphorus tp ammonia nh3 n nitrate no3 n soluble reactive phosphorus srp permanganate index codmn dissolved silicate sio3 si and chlorophyll a chl a were all determined in the laboratory according to the method used by jin and tu 1990 2 3 identification of phytoplankton communities the 1 l lugol s iodine reagent fixed water sample for each site was transferred into a separating funnel after stewing for 24 h the 50 ml precipitated bottom sample was collected to store in the sterile glass bottle and kept in a dark place until the beginning of the phytoplankton identification jin and tu 1990 a 0 1 ml of the concentrated sample was injected into the algae counting box and put in the optical microscope axiovert 200 carl zeiss jena germany to uniformly capture 100 random views these random views were used to identify the phytoplankton species and to count the cell numbers with the help of the t300 algae smart identification software shineso hangzhou china this procedure was repeated three times for each sample the identification of the phytoplankton species was done according to the method used by hu and wei 2006 2 4 statistical analyses the phytoplankton diversity indexes of the species number and the shannon wiener index h for each sample were calculated using the primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand the differences in the physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton diversity indexes in the gonghu bay between the water diversion and non diversion periods were compared with the one way anova method using the spss 16 0 statistic software ibm armonk usa the venn diagram plotted using the vennpainter software lin et al 2016 was adopted to determine the potential contribution of allochthonous phytoplankton species of the wangyu river to that of the gonghu bay the gradients in the average relative proportions of the phytoplankton community composition from the wangyu river sites a1 a3 to the lake center sites l1 l3 were plotted using the sigmaplot 12 5 software systat software inc london uk the similarities between the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay among the same seasons in the three years 2013 2014 and 2015 were analyzed by the analysis of similarities anosim method fanini and lowry 2016 and plotted using the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds method with the primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand for the nmds analysis the matrix data constructed using the genera cell numbers of all samples were first log10 x 1 transformed and then reassembled using the bray curtis similarity index redundancy analysis rda was carried out to reveal the correlations and contributions of the investigated physicochemical parameters to lacustrine phytoplankton communities by using the canoco 5 software lai 2013 the significance p 0 05 of the calculated results was verified with an unrestricted monte carlo permutation 3 results 3 1 physicochemical parameters during the sampling days there was no rain in the sampling regions and most of the wind speeds on the lake surface were lower than 4 m s the cumulative inflow during the water diversion period in winter until the sampling day was higher than the annual average water storage of the gonghu bay about 2 70 108 m3 while that in the summer and autumn diversion periods until the sampling day were lower table 1 the average inflow 111 5 m3 s during the summer water diversion period was higher than that during the winter 85 4 and 73 5 m3 s and fall 41 6 and 58 8 m3 s water diversion periods significant differences in the concentrations of ph sio3 si tn no3 n tp and codmn were found between the diversion period and non diversion period in each season respectively one way anova p 0 05 fig 3 since there were significant differences in the physicochemical parameters between the wangyu river and the center of lake taihu water diversion activities in different seasons significantly decreased the values of ph and codmn and increased the contents of sio3 si tn no3 n and tp 3 2 phytoplankton diversities and overlaps of genera among three regions on water diversion days the average diversities in the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on different sampling days were respectively all significantly higher than those in the lake center fig 4 one way anova p 0 05 for the gonghu bay in the same season

except for the diversities in january fig 4a and 4b one way anova p 0 05 whether between the diversion days or between the non diversion days there was also no significant divergence in both the two diversity indexes in this study fig 4 one way anova p 0 05 the unique genera only found in the gonghu bay accounted for 17 4 fig 5 a 12 fig 5b 23 1 fig 5c 15 8 fig 5d and 31 3 fig 5e of the total phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day in january of 2014 january of 2015 august of 2013 november of 2014 and november of 2015 respectively moreover the common genera only found between the wangyu river and gonghu bay on the water diversion days showed that the allochthonous genera from the wangyu river potentially accounted for 0 8 3 7 7 15 8 and 0 of the total phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay on the above mentioned water diversion days respectively the genera only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons were affiliated with the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta chrysophyta and xanthophyta however all of the relative proportions in the cell abundances of these genera were lower than 1 0 table 2 none of these was the dominant genera in the gonghu bay during the water diversion days there were several genera such as westella spp phacus spp arthrospira spp golenkinia spp neidium spp ankistrodsemus spp and synura spp overlapped only between the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in different seasons in january and november the relative proportions of aulacoseira granulate cyclotella spp and synedra spp in the wangyu river were evidently higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days and non diversion days respectively table 2 in august the arthrospira spp 46 7 and planktothrix spp 40 2 were the dominant bacillariophyta genera in the wangyu river which were significantly higher in relative proportions than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days and non diversion days respectively table 2 3 3 phytoplankton abundances and community compositions the spatial variations in the total phytoplankton cell abundances and community compositions on each sampling day are shown in fig 6 there were eight phytoplankton phyla recovered on the sampling days in different seasons including the cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta cryptophyta euglenophyta pyrrophyta chrysophyta and the xanthophyta in january the average values of the total phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay on the non diversion day fig 6a were significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days fig 6b and c one way anova p 0 05 the bacillariophyta dominated in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days fig 6b and c whereas the cyanophyta was more abundant on the non diversion day fig 6a in april the cyanophyta predominated in the gonghu bay and the lake center on all the sampling days fig 6d 6e and 6f in august the average phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day in 2013 fig 6g and on the non diversion day in 2015 fig 6i were significantly lower than those on the non diversion day in 2014 fig 6h one way anova p 0 05 on both the water diversion and the non diversion days the cyanophyta predominated in all the three sampling regions fig 6g h and i for november there was no significant divergence in the total phytoplankton cell abundances in the gonghu bay among the three sampling days fig 6j k and l one way anova p 0 05 on the non diversion day in 2013 the average relative proportions of the bacillariophyta in the gonghu bay fig 6j were significantly lower than those on the two water diversion days in 2014 and 2015 fig 6k and l one way anova p 0 05 although the cyanophyta predominated in the water regions studied during both diversion and non diversion periods in august the dominant cyanophyta genera in the wangyu river and the gonghu bay on the water diversion day were different from those on the non diversion days fig s1 the planktothrix spp merismopedia spp and arthrospira spp were dominant in the wangyu river and in most of the regions in the gonghu bay on the water diversion day fig s1a while the microcystis spp was the absolute dominant genus in the three water regions studied during the non diversion days in summer fig s1b and c according to the nmds and anosim results there were significant differences in the phytoplankton community structures of the gonghu bay among the water diversion and non diversion days in each season fig 7 a b and c except for the comparison between the community structures in november 2013 and 2014 fig 7d however for january and august the r values of the anosim between the water diversion and non diversion days were relatively higher than those between the non diversion days in each season fig 7a and c 3 4 correlations between physicochemical habitats and phytoplankton communities in january the values of water temperature tn nh3 n and srp were significantly correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay fig s2a in august the ph tn water temperature and silicate were the significant physicochemical parameters correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay fig s2b as for november the values of water temperature tn srp ph and no3 n were significantly correlated with the variations in the phytoplankton communities of gonghu bay among the three sampling days fig s2c the physicochemical parameters studied herein explained 39 8 37 2 and 46 7 of the variances in the phytoplankton communities for the water diversion and non diversion days in january august and november respectively fig 8 a 8b and 8c the physicochemical parameters sensitive to the water diversion explained 23 3 fig 8a 24 5 fig 8b and 31 3 fig 8c of the variances in the phytoplankton communities in january august and november respectively 4 discussion 4 1 responses of phytoplankton diversity to wdyt in different seasons the lacustrine phytoplankton diversity as an important ecological indicator in lakes is sensitive to water diversion in different seasons see fig 4 the effects of water diversion on the phytoplankton diversity in lacustrine ecosystems has been reported in many previous studies fornarelli et al 2013 lin et al 2003 wang 2008 jiang 2013 most of these studies have observed an increase in the diversity in water receiving aquatic ecosystems lin et al 2003 wang 2008 jiang 2013 our study has also revealed that the phytoplankton diversity on the water diversion days was higher than that on the non diversion days in august and november see fig 4 however fornarelli et al 2013 reported significant positive correlations between the diversity indexes shannon weaver index and evenness of phytoplankton and the retention time in a reservoir influenced by inter basin water transfers this finding suggests that the increase in diversity induced by water diversion might be reasonable in the context of appropriate retention time the allochthonous species and physicochemical habitat variation are often regarded as the two critical contributors to variations in phytoplankton communities in freshwater ecosystems dai et al 2018 paerl et al 2016 yang et al 2017 the phytoplankton species only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were the main contributors to the increase in diversity induced by water diversion in different seasons see fig 4 and table 2 this result revealed that the variations in physicochemical habitat of the gonghu bay contributed more to the phytoplankton diversity increase on the water diversion days the lacustrine habitat disturbed by the water diversion was mainly reflected in the variations in the hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions since wdyt has been found to mainly influence the water age and circulate flow field in the gonghu bay under limited inflow discharges li et al 2011 lv 2013 the horizontal and vertical water exchange in the gonghu bay may be the dominant factor shaping the phytoplankton communities during the water diversion periods this was supported by the observation that most of the phytoplankton genera only found in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were affiliated with the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta see table 2 compared with the cyanophyta species most of the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta species have faster growth rates and are more adaptive to the turbulent flowing environment istvánovics and honti 2012 moreover the decrease in organic pollutants and increase in active silicate and nutrients during the water diversion periods can also provide beneficial physicochemical conditions for some of the chlorophyta and bacillariophyta species rao et al 2018 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however the phytoplankton species only found in the gonghu bay were not dominant i e most of them with relative proportions lower than 1 during the water diversion days in different seasons see table 2 which revealed that these species might be rare ones originally survived in lake taihu when the environmental conditions vary during the water diversion periods the cell abundances of these rare species will increase to the detectable level for microscopic counting additionally in january there was no pronounced difference in diversity among the three sampling days see fig 4 which was ascribed to the fact that the sampling day on the non diversion period was 10 days after the previous water diversion period tba 2013 and the influence of the previous water diversion on diversity may have remained to some extent 4 2 impacts of wdyt on lacustrine phytoplankton abundances and communities the efficacy of water diversion in reducing the phytoplankton cell abundance and primary productivity has been reported for some lakes such as lake green oglebsy 1969 and lake moses welch et al 1992 in the state of washington usa and lake nanhu in changchun city china wang 2008 the lower phytoplankton cell abundance especially of the microcystis spp in the turbulent flowing water environment of rivers is the main reason huisman et al 2004 li et al 2013 the water mixing of the wangyu river and the gonghu bay directly diluted the phytoplankton cell abundance in the gonghu bay in this study the planktonic cell abundances in the wangyu river were always lower than those in the lake regions in different seasons see fig 6 on the other hand it is also important to note that water diversion enhances the turbulent diffusivity of water receiving regions which could promote the vertical mixing of planktonic cells huisman et al 2004 since the buoyant microcystis spp is not well adaptable to the turbulent mixing environment paerl et al 2011 reynolds et al 1994 the proliferation of the microcystis spp could be precluded to reduce the phytoplankton cell abundance in the water receiving lake region the phytoplankton community composition is another index representing the planktonic response to biotic and abiotic disturbances ko et al 2017 yang et al 2017 due to the influences of climate warming and anthropogenic activities in the eutrophic lake taihu the microcystis spp predominated the northern regions for over ten months per year ma et al 2016 the stronger adaptation to water temperature and sufficient nutrients in lake taihu create opportunities for forming frequent microcystis blooms almost throughout the year qin et al 2018 in this study water diversions in different seasons were all found to be capable of decreasing the relative proportions of the microcystis spp and increasing the proportions of the other phyla e g bacillariophyta and chlorophyta in most regions of the gonghu bay see fig 6 and fig s1 this phenomenon i e shaping the phytoplankton communities of lakes by water diversion has also been reported for other eutrophic lakes such as lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake nanhu in china wang 2008 and lake tega in japan amano et al 2010 however in the case of lake taihu and under conditions of only limited inflow discharges i e average 90 m3 s during water diversion periods in the last 10 years tba 2015 this ecological effect was just limited to the gonghu bay and the lake center was marginally influenced by the water diversion however on the protection of the drinking water source in the gonghu bay the ecological effect has been found to be positive qin et al 2010 since many phytoplankton species have only a short life cycle period i e several days and are sensitive to physicochemical conditions e g the microcystis spp scenedesmus spp and cyclotella spp reynolds 2006 variations in the physicochemical habitat are the critical impetus to drive the succession of the phytoplankton communities in freshwater lakes li et al 2019 in the present study the physicochemical parameters studied in the gonghu bay explained about 40 of the variations in the phytoplankton communities among the water diversion and non diversion days in each season see fig 8 the variations in the phytoplankton communities in the gonghu bay were explained about 23 3 to 31 3 by the physicochemical habitat shifts induced by water diversion in different seasons see fig 8 as for november and january the dominant bacillariophyta in the gonghu bay can be partially explained by the increase in active silicate concentrations on the water diversion days zhang et al 2018 for august however the increase in the other cyanophyta species abundances except for the microcystis spp can be mainly attributed to the input of the allochthonous species from the wangyu river most of the variations i e about 60 in the phytoplankton communities between the water diversion days and the non diversion days cannot be explained by the variations in the physicochemical parameters studied see fig 8 therefore the allochthonous species as input from the wangyu river should be another reason for the variations in the phytoplankton communities induced by water diversion in this study the average relative proportions of the chlorella spp aulacoseira granulate cyclotella spp planktothrix spp aphanothece spp and others in the wangyu river of the five water diversion days were significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on both the water diversion and non diversion days see table 2 further because the average relative proportions of these genera in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days were also higher than those in the gonghu bay on the non diversion days see table 2 the allochthonous species from the wangyu river definitely contributed to the increase of these genera at least to some extent however due to the only limited sampling time of each water diversion period quantitative assessment on the contributions of the allochthonous species to the variations in the phytoplankton community compositions in the gonghu bay on water diversion days requires further exploration for the water diversion day in summer the dominant groups of phytoplankton genera in the gonghu bay were merismopedia spp and planktothrix spp while microcystis spp predominated in the non diversion period table 2 it is worth noting that merismopedia spp belongs to the phytoplankton functional group l0 reynolds et al 2002 which is commonly found in the epilimnion of mesotrophic lakes the common habitat of the planktothrix spp is also the shallow lake with frequent hydrodynamic disturbance moreover it can be seen that diatoms predominated in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days in autumn and winter see fig 6 among the diatom genera aulacoseira granulate and cyclotella spp were the dominant groups and belong to phytoplankton functional groups p and a respectively reynolds et al 2002 in general aulacoseira granulate is mostly found in shallow eutrophic lakes and has good adaptability to hydrodynamic disturbance cyclotella spp on the other hand is commonly found in well mixed clear water lakes and has good tolerance to lake habitats with nutrient limitation these genera dominant in the gonghu bay during the water diversion period imply the potential impact of water diversion on the habitat conditions of gonghu bay which might be more conducive to the health of the lake aquatic ecosystem 4 3 implications for water diversion management in the taihu basin during the past three decades over forty water diversion projects for national and regional water resource allocation have been constructed or under construction in china as a typical water diversion project for regional water supply the wdyt also provides the advantage for alleviating cyanobacterial blooms in the large eutrophic lake taihu hu et al 2008 li et al 2011 qin 2009 however the allochthonous nutrient input from the yangtze river and the tributaries of the wangyu river dai et al 2018 brings negative impacts on the water receiving lake regions the government has made investments on hydraulic engineering construction and ecological restoration to improve the water quality of the wangyu river in our study the concentrations of no3 n and tp in the wangyu river were found to be significantly higher than those in the gonghu bay on the water diversion days see fig 3 since our monitoring data revealed that the concentrations of no3 n and tp in the western tributaries of the wangyu river were significantly higher than those in the yangtze river and lake taihu the construction projects controlling water pollution of the west bank of the wangyu river could offer benefits in improving the water quality of the wangyu river however if the government wants to enhance the use of the wdyt through importing water from the yangtze river by other water diversion channels such as the xinmeng river and the xingou river it would be very important to first investigate how to reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in these inflow channels in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river due to the anthropogenic influences the nutrient concentrations in most of the rivers are higher than that in lakes wang et al 2019 thus to reduce the ecological risks of water diversion projects controlling the pollutant afflux from tributaries and increasing the self purification capacity and time of the inflow river channels are two critical measures furthermore long term monitoring needs to be continuously carried out to assess the ecological effects of water diversion projects in china for the wdyt according to the dispatching control water level water diversion activities are always run in the fall and winter of each year supplying water for the basin tba 2013 2014 2015 during summer and spring due to the flood control requirement of the taihu basin water diversion activities are rare and always taken as the emergency measure to deal with the microcystis blooms aggregated in the drinking water sources in the gonghu bay tba 2013 in our study in the fall of 2015 the effect of decreasing the relative proportion of the cyanophyta in the gonghu bay was observed after 13 days of diversion with a 58 8 m3 s average inflow see table 1 although the effect of decreasing cyanophyta proportions in the winter of 2014 and 2015 was also evident allochthonous nutrient inputs from the wangyu river also increased with the higher inflow during the winter of 2014 and 2015 before resolving the problems associated with the high nutrient loads in the wangyu river controlling the inflow of the wangyu river can decrease the nutrient loads into lake taihu however how to coordinate the multiple objectives including the ecological restoration of lake taihu water supply of the taihu basin and flood control needs further exploration appropriate diversion discharges diversion duration times and diversion seasons should be evaluated to enhance the positive ecological effects and reduce the negative impacts 5 conclusions the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu wdyt reduced the organic pollutant concentrations in the water receiving gonghu bay in different seasons but the nitrate and phosphorus levels in the inflow to the wangyu river were significantly higher than those in lake taihu allochthonous nutrients from the yangtze river and the western tributaries of the wangyu river should be cut down with the help of water pollution control projects 2 water diversion activities can profoundly increase the phytoplankton diversity and alter the community composition of the gonghu bay in different seasons in fall and winter the bacillariophyta instead of the cyanophyta dominated in the water receiving gonghu bay while the relative proportions of the non microcystis cyanophyta species significantly increased in summer 3 allochthonous input of the phytoplankton species and the physicochemical habitat disturbance were identified to be the two major reasons for the variations in phytoplankton communities in the water receiving regions the physicochemical habitat disturbance induced by water diversion potentially contributed 23 3 to 31 3 of the community variations the highest potential contribution of the allochthonous species to the increase in phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay was about 15 8 while the physicochemical habitat disturbance contributed about 12 0 31 3 of the phytoplankton diversity in the gonghu bay 4 before resolving the widespread problem of high loads of allochthonous nutrients in river networks in the taihu basin the wdyt can only be taken as an urgent and temporary measure to alleviate cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu however due to the limitation in this field study how to conduct the ecological operation of the wdyt in different seasons remains unknown furtherly the extensive investigations in other similar lakes and the harmonization among the multiple objectives including flood control water supply and water environment improvement should be conducted for better management of water diversion projects in china credit

5396,peatlands cover only about 3 of the earth s surface and store 15 30 of the global soil carbon as a peat however human intervention and climate change threatens the stability of peatlands owing to deforest wildfire mining drainage glacial retreat and permafrost in our study we modified the swat model to couple snow soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission then the modified swat was used for predicting snow depth soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at athabasca river basin canada the results of the study indicated that swat model estimated the daily snow depth with r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 83 0 76 0 52 and 2 3 in the calibration period 2006 2007 and 0 79 0 71 0 97 and 3 6 for the validation period 2008 2009 respectively the swat model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths 5 cm 10 cm and 30 cm the simulation model results also confirmed that the modified swat model estimates the co2 emission at athabasca river basin with good model fit during calibration r2 0 71 nse 0 67 rmse 2 6 and pbias 3 2 and during validation r2 0 63 nse 0 58 rmse 3 1 and pbias 9 3 overall our result confirmed that swat model performed well in representing the dynamics of snow depth soil temperature and co2 emissions in the peatlands at the athabasca river basin keywords swat subroutine carbon dioxide snow depth soil temperature peatland 1 introduction northern peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling as large stores of soil organic matter berger et al 2018 however northern peatlands are vulnerable to global warning due to decrease of snow cover areas change of snow cover duration permafrost and glacier retreat ipcc 2014 peatlands are important sources of derived dissolved organic carbon doc and nutrients in cold watersheds because they often are hydrologically well connected to creek and river systems burd et al 2018 although processes governing carbon dynamics in cold peatlands receive much attention to estimate global greenhouse gas emissions the responses of nutrient cycles to long term changed hydrological conditions such as snowmelt permafrost water table change and freeze thaw cycles are not well known because of large variability in time and space of various watershed water sources berger et al 2018 burd et al 2018 therefore there are increasing concerns how combined effects of soil temperature and snow melt on organic matter turnover and carbon dioxide emission in cold peatlands zhu et al 2014 many studies have been performed to study effects of snowpack and freezing and thaw cycles on co2 fluxes using closed chamber technique eddy covariance and modelling cui and wang 2019 dutta et al 2016 dutta et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 ruan and robertson 2017 showed that the change of freezing and thawing cycles and permafrost have a great influence on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics leading to carbon dioxide emissions the snow cover change also affects soil heat transfer and profile of temperatures soil temperature is an important factor of heterotrophic microbial activity in peatlands atnafe et al 2015 oertel et al 2016 zou et al 2018 the snow cover change during the spring season can be much higher than the other seasons this can shorten the duration of snow cover change of water table and peatland water areas and early permafrost this can further influence the nitrogen and carbon cycling kim et al 2007 brooks et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 in the past decades different models such as denitrification decomposition dndc and daycent have been used to quantify carbon dioxide emission at plot and large scale globally by several researchers balasubramanian et al 2017 cui and wang 2019 dutta et al 2016 gilhespy et al 2014 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however as point based land surface models these models might lead to uncertainties of predictions of snowmelt soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission some land surface models lsms at global scale have been developed such as orchidee organizing carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems environment jpj guess lund potsdam jena general ecosystem simulator and the clm community land model krinner et al 2005 murray tortarolo et al 2013 lawrence et al 2019 these lsms integrate soil carbon models to simulate future feedbacks between climate and global c and n cycles such as passim for orchidee qiu et al 2018 and daycent for clms lawrence et al 2019 these models are not efficient in modeling hydrological processes in the wetlands such as snowpack stream flow water table and soil temperature at different depths therefore there is a need to improve process based models swat to predict co2 emissions in the peatlands since hydrological processes may be dominant factors in affecting co2 emissions in river basins the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been applied worldwide to support sustainable land and water management in a changing climate arnold et al 2012 it has been applied globally for watershed modelling of water quality and sediment addis et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 n2o emissions shrestha et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 melaku et al 2020 and bacterial and nutrient transport meshesha et al 2020 akhavan et al 2010 however the existing peatland module of the swat is inadequate to account for snowmelt processes soil heat transfer peatland water table and processes of nutrient and trapped co2 in cold river basin with large peatland areas in this study we modify the swat model to consider the important factors of soil temperature snow melt and carbon dioxide emissions in cold peatlands we studied the complex interactions of these processes to improve our understanding of controls on seasonal variations of carbon dioxide emissions in the athabasca river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted from 2006 to 2009 at athabasca river basin west peatlands flux station fcrn fig 1 the research study area was located at 54 57 13 81 n latitude and 112 28 1 17 w longitude and at an altitude of 540 m above sea level alberta canada the climate of the area is categorized as sub humid which is classified as short cool summer and long cold winter alberta natural heritage information center 2005 the mean annual air temperatures were 1 1 c and the mean annual precipitation was 461 07 mm respectively the dominant vegetations in the study area are stunted tress and mosses species larix laricina picea mariana betula pumila ledum groenlandicum and salix sp coursolle et al 2006 the study area is also known with herbs and short shrub including menyanthese trifoliata carex sp empertrum nigrum andromeda polifolia oxycoccus microcarpus potentilla palustris rubus acaulis and smilacina trifolia coursolle et al 2006 qiu et al 2018 the athabasca river basin contain larger proportion of peatland classes theses classes occur in a single or in complex and mixed and are the principle wetlands in alberta s peatland zone fig 2 about 56 of the peatland area in the athabasca river basin is bogs and about 17 is comprised of tree fens and open fens the remaining contains mixed water bodies such as lakes fig 2 the data was obtained from flux canada research network fcrn which is easily accessible database in the ameriflux website https ameriflux lbl gov data download data with the necessary data policy https ameriflux lbl gov data data policy the measurements recorded at the flux tower station were co2 emission snow depth soil temperature and other parameters we use the measured data between 2006 and 2007 for calibration period and the measured data from 2008 to 2009 period were used for model validation 2 2 the swat model soil and water assessment tool swat model is a continuous semi distributed process based watershed scale model arnold et al 2012 the swat model requires climate data soil land cover and land management data to simulate surface and subsurface hydrology pollutant loads chemicals nutrients and sediment fluxes addis et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 due to its flexibility swat has been used in many parts of the world neitsch et al 2011 while the original model considers snowmelt hydrology fontaine et al 2002 the complex peatland processes is not explicitly reported furthermore the swat model need to account for the complex interaction of snowmelt processes soil heat transfer peatland water table and processes of co2 emission in the cold river basin with large peatland areas swat classifies precipitation as a rain or freezing rain snow by the mean daily air temperature if the mean daily air temperature is less than the boundary temperature then the precipitation within the hru is classified as snow and the water equivalent of the snow precipitation is added to the snowpack snow fall is stored at the ground surface in the form of a snowpack the snowpack will increase with additional snowfall or decrease with snow melt or sublimation the mass balance for snowpack is given in eq 1 1 sno s n o r day e sub sno melt where sno is the water content of the snowpack on a given day mm h2o rday is the amount of precipitation on a given day mm h2o esub is the amount of sublimation on a given day mm h2o and snomlt is the amount of snow melt on a given day mm h2o the amount of snow is expressed as depth over the total hru area in the modified swat model we coupled the nonlinear processes of snow accumulation melting and sublimation of the snomaus model developed by thornton et al 2000 and trnka et al 2010 within the swat modeling framework thus the snowmaus partitions rain snow and simulates snow accumulation were added with two parameters taccmix c represents that a portion of precipitation p mm is in the form of snow when the minimum air temperature tamin c is below taccmix and taccsnow c represents that all the precipitation is in the form of snow when tamin is below or equal to taccsnow snow accumulation snoaccu mm in terms of snow water equivalent swe the amount of water in the snowpack is calculated by eq

is a key ecosystem process that generate co2 from the soil carbon is stored in the soil as organic matter and is respired by plants bacteria fungi and animals soil co2 emission has two components the

m to 3669 m fig 3 and the soil types were defined and prepared as an input file required by the model the daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed were also used as an input file for the swat model 2 4 model performance evaluation graphical and statistical model evaluation techniques were used to investigate how well the observed and the simulated results

validation processes in the swat model it is quite important to identify the key parameters and degree of precision required for calibration process arnold et al 2012 the most sensitive parameters for the model are given in table 1 consequently we considered these parameters for model calibration 3 2 precipitation and temperature the daily mean precipitation and mean daily temperature are depicted in fig 4 the figure showed the trend of precipitation and air temperature in the study area for the study period the temperature ranges from 35 c to 29 c where higher temperature was observed during summer season and lower air temperature was observed during winter season in the study period 2006 2009 the air temperature starts to increase in mid march reaching its maximum during july and august similarly the precipitation trend indicated that higher precipitation was observed in summer while lower precipitation was measured during winter fig 4 3 3 snow depth fig 5 displays the calibrated and validated snow depth at athabasca river basin during the study period 2006 2009 the snow depth began to develop in the middle of october at the peatlands of athabasca river basin the depth gradually increased and reached its maximum in late december and kept constant snow depth up to 65 cm the snow depth started to decline from late march to early april in all the study periods the snow depth observed in 2009 showed highest values while in 2006 showed lowest values fig 5 the snow depth observations were compared with the model results for the calibration and validation periods based on the comparison results the modified swat model showed that the simulated snow depth was fitted very well with the observed snow depth the model resulted an r2 of 0 83 during calibration 2006 2009 and 0 79 during validation 2008 2009 similarly the modified swat model resulted a very good model fit resulting nse value of 0 76 for the calibration period and 0 71 for the validation period the results of the study depicted that the measured and predicted snow depth was captured well the results showed optimal percent bias values during calibration pbias 2 3 and validation pbias 3 04 with low magnitude values indicating very good model fit fig 5 furthermore the simulated results showed very good model efficiency at athabasca river basin with an rmse of 0 52 during calibration and 0 97 during the validation period 3 4 soil temperature the swat model simulated the daily soil temperature with a very good correlation with the observed values figs 6 7 and 8 the trend between the observed and the simulated soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm results has been represented well in the simulation period as it can be confirmed with the corresponding r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 78 0 71 1 23 and 2 12 respectively fig 6 during calibration the results also showed good results of r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 72 0 67 2 15 and 3 21 for the validation period respectively similarly the simulated soil temperature results show that the model can predict the trend of observed soil temperature very well at 10 cm soil depth both during calibration and validation periods 2006 2009 fig 7 the simulation results of soil temperature at the depth of 30 cm showed very slight lower statistical values as compared to the 10 cm and 5 cm depths however the model efficiency stilled showed vey well model fit fig 8 overall soil temperature results showed a distinct seasonal variation in each year from 2006 to 2009 at three different depths based on the simulated results higher soil temperature was recorded in summer season and the lower was observed during winter where air temperature is low and snow cover presents the model results clearly indicate that soil temperature from the swat model are in good agreement with the measured soil temperature at all depths 5 cm 10 cm and 30 cm 3 5 carbon dioxide emission the simulated co2 results show that the model predicted the trend of observed daily co2 emission very well during the calibration 2006 2007 and validation 2008 2009 periods figs 9 and 10 the daily co2 calibration results gave an r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 71 0 67 2 6 and 3 2 respectively fig 9 comparison of simulated daily co2 emission with observed values showed that the magnitude co2 emission were very well estimated figs 9 and 10 the co2 emission showed similar order of magnitude as the measured co2 emissions during calibration fig 9 on the other side during the validation period there was a very slight variation on the magnitude and timing of peak carbon dioxide emission between the predicted and the observed values fig 10 the comparison of the measured and simulated results showed well model fit in the calibration and satisficed model fit for the validation periods figs 9 and 10 the model results gave a good statistical value in the simulation periods 2006 2009 the r2 value was 0 71 during calibration and 0 63 during validation which indicates that the model was capable in predicting the daily carbon dioxide emission the nse values also showed reasonably higher results both during calibration nse 0 67 and validation nse 0 58 compared with the flux tower measurements the predicted values by the swat model indicated very good statistical results with the observed data both during calibration and validation periods 3 6 the relationship between snow depth and co2 emission in this study we confirmed that co2 emission responded to snow depth potentially reflecting the contribution of increased co2 emission fig 11 the results in fig 11 showed a reasonable trend in snow depth and carbon dioxide emission over the study period 2006 2009 the trend shows that higher carbon dioxide emission was observed during midsummer where lower snow depth was observed on the other hand lower co2 emission was observed during the midwinter where lower snow depth was observed in the simulation periods 2006 2009 overall this study indicates that the swat model can capture the main trends of carbon dioxide emission and snow depth from peatlands in the canadian cold regions the swat model simulation results indicated that the estimated carbon dioxide emission using the modified subroutine agrees with the observed data at the athabasca river basin 3 7 spatial and temporal distribution of co2 emission fig 12 shows the temporal and spatial distribution of the average carbon dioxide emission from the delineated sub basins of the athabasca river basin canada the spatial and temporal variability of carbon dioxide emission has been reflected in the four major seasons fig 12 the distribution of carbon dioxide emission varied from each season despite the expected higher snow cover accompanied with low soil and air temperature in winter the carbon dioxide emission showed lower values in the winter season fig 12a however the emission becomes higher during spring period as snow melting starts fig 12b the swat model predicts the highest carbon dioxide emission during the summer season fig 12c while the emission starts to decrease in autumn fig 12d 4 discussions swat has been tested to investigate watershed processes in different agroecologies globally addis et al 2016 akhavan et al 2010 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 leduc et al 2016 melaku et al 2020 with a very limited studies evaluating swat performance in modeling the impact of snow depth and soil temperature on co2 emission in the peatlands in our study the new modified swat subroutine predicted snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission very well these results indicate a very good model efficiency performance between the swat simulated and the observed daily snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission for both calibration and validation periods 2006 2009 in the cold regions of canada the analysis of the model results showed higher carbon dioxide emission during midsummer for the calibration periods and validation periods a study in central alberta reported that carbon dioxide emission is higher between june and august baah acheamfour et al 2016 indicating most soil carbon dioxide emissions were recorded between june and august in central alberta canada similarly other studies depicted that co2 emission higher as soil temperature increases renger et al 2002 wessolek et al 2002 mezbahuddin et al 2014 our results indicated distinct seasonality in soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission in each year from 2006 to 2009 soil temperature is the one major factor controlling co2 emission in our results the co2 emission was low during winter when soil temperatures were low and while the emission started increasing during summer with increasing soil temperature in mid summer with soil temperature between 15 and 35 c the carbon dioxide emission rate was recorded higher in the simulation study period 2006 2009 at the athabasca river basin other research results showed a significant correlation between co2 emissions and soil temperature similar research studies found that soil temperature has been used to model the rate of co2 emission from peatland soils sihi et al 2018 euskirchen et al 2014 moore and dalva 1993 reported that with an increase in temperature from 10 c to 23 c carbon dioxide emissions had raised by a factor of 2 4 this showed that carbon dioxide emission is affected by temperature that will increase soil respiration during warmer temperature in peatlands schadel et al 2016 yvon durocher et al 2014 gill et al 2017 yadav and wang 2017 our study showed that the new swat module predicted the daily net ecosystem exchange groundwater table soil temperature and carbon dioxide very well this showed the capacity and robustness of the swat model in estimating watershed processes and the applicability the model to predict greenhouse gas emission 5 conclusions the swat model has been used globally to investigate the influence of anthropogenic and natural impacts on watershed processes however the model performance to evaluate the effects of snow and soil depth in carbon dioxide emission has not been studied in cold peatlands in canada therefore it is crucial to modify and apply the swat model capability in estimating carbon dioxide emission in the arb with large cold peatlands alberta canada we accounted explicitly for the important role of soil temperature and snow depth in carbon dioxide emission and the interaction between these parameters in cold peatlands of canada this study is the first in examining the swat model to predict carbon dioxide emission the cold river basin with large peatland areas in using data from the flux tower observation stations our swat model simulation results provide complementary information to the existing knowledge and experience of swat strength and weakness in the modeling watershed processes with large peatland areas such as snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission the swat model performance in predicting snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emissions were significantly captured this study confirmed that the swat model with careful parameterization to represent the interaction between snow cover soil temperature and carbon dioxide emissions overall the new modified swat module simulated carbon dioxide emission soil temperature

5396,peatlands cover only about 3 of the earth s surface and store 15 30 of the global soil carbon as a peat however human intervention and climate change threatens the stability of peatlands owing to deforest wildfire mining drainage glacial retreat and permafrost in our study we modified the swat model to couple snow soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission then the modified swat was used for predicting snow depth soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at athabasca river basin canada the results of the study indicated that swat model estimated the daily snow depth with r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 83 0 76 0 52 and 2 3 in the calibration period 2006 2007 and 0 79 0 71 0 97 and 3 6 for the validation period 2008 2009 respectively the swat model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths 5 cm 10 cm and 30 cm the simulation model results also confirmed that the modified swat model estimates the co2 emission at athabasca river basin with good model fit during calibration r2 0 71 nse 0 67 rmse 2 6 and pbias 3 2 and during validation r2 0 63 nse 0 58 rmse 3 1 and pbias 9 3 overall our result confirmed that swat model performed well in representing the dynamics of snow depth soil temperature and co2 emissions in the peatlands at the athabasca river basin keywords swat subroutine carbon dioxide snow depth soil temperature peatland 1 introduction northern peatlands play an important role in global carbon cycling as large stores of soil organic matter berger et al 2018 however northern peatlands are vulnerable to global warning due to decrease of snow cover areas change of snow cover duration permafrost and glacier retreat ipcc 2014 peatlands are important sources of derived dissolved organic carbon doc and nutrients in cold watersheds because they often are hydrologically well connected to creek and river systems burd et al 2018 although processes governing carbon dynamics in cold peatlands receive much attention to estimate global greenhouse gas emissions the responses of nutrient cycles to long term changed hydrological conditions such as snowmelt permafrost water table change and freeze thaw cycles are not well known because of large variability in time and space of various watershed water sources berger et al 2018 burd et al 2018 therefore there are increasing concerns how combined effects of soil temperature and snow melt on organic matter turnover and carbon dioxide emission in cold peatlands zhu et al 2014 many studies have been performed to study effects of snowpack and freezing and thaw cycles on co2 fluxes using closed chamber technique eddy covariance and modelling cui and wang 2019 dutta et al 2016 dutta et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 ruan and robertson 2017 showed that the change of freezing and thawing cycles and permafrost have a great influence on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics leading to carbon dioxide emissions the snow cover change also affects soil heat transfer and profile of temperatures soil temperature is an important factor of heterotrophic microbial activity in peatlands atnafe et al 2015 oertel et al 2016 zou et al 2018 the snow cover change during the spring season can be much higher than the other seasons this can shorten the duration of snow cover change of water table and peatland water areas and early permafrost this can further influence the nitrogen and carbon cycling kim et al 2007 brooks et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 in the past decades different models such as denitrification decomposition dndc and daycent have been used to quantify carbon dioxide emission at plot and large scale globally by several researchers balasubramanian et al 2017 cui and wang 2019 dutta et al 2016 gilhespy et al 2014 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however as point based land surface models these models might lead to uncertainties of predictions of snowmelt soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission some land surface models lsms at global scale have been developed such as orchidee organizing carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems environment jpj guess lund potsdam jena general ecosystem simulator and the clm community land model krinner et al 2005 murray tortarolo et al 2013 lawrence et al 2019 these lsms integrate soil carbon models to simulate future feedbacks between climate and global c and n cycles such as passim for orchidee qiu et al 2018 and daycent for clms lawrence et al 2019 these models are not efficient in modeling hydrological processes in the wetlands such as snowpack stream flow water table and soil temperature at different depths therefore there is a need to improve process based models swat to predict co2 emissions in the peatlands since hydrological processes may be dominant factors in affecting co2 emissions in river basins the soil and water assessment tool swat model has been applied worldwide to support sustainable land and water management in a changing climate arnold et al 2012 it has been applied globally for watershed modelling of water quality and sediment addis et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 n2o emissions shrestha et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 melaku et al 2020 and bacterial and nutrient transport meshesha et al 2020 akhavan et al 2010 however the existing peatland module of the swat is inadequate to account for snowmelt processes soil heat transfer peatland water table and processes of nutrient and trapped co2 in cold river basin with large peatland areas in this study we modify the swat model to consider the important factors of soil temperature snow melt and carbon dioxide emissions in cold peatlands we studied the complex interactions of these processes to improve our understanding of controls on seasonal variations of carbon dioxide emissions in the athabasca river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted from 2006 to 2009 at athabasca river basin west peatlands flux station fcrn fig 1 the research study area was located at 54 57 13 81 n latitude and 112 28 1 17 w longitude and at an altitude of 540 m above sea level alberta canada the climate of the area is categorized as sub humid which is classified as short cool summer and long cold winter alberta natural heritage information center 2005 the mean annual air

pumila ledum groenlandicum and salix sp coursolle et al 2006 the study area is also known with herbs and short shrub including menyanthese trifoliata carex sp empertrum nigrum andromeda polifolia oxycoccus microcarpus potentilla palustris rubus acaulis and smilacina trifolia coursolle et al 2006 qiu et al 2018 the athabasca river basin contain larger proportion of peatland classes theses classes occur in a single or in complex and mixed and are the principle wetlands in alberta s peatland zone fig 2 about 56 of the peatland area in the athabasca river basin is bogs and about 17 is comprised of tree fens and open fens the remaining contains mixed water bodies such as lakes fig 2 the data was obtained from flux canada research network fcrn which is easily accessible database in the ameriflux website https ameriflux lbl gov data download data with the necessary data policy https ameriflux lbl gov data data policy the measurements recorded at the flux tower station were co2

validation 2 2 the swat model soil and water assessment tool swat model is a continuous semi distributed process based watershed scale model arnold et al 2012 the swat model requires climate data soil land cover and land management data to simulate surface and subsurface hydrology pollutant loads chemicals nutrients and sediment fluxes addis et al 2016 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 due to its flexibility swat has been used in many parts of the world neitsch et al 2011 while the original model considers snowmelt hydrology fontaine et al 2002 the complex peatland processes is not explicitly reported furthermore the swat model need to account for the complex interaction of snowmelt processes soil heat transfer peatland water table and processes of co2 emission in the cold river basin with large peatland areas swat classifies precipitation as a rain or freezing rain snow by the mean daily air temperature if the mean daily air temperature is less than the boundary temperature then the precipitation within the hru is classified as snow and the water equivalent of the snow precipitation is added to the snowpack snow fall is stored at the ground surface in the form of a snowpack the snowpack will increase with additional snowfall or decrease with snow melt or sublimation the mass balance for snowpack is given in eq 1 1 sno s n o r day e sub sno melt where sno is the

melt on a given day mm h2o the amount of snow is expressed as depth over the total hru area in the modified swat model we coupled the nonlinear processes of snow accumulation melting and sublimation of the snomaus model developed by thornton et al 2000 and trnka et al 2010 within the swat modeling framework thus the snowmaus partitions rain snow and simulates snow accumulation were added with two parameters taccmix c represents that a portion of precipitation p mm is in the form of snow when the minimum air temperature tamin c is below taccmix and taccsnow c represents that all the

is a key ecosystem process that generate co2 from the soil carbon is stored in the soil as organic matter and is respired by plants bacteria fungi and animals soil co2 emission has two components the

validation processes in the swat model it is quite important to identify the key parameters and degree of precision required for calibration process arnold et al 2012 the most sensitive parameters for the model are given in table 1 consequently we considered these parameters for model calibration 3 2 precipitation and temperature the daily mean precipitation and mean daily temperature are depicted in fig 4 the figure showed the trend of precipitation and air temperature in the study area for the study period the temperature ranges from 35 c to 29 c where higher temperature was observed during summer season and lower air temperature was observed during winter season in the study period 2006 2009 the air temperature starts to increase in mid march reaching its maximum during july and august similarly the precipitation trend indicated that higher precipitation was observed in summer while lower precipitation was measured during winter fig 4 3 3 snow depth fig 5 displays the calibrated and validated snow depth at athabasca river basin during the study period 2006 2009 the snow depth began to develop in the middle of october at the peatlands of athabasca river basin the depth gradually increased and reached its maximum in late december and kept constant snow depth up to 65 cm the snow depth started to decline from late march to early april in all the study periods the snow depth observed in 2009 showed highest values while in 2006 showed lowest values fig 5 the snow depth observations were compared with the model results for the calibration and validation periods based on the comparison results the modified swat model showed that the simulated snow depth was fitted very well with the observed snow depth the model resulted an r2 of 0 83 during calibration 2006 2009 and 0 79 during validation 2008 2009 similarly the modified swat model resulted a very good model fit resulting nse value of 0 76 for the calibration period and 0 71 for the validation period the results of the study depicted that the measured and predicted snow depth was captured well the results showed optimal percent bias values during calibration pbias 2 3 and validation pbias 3 04 with low magnitude values indicating very good model fit fig 5 furthermore the simulated results showed very good model efficiency at athabasca river basin with an rmse of 0 52 during calibration and 0 97 during the validation period 3 4 soil temperature the swat model simulated the daily soil temperature with a very good correlation with the observed values figs 6 7 and 8 the trend between the observed and the simulated soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm results has been represented well in the simulation period as it can be confirmed with the corresponding r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 78 0 71 1 23 and 2 12 respectively fig 6 during calibration the results also showed good results of r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 72 0 67 2 15 and 3 21 for the validation period respectively similarly the simulated soil temperature results show that the model can predict the trend of observed soil temperature very well at 10 cm soil depth both during calibration and validation periods 2006 2009 fig 7 the simulation results of soil temperature at the depth of 30 cm showed very slight lower statistical values as compared to the 10 cm and 5 cm depths however the model efficiency stilled showed vey well model fit fig 8 overall soil temperature results showed a distinct seasonal variation in each year from 2006 to 2009 at three different depths based on the simulated results higher soil temperature was recorded in summer season and the lower was observed during winter where air temperature is low and snow cover presents the model results clearly indicate that soil temperature from the swat model are in good agreement with the measured soil temperature at all depths 5 cm 10 cm and 30 cm 3 5 carbon dioxide emission the simulated co2 results show that the model predicted the trend of observed daily co2 emission very well during the calibration 2006 2007 and validation 2008 2009 periods figs 9 and 10 the daily co2 calibration results gave an r2 nse rmse and pbias values of 0 71 0 67 2 6 and 3 2 respectively fig 9 comparison of simulated daily co2 emission with observed values showed that the magnitude co2 emission were very well estimated figs 9 and 10 the co2 emission showed similar order of magnitude as the measured co2 emissions during calibration fig 9 on the other side during the validation period there was a very slight variation on the magnitude and timing of peak carbon dioxide emission between the predicted and the observed values fig 10 the comparison of the measured and simulated results showed well model fit in the calibration and satisficed model fit for the validation periods figs 9 and 10 the model results gave a good statistical value in the simulation periods 2006 2009 the r2 value was 0 71 during calibration and 0 63 during validation which indicates that the model was capable in predicting the daily carbon dioxide emission the nse values also showed reasonably higher results both during calibration nse 0 67 and validation nse 0 58 compared with the flux tower measurements the predicted values by the swat model indicated very good statistical results with the observed data both during calibration and validation periods 3 6 the relationship between snow depth and co2 emission in this study we confirmed that co2 emission responded to snow depth potentially reflecting the contribution of increased co2 emission fig 11 the results in fig 11 showed a reasonable trend in snow depth and carbon dioxide emission over the study period 2006 2009 the trend shows that higher carbon dioxide emission was observed during midsummer where lower snow depth was observed on the other hand lower co2 emission was observed during the midwinter where lower snow depth was observed in the simulation periods 2006 2009 overall this study indicates that the swat model can capture the main trends of carbon dioxide emission and snow depth from peatlands in the canadian cold regions the swat model simulation results indicated that the estimated carbon dioxide emission using the modified subroutine agrees with the observed data at the athabasca river basin 3 7 spatial and temporal distribution of co2 emission fig 12 shows the temporal and spatial distribution of the average carbon dioxide emission from the delineated sub basins of the athabasca river basin canada the spatial and temporal variability of carbon dioxide emission has been reflected in the four major seasons fig 12 the distribution of carbon dioxide emission varied from each season despite the expected higher snow cover accompanied with low soil and air temperature in winter the carbon dioxide emission showed lower values in the winter season fig 12a however the emission becomes higher during spring period as snow melting starts fig 12b the swat model predicts the highest carbon dioxide emission during the summer season fig 12c while the emission starts to decrease in autumn fig 12d 4 discussions swat has been tested to investigate watershed processes in different agroecologies globally addis et al 2016 akhavan et al 2010 melaku et al 2018 melaku and wang 2019 leduc et al 2016 melaku et al 2020 with a very limited studies evaluating swat performance in modeling the impact of snow depth and soil temperature on co2 emission in the peatlands in our study the new modified swat subroutine predicted snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission very well these results indicate a very good model efficiency performance between the swat simulated and the observed daily snow depth soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission for both calibration and validation periods 2006 2009 in the cold regions of canada the analysis of the model results showed higher carbon dioxide emission during midsummer for the calibration periods and validation periods a study in central alberta reported that carbon dioxide emission is higher between june and august baah acheamfour et al 2016 indicating most soil carbon dioxide emissions were recorded between june and august in central alberta canada similarly other studies depicted that co2 emission higher as soil temperature increases renger et al 2002 wessolek et al 2002 mezbahuddin et al 2014 our results indicated distinct seasonality in soil temperature and carbon dioxide emission in each year from 2006 to 2009 soil temperature is the one major factor controlling co2 emission in our results the co2 emission was low during winter when soil temperatures were low and while the emission started increasing during summer with increasing soil temperature in mid summer with soil temperature between 15 and 35 c the carbon dioxide emission rate was recorded higher in the simulation study period 2006 2009 at the athabasca river basin other research results showed a significant correlation between co2 emissions and soil temperature similar research studies found that soil temperature has been used to model the rate of co2 emission from peatland soils sihi et al 2018 euskirchen et al 2014 moore and dalva 1993 reported that with an increase in temperature from 10 c to 23 c carbon dioxide emissions had raised by a factor of 2 4 this showed that carbon dioxide emission is affected by temperature that will increase soil respiration during warmer temperature in peatlands schadel et al 2016 yvon durocher et al 2014 gill et al 2017 yadav and wang 2017 our study showed that the new swat module predicted the daily net ecosystem exchange groundwater table soil temperature and carbon dioxide very well this showed the capacity and robustness of the swat model in estimating watershed processes and the applicability the model to predict greenhouse gas emission 5 conclusions the swat model has been used globally to investigate the influence of anthropogenic and natural impacts on watershed processes however the model performance to evaluate the effects of snow and soil depth in carbon dioxide emission has not been studied in cold peatlands in canada therefore it is crucial to modify and apply the swat model capability in estimating carbon dioxide emission in the arb with large cold peatlands alberta canada we accounted explicitly for the important role of soil temperature and snow depth in carbon dioxide emission and the interaction between these parameters in cold peatlands of canada this study is the first in examining the swat model to predict carbon dioxide emission the cold river basin with large peatland areas in using data from the flux tower observation stations our swat model simulation results provide complementary

through extensive analysis of location specific authentic dataset for sustaining natural resources although various physical models are available in estimating se and sy across river basins around the globe they contradict largely with each other particularly in requiring data variety for model adjustment and utilization li et al 2017 hajigholizadeh et al 2018 asheghi and hosseini 2020 some of these models like answers beasley et al 1980 creams knisel 1980 guest rose 2001 epic williams 1990 eurosem morgan et al 1998 and wepp flanagan and livingston 1995 are found to be highly capable of estimating hydrological and sedimentation processes more accurately using numerical equations smets et al 2008 defersha et al 2010 but these models are rarely suitable to fit with small to medium scale basin especially in the developing nations like india because of the unavailability of adequate spatial data merritt et al 2003 singh and panda 2017 kayet et al 2018 conversely the empirical models like universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised form rusle renard et al 1991 are widely being used to assess annual soil erosion over small to large scales river basins in india mostly because of their strong fundamental model structure and low data requirement shinde et al 2010 parveen and kumar 2012 balasubramani et al 2015 thomas et al 2018 the six principal factors i e the rainfall runoff erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k slope length and steepness factor ls cover management factor c conservation practice factor p are used to represent surface qualities responsible for soil erosion as per the rusle renard et al 1994 similarly sediment yield sy studies are important for investigating the relationship between soil erosion and suspended sediment transport in the basins sediment yield refers to the normalized sediment load specific sediment yield ssy in a drainage basin per year xin et al 2011 as the usle and its revised form rusle measure only soil erosion irrespective of sediment transport and deposition the sediment delivery ratio sdr or sediment transport capacity stc model generally being coordinated with usle or rusle to estimate the se and ssy simultaneously jain and kothyari 2000 thomas et al 2018 the sediment yield process in a drainage basin mainly controlled by soil erosion and sediment delivery influenced by location specific physical factors like climate local topography lithology basin morphology drainage network characteristics and lulc types restrepo et al 2006 syvitski and milliman 2007 besides the knowledge of sediment yield and its controlling factors bear useful information for developing quantitative models of landform evolution dynamic soil quality studies sediment budget and fluvial dynamics studies as well as for estimating net erosion intensities within a river basin de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 many studies so far attempted to estimate sediment yield in terms of the combined effect of the morphometric climatic and hydrologic variables of drainage basins restrepo et al 2006 tamene et al 2006 molina et al 2012 various multivariate regression techniques long being used to understand the impacts of different geo environmental attributes on sediment generation and yield in different studies restrepo et al 2006 tamene et al 2006 grauso et al 2008 de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 however highly collinear basin characteristics like topography landuse geology and soil properties are often confounded correlation and thus generate potential erroneous results this limitation of handling multicollinear redundant data can be excluded by adopting multivariate statistical projection techniques the partial least square regression plsr is a technique that combines principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regressions mlr wold et al 2001 abdi 2010 the plsr can handle highly correlated variable by assuming dependency among the variables and estimating the underlying structures which have essentially linear combinations of the original variables carrascal et al 2009 besides the plsr is particularly suitable for multivariate problems when the number of observations is less than the number of possible predictors onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2013 many of the river basins including konar in india are un gagged therefore adoption of any gis based statistical model is imperative to understand the soil erosion and sedimentation process quantitively previous studies jain and kothyari 2000 kothyari et al 2002 shinde et al 2010 conducted in india were only limited to quantify the rate of se and ssy but this information is not enough to implement any management strategy spatially in a river basin there are some other influential basin parameters e g basin morphology drainage network topography lulc that control the rate of erosion and sedimentation spatially de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 information of those crucial parameters in a river basin helps better understanding the processes involved as well as for adopting any soil conservation measures therefore the plsr analysis has been introduced in this study along with rusle sdr model combination in order to comprehensively assess the se and ssy dynamics besides physical parameter dependent model based studies like usle or rusle coupled with sediment delivery ratio sdr are still limited in and around the area apart no initiative has been found to identify most serious factors for se and ssy based on plsr analysis therefore the specific objectives emphasized on to i estimate the se and ssy at sub basin scale ii investigate the relationship between the basin specific parameters and the se and ssy using plsr and iii model the ssy using most important variable at the basin level 2 materials and methods 2 1 geo environmental set up of the konar basin the konar basin 23 51 23 25 n 24 8 26 83 n and 85 14 32 93 e 85 47 10 54 e covering 94 3 thousand hectares th ha

from 418 m to 930 m while major slope directed towards east the predominant sub tropical climate brings more than 1300 mm rainfall annually majority 80 of which occur in the form of southwest monsoon rainfall june september during peak summer maximum temperature goes up to 46 c and in winter season minimum temperature drops down to 4 c large scale deforestation for rapid industrial growth in the area particularly during past few decades resulted multifarious consequences like exposing lands to weathering and erosion rapid loss of fertile topsoil formation of gullies and ravines siltation in river beds and dams and thereby reduced their water holding capacities choudhury 2011 ghosh 2011 2 2 data sources multifarious source of data has been used to accomplish the objectives of this study the cloud free landsat 8 satellite image at 30 m spatial resolution december 2016 sourced from http earthexplorer usgs gov to prepare the lulc map of the basin the survey of india soi topographical sheets 72h 8 72h 12 73e 5 73e 9 73e 13 having 10 m and 20 m contour intervals were employed for the generation of digital elevation model dem soil taxonomy of the basin adopted from indian council of agricultural research national bureau of soil survey and land use planning icar nbss and lup kolkata fig 3 a high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset was sourced from indian meteorological department imd www imd gov in to compute rainfall runoff erosivity factor r a total of 34 geo referenced surface soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm depth using the stratified random sampling methods from different lulc and soil taxonomy classes to estimate soil erodibility factor k across the basin fig 1 to validate the estimated sediment yield of the model the input sediment yield data obtained through round the year ground sampling at the outlet of two sub basins sub basin no 30 and 35 sampling basins were selected based on wide variation of lulc and suitable positions for installation of the gauge besides the input data for identifying the potential influencing basin parameters were collected from individual sub basins for this purpose dem annual rainfall lulc and soil analysis data has been used to extract the basin morphology drainage network topography climate lulc pattern and different soil parameters the abbreviation and description of the individual basin parameters are given in table 1 2 3 methods the rusle coupled with sdr model has been used to generate spatial dimensions of soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy across the sub basins contours and spot heights of the basin were digitized from the topographical sheets and then the vector elevation map was initially calculated to tin triangulated irregular network in the next step the tin file was converted to a raster file with a grid cell size of 30 m 30 m in arc gis v10 2 software environment to generate dem a total of 35 sub basins were identified using archydro tool in arcgis v10 2 software environment fig 1 the input parameters for rusle estimated through analyzing the data of dem rainfall soil type and lulcs supervised learning technique with maximum likelihood classification was used to prepare lulc map of the basin following standard procedures patil et al 2012 the kappa coefficient k of accuracy assessment was within the acceptable value of k 0 82 p 0 05 with an overall accuracy of 84 83 cohen 1960 anderson et al 1976 thomlinson et al 1999 collected soil samples were air dried ground sieved and analyzed for soil physical and chemical properties particle size analysis was carried out using the hydrometer method beverwijk 1967 then the textural group was determined by the texture triangle usda soil taxonomy 1975 shahri et al 2015 shahri 2016 ghaderi et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc content was measured from 0 5 mm sieved samples following rapid titration method walkley and black 1934 soil structure and permeability were determined following the ontario centre for soil resource evaluation wall et al 2002 the severity of soil erosion t ha 1year 1 classified as slight 0 5 moderate 5 10 high 10 20 very high 20 40 severe 40 80 and very severe 80 following dabral et al 2008 for the analysis of slope dependent soil erosion slope zones were categorised as gentle 0 5 moderate 5 15 steep 15 25 steep moderate 25 40 and very steep 40 following koulouri and giourga 2007 finally we employed the partial least square regression plsr model abdi 2010 to identify most influencing basin parameters a total of 32 independent variables were considered as basin descriptors while the dependent variables were se and ssy the overall methodology adopted in the present study is schematically presented in fig 4 2 3 1 revised universal soil loss equation rusle the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised edition rusle renard et al 1991 are long being used to predict long period rates of rill and inter rill erosion under different management practices around the globe ganasri and ramesh 2016 singh and panda 2017 kayet et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 like other data scarce regions we considered it as an effective runoff dependent soil erosion model requiring limited data for our study area haile and fetene 2012 prasannakumar et al 2012 apart it is assumed as one of the cost effective methods particularly for model validation purpose in the present study haile and fetene 2012 prasannakumar et al 2012 soil erosion in our study estimated using the following rusle eq 1 1 s e r k l s c p where se is the estimated spatial average soil erosion per unit area t ha 1 yr 1 r denotes the rainfall runoff erosivity factor mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 k represents the soil erodibility factor t h mj 1 mm 1 ls holds the slope length and steepness factor c is the cover management factor and p identifies the conservation support practice factor the rusle was enhanced by revising the r and k factor depending on seasons revising the ls based on rill and inter rill erosion and with the c factor renard et al 1991 2 3 2 the rainfall runoff erosivity factor r r factor requires storm kinetic energy e and maximum 30 min storm depth i30 data however in the absence of authentic rainfall datasets indirect methods are generally suggested to estimate r factor using monthly or annual average rainfall data wischmeier and smith 1978 brown and foster 1986 thus the spatially distributed r factor is estimated using eq 2 singh et al 1981 2 r 79 0 363 x a r 0 83 where r is the annual erosivity index xa denotes annual average rainfall mm annual average rainfall over the basin is derived from high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset pai et al 2014 the r factor value computed from average rainfall representing the grid cell area 2 3 3 soil erodibility factor k soil erodibility factor k explains the effects of soil inherent properties profile depth soil texture organic matter content on soil erosion rate wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1991 the k factor of the individual soil sample was estimated following the eq 3 semmahasak 2014 3 k 2 1 10 4 12 o m m 1 14 3 25 s 2 2 5 p 3 0 0759 where om stands for organic matter m represents particle size distribution sand silt clay s denotes soil structural classes 1 very fine granular 2 fine granular 3 medium or coarse granular 4 blocky platy or massive p for permeability classes 1 rapid 2 moderate to rapid 3 moderate 4 slow to moderate 5 slow 6 very slow the spatial distribution of k factor is then produced by using kriging interpolation method 2 3 4 slope length and steepness factor ls the ls factor indicates the effects of topography on se which is dimensionless and obtained by using eq 4 desmet and govers 1996 4 l ij a ij i n d 2 m 1 a ij m 1 i n d m 2 x ij m 22 13 m where a ij i n is the contributing area at the inlet of grid cell ij measured in m 2 d is the grid cell size meters x i j sin a j cos a j the a i j indicates aspect direction of the grid cell i j m is the coefficient that represnts the ratio of rill and interrill erosion ranges between 0 and 1 to take advantage of dem and gis procedures desmet and govers 1996 proposed the upslope area which is approximated simply using flow accumulation to replace the slope linear length similarly the slope steepness factor s is defined as the ratio of se from the field slope gradient to unit field area wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1991 the equation is as follows mccool et al 1987 5 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 g r a d i e n t 9 6 s sin θ 0 0896 0 6 g r a d i e n t 9 the ls factor thus ascertained utilizing the eqs 4 5 and 6 on the digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution 2 3 5 cover management factor c c factor depends on the lulc characteristics of the basin it is defined as the ratio of se from crop land to the se from clean tilled fallow wischmeier and smith 1978 the lulc map was reclassified based on c factor values collected from previous research bakker et al 2008 märker et al 2008 kuok et al 2013 ganasri and ramesh 2016 table 2 2 3 6 conservation practice factor p p factor is defined as the ratio of se from upslope and downslope under each agricultural conservation practices wischmeier and smith 1978 the p factor values are assigned based on cultivation methods and slope aspect as proposed by shin 1999 table 3 the values closer to 0 indicate good conservation while for upper values it is vice versa 2 3 7 sediment yield estimation 2 3 7 1 sediment delivery ratio sdr approach the annual specific sediment yield of the basin was estimated by multiplying the se with the sdr as expressed in eq 7 fistikoglu and harmancioglu 2003 7 ssy se sdr where ssy is the specific sediment yield t ha 1 yr 1 sdr is the sediment delivery ratio and se is the soil erosion rklscp gross erosion per unit area above a measuring point the sdr for a cell i calculated from the sediment connectivity index ic following vigiak et al 2012 the ic was initially defined by borselli et al 2008 as follows 8 i c l o g 10 d u p d d n l o g 10 w s a i d i w i s i where dup and ddn are the upslope and downslope components of the connectivity w is the average weighting factor of the upslope contributing area s indicates average slope gradient of the up slope contributing area m m a is the upslope contributing area m2 di is the length of the flow path along the ith cell according to the steepest downslope direction m wi and si are the weighting factor and the slope gradient of the ith cell respectively in our model ic0 have been set to 0 5 and k equal to 2 after calibrating the model the c factor map has been used for the weighting factor as suggested by borselli et al 2008 sdr thus computed for the ith cell using eq 9 vigiak et al 2012 9 s d r i s d r m a x 1 e i c 0 i c i k 2 3 7 2 specific sediment yield ssy measurement to validate the estimated specific sediment yield suspended sediment load was measured at the outlet of the sub basin of k sb 30 and k sb 35 in 2016 during monsoon months june september since majority of the annual rainfall 80 occurs this time a gauge was attached to a bridge pier and water levels were monitored near the measuring point twice daily but during high flow frequent water levels were monitored river discharge q measured with current meter and float method a correction factor 0 8 was used in float method to estimate average channel segment velocity from its surface velocity hauet et al 2008 stream water samples were taken using usdh 48 depth integrated suspended sediment sampler at two times in a day at 6 00 and 17 00 h but during high flow 5 7 samples were taken in 500 ml pre washed sample collection bottles the collected samples were filtered by pre weighted 0 45 µm membrane filter paper and then air dried to separate the suspended sediment in the laboratory the filtered samples were further oven dried for 24 h at 110 c and the samples were weighed using the electronic balance in normal temperature finally the discharge rating curve gauge height vs discharge and suspended sediment rating curve suspended sediment concentration ssc vs q were plotted for two sub basins separately suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspended sediment loads ssl were computed following the standard procedure guyot et al 1996 semmahasak 2014 the ssc and q generally have a power equation of the form eq 10 10 s s c a q b 11 s s l q s s c 0 0864 where ssl q and ssc measured in tonnes day 1 m3s 1 and mg liter 1 respectively the coefficient value of ssc was 0 0864 based on the unit of measurement of q the total ssl is then divided by the area to get the ssy in the basin 2 3 8 identification of potential variables influencing specific sediment yield ssy based on the location specific characteristics as well as reviewing previous literature a total of 32 variables were assumed to be potential for se and ssy in the basin restrepo et al 2006 tamene et al 2006 haregeweyn et al 2008 de vente et al 2011 xin et al 2011 shi et al 2013 shahri et al 2019 these variables were categorised into basin morphology drainage network topography climate land use composition land use pattern and soil properties table 1 all these variables were calculated using the equation provided in table 1 dem was used to calculate the parameters of basin morphology drainage network and topography annual rainfall data was used to prepare the climatic factors for the calculation of land use pattern fragstat 2 0 software and lulc map of the study area have been used soil properties raster maps were prepared using kriging interpolation method as suggested by addis and klik 2015 and bhunia et al 2018 spatial resolution pixel size was set at 30 m with a total of 104 799 pixels to match other raster maps in the study area cross validation technique was adopted to evaluate the performance of the interpolation method root mean square error for percent of sand silt and clay was less than 15 normality has been tested for each parameter with the shapiro wilk test otherwise logarithmically transformed shapiro wilk 1965 finally partial least square regression plsr was performed to predict the se and ssy using screened predictors of the basin to avoid over fitting the appropriate number of factors of the plsr model was determined using the leave one out cross validation and van der voet s t2 test van der voet 1994 variable importance for projection vip statistic of wold et al 2001 has been used to identify the most important basin variables 3

paleustalfs fine loamy and typic rhodustalfs class 102 occupied the majority of the basin area by accounting nearly 42 9 th ha 44 9 within which the k factor ranged from 0 3 to 0 37 t h mj 1 mm 1 with an average of 0 34 t h mj 1 mm 1 fig 3a and fig 5b conversely the loamy skeletal lithic ustorthents and fine loamy typic haplustalfs taxonomical attributes class 103 spread across only 1 5 th ha 1 6 of basin area having average k factor of 0 27 t h mj 1 mm 1 along a small patch in the northern tip of the basin the minimum k factor 0 2 t h mj 1 mm 1 observed across the sub basins number 11 17 in the northeastern pocket attributed with fine typic paleustalfs fine loamy and typic rhodustalfs taxonomic characteristics fig 3a and fig 5b similarly the higher ls factor value 1 observed in the southeastern portion and along few small patches in the south particularly along high hill slopes and summits while majority of remaining 85 7 th ha area 90 9 attributed with comparatively lower ls value of 1 fig 5c the c factor varied from 0 to 0 5 where the higher values 0 3 0 5 distributed across wasteland and agricultural areas mostly located in the northwestern part while comparatively lower values 0 0 0 04 observed across the forest and shrubs lands in the southeastern portion of the basin fig 3b and fig 5d likewise the p factor varied from 0 1 to 1 0 in the agricultural areas mostly in the northwestern and southwestern intermountain valleys depending on slope and erosion management practices fig 5e 3 2 sediment delivery ratio sdr the sdr varied from 0 08 to 0 73 across the basin with averaged over grid cells being 0 12 spatially the higher sdr values measured in and around the river channel and hillslope areas particularly in the low elevated 500 m plateau fringe areas in the east while the lower sdr was recorded in the outward of the river channel in the plateau proper along the basin periphery and ridges fig 6 a 3 3 soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy the soil erosion se in the basin varied from 0 to 729 4 t ha 1 yr 1 with an average of 4 42 t ha 1yr 1 fig 6b moderate to very high 5 40 0 t ha 1 yr 1 annual rate of soil erosion measured across the wastelands in the northwest and southwest portion comprising sub basin no 1 10 20 26 28 and 33 compared to other lulcs likewise severe erosion 40 80 t ha 1 yr 1 observed along wastelands with small patches of shrubs in the southwestern section comprising sub basin no 19 21 23 25 30 32 and 35 fig 3b and fig 6b c the specific sediment yield ssy ranged from 0 to 97 7 t ha 1 yr 1 with an average of 0 12 t ha 1yr 1 comparatively higher ssy in the channels measured near the confluence in the southeastern corner consisting sub basin no 17 25 30 32 and 34 35 fig 6d other major lulcs have slight to negligible contribution in se and ssy accounting 10 0 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 3 t ha 1 yr 1 in agricultural areas 3 7 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 in built up areas 2 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1in shrubs land 0 16 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 01 t ha 1 yr 1 in forest areas naturally no se and ssy were measured in ponded water bodies the se severity dimension revealed that a large proportion of the valley area 71 0 66 9 th ha was prone to slight 5t ha 1 yr 1 erosion while only 2 0 and 0 6 ga nearly 1 9 th ha and 0 6 th ha were in the severe and very severe 40 80 t ha 1 yr 1 80 t ha 1 yr 1 risk of soil erosion as well as sediment generation table 4 slope gradient wise soil erosion intensity analysis showed that slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 erosion has largely occurred on gentle 5 slope terrain by occupying nearly 77 4 73 0 th ha of the ga while 0 4 ga 0 4 th ha on steep terrain 15 25 prone to slight intensities of erosion very severe 80 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion found to be maximum 0 4 th ha 0

gradient prone to erosion since majority of those areas devoted to intensive agricultural practices and remaining has left as barren or as wasteland which are easy to be eroded by intense rainfall and runoff area weighted se and ssy at sub basin scale ranged from 0 94 to 8 18 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 02 to 0 7 t ha 1 yr 1 where se found to be maximum in sub basin no 25 and 32 at 7 t ha 1 yr 1 besides predicted rate of se and ssy revealed three fold higher 11 96 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 38 t ha 1 yr 1 on steep 15 25 slopes than gentle 5 slopes 3 97 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 respectively 3 4 validation of the rusel sdr model simulation because of the absence of any experimental erosion plot in the basin the model estimated se in this study validated with the field visit and previous studies performed in the similar region with resembled geo environmental attributes pandey et al 2007 shinde et al 2010 parveen and kumar 2012 our estimated mean erosion 4 4 t ha 1yr 1 was more or less similar with the reported value of 3 7 and 4 2 t ha 1yr 1 for karso mohgaon river basin from the same indian state jharkhand under similar geo environmental setting 1192 1300 mm annual rainfall and 390 934 m altitude pandey et al 2007 our results also corroborated with the findings of balasubramani et al 2015 from andipatti basin 5 3 t ha 1yr 1 of south india tamil nadu 698 948 mm rainfall and 400 m elevation from mean sea level though wider range rainfall relief 1300 1550 mm rainfall and 430 2540 m from mean sea level dominated higher erosion rate also exists in pambar river basin 11 7 t ha 1yr 1 kerala and south koel basin 12 2 t ha 1yr 1 jharkhand parveen and kumar 2012 thomas et al 2018 shinde et al 2010 reported 2 6 times lower rate of erosion 1 7 t ha 1yr 1 for the same river basin of konar such a wide range of deviation may result because of their limited number of variable consideration and different method of parameterization the plotted rating curve based and model simulated statistics of two sub basins consider for model validation purpose revealed that the trend of discharge q wise suspended sediment concentration ssc has significantly p 0 001 strong coefficient of determination r2 0 64 0 73 for both the sub basin k sb 30 and k sb 35 fig 7 and table 6 the rusle sdr model predicted ssy were 0 30 and 0 29 t ha 1 yr 1 which measured to be 0 26 and 0 39 t ha 1 yr 1 on the rating curve for ksb 30 and 35 respectively thus the ssy is over estimated by 0 04 t ha 1yr 1 15 39 in model prediction for ksb 30 which under estimated in ksb 35 by 0 10 t ha 1yr 1 25 64 therefore the precision of rusle sdr model found to be highly satisfied with respect to the widely contradicted and uncertain model performance around the globe wu et al 1993 wicks and bathurstbt 1996 jain and kothyari 2000 3 5 basin controlling variables and their correlation with specific sediment yield ssy the ssy and sediment delivery ratio sdr varied substantially across sub basins however the ssy was more sensitive cv 121 8 to those basin controlling variables than the sdr cv 70 9 the basin physical and hydrological indices like the patch cohesion index cohe mean elevation hmean topographic wetness index twi erosivity factor r factor mean annual precipitation p percentage of sand and silt weakly varied cv 15 whereas ssy sdr mean slope gradient s basin relief hd basin area a total stream length sl varied widely cv 70 across the basin the preliminary pearson correlation studies in fig 8 showed that the basin properties like the patch and edge density pd and ed of landuse pattern percentage of wasteland and ssy had significant p 0 01 moderate to strong correlations r 0 4 0 8 with area specific soil erosion se similarly the most important explanatory variables for ssy are sdr pd hmean r factor p and percentage of shrubs land r 0 50 to 0 94 p 0 01 multi co linearity also observed among basin properties for example the basin morphological parameters like a basin perimeter peri basin length bl and sl were strongly correlated with each other similarly the basin soil variables like soil erodibility factor k factor percentage of sand silt and clay showed a strong correlation among them strong positive correlations of climatic variables p and r factor have explained their importance in se and ssy in the basin 3 6 identification of important basin controlling variables for se and ssy through plsr analysis in the se model cross validation test cvtest returned 3 factors f1 f3 having non significant t2 where α 0 1 apart the root mean press 0

5 of the variance while the first three factors f1 f3 explained 78 2 of the variance altogether in the case of ssy the f1 explained 72 0 of the variance while f1 and f2 jointly explained 82 7 of the variance the root mean press 0 5 was minimum at two factors fig 9b in the correlation loading plots the predictor variables were plotted in blue color fig 9c and d percent variations in each variable accounted by the desired factors depicted in concentric circles a variable s distance from the center indicated how well it was predicted by the factors a peri shdi bl and ed were highly weighted f1 variables in se model having high positive correlations r 0 68 0 80 similarly s r factor p and rr were positively correlated r 0 65 0 86 with the f2 fig 9c notwithstanding that the sdr p and r factor were highly correlated r 0 82 0 85 with f1 in ssy model whereas k factor percentage of clay silt were strongly correlated r 0 77 0 79 with f2 fig 9d considering the variable importance for the

optimal plsr model eq 12 was validated using the plot comparing the actual rusle based and predicted plsr based ssy the r2 and q2 cum value of the ssy 0 79 0 69 model indicated good predictive ability

spatial resolution have been used to estimate the annual soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy in the konar basin because of the higher annual rainfall concentration over the eastern part of the basin measured rainfall runoff erosivity r was maximum 550 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in this direction however the soil erodibility k measures showed spatially opposite pattern over r which found to be maximum 0 3 0 37 t h mj 1 mm 1 in a vast area in the west and southwest direction of the basin such spatial organization of k measure may be because of the highly erosion sensitive taxonomic nature of the fine loamy typic paleustalfs and rhodustalfs soil in this area class 102 and 104 fig 3a and fig 5b the high sensitivity of k to coarse loamy texture is also reported from the nearby barakar basin of jharkhand biswas and pani 2015 on the contrary loamy lithic ustorthents fine typic rhodustalfs and fine loamy ultic haplustalfs type soil in the north eastern part of the basin favored moderate leaching and infiltration process and thereby resulted lower k factor values 0 2 t h mj 1 mm 1 fig 3a and fig 5b higher c measure 0 3 0 5 across wasteland and agricultural areas in the northwestern part because of the less vegetation canopy and ground covers that lead to higher susceptibility to erosion renard et al 1994 semmahasak 2014 conversely dense forests in the east and northeast direction c 0 002 subject to slight soil erosion 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 due to the semi impermeable organic residual rich layer of topsoil that considerably restricted runoff to soil erosion fig 3b fig 5d and fig 6b c thus the relative impact of management options in basin might easily be compared with changing pattern of c factor distribution which varies from near zero for a well protected land cover to 1 for barren areas cultivated lands in the basin are mostly on the gentle and moderate slopes the soil surface and soil structure particularly in agricultural areas along gentle and moderate slopes were disturbed by improper cropping practices thus the impact of c factor on soil erosion seems to have great significance as the lulc system in the basin accounted higher proportion of wasteland and agricultural areas 14 5 th ha and 18 4 th ha fig 3b and fig 5d considerable amount of soil loss generally occurred during monsoon months june september as soon as the dry land crops are harvested and the fields bring into plowing activity again as a result a vast proportion of the basin 77 4 of the ga felled into slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion especially on gentle 5 slope gradients a higher proportion of soil erosion across the agricultural field in gentle and moderate slopes also documented from different regions of the globe liu et al 2013 ostovari et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 large scale deforestation overgrazing and over tillage have sharply increased wasteland 14 5 in between 1976 and 2004 that leads to accelerated soil erosion and land degradation in konar basin sanyal et al 2014 in our study the plsr model successfully identified the most influential variables for se and ssy with reasonable accuracy from highly correlated environmental data unlike other traditional statistical methods for instance de vente et al 2011 applied multiple linear regression model to find out the controlling factors e g topography climate vegetation lithology soil properties on sediment yield their result showed that the model was unstable and not performed well due to nonlinear relation presents between the sediment yield and environmental variables likewise grauso et al 2008 stated that the application of the regression model did not yield accurate results for the prediction of sediment yield in a range of italian catchments although the use of lumped regression for understanding and prediction of sediment yield at the catchment scale is found in the works of different researchers e g syvitski and milliman 2007 restrepo et al 2006 grauso et al 2008 tamene et al 2006 a wide variation in model performance limits their applicability in some specific areas only the positive regression coefficient b 0 1 0 16 of mean slope gradient s basin relief hd sediment delivery ratio sdr patch density pd edge density ed hypsometric integral hi topographic wetness index twi among the very important basin variables vip 1 indicated that soil erosion will increase with the increasing the value of these variables fig 10a by definition pd and ed reflected the degree of forest fragmentation increase when many small patches of lulc type gradually occupied the basin shi et al 2013 thus highly fragmented forest cover encouraged soil erosion by declining infiltration and thereby generating high volume surface runoff ouyang et al 2010 shi et al 2013 alike our study s and hd are found to be important variables for se in many other basins around the globe montgomery and brandon 2002 tamene et al 2006 vijith and dodge wan 2019 when it was talking about the mean specific sediment yield ssy of the basin it was very low 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to the mean soil loss 4 42 t ha 1 yr 1 this may be because of the deposition of a considerable amount of sediment in places before reaching the outlet fang et al 2015 the major proportion of the basin area 71 ga was affected by the slight risk of soil erosion 0 5 t ha 1 yr 1 while 86 of the basin area dominated by low sediment yield along gentle slopes 0 5 table 5 and fig 6d estimated mean erosion 4 4 t ha 1yr 1 was corroborated with the reported value of 3 7 and 4 2 t ha 1yr 1 for karso and mohgaon river basin from the same indian state jharkhand under similar geo environmental setting 1192 1300 mm annual rainfall and 390 934 m altitude pandey et al 2007 however it was deviated by 2 74 t ha 1 yr 1 from the reported loss 1 68 t ha 1 yr 1 in the same basin shinde et al 2010 such deviation may be because of the adoption of different rusle parameters or ever changing lulc pattern that has not been well reflected in their study such anomaly has already been addressed in penultimate section 3 4 in this study the higher coefficients b and vip values in plsr suggested that the sediment delivery ratio sdr mean annual precipitation p patch density pd mean slope gradient s and basin relief hd b 0 12 0 22 were important variables vip 1 2 2 3 in generating ssy in the basin fig 10b the similar results also found in the works of tamene et al 2006 where they have applied principal component analysis and reported that 80 of the variability of the sediment yield could be explained by hd and percentage of agricultural land in highlands of northern ethiopia by analyzing sy dynamics of 280 major river basins around the globe syvitski and milliman 2007 reported that the physiographic and climatic features s hd and r were highly impactful for subtropical river basins like our study r factor also considered as crucial in generating sy in different regions fang et al 2015 the lulc attribute like pd in particular played an important role in sedimentation characteristics in this study by changing the speed of the runoff and sediment transportation like most of the river basin shi et al 2013 some effective conclusions of the study could be drawn with the exclusion of multicollinear and redundant data in the plsr analysis in the ssy model only six independent predictors sdr pd s hmean r factor and p were selected from 32 basin properties of morphometric s hmean climatic r factor and p and lulc pattern pd however in se model the basin morphology a peri bl drainage network sl topography s hd twi hi lulc composition forest and wasteland and lulc pattern ed pd contag shdi were identified as important vip 1 basin properties table 1 5 conclusions in this study we have comprehensively assessed the dimensions of annual soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy by investigating the role of basin characteristics in the konar basin using rusle sdr parameters besides the basin characteristics that have contributed significantly in ssy identified using plsr procedure which thought to be relatively insensitive to confounding relationships among predictor variables despite the higher concentration of rainfall runoff erosivity r factor in the eastern part highly erosion sensitive taxonomic nature coarse loamy texture of the soil made the western part more prone to soil erosion by exhibiting higher k measures over r factor in the vast area in this direction in addition to this the wasteland and agricultural activities in this area produced less vegetation canopy and ground covers that lead to higher susceptibility of erosion higher c measures a large proportion of forest covers in the east and northeast portion restricted soil erosion improper cropping practices along gentle and moderate slopes considerably hampered the dynamic soil properties like breaking down the soil texture and structural components which have attributed slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion especially on gentle 5 slope gradients over the vast proportion of the basin 77 4 very low 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 ssy of the basin compared to the mean soil loss 4 42 t ha 1 yr 1 indicated that a large proportion of eroded sediment deposited in the places of river beds before it reaches into confluence among the basin physical parameters the sediment delivery ratio sdr mean annual precipitation p erosivity factor r factor patch density pd mean slope gradient s and basin relief hd found to be important variables in generating sediment yield in the basin

yield sy across the river basins particularly in the tropical and sub tropical regions issaka and ashraf 2017 soils have been more exposed to water erosion in recent decades mostly because of the rapidly changing land use and land cover lulc composition particularly through intensive agricultural practices and deforestation gomiero 2016 besides burgeoning population pressure related unplanned land utilizations as well as infrastructural development by replacing forest cover aggravating the issues of soil erosion across countries pimentel and burgess 2013 razali et al 2018 despite soil disintegration directly impacts huge sediment generation and rapid sedimentation in river basins it is estimated that nearly 1964 4million hectares m ha of global soils are affected by human induced degradation of which 1903 m ha is subject to aggravate by water erosion bhattacharyya et al 2015 pal 2016 being located in the humid subtropical region soil erosion in india is one of the burning threats to fertile topsoil as per the estimates of national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss and lup nearly 45 146 8 m ha of the geographical area ga of the country ga 328 7 m ha is prone to soil erosion majority of which dominated by surface runoff bhattacharyya et al 2015 as a result around 74 million tons of major nutrients loss annually which equivalent to the annual loss of about 68 billion rupees in terms of crop productivity land use intensity and changing cropping pattern lal 2015 bhattacharyya et al 2015 therefore the accelerated soil erosion needs to be managed through extensive analysis of location specific authentic dataset for sustaining natural resources although various physical models are available in estimating se and sy across river basins around the globe they contradict largely with each other particularly in requiring data variety for model adjustment and utilization li et al 2017 hajigholizadeh et al 2018 asheghi and hosseini 2020 some of these models like answers beasley et al 1980 creams knisel 1980 guest rose 2001 epic williams 1990 eurosem morgan et al 1998 and wepp flanagan and livingston 1995 are found to be highly capable of estimating hydrological and sedimentation processes more accurately using numerical equations smets et al 2008 defersha et al 2010 but these models are rarely suitable to fit with small to medium scale basin especially in the developing nations like india because of the unavailability of adequate spatial data merritt et al 2003 singh and panda 2017 kayet et al 2018 conversely the empirical models like universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised form rusle renard et al 1991 are widely being used to assess annual soil erosion over small to large scales river basins in india mostly because of their strong fundamental model structure and low data requirement shinde et al 2010 parveen and kumar 2012 balasubramani et al 2015 thomas et al 2018 the six principal factors i e the rainfall runoff erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k slope length and steepness factor ls cover management factor c conservation practice factor p are used to represent surface qualities responsible for soil erosion as per the rusle renard et al 1994 similarly sediment yield sy studies are important for investigating the relationship between soil erosion and suspended sediment transport in the basins sediment yield refers to the normalized sediment load specific sediment yield ssy in a drainage basin per year xin et al 2011 as the usle and its revised form rusle measure only soil erosion irrespective of sediment transport and deposition the sediment delivery ratio sdr or sediment transport capacity stc model generally being coordinated with usle or rusle to estimate the se and ssy simultaneously jain and kothyari 2000 thomas et al 2018 the sediment yield process in a drainage basin mainly controlled by soil erosion and sediment delivery influenced by location specific physical factors like climate local topography lithology basin morphology drainage network characteristics and lulc types restrepo et al 2006 syvitski and milliman 2007 besides the knowledge of sediment yield and its controlling factors bear useful information for developing quantitative models of landform evolution dynamic soil quality studies sediment budget and fluvial dynamics studies as well as for estimating net erosion intensities within a river basin de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 many studies so far attempted to estimate sediment yield in terms of the combined effect of the morphometric climatic and hydrologic variables of drainage basins restrepo et al 2006 tamene et al 2006 molina et al 2012 various multivariate regression techniques long being used to understand the impacts of different geo environmental attributes on sediment generation and yield in different studies restrepo et al 2006 tamene et al 2006 grauso et al 2008 de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 however highly collinear basin characteristics like topography landuse geology and soil properties are often confounded correlation and thus generate potential erroneous results this limitation of handling multicollinear redundant data can be excluded by adopting multivariate statistical projection techniques the partial least square regression plsr is a technique that combines principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regressions mlr wold et al 2001 abdi 2010 the plsr can handle highly correlated variable by assuming dependency among the variables and estimating the underlying structures which have essentially linear combinations of the original variables carrascal et al 2009 besides the plsr is particularly suitable for multivariate problems when the number of observations is less than the number of possible predictors onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2013 many of the river basins including konar in india are un gagged therefore adoption of any gis based statistical model is imperative to understand the soil erosion and sedimentation process quantitively previous studies jain and kothyari 2000 kothyari et al 2002 shinde et al 2010 conducted in india were only limited to quantify the rate of se and ssy but this information is not enough to implement any management strategy spatially in a river basin there are some other influential basin parameters e g basin morphology drainage network topography lulc that control the rate of erosion and sedimentation spatially de vente et al 2011 shi et al 2013 information of those crucial parameters in a river basin helps better understanding the processes involved as well as for adopting any soil conservation measures therefore the plsr analysis has been introduced in this study along with rusle sdr model combination in order to comprehensively assess the se and ssy dynamics besides physical parameter dependent model based studies like usle or rusle coupled with sediment delivery ratio sdr are still limited in and around the area apart no initiative has been found to identify most serious factors for se and ssy based on plsr analysis therefore the specific objectives emphasized on to i estimate the se and ssy at sub basin scale ii investigate the relationship between the basin specific parameters and the se and ssy using plsr and iii model the ssy using most important variable at the basin level 2 materials and methods 2 1 geo environmental set up of the konar basin the konar basin 23 51 23 25 n 24 8 26 83 n and 85 14 32 93 e 85 47 10 54 e covering 94 3 thousand hectares th ha

from 418 m to 930 m while major slope directed towards east the predominant sub tropical climate brings more than 1300 mm rainfall annually majority 80 of which occur in the form of southwest monsoon rainfall june september during peak summer maximum temperature goes up to 46 c and in winter season minimum temperature drops down to 4 c large scale deforestation for rapid industrial growth in the area particularly during past few decades resulted multifarious consequences like exposing lands to weathering and erosion rapid loss of fertile topsoil formation of gullies and ravines siltation in river beds and dams and thereby reduced their water holding capacities choudhury 2011 ghosh 2011 2 2 data sources multifarious source of data has been used to accomplish the objectives of this study the cloud free landsat 8 satellite image at 30 m spatial resolution december 2016 sourced from http earthexplorer usgs gov to prepare the lulc map of the basin the survey of india soi topographical sheets 72h 8 72h 12 73e 5 73e 9 73e 13 having 10 m and 20 m contour intervals were employed for the generation of digital elevation model dem soil taxonomy of the basin adopted from indian council of agricultural research national bureau of soil survey and land use planning icar nbss and lup kolkata fig 3 a high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset was sourced from indian meteorological department imd www imd gov in to compute rainfall runoff erosivity factor r a total of 34 geo referenced surface soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 cm depth using the stratified random sampling methods from different lulc and soil taxonomy classes to estimate soil erodibility factor k across the basin fig 1 to validate the estimated sediment yield of the model the input sediment yield data obtained through round the year ground sampling at the outlet of two sub basins sub basin no 30 and 35 sampling basins were selected based on wide variation of lulc and suitable positions for installation of the gauge besides the input data for identifying the potential influencing basin parameters were collected from individual sub basins for this purpose dem annual rainfall lulc and soil analysis data has been used to extract the basin morphology drainage network topography climate lulc pattern and different soil parameters the abbreviation and description of the individual basin parameters are given in table 1 2 3 methods the rusle coupled with sdr model has been used to generate spatial dimensions of soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy across the sub basins contours and spot heights of the basin were digitized from the topographical sheets and then the vector elevation map was initially calculated to tin triangulated irregular network in the next step the tin file was converted to a raster file with a grid cell size of 30 m 30 m in arc gis v10 2 software environment to generate dem a total of 35 sub basins were identified using archydro tool in arcgis v10 2 software environment fig 1 the input parameters for rusle estimated through analyzing the data of dem rainfall soil type and lulcs supervised learning technique with maximum likelihood classification was used to prepare lulc map of the basin following standard procedures patil et al 2012 the kappa coefficient k of accuracy assessment was within the acceptable value of k 0

properties particle size analysis was carried out using the hydrometer method beverwijk 1967 then the textural group was determined by the texture triangle usda soil taxonomy 1975 shahri et al 2015 shahri 2016 ghaderi et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc content was measured from 0 5 mm sieved samples following rapid titration method walkley and black 1934 soil structure and permeability were determined following the ontario centre for soil resource evaluation wall et al 2002 the severity of soil erosion t ha 1year 1 classified as slight 0 5 moderate 5 10 high 10 20 very high 20 40 severe

steep 40 following koulouri and giourga 2007 finally we employed the partial least square regression plsr model abdi 2010 to identify most influencing basin parameters a total of 32 independent variables were considered as basin descriptors while the dependent variables were se and ssy the overall methodology adopted in the present study is schematically presented in fig 4 2 3 1 revised universal soil loss equation rusle the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and its revised edition rusle renard et al 1991 are long being used to predict long period rates of rill and inter rill erosion under different management practices around the globe ganasri and ramesh 2016 singh and panda 2017 kayet et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 like other data scarce regions we considered it as an effective runoff dependent soil erosion model requiring limited data for our study area haile and fetene 2012 prasannakumar et al 2012 apart it is assumed as one of the cost effective methods particularly for model validation purpose in the present study haile and fetene 2012 prasannakumar et al 2012 soil erosion in our study estimated using the following rusle eq 1 1 s e r k l s c p where se is the estimated spatial average soil erosion per unit area t ha 1 yr 1 r denotes the rainfall runoff erosivity factor mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 k represents the soil erodibility factor t h mj 1 mm 1 ls holds the slope length and steepness factor c is the cover management factor and p identifies the conservation support practice factor the rusle was enhanced by revising the r and k factor depending on seasons revising the ls based on rill and inter rill erosion and with the c factor renard et al 1991 2 3 2 the rainfall runoff erosivity factor r r factor requires storm kinetic energy e and maximum 30 min storm depth i30 data however in the absence of authentic rainfall datasets indirect methods are generally suggested to estimate r factor using monthly or annual average rainfall data wischmeier and smith 1978 brown and foster 1986 thus the spatially distributed r factor is estimated using eq 2 singh et al 1981 2 r 79 0 363 x a r 0 83 where r is the annual erosivity index xa denotes annual average rainfall mm annual average rainfall over the basin is derived from high resolution 0 25 0 25 gridded daily rainfall dataset pai et al 2014 the r factor value computed from average rainfall representing the grid cell area 2 3 3 soil erodibility factor k soil erodibility factor k explains the effects of soil inherent properties profile depth soil texture organic matter content on soil erosion rate wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1991 the k factor of the individual soil sample was estimated following the eq 3 semmahasak 2014 3 k 2 1 10 4 12 o m m 1 14 3 25 s 2 2 5 p 3 0 0759 where om stands for organic matter m represents particle size distribution sand silt clay s denotes soil structural classes 1 very fine granular 2 fine granular 3 medium or coarse granular 4 blocky platy or massive p for permeability classes 1 rapid 2 moderate to rapid 3 moderate 4 slow to moderate 5 slow 6 very slow the spatial distribution of k factor is then produced by using kriging interpolation method 2 3 4 slope length and steepness factor ls the ls factor indicates the effects of topography on se which is dimensionless and obtained by using eq 4 desmet and govers 1996 4 l ij a ij i n d 2 m 1 a ij m 1 i n d m 2 x ij m 22 13 m where a ij i n is the contributing area at the inlet of grid cell ij measured in m 2 d is the grid cell size meters x i j sin a j cos a j the a i j indicates aspect direction of the grid cell i j m is the coefficient that represnts the ratio of rill and interrill erosion ranges between 0 and 1 to take advantage of dem and gis procedures desmet and govers 1996 proposed the upslope area which is approximated simply using flow accumulation to replace the slope linear length similarly the slope steepness factor s is defined as the ratio of se from the field slope gradient to unit field area wischmeier and smith 1978 renard et al 1991 the equation is as follows mccool et al 1987 5 s 10 8 sin θ 0 03 g r a d i e n t 9 6 s sin θ 0 0896 0 6 g r a d i e n t 9 the ls factor thus ascertained utilizing the eqs 4 5 and 6 on the digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution 2 3 5 cover management factor c c factor depends on the lulc characteristics of the basin it is defined as the ratio of se from crop land to the se from clean tilled fallow wischmeier and smith 1978 the lulc map was reclassified based on c factor values collected from previous research bakker et al 2008 märker et al 2008 kuok et al 2013 ganasri and ramesh 2016 table 2 2 3 6 conservation practice factor p p factor is defined as the ratio of se from upslope and downslope under each agricultural conservation practices wischmeier and smith 1978 the p factor values are assigned based on cultivation methods and slope aspect as proposed by shin 1999 table 3 the values closer to 0 indicate good conservation while for upper values it is vice versa 2 3 7 sediment yield estimation 2 3 7 1 sediment delivery ratio sdr approach the annual specific sediment yield of the basin was estimated by multiplying the se with the sdr as expressed in eq 7 fistikoglu and harmancioglu 2003 7 ssy se sdr where ssy is the specific sediment yield t ha 1 yr 1 sdr is the sediment delivery ratio and se is the soil erosion rklscp gross erosion per unit area above a measuring point the sdr for a cell i calculated from the sediment connectivity index ic following vigiak et al 2012 the ic was initially defined by borselli et al 2008 as follows 8 i c l o g 10 d u p d d n l o g 10 w s a i d i w i s i where dup and ddn are the upslope and downslope components of the connectivity w is the average weighting factor of the upslope contributing area s indicates average slope gradient of the up slope contributing area m m a is the upslope contributing area m2 di is the length of the flow path along the ith cell according to the steepest downslope direction m wi and si are the weighting factor and the slope gradient of the ith cell respectively in our model ic0 have been set to 0 5 and k equal to 2 after calibrating the model the c factor map has been used for the weighting factor as suggested by borselli et al 2008 sdr thus computed for the ith cell using eq 9 vigiak et al 2012 9 s d r i s d r m a x 1 e i c 0 i c i k 2 3 7 2 specific sediment yield ssy measurement to validate the estimated specific sediment yield suspended sediment load was measured at the outlet of the sub basin of k sb 30 and k sb 35 in 2016 during monsoon months june september since majority of the annual rainfall 80 occurs this time a gauge was attached to a bridge pier and water levels were monitored near the measuring point twice daily but during high flow frequent water levels were monitored river discharge q measured with current meter and float method a correction factor 0 8 was used in float method to estimate average channel segment velocity from its surface velocity hauet et al 2008 stream water samples were taken using usdh 48 depth integrated suspended sediment sampler at two times in a day at 6 00 and 17 00 h but during high flow 5 7 samples were taken in 500 ml pre washed sample collection bottles the collected samples were filtered by pre weighted 0 45 µm membrane filter paper and then air dried to separate the suspended sediment in the laboratory the filtered samples were further oven dried for 24 h at 110 c and the samples were weighed using the electronic balance in normal temperature finally the discharge rating curve gauge height vs discharge and suspended sediment rating curve suspended sediment concentration ssc vs q were plotted for two sub basins separately suspended sediment concentration ssc and suspended sediment loads ssl were computed following the standard procedure guyot et al 1996 semmahasak 2014 the ssc and q generally have a power equation of the form eq 10 10 s s c a q b 11 s s l q s s c 0 0864 where ssl q and ssc measured in tonnes day 1 m3s 1 and mg liter 1 respectively the coefficient value of ssc was 0 0864 based on the unit of measurement of q the total ssl is then divided by the area to get the ssy in the basin 2 3 8 identification of potential variables influencing specific sediment yield ssy based on the location specific characteristics as well as reviewing previous literature a total of 32 variables were assumed to be potential for se and ssy in the basin restrepo et al 2006

an average of 0 34 t h mj 1 mm 1 fig 3a and fig 5b conversely the loamy skeletal lithic ustorthents and fine loamy typic haplustalfs taxonomical attributes class 103 spread across only 1 5 th ha 1 6

mostly in the northwestern and southwestern intermountain valleys depending on slope and erosion management practices fig 5e 3 2 sediment delivery ratio sdr the sdr varied from 0 08 to 0 73 across the basin with averaged over grid cells being 0 12 spatially the higher sdr values measured in and around the river channel and hillslope areas particularly in the low elevated 500 m plateau fringe areas in the east while the lower sdr was recorded in the outward of the river channel in the plateau proper along the basin periphery and ridges fig 6 a 3 3 soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy the soil erosion se in the basin varied from 0 to 729 4 t ha 1 yr 1 with an average of 4 42 t ha 1yr 1 fig 6b moderate to very high 5 40 0 t ha 1 yr 1 annual rate of soil erosion measured across the wastelands in the northwest and southwest portion comprising sub basin no 1 10 20 26 28 and 33 compared to other lulcs likewise severe erosion 40 80 t ha 1 yr 1 observed along wastelands with small patches of shrubs in the southwestern section comprising sub basin no 19 21 23 25 30 32 and 35 fig 3b and fig 6b c the specific sediment yield ssy ranged from 0 to 97 7 t ha 1 yr 1 with an average of

negligible contribution in se and ssy accounting 10 0 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 3 t ha 1 yr 1 in agricultural areas 3 7 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 in built up areas 2 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1in shrubs land 0 16 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 01 t ha 1 yr 1 in forest areas naturally no se and ssy were measured in ponded water bodies the se severity dimension revealed that a large proportion of the valley area 71 0 66 9 th ha was prone to slight 5t ha 1 yr 1 erosion while only 2 0 and 0 6 ga nearly 1 9 th ha and 0 6 th ha were in the severe and very severe 40 80 t ha 1 yr 1 80 t ha 1 yr 1 risk of soil erosion as well as sediment generation table 4 slope gradient wise soil erosion intensity analysis showed that slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 erosion has largely occurred on gentle 5 slope terrain by occupying nearly 77 4 73 0 th ha of the ga while 0 4 ga 0 4 th ha on steep terrain 15 25 prone to slight intensities of erosion very severe 80 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion found to be maximum 0 4 th ha 0 4 ga on moderate 5 15 slope similarly 1 3 th ha 1 4 ga are prone to severe 40 80 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion on gentle slope table 5 a higher proportion of top soils along gentle to moderate slope gradient prone to erosion since majority of those areas devoted to intensive agricultural practices and remaining has left as barren or as wasteland which are easy to be eroded by intense rainfall and runoff area weighted se and ssy at sub basin scale ranged from 0 94 to 8 18 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 02 to 0 7 t ha 1 yr 1 where se found to be maximum in sub basin no 25 and 32 at 7 t ha 1 yr 1 besides predicted rate of se and ssy revealed three fold higher 11 96 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 38 t ha 1 yr 1 on steep 15 25 slopes than gentle 5 slopes 3 97 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 respectively 3 4 validation of the rusel sdr model simulation because of the absence of any experimental erosion plot in the basin the model estimated se in this study validated with the field visit and previous studies performed in the similar region with resembled geo environmental attributes pandey et al 2007 shinde et al 2010 parveen and kumar 2012 our estimated mean erosion 4 4 t ha 1yr 1 was more or less similar with the reported value of 3 7 and 4 2 t ha 1yr 1 for karso mohgaon river basin from the same indian state jharkhand under similar geo environmental setting 1192 1300 mm annual rainfall and 390 934 m altitude pandey et al 2007 our results also corroborated with the findings of balasubramani et al 2015 from andipatti basin 5 3 t ha 1yr 1 of south india tamil nadu 698 948 mm rainfall and 400 m elevation from mean sea level though wider range rainfall relief 1300 1550 mm rainfall and 430 2540 m from mean sea level dominated higher erosion rate also exists in pambar river basin 11 7 t ha 1yr 1 kerala and south koel basin 12 2 t ha 1yr 1 jharkhand parveen and kumar 2012 thomas et al 2018 shinde et al 2010 reported 2 6 times lower rate of erosion 1 7 t ha 1yr 1 for the same river basin of konar such a wide range of deviation may result because of their limited number of variable consideration and different method of parameterization the plotted rating curve based and model simulated statistics of two sub basins consider for model validation purpose revealed that the trend of discharge q wise suspended sediment concentration ssc has significantly p 0 001 strong coefficient of determination r2 0 64 0 73 for both the sub basin k sb 30 and k sb 35 fig 7 and table 6 the rusle sdr model predicted ssy were 0 30 and 0 29 t ha 1 yr 1 which measured to be 0 26 and 0 39 t ha 1 yr 1 on the rating curve for ksb 30 and 35 respectively thus the ssy is over estimated by 0 04 t ha 1yr 1 15 39 in model prediction for ksb 30 which under estimated in ksb 35 by 0 10 t ha 1yr 1 25 64 therefore the precision of rusle sdr model found to be highly satisfied with respect to the widely contradicted and uncertain model performance around the globe wu et al 1993 wicks and bathurstbt 1996 jain and kothyari 2000 3 5 basin controlling variables and their correlation with specific sediment yield ssy the ssy and sediment delivery ratio sdr varied substantially across sub basins however the ssy was more sensitive cv 121 8 to those basin controlling variables than the sdr cv 70 9 the basin physical and hydrological indices like the patch cohesion index cohe mean elevation hmean topographic wetness index twi erosivity factor r factor mean annual precipitation p percentage of sand and silt weakly varied cv 15 whereas ssy sdr mean slope gradient s basin relief hd basin area a total stream length sl varied widely cv 70 across the basin the preliminary pearson correlation studies in fig 8 showed that the basin properties like the patch and edge density pd and ed of landuse pattern percentage of wasteland and ssy had significant p 0 01 moderate to strong correlations r 0 4 0 8 with area specific soil erosion se similarly the most important explanatory variables for ssy are sdr pd hmean r factor p and percentage of shrubs land r 0 50 to 0 94 p 0 01 multi co linearity also observed among basin properties for example the basin morphological parameters like a basin perimeter peri basin length bl and sl were strongly correlated with each other similarly the basin soil variables like soil erodibility factor k factor percentage of sand silt and clay showed a strong correlation among them strong positive correlations of climatic variables p and r factor have explained their importance in se and ssy in the basin 3 6 identification of important basin controlling variables for se and ssy through plsr analysis in the se model cross validation test cvtest returned 3 factors f1 f3 having non significant t2 where α 0 1 apart the root mean press 0

5 of the variance while the first three factors f1 f3 explained 78 2 of the variance altogether in the case of ssy the f1 explained 72 0 of the variance while f1 and f2 jointly explained 82 7 of the variance the root mean press 0 5 was minimum at two factors fig 9b in the correlation loading plots the predictor variables were plotted in blue color fig 9c and d percent variations in each variable

optimal plsr model eq 12 was validated using the plot comparing the actual rusle based and predicted plsr based ssy the r2 and q2 cum value of the ssy 0 79 0 69 model indicated good predictive ability

spatial resolution have been used to estimate the annual soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy in the konar basin because of the higher annual rainfall concentration over the eastern part of the basin measured rainfall runoff erosivity r was maximum 550 mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 in this direction however the soil erodibility k measures showed spatially opposite pattern over r which found to be maximum 0 3 0 37 t h mj 1 mm 1 in a vast area in the west and southwest direction of the basin such spatial organization of k measure may be because of the highly erosion sensitive taxonomic nature of the fine loamy typic paleustalfs and rhodustalfs soil in this area class 102 and 104 fig 3a and fig 5b the high sensitivity of k to coarse loamy texture is also reported from the nearby barakar basin of jharkhand biswas and pani 2015 on the contrary loamy lithic ustorthents fine typic rhodustalfs and fine loamy ultic haplustalfs type soil in the north eastern part of the basin favored moderate leaching and infiltration process and thereby resulted lower k factor values 0 2 t h mj 1 mm 1 fig 3a and fig 5b higher c measure 0 3 0 5 across wasteland and agricultural areas in the northwestern part because of the less vegetation canopy and ground covers that lead to higher susceptibility to erosion renard et al 1994 semmahasak 2014 conversely dense forests in the east and northeast direction c 0 002 subject to slight soil erosion 1 3 t ha 1 yr 1 due to the semi impermeable organic residual rich layer of topsoil that considerably restricted runoff to soil erosion fig 3b fig 5d and fig 6b c thus the relative impact of management options in basin might easily be compared with changing pattern of c factor distribution which varies from near zero for a well protected land cover to 1 for barren areas cultivated lands in the basin are mostly on the gentle and moderate slopes the soil surface and soil structure particularly in agricultural areas along gentle and moderate slopes were disturbed by improper cropping practices thus the impact of c factor on soil erosion seems to have great significance as the lulc system in the basin accounted higher proportion of wasteland and agricultural areas 14 5 th ha and 18 4 th ha fig 3b and fig 5d considerable amount of soil loss generally occurred during monsoon months june september as soon as the dry land crops are harvested and the fields bring into plowing activity again as a result a vast proportion of the basin 77 4 of the ga felled into slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion especially on gentle 5 slope gradients a higher proportion of soil erosion across the agricultural field in gentle and moderate slopes also documented from different regions of the globe liu et al 2013 ostovari et al 2017 thomas et al 2018 large scale deforestation overgrazing and over tillage have sharply increased wasteland 14 5 in between 1976 and 2004 that leads to accelerated soil erosion and land degradation in konar basin sanyal et al 2014 in our study the plsr model successfully identified the most influential variables for se and ssy with reasonable accuracy from highly correlated environmental data unlike other traditional statistical methods for instance de vente et al 2011 applied multiple linear regression model to find out the controlling factors e g topography climate vegetation lithology soil properties on sediment yield their result showed that the model was unstable and not performed well due to nonlinear relation presents between the sediment yield and environmental variables likewise grauso et al 2008 stated that the application of the regression model did not yield accurate results for the prediction of sediment yield in a range of italian catchments although the use of lumped regression for understanding and prediction of sediment yield at the catchment scale is found in the works of different researchers e g syvitski and milliman 2007 restrepo et al 2006 grauso et al 2008 tamene et al 2006 a wide variation in model performance limits their applicability in some specific areas only the positive regression coefficient b 0 1 0 16 of mean slope gradient s basin relief hd sediment delivery ratio sdr patch density pd edge density ed hypsometric integral hi topographic wetness index twi among the very important basin variables vip 1 indicated that soil erosion will increase with the increasing the value of these variables fig 10a by definition pd and ed reflected the degree of forest fragmentation increase when many small patches of lulc type gradually occupied the basin shi et al 2013 thus highly fragmented forest cover encouraged soil erosion by declining infiltration and thereby generating high volume surface runoff ouyang et al 2010 shi et al 2013 alike our study s and hd are found to be important variables for se in many other basins around the globe montgomery and brandon 2002 tamene et al 2006 vijith and dodge wan 2019 when it was talking about the mean specific sediment yield ssy of the basin it was very low 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to the mean soil loss 4 42 t ha 1 yr 1 this may be because of the deposition of a considerable amount of sediment in places before reaching the outlet fang et al 2015 the major proportion of the basin area 71 ga was affected by the slight risk of soil erosion 0 5 t ha 1 yr 1 while 86 of the basin area dominated by low sediment yield along gentle slopes 0 5 table 5 and fig 6d estimated mean erosion 4 4 t ha 1yr 1 was corroborated with the reported value of 3 7 and 4 2 t ha 1yr 1 for karso and mohgaon river basin from the same indian state jharkhand under similar geo environmental setting 1192 1300 mm annual rainfall and 390 934 m altitude pandey et al 2007 however it was deviated by 2 74 t ha 1 yr 1 from the reported loss 1 68 t ha 1 yr 1 in the same basin shinde et al 2010 such deviation may be because of the adoption of different rusle parameters or ever changing lulc pattern that has not been well reflected in their study such anomaly has already been addressed in penultimate section 3 4 in this study the higher coefficients b and vip values in plsr suggested that the sediment delivery ratio sdr mean annual precipitation p patch density pd mean slope gradient s and basin relief hd b 0 12 0 22 were important variables vip 1 2 2 3 in generating ssy in the basin fig 10b the similar results also found in the works of tamene et al 2006 where they have applied principal component analysis and reported that 80 of the variability of the sediment yield could be explained by hd and percentage of agricultural land in highlands of northern ethiopia by analyzing sy dynamics of 280 major river basins around the globe syvitski and milliman 2007 reported that the physiographic and climatic features s hd and r were highly impactful for subtropical river basins like our study r factor also considered as crucial in generating sy in different regions fang et al 2015 the lulc attribute like pd in particular played an important role in sedimentation characteristics in this study by changing the speed of the runoff and sediment transportation like most of the river basin shi et al 2013 some effective conclusions of the study could be drawn with the exclusion of multicollinear and redundant data in the plsr analysis in the ssy model only six independent predictors sdr pd s hmean r

topography s hd twi hi lulc composition forest and wasteland and lulc pattern ed pd contag shdi were identified as important vip 1 basin properties table 1 5 conclusions in this study we have comprehensively assessed the dimensions of annual soil erosion se and specific sediment yield ssy by investigating the role of basin characteristics in the konar basin using rusle sdr parameters besides the basin characteristics that have contributed significantly in ssy identified using plsr procedure which thought to be relatively insensitive to confounding relationships among predictor variables despite the higher concentration of rainfall runoff erosivity r factor in the eastern part highly erosion sensitive taxonomic nature coarse loamy texture of the soil made the western part more prone to soil erosion by exhibiting higher k measures over r factor in the vast area in this direction in addition to this the wasteland and agricultural activities in this area produced less vegetation canopy and ground covers that lead to higher susceptibility of erosion higher c measures a large proportion of forest covers in the east and northeast portion restricted soil erosion improper cropping practices along gentle and moderate slopes considerably hampered the dynamic soil properties like breaking down the soil texture and structural components which have attributed slightly intense 5 t ha 1 yr 1 soil erosion especially on gentle 5 slope gradients over the vast proportion of the basin 77 4 very low 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 ssy of the basin compared to the mean soil loss 4 42 t ha 1 yr 1 indicated that a large proportion of eroded sediment deposited in the places of river beds before it reaches into confluence among the basin physical parameters the sediment delivery ratio sdr mean annual precipitation p erosivity factor r factor patch density pd mean slope gradient s and basin relief hd found to be important variables in generating sediment yield in the basin

surface water exchange here we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow hef due to a channel spanning logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in modflow and mt3dms electrical resistivity er imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes into the hyporheic zone during a series of in stream tracer tests supplemented by in stream monitoring we conducted experiments in two reaches in little beaver creek colorado usa one with a single channel spanning logjam and the second at a control reach with no logjams our results show that 1 higher hef occurred at the reach with a logjam 2 logjams created complex hef pathways that caused bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream and 3 higher discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increased the extent and magnitude of hef our numerical modeling supported all three field findings and also suggested that lower flows increased solute retention in streams although this last conclusion was not supported by

years of human alterations and provide an example of the resulting compromised river functions wohl 2005 here we focus on quantifying hef in response to a natural channel spanning logjam which blocks large portions of the channel cross section at different stream discharges we examined two reaches of a partially confined mountain stream little beaver creek colorado usa with and without a channel spanning logjam by conducting tracer tests under varying flows using both in stream monitoring and geophysical methods we expected that hef would increase in a reach with a logjam relative to a similar reach with no jam and also that hef would increase during peak snowmelt regardless of jams but would increase more in the reach with a logjam to explore these expected behaviors we performed tracer tests at the reaches of interest using dissolved nacl as a conservative solute nacl is electrically conductive which allows it to be visible to electrical resistivity er which we use here for the first time to characterize changes in hef due to logjams numerical modeling using modflow and mt3dms provided a simplified but valuable framework for understanding generalized solute transport behavior around a logjam in a steep mountain stream and therefore allowed for additional insight beyond the field measurements and helped to quantify the relations between logjams and hef 2 methods 2 1 site observations we measured hef along two segments of little beaver creek a third order tributary to the south fork of the cache la poudre river in northern colorado fig 1 a and b we chose this site because there has been previous work on logjam characteristics jackson and wohl 2015 the stream has had little to no human impact and there are reaches with different levels of logjam complexity we chose two reaches for our work one with a single channel spanning logjam and long enough to conduct a well mixed tracer test and another reach without a logjam to serve as a control channel width in both reaches averages 6 m and channel gradient averages 0 02 m m the surrounding montane forest is dominated by ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and the riparian zone contains ponderosa pine douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii engelmann spruce picea engelmannii and aspen populus tremuloides the watershed 40 km2 drainage area is at 1830 2740 m elevation and flow is snowmelt dominated while spring runoff and summer floods can move large wood pieces and sometimes remove logjams the jams at this site have remained relatively constant from year to year based on our observations average valley width increases downstream in the study area and wood load in the channel decreases ader 2019 ground penetrating radar data suggest that the depth to bedrock is approximately 1 m and increases in average depth 2 3 m and variability in the lower portion of the study area dan mcgrath personal communication october 9 2018 the logjam site includes one channel spanning logjam fig 1d a single tree makes up the key piece of the jam with other loose wood and organic material built up behind and around it looking immediately downstream the right bank of the site is highly vegetated with moist soils as well as some standing water particularly during high flows the left bank is steeper with less vegetation the control transect has no logjams within the reach fig 1c but is downstream of the logjam reach this was the only viable reach with a long enough stretch without logjams to expect complete mixing of the tracer both banks at this transect are highly vegetated with slightly more vegetation on the left bank an abandoned beaver dam and inactive channel were observed approximately 100 m across the floodplain from the left bank of the control transect 2 2 tracer injection we conducted three constant rate injections of dissolved nacl for 4 h upstream of the logjam and control sites fig 1 table 1 the tracer was pumped into little beaver creek at the injection site fig 1 at a low flow rate relative to stream discharge while in stream and er measurements were continuously collected the first tracer test was conducted in june during peak snowmelt runoff while the second and third tests were performed in july under similar lower flows table 1 for each test the tracer was injected at a single location and constant rate from well mixed reservoirs of constant concentration more mass was injected during the higher flow in order to increase the in stream fluid conductivity by approximately 50 us cm for all three tests table 1 the injection sites were approximately 50 and 250 m upstream respectively of the two monitored sites to allow the tracer to mix fully into the stream the stream was monitored before the tracer test and for a minimum of 24 h after injection using in stream fluid ec transducers above the injection site and above and below the monitored sites fig 1 there were thunderstorms on july 28 and 29 that affect some results as outlined below 2 3 electrical resistivity imaging tracer tests are often interpreted for hef or transient storage residence times using solute breakthrough curves btcs from the stream or well networks e g wörman et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 lautz et al 2006 wondzell 2006 tonina and buffington 2007 but these spatially sparse measurements often limit our ability to map heterogeneity in hef in contrast electrical resistivity er provides spatially rich data on the subsurface bulk electrical conductivity which is sensitive to porosity total dissolved solids and geologic material and has often been used to characterize groundwater surface water interactions e g singha et al 2010 slater et al 2010 cardenas and markowski 2011 coscia et al 2011 er is a direct current method that passes low frequency alternating current through a pair of electrodes which are placed into the ground the subsequent voltage is measured in another two electrodes this process proceeds using different combinations of electrodes allowing collection of hundreds of measurements in minutes the injection of a highly conductive fluid such as dissolved nacl increases the bulk conductivity of the subsurface so er measurements can provide a multidimensional look at subsurface transport through time and consequently serve as a useful supplement to point based fluid ec btcs ward et al 2010a 2010b toran et al 2013 ward et al 2014 in a time lapse inversion the background conditions are differenced from the images making er a valuable method for characterizing hydrologic processes in the natural environment ward et al 2010b cardenas and markowski 2011 coscia et al 2011 or stream restoration structures toran et al 2012 toran et al 2013 er data were collected using an iris syscal pro resistivity meter using a dipole dipole geometry and 24 electrodes per line with 0 5 to 1 m spacing fig 1c d collecting 231 measurements per time step the survey times for the transects were approximately 8 min long which allowed for high temporal resolution data of the tracer transport three total transects were monitored during the three tracer tests two were located above and below the logjam being monitored and the third was located at the control transect fig 1b background er data were collected for a minimum of 1 h before the injection began along the transects data collection continued during and then after the 4 hour tracer injection for at least 24 h to monitor the tracer entering and leaving the subsurface during data collection two replicate measurements were collected and averaged the mean standard deviation across replicate measurements was 0 23 the bulk apparent conductivity σ a was calculated from the measured resistance data v i using equation 1 and the geometric factor k in equation 2 which accounts for the arrangement of electrodes 1 σ a i vk 2 k 2 π 1 am 1 an 1 bm 1 bn where i is the current injected into the ground amperes v is the voltage measured volts a and b are the current electrodes and m and n are the potential electrodes that the resistivity meter uses to compare the btcs from the in stream monitoring to the er data we averaged the calculated bulk apparent conductivity along the entire transect to create a composite breakthrough curve for the entire transect er methods are sensitive to temperature changes in the subsurface hayley et al 2007 hayley et al 2010 therefore ibutton temperature stakes were installed to measure the temperature every 10 min at 10 cm and 40 cm below the ground surface near the logjam transects and the control transect the temperature stake at the logjam site also had an ibutton at the surface to measure air temperature fluctuations 2 4 inversion of er data resistance data were inverted using the code r2 v 3 1 an inverse model accounting for 3 d current flow based on occam s solution as described by binley and kemna 2005 all four boundary conditions of the 2 d mesh are zero flux and the boundaries are set a substantial distance approximately 130 m from the area of investigation a time lapse inversion was used which calculates the percent difference from the background data such that errors related to field configuration and discretization are minimized labrecque and yang 2009 inversions from background measurements were used as the starting model for all data collected the resolution matrix was also calculated this shows how well each model parameter is resolved given the er data in the last iteration of the inversion multiple factors affect the calculation of the resolution matrix including electrode layout measurement scheme data signal to noise ratio bulk electrical conductivity distribution and the parameterization and regularization used in the inversion binley and kemna 2005 the equation for the resolution matrix e g binley and kemna 2005 is as follows 3 r j k t w d t w d j k α w m t w m 1 j k t w d t w d j k where k is the final inversion iteration t is the transpose operator d is the data jk is the jacobian matrix for the current model m wd is the data weighting matrix associated with individual data errors wm is the model weighting matrix and α is the regularization parameter values on the diagonal of the r matrix close to 1 indicate that the parameter was resolved perfectly as the values decrease the resolution does as well values near zero indicate parameters that cannot be uniquely resolved in general resolution decreases with distance and depth from the electrodes 2 5 numerical modeling of flow and transport the flow and transport of an idealized straight channel and stream corridor were modeled to explore potential changes in hef due to changes in stream flow and logjams fig 2 these models were not calibrated because the goal is not to predict the exact behavior of solute transport in the field where the hydrology and geology are particularly complex but rather to elucidate and support the general observations from er inversions which are subject to constraints from resolution inversion artifacts and other challenges the steady state groundwater flow model was built using modflow harbaugh 2005 and transient solute transport was modeled using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to simulate tracer injections we used a steady state groundwater model because we were not looking at event based changes but seasonal changes over the time that our tracer tests were being conducted the changes in discharge were nominal we explored four model configurations 1 no logjam at high flow 2 single logjam at high flow 3 no logjam at low flow and 4 single logjam at low flow as in field experiments the simulated tracer test is represented as a continuous injection for 4 h at fixed concentration it is assumed that the tracer is conservative and nonreactive these relatively simple idealized models are intended to compliment and clarify results from er imaging not to recreate exact field conditions which would have required more information on heterogeneity in subsurface geology and hydraulic heads created by current interactions with the bed than existed we also were not trying to characterize this site only but to develop intuition on processes that could be extrapolated to other sites we therefore do not directly compare measured and modeled btcs but only their relative differences the model domain consists of three homogeneous isotropic material types intended to represent soil alluvium and bedrock loosely based on the field system and other mountain streams on the colorado front range fig 2 table 2 the soil layer is 1 m deep and has a relatively high hydraulic conductivity 8 m d the stream lies within the soil layer and is 0 9 m deep and 1 m wide fig 2b the elevation of the top of the stream cells water surface is 0 1 m lower in elevation than the surrounding material in the upper layer land surface under the soil the alluvium table 2 is 5 m thick and has a 1 m discretization the bottom layer which represents fractured bedrock is 5 m thick table 2 the entire domain is 70 m in the downstream direction x 30 m in the cross valley direction y and 11 m in the vertical z cell sizes are 1 m in x y and z in the first two layers and increase to 1 by 1 by 5 m in x y and z in the third layer we kept heterogeneity relatively simple within the model as we looked to simulate a system transferable to other headwater mountain streams with shallow soils overlying regolith and then bedrock the stream and logjam located within the top model layer were treated as equivalent porous media table 2 this approach has been used in previous surface water groundwater exchange models mao et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 and was adopted because stream and river packages in modflow and mt3dms do not represent lateral exchange flows between the stream and aquifer ben simon et al 2015 along the stream surface hydraulic head was set to vary under high flow scenarios from 13 8 m at the top of the reach to 11 m at the bottom leading to an overall hydraulic gradient of 0 02 under low flow scenarios head varied from 11 7 to 11 m leading to a lower gradient of 0 01 using a high hydraulic conductivity stream also allows the inclusion of the logjam as a porous medium in the stream system that alters the head distribution near the sediment water interface because the effective hydraulic conductivities of logjams are not widely known we calculated a value using darcy s law and the discharge from the no logjam numerical model where the cross sectional area a was of the modeled stream 0 9 m2 and the desired head drop dh was 0 5 m across a 1 m distance dl the upstream and downstream sides of the model were set to constant head values equal to the head at the upstream and downstream ends of the channel the other model sides top and bottom were defined as no flow boundaries all no flow boundaries were defined as zero mass flux boundaries in the transport model and the constant head boundaries were given a concentration of 0 in mt3dms with the exception of the inlet face of the stream cell where concentration was varied over time to represent the injection the transient solute transport model spanned 100 days initially concentration throughout the domain was set to 0 mg l and the upstream cell of the channel at the constant head boundary was specified with a concentration of 100 mg l for 4 h followed by 0 mg l to compare the four model configurations we examined concentration btcs at the three transects along the synthetic stream corresponding to our field transects transect a above the logjam when it existed transect b below the logjam when it existed and transect c a downstream control from a and fig 2 at each transect we explored the tracer response at three locations in the subsurface 1 m and 2 m below the stream and 2 m lateral to the stream for each transect fig 2 temporal moments were calculated for the nine btcs the three cells at each of the three transects see section 2 6 to analyze the movement of the tracer and assess the effect of the logjams at varying flow rates in addition to the btcs we analyzed the water flux into and out of the stream to characterize and compare the amount of hef among the models 2 6 temporal moments to look at how controlling processes vary with discharge and the presence absence of a logjam we analyzed the following moments of solute btcs from field measurements both surface and subsurface water and models subsurface only mass mean arrival time variance and skew gupta and cvetkovic 2000 harvey and gorelick 1995 the moments analyzed from the subsurface in the field were based off the bulk apparent conductivity btcs from er for qualitative comparison to one another ward et al 2010a since each field tracer test was not monitored for exactly the same time interval data were truncated so the same amount of time was used for the temporal moment calculations to prevent misrepresentations in the calculations the nth order temporal moment mn was calculated by 4 m n 0 t n c t d t 5 c e c 0 5 where t is time n is the order of the moment and c t is concentration mg l at time t concentration c is assumed to be linearly related to total dissolved solids mg l and ec us cm keller and frischknecht 1966 equation 5 to estimate moments the background electrical conductivity was first removed from the data the zeroth moment mg s l is the total tracer mass passing the observation point per unit of discharge to find the total mass passing the observation point the zeroth moment was multiplied by the average flow which was done for both the in stream and er measurements the mean arrival time t of the injected tracer at the point of observation is calculated using 6 t m 1 m 0 the variance of the pulse describes the spread of the btc and is related to the second first and zeroth temporal moments 7 σ 2 m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 2 the skewness of the data describes asymmetry of the btc based on solute retention drummond et al 2012 a more positive skewness μ3 value indicates a larger degree of tailing behavior exhibited in the btc and therefore a higher amount of hyporheic exchange 8 μ 3 m 3 m 0 3 σ 2 m 1 m 0 m 1 m 0 3 3 results we begin by describing general differences in the observed fluid and average bulk apparent conductivity as well as inverted bulk conductivity from the three transects from the field tracer experiments above and below the logjam and the downstream control without a logjam we then compare the field data with the behavior from the three transects in the numerical models both with and without a logjam for all field data there is a 3 us cm fluctuation in the background fluid conductivity values before the tracer injection the fluid conductivity in the stream increases almost immediately after the tracer injection begins plateaus during the injection around 90 100 us cm if the ec transducer was in the main flow path with a slow decrease through the peak as a function of changing stream discharge and temperature and returns to background almost immediately after the tracer tests end fig 3 si 3 and si 4 the average bulk apparent conductivities from er show a slow increase during the tracer injection plateau instead of the slight decrease in the fluid conductivity plateau as measured from ec transducers during the same time fig 3 si 3 and si 4 this is likely due to the tracer dispersing throughout the course of the tracer test so the tracer is then better resolved by the er measurements e g bethune et al 2015 the average bulk apparent conductivity does not return to background immediately like the fluid measurements at any flow rate the temporal moments for the fluid and bulk apparent conductivities were calculated at each transect to demonstrate patterns and similarities across different flows and transect locations fig 4 the background er inversions show similar patterns in subsurface bulk electrical conductivity for all three transects fig 5 a c for the june 13 14 tests si 1a c and si 2a c for the later two tests in july conductive regions under the stream and near the surface where the sediments have higher porosity and less conductive material deeper into the subsurface all transects show low bulk conductivity about a half meter below the surface which likely corresponds to the top of a cobble layer that we observed in the field in the time lapse inversions regions with large increases in bulk conductivity are where the tracer moves through the subsurface fig 5d i si 1d i and si 2d i conversely areas with little to no change in bulk conductivity are where little to no tracer is observed the resolution matrices for all transects show high resolution along the surface to about 2 m deep from where the electrodes start and end fig 5j l si 1 j l and si 2 j l the maximum temperature variation at a depth of 10 cm was 3 5 c at the control site and 2 5 c at the logjam site at any time during the tracer tests and was 2 c at the control site and 0 5 c at the logjam site at 40 cm for some of the tracer tests no temperature changes were observed at a depth of 40 cm due to the small change in temperature throughout the er observational periods no temperature corrections were made to the bulk apparent conductivity or inversions 3 1 control transect measurements the changes in inverted bulk conductivity for the control transect 1 h after the tracer injection started fig 5d si 1d si 2d show the tracer moving under the stream and into the left bank along the transect from 4 to 8 m at a depth from 0 5 to 1 m regardless of stream flow rate the left bank of the stream has a lower slope than the right and is also before a bend in the stream which would favor hyporheic exchange through the left bank there is a greater change in bulk apparent conductivity measurements from background during the june 13 14 tracer test compared to the two tests in july fig 3a si 3a si 4a which leads to the june tracer test having a larger area estimated using the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour compared to the two tests in july suggesting a larger hyporheic extent we do not calculate actual areas but just look at relative comparisons due to issues with out of plane effects in 2 d er inversions e g ward et al 2010a it becomes difficult to image the tracer once the injection ends for all three tests as the percent changes in electrical conductivity from background start to fall within the data noise in the average bulk apparent conductivity data from this transect there is also a small secondary peak after the tracer ends and then a slow return to background on the receding limb for all tracer tests fig 3a si 3a si 4a this might be caused by the release of solutes from the logjam site located upstream the mean arrival times based on the average bulk apparent conductivity are longer than those calculated from fluid conductivities 7 10 h vs 2 3 h increasing with lower flows fig 4f based on stream discharge it takes approximately 10 min for the tracer to reach the control from the injection point in the stream but transport through the aquifer would be much slower variation in higher order moments is shown in fig 4 most notable is the decrease in skew with each tracer test through time 3 2 control transect models the btcs from the cell 1 m below the stream at y 15 m z 2 m for the no logjam low flow numerical model show that concentration increases rapidly after the start of the tracer peaks and then decreases rapidly after the end of the tracer fig 6 a c the concentration at this cell drops more quickly after the tracer ends in the high flow case fig 6a c because solute exchange beneath the channel is fairly uniform along the synthetic reach the mass mean arrival time variance and skew are similar at all three transects at both high and low flow for the cell 1 m below the stream fig 7 a d observed mass mean arrival time variance and skew values 2 m lateral to the stream at y 13 m z 1 m all increase downgradient from transect a to b to c at low flow fig 7i k at high flows the btcs show similar behavior and low concentrations along the channel fig 6g i so the mass mean arrival time and variance remain relatively consistent at all three transects fig 7i l with only slight increases downgradient from transect a to b to c little to no concentration is detected in any of the locations 2 m below the stream at y 15 m z 3 m fig 6d f at high or low flows so temporal moments are not calculated flow is primarily directed down valley and dispersion does not mix the tracer to 2 m depth over the timescale of simulations despite losing conditions in the models without logjams fig si 5 at low flows the net water flux across the streambed table 3 is from the stream to the aquifer 2 10 5 m3 s and no regions of groundwater discharge to the stream occur the rate of loss is influenced by the channel hydraulic head gradient which was chosen to be similar to our field setting the water flux across the streambed integrated over the 70 m long model reach is approximately 0 17 of the daily discharge in the modeled stream which is within observations from natural mountain streams in arid regions e g payn et al 2009 at high flows the model stream is losing a greater amount compared to the low flow scenario table 3 again no regions of groundwater discharge to the stream occur the rate loss integrated over the 70 m long model reach is approximately 0 15 of the model discharge for the high flow model 3 3 above the logjam measurements the changes in inverted bulk conductivity during the tracer injection show the tracer moving through the subsurface of the less steep right bank and partially under the stream at a depth from 0 5 to 2 m along the transect from 4 to 9 m for all flows fig 5e si 1e and si 2e as at the control the tracer test from june 13 14 has a higher percent change in bulk conductivity than the other dates fig 3b si 3b si 4b and also shows the tracer moving at a greater depth compared to the july 10 11 and july 28 29 tests fig 5e si 1e si 2e similarly there is a larger area associated with the change in bulk apparent conductivity during the june 13 14 tracer test compared to the area calculated from the two tests in july the calculated tracer masses from the bulk apparent conductivity are consistently smaller than those at the control transect for both tests but have a similar magnitude to those calculated for the below logjam transect fig 4 described below the mean arrival times estimated from mean bulk apparent conductivity fig 4f range from 6 to 8 h longer than those of 2 h estimated from the fluid conductivity increasing for the two july tracer tests the mean arrival times at this transect are about 1 2 h less than those estimated from the geophysics at the control transect which is farther downgradient the temporal variance tends to be slightly smaller for the logjam transects than the control fig 4g which would indicate less dispersion of the tracer at logjam sites this makes sense given the downstream position of the control site compared to the logjam sites this additional distance would allow more time for spreading of the tracer compared to the upstream logjam sites closer to the injection 3 4 below the logjam the changes in inverted bulk conductivity one hour into the tracer injection fig 5f si 1f si 2f show the tracer moving almost solely under the stream at a depth of 0 5 to 1 m along the transect from 4 to 9 m for all three tracer tests the july 10 11 test also shows the tracer moving a little deeper in the subsurface than the other two tests and toward the left bank but the location of the tracer is otherwise largely similar between tests the tracer is difficult to see even one hour after the end of injection fig 5i si 1i and si 2i as in the other transects there is a larger change in bulk apparent conductivity from background during the june 13 14 tracer test than the two tests from july fig 3c si 3c si 4c consequently the estimated area of tracer extent in the june 13 14 transects an hour into the tracer test is larger than the two july tests fig 5f si 1f si 2f as seen at the other two transects indicating a potentially larger hyporheic zone with high flow the drop in average bulk apparent conductivity after the injection ends is more gradual during the july 28 29 test fig 3c si 3c si 4c but this is likely due to gaps in data caused by the thunderstorms the temporal moment calculations from the bulk apparent conductivity measurements fig 4e h have similar trends and values as the above logjam calculations between the logjam sites the skew and therefore the interpreted retention at the above and below logjam locations were similar for the first two of our tracer tests 3 5 logjam models at high or low flows the btc 1 m below the stream at y 15 m z 2 m for the logjam models has a similar shape and magnitude to the corresponding no jam models fig 6a c in other words the jam does not lead to strong heterogeneity in shallow solute transport 1 m below the stream the mean arrival times are relatively similar for the high and low flow models at all three transects fig 7a b at both high and low flow the variance and skew increase from above the logjam to below it transects a to b but decrease from below the logjam into the control transect transects b to c fig 7c d although values are small the concentration at 2 m below the stream at y 15 m z 3 m is much more sensitive to the existence of a jam and the btcs vary with distance downstream fig 6d f enough mass was detected 2 m below the stream in the two logjam models to calculate the higher temporal moments unlike the no logjam models fig 7f h which serves as one indication of the logjam s ability to increase the extent of tracer movement into the subsurface the low flow logjam model did not have enough detected at transect c to calculate meaningful moments although the high flow logjam model did which suggests the higher flows keep the tracer in the subsurface farther downstream the high flow logjam model s skew at transect c fig 7h is also negative here interestingly due to a secondary peak in concentration fig 8 which we also observe 2 m lateral to the stream the cell located 2 m lateral to the stream at y 13 m z 1 m also shows a higher sensitivity to the presence of a logjam at both high and low flows compared to the cell 1 m below the stream fig 6i l while the two logjam models had a higher observed tracer mass 2 m lateral to the stream compared to the no logjam models similar patterns in mean arrival time variance and skew for transects a and b exist fig 7i l at transect c the control transect we see differences between the logjam and no logjam models especially the negative skew for the low flow logjam model fig 7l due to the secondary peak in concentration 2 m lateral to the stream driven by the logjam fig 8 the logjam drives the tracer deeper into the subsurface and the tracer travels downgradient at a slower velocity than solute in the stream causing two peaks in concentration associated with rapid dispersion from the stream and slow advection along deeper flow paths figure si 5 at high flow the skew is positive at transect c the downstream control however it is not as large as it would be because of the second peak fig 7l and 8 the two logjam models are both losing streams but have localized zones of upwelling that the no logjam models lack the low flow scenario is a losing stream with 3 10 5 m3 s entering the subsurface and 1 10 5 m3 s returning to the stream table 3 the 1 10 5 m3 s returning flow represents hef occurring in this model which is created by the logjam no return flow occurs in scenarios without a jam the high flow logjam model has the largest rate of flow from stream to aquifer 1 10 4 m3 s and the highest hef 5 10 5 m3 s compared to the three other models table 3 4 discussion three important inferences can be made from our field measurements and numerical models 1 logjams increase the extent and amount of the tracer movement into the subsurface 2 logjams create complex transport pathways that can lead to bimodal btc behavior and 3 higher flow increases the extent of hef these interpretations are discussed in detail below first in relation to the field measurements and then model results the models generally agree with findings from the field and provide further insight into hyporheic processes happening in the field as described below we also outline differences between field data and generalized numerical models 4 1 jams increase the extent and amount of hef the er imaging from the three transects in the field provide an illuminating look at hyporheic processes comparing the above logjam er images fig 5e si 1e si 2e to the below logjam fig 5f si 1f si 2f and control er images fig 5d si 1d si 2d the tracer moves deeper into the subsurface and further laterally from the stream above the jam while there are many geologic and hydrologic complexities that can alter hyporheic flow paths the above and below logjam transects are only a few meters apart and therefore are as similar in terms of geology vegetation and slope as we could hope for in the field the crucial difference between them is the logjam the above logjam transect experiences the increased hydraulic resistance from the jam which causes pooling and higher amounts of downwelling based on this we conclude that the higher extent of the hefs both vertically and horizontally in the above logjam er images fig 5e si 1e si 2e are a direct result of the logjam because the below logjam er images fig 5f si 1f si 2f show the tracer only directly under the stream while the other hydraulic conditions influence the shape or paths of the larger hefs the stark contrast between the above and below logjam er images shows the impact a logjam can have on the amount and extent of groundwater surface water exchange our er images show us the affect a logjam has on increasing hef extent but we can also infer the factors that control the shape or paths of enlarged hefs near stream vegetation and streambank slope likely influence hef and their affects can be seen in our er images for example the tracer at the control transect moves underneath the streambed and into the left bank fig 5d si 1d and si 2d potentially due to the lower slope and high density of vegetation on the left bank the vegetation could induce flow away from the stream as well as create more porosity around roots which would cause hef to favor that bank e g menichino et al 2014 similarly the tracer at the above logjam transect moves mostly through the right bank of the stream fig 5e si 1e and si 2e but to a greater extent than the control the right bank at the logjam was highly vegetated had a lower slope and had standing water during high flows the standing water suggests that the water table is near the surface allowing easy exchange of water through thick saturated sediments the steepness of the left bank could also indicate bedrock at shallower depths and therefore lower hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface material bedrock geometry and valley constraint have been shown to influence hyporheic transport behavior in similar streams e g ward et al 2016 the er images and the variations among the three transects demonstrate the complexity of groundwater surface water exchange processes and reinforce the importance of logjams while our er images provide a qualitative look at hyporheic processes temporal moments let us gauge differences between the transects more quantitatively calculated skew was greater for the fluid and mean bulk apparent conductivity at both logjam transects compared to the control fig 4d and h which is interpreted as higher retention the logjam transects show a much slower return to background when compared to the rapid decrease seen in the control our er measurements and skew calculations support the observations from the er images and show that the logjam increases hef in terms of logjams increasing the extent and amount of hef the model results show tracer downwelling figure si 5 larger calculated skew values farther from the stream at 2 m deep and 2 m lateral from it fig 7h and l and the existence of upwelling return flows in the logjam models table 3 the model lacks the inherent heterogeneity in the field and thus cannot account for all effects since in the field but it does show deeper and wider exchange around the logjam figure si 5 provides a cross sectional view of the tracer through time in the subsurface for all four models and the greater depth of tracer movement above the logjam at the two different flow rates is distinct this result as well as the higher amounts of tracer 2 m below and lateral to the stream in the logjam vs no logjam models provide evidence of the increased extent of hef from a logjam the same observations were made about the logjam in the field the largest hef extent was observed above the logjam fig 5e this correlates with the large downwelling above the logjam in the model similarly wondzell et al 2009 observed downwelling upstream of major slope breaks such as those associated with logjams and upwelling downstream of these features and sawyer and cardenas 2012 showed that adding logs created upwelling zones in an otherwise losing stream from the model we see that the logjam not only drives changes in hef immediately around it but also farther downstream 4 2 higher flows increase hef around jams we find that higher flows increase the amount and extent of hef the er images from the june test show the largest hyporheic area based on the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour fig 5d f compared to the two july tests which were at lower flow figure si 1d f and si 2d f the model even with a lack of heterogeneity also shows the tracer moving deeper and wider during the high flow scenario figure si 5g l the deeper flow paths and higher change in bulk conductivity imaged by the er in june when compared to july suggest that higher flows increase the extent of hef but not necessarily the time water spends in the subsurface the mean arrival times are as long or longer at each transect for the lower stream flows compared to the higher flow fig 4b and f which is expected in terms of transport velocity in the stream jobson 2002 and its impact on flows in the subsurface at low flows the longer mean arrival times indicate that water moves through the smaller hyporheic zone more slowly skew appears to decrease with flow in the field although there are differences between the july 10 11 and july 28 29 tests despite similar flows q 0 17 and 0 18 m3 s respectively fig 4d and h this could be due to gaps in the data due to thunderstorms see section 4 4 which outlines limitations of this study regardless both july tests have lower skew values than the high flow test in june while this suggests larger tailing in the lower flows in june we know that our er data are truncated for all three tracer tests due to limitations in the field that prohibited additional observations therefore the relationship between flows and retention skew values could be different than indicated by our calculations the modeling results also show that higher flows increase the extent of hef the tracer was observed 4 m deep in the logjam high flow model two days after the injection ended while the logjam low flow model only detected the tracer to 3 m deep at the same time after the tracer test the tracer was also observed 6 m lateral to the stream two days after the end of injection for the logjam high flow model while the logjam low flow only observed tracer 4 m lateral to the stream at the same time there was also a greater amount of calculated hef in the high flow logjam model compared to the low flow logjam model table 3 these results support our field observations which show an increase in hef extent under high flows particularly when comparing the varying flows at the transect immediately above the jam the above logjam transect from the high flow tracer test in june fig 5e shows deeper flow paths and larger lateral extent again based on the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour compared to the corresponding transect at low flow figure si 1e and si 2e the numerical models also suggest that lower flows increase solute retention in streams similar to other studies e g morrice et al 1997 but this is not corroborated by the field measurements the low flow logjam model exhibits increased tailing consistently higher skew values in comparison to the high flow logjam model in every cell at all transects except where concentrations were too low for moment calculations or the second peak caused a negative skew value e g 2 m lateral to the stream at the simulated control transect c fig 7d h l while the model shows that lower flow increases retention times compared to the high flow this was not clearly observed in the field measurements on the contrary slightly higher skew values were observed for the high flow tracer test june 13 14 in the field compared to the two low flow tests july 10 11 and july 28 29 fig 4d h this is likely due to the truncation of the apparent bulk conductivity btc discussed below 4 3 bimodal transport behavior the mean bulk apparent conductivity at the control transect fig 3a si 3a and si 4a shows a secondary peak after the tracer ends for all three tracer tests that is not observed at the two logjam sites this secondary peak is also observed downstream of the logjam transect c in the numerical models with a simulated logjam fig 8 the secondary peak is likely an effect of the control transect being downstream of the logjam site and the slow movement of tracer through the subsurface and causes the skew values to be lower at the control site than would otherwise be expected because the rising limb of the second peak creates negative moments in the calculation the observed secondary peak is one of the most interesting similarities between the field measurements and the numerical model results using only field measurements the exact cause of the secondary peak is unclear but because this phenomenon was also observed in our models it is easier to interpret what may have caused the bimodal btcs in the field the secondary peak only occurs in the logjam models and the tracer remains in the subsurface between the area above the logjam near transect a to the region below transect c therefore we can infer that the secondary peak in the field data at the control is driven by tracer remaining in the subsurface from downwelling above the logjam similar observations of a secondary peak in tracer concentration have been seen in other studies toran et al 2013 sawyer et al 2015 this secondary peak demonstrates that hyporheic flows induced by the logjam remain in the subsurface for a substantial amount of time and travel distance this increase in hef residence times and extent may be a primary driver in reaction rates for nutrients such as nitrates e g triska et al 1989 briggs et al 2014 the secondary peak also explains why the skew value is lower at the control site and at transect c compared to the upstream transects fig 4d h and fig 7d h l the secondary peak introduces a left or negative skew in the calculation 4 4 limitations of this study while we attempted to identify two experimental reaches where the primary difference was the presence or absence of a logjam this is a natural stream with substantial spatial heterogeneity consequently there are undoubtedly differences in alluvial sediment width depth porosity and permeability between the logjam and control sites that influence the results in ways that are difficult to isolate or measure in fine detail the control site is also downstream of the logjam site the only feasible option for these experiments due to the existence of logjams upstream which led to additional complications since the control site was influenced by the upstream hydrologic processes at the logjam one other issue was truncation of data in the field due to limitations on human resources and unexpected weather although the correlation between increased retention times and lower flows was shown by the model the field data do not definitively support this result however if the er surveys in the field were run for longer and thus were not truncated the field results may have been more similar to the model results this issue of truncation was tested in the model stopping the monitoring period early one day after the end of the tracer injection resulted in lower or sometimes negative skew values more similarly matching the data from the field another complication in our analyses is that there were thunderstorms throughout the day on july 28 including heavy rain and lightning the former undoubtedly altered the fluid and bulk apparent conductivity and the latter forced us to halt er monitoring consequently we lost data during the tracer injection and within a few hours after the injection stopped the biggest gap in data is between 1553 and 1912 hr the end of this data gap is where the large secondary peak in the control reach occurs 4 5 implications er provides valuable information on the relative extent of hef which is an improvement over point measurements in stream especially in sites with thin alluvial cover where installing samplers is challenging because er methods can be time intensive and require a high initial cost however er is not a long term monitoring method for all restoration efforts that said it can be used to further research in restoration and the results from the er measurements could also provide a basis for more practical long term monitoring methods such as measuring stream temperature and head drops across structures like logjams river management operations such as adding large wood in streams commonly involve strategies to offset negative impacts that occurred from controlling and engineering stream systems or altering land use current river management and restoration practices that incorporate large wood placement typically use few quantitative or predictive methods for implementation advancing the predictive and quantitative basis for using large wood and logjams for restoration requires characterizing the relation between logjams and hyporheic exchange rates and this work offers a possible framework for assessment 5 conclusions our field measurements and numerical models support the conclusion that logjams increase hef longer tailing as quantified by the temporal moment skew is observed in both the field measurements and numerical modeling results for reaches with logjams compared to those without logjams also create complex flow paths in the subsurface and can result in bimodal btcs which is seen downstream of the logjam in both the model and field btcs furthermore higher flows increase the depth and lateral extent of hef paths particularly around logjams in the models substantially more tracer mass is detected at greater depth and lateral distance in the logjam model scenarios under high flow in er inversions a larger hef extent is observed during high flow above the logjam lower flows have a smaller extent of hef and they decrease the flow in the hyporheic zone possibly resulting in longer residence times while models show higher retention or skew at low flows field observations on the relationship between flow rate and retention are less conclusive perhaps due to data truncation these findings may be used to advance stream restoration and conservation efforts providing a foundation for placing wood or engineered logjams into streams credit authorship contribution statement m

5398,human impacts such as timber harvesting channel engineering beaver removal and urbanization alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams these anthropogenic changes have reduced the number of fallen trees and amount of loose wood that form blockages in streams logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater surface water exchange here we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow hef due to a channel spanning logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in modflow and mt3dms electrical resistivity er imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes into the hyporheic zone during a series of in stream tracer tests supplemented by in stream monitoring we conducted experiments in two reaches in little beaver creek colorado usa one with a single channel spanning logjam and the second at a control reach with no logjams our results show that 1 higher hef occurred at the reach with a logjam 2 logjams created complex hef pathways that caused bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream and 3 higher discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increased the extent and magnitude of hef our numerical modeling supported all three field findings and also suggested that lower flows increased solute retention in streams although this last conclusion was not supported by

to be highest near single log structures and decrease exponentially with distance upstream and downstream sawyer et al 2011 tracer experiments have also been used to quantify hef in flume experiments to characterize hydraulic jumps from obstructions endreny et al 2011 and in field experiments to examine debris dams in meadow streams lautz et al 2006 despite these advances in understanding hef

years of human alterations and provide an example of the resulting compromised river functions wohl 2005 here we focus on quantifying hef in response to a natural channel spanning logjam which blocks large portions of the channel cross section at different stream discharges we examined two reaches of a partially confined mountain stream little beaver creek colorado usa with and without a channel spanning logjam by conducting tracer tests under varying flows using both in stream monitoring and geophysical methods we expected that hef would increase in a reach with a logjam relative to a similar reach with no jam and also that hef would increase during peak snowmelt regardless of jams but would increase more in the reach with a logjam to explore these expected behaviors we performed tracer tests at the reaches of interest using dissolved nacl as a conservative solute nacl is electrically conductive which allows it to be visible to electrical resistivity er which we use here for the first time to characterize changes in hef due to logjams numerical modeling using modflow and mt3dms provided a simplified but valuable framework for understanding generalized solute transport behavior around a logjam in a steep mountain stream and therefore allowed for additional insight beyond the field measurements and helped to quantify the relations between logjams and hef 2 methods 2 1 site observations we measured hef along two segments of little beaver creek a third order tributary to the south fork of the cache la poudre river in northern colorado fig 1 a and b we chose this site because there has been previous work on logjam characteristics jackson and wohl 2015 the stream has had little to no human impact and there are reaches with different levels of logjam complexity we chose two reaches for our work one with a single channel spanning logjam and long enough to conduct a well mixed tracer test and another reach without a logjam to serve as a control channel width in both reaches averages 6 m and channel gradient averages 0 02 m m the surrounding montane forest is dominated by ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and the riparian zone contains ponderosa pine douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii engelmann spruce picea engelmannii and aspen populus tremuloides the watershed 40 km2 drainage area is at 1830 2740 m elevation and flow is snowmelt dominated while spring runoff and summer floods can move large wood pieces and sometimes remove logjams the jams at this site have remained relatively constant from year to year based on our observations average valley width increases downstream in the study area and wood load in the channel decreases ader 2019 ground penetrating radar data suggest that the depth to bedrock is approximately 1 m and increases in average depth 2 3 m and variability in the lower portion of the study area dan mcgrath personal communication october 9 2018 the logjam site includes one channel spanning logjam fig 1d a single tree makes up the key piece of the jam with other loose wood and organic material built up behind and around it looking immediately downstream the right bank of the site is highly vegetated with moist soils as well as some standing water particularly during high flows the left bank is steeper with less vegetation the control transect has no logjams within the reach fig 1c but is downstream of the logjam reach this was the only viable reach with a long enough stretch without logjams to expect complete mixing of the tracer both banks at this transect are highly vegetated with slightly more vegetation on the left bank an abandoned beaver dam and inactive channel were observed approximately 100 m across the floodplain from the left bank of the control transect 2 2 tracer injection we conducted three constant rate injections of dissolved nacl for 4 h upstream of the logjam and control sites fig 1 table 1 the tracer was pumped into little beaver creek at the injection site fig 1 at a low flow rate relative to stream discharge while in stream and er measurements were continuously collected the first tracer test was conducted in june during peak snowmelt runoff while the second and third tests were performed in july under similar lower flows table 1 for each test the tracer was injected at a single location and constant rate from well mixed reservoirs of constant concentration more mass was injected during the higher flow in order to increase the in stream fluid conductivity by approximately 50 us cm for all three tests table 1 the injection sites were approximately 50 and 250 m upstream respectively of the two monitored sites to allow the tracer to mix fully into the stream the stream was monitored before the tracer test and for a minimum of 24 h after injection using in stream fluid ec transducers above the injection site and above and below the monitored sites fig 1 there were thunderstorms on july 28 and 29 that affect some results as outlined below 2 3 electrical resistivity imaging tracer tests are often interpreted for hef or transient storage residence times using solute breakthrough curves btcs from the stream or well networks e g wörman et al 2002 anderson et al 2005 lautz et al 2006 wondzell 2006 tonina and buffington 2007 but these spatially sparse measurements often limit our ability to map heterogeneity in hef in contrast electrical resistivity er provides spatially rich data on the subsurface bulk electrical conductivity which is sensitive to porosity total dissolved solids and geologic material and has often been used to characterize groundwater surface water interactions e g singha et al 2010 slater et al 2010 cardenas and markowski 2011 coscia et al 2011 er is a direct current method that passes low frequency alternating current through a pair of electrodes which are placed into the ground the subsequent voltage is measured in another two electrodes this process proceeds using different combinations of electrodes allowing collection of hundreds of measurements in minutes the injection of a highly conductive fluid such as dissolved nacl increases the bulk conductivity of the subsurface so er measurements can provide a multidimensional look at subsurface transport through time and consequently serve as a useful supplement to point based fluid ec btcs ward et al 2010a 2010b toran et al 2013 ward et al 2014 in a time lapse inversion the background conditions are differenced from the images making er a valuable method for characterizing hydrologic processes in the natural environment ward et al 2010b cardenas and markowski 2011 coscia et al 2011 or stream restoration structures toran et al 2012 toran et al 2013 er data were collected using an iris syscal pro resistivity meter using a dipole dipole geometry and 24 electrodes per line with 0 5 to 1 m spacing fig 1c d collecting 231 measurements per time step the survey times for the transects were approximately 8 min long which allowed for high temporal resolution data of the tracer transport three total transects were monitored during the three tracer tests two were located above and below the logjam being monitored and the third was located at the control transect fig 1b background er data were collected for a minimum of 1 h before the injection began along the transects data collection continued during and then after the 4 hour tracer injection for at least 24 h to monitor the tracer entering and leaving the subsurface during data collection two replicate measurements were collected and averaged the mean standard deviation across replicate measurements was 0 23 the bulk apparent conductivity σ a was calculated from the measured resistance data v i using equation 1 and the geometric factor k in equation 2 which accounts for the arrangement of electrodes 1 σ a i vk 2 k 2 π 1 am 1 an 1 bm 1 bn where i is the current injected into the ground amperes v is the voltage measured volts a and b are the current electrodes and m and n are the potential electrodes that the resistivity meter uses to compare the btcs from the in stream monitoring to the er data we averaged the calculated bulk apparent conductivity along the entire transect to create a composite breakthrough curve for the entire transect er methods are sensitive to temperature changes in the subsurface hayley et al 2007 hayley et al 2010 therefore ibutton temperature stakes were installed to measure the temperature every 10 min at 10 cm and 40 cm below the ground surface near the logjam transects and the control transect the temperature stake at the logjam site also had an ibutton at the surface to measure air temperature fluctuations 2 4 inversion of er data resistance data were inverted using the code r2 v 3 1 an inverse model accounting for 3 d current flow based on occam s solution as described by binley and kemna 2005 all four boundary conditions of the 2 d mesh are zero flux and the boundaries are set a substantial distance approximately 130 m from the area of investigation a time lapse inversion was used which calculates the percent difference from the background data such that errors related to field configuration and discretization are minimized labrecque and yang 2009 inversions from background measurements were used as the starting model for all data collected the resolution matrix was also calculated this shows how well each model parameter is resolved given the er data in the last iteration of the inversion multiple factors affect the calculation of the resolution matrix including electrode layout measurement scheme data signal to noise ratio bulk electrical conductivity distribution and the parameterization and regularization used in the inversion binley and kemna 2005 the equation for the resolution matrix e g binley and kemna 2005 is as follows 3 r j k t w d t w d j k α w m t w m 1 j k t w d t w d j k where k is the final inversion iteration t is the transpose operator d is the data jk is the jacobian matrix for the current model m wd is the data weighting matrix associated with individual data errors wm is the model weighting matrix and α is the regularization parameter values on the diagonal of the r matrix close to 1 indicate that the parameter was resolved perfectly as the values decrease the resolution does as well values near zero indicate parameters that cannot be uniquely resolved in general resolution decreases with distance and depth from the electrodes 2 5 numerical modeling of flow and transport the flow and transport of an idealized straight channel and stream corridor were modeled to explore potential changes in hef due to changes in stream flow and logjams fig 2 these models were not calibrated because the goal is not to predict the exact behavior of solute transport in the field where the hydrology and geology are particularly complex but rather to elucidate and support the general observations from er inversions which are subject to constraints from resolution inversion artifacts and other challenges the steady state groundwater flow model was built using modflow harbaugh 2005 and transient solute transport was modeled using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to simulate tracer injections we used a steady state groundwater model because we were not looking at event based changes but seasonal changes over the time that our tracer tests were being conducted the changes in discharge were nominal we explored four model configurations 1 no logjam at high flow 2 single logjam at high flow 3 no logjam at low flow and 4 single logjam at low flow as in field experiments the simulated tracer test is represented as a continuous injection for 4 h at fixed concentration it is assumed that the tracer is conservative and nonreactive these relatively simple idealized models are intended to compliment and clarify results from er imaging not to recreate exact field conditions which would have required more information on heterogeneity in subsurface geology and hydraulic heads created by current interactions with the bed than existed we also were not trying to characterize this site only but to develop intuition on processes that could be extrapolated to other sites we therefore do not directly compare measured and modeled btcs but only their relative differences the model domain consists of three homogeneous isotropic material types intended to represent soil alluvium and bedrock loosely based on the field system and other mountain streams on the colorado front range fig 2 table 2 the soil layer is 1 m deep and has a relatively high hydraulic conductivity 8 m d the stream lies within the soil layer and is 0 9 m deep and 1 m wide fig 2b the elevation of the top of the stream cells water surface is 0 1 m lower in elevation than the surrounding material in the upper layer land surface under the soil the alluvium table 2 is 5 m thick and has a 1 m discretization the bottom layer which represents fractured bedrock is 5 m thick table 2 the entire domain is 70 m in the downstream direction x 30 m in the cross valley direction y and 11 m in the vertical z cell sizes are 1 m in x y and z in the first two layers and increase to 1 by 1 by 5 m in x y and z in the third layer we kept heterogeneity relatively simple within the model as we looked to simulate a system transferable to other headwater mountain streams with shallow soils overlying regolith and then bedrock the stream and logjam located within the top model layer were treated as equivalent porous media table 2 this approach has been used in previous surface water groundwater exchange models mao et al 2006 robinson et al 2007 and was adopted because stream and river packages in modflow and mt3dms do not represent lateral exchange flows between the stream and aquifer ben simon et al 2015 along the stream surface hydraulic head was set to vary under high flow scenarios from 13 8 m at the top of the reach to 11 m at the bottom leading to an overall hydraulic gradient of 0 02 under low flow scenarios head varied from 11 7 to 11 m leading to a lower gradient of 0 01 using a high hydraulic conductivity stream also allows the inclusion of the logjam as a porous medium in the stream system that alters the head distribution near the sediment water interface because the effective hydraulic conductivities of logjams are not widely known we calculated a value using darcy s law and the discharge from the no logjam numerical model where the cross sectional area a was of the modeled stream 0 9 m2 and the desired head drop dh was 0 5 m across a 1 m distance dl the upstream and downstream sides of the model were set to constant head values equal to the head at the upstream and downstream ends of the channel the other model sides top and bottom were defined as no flow boundaries all no flow boundaries were defined as zero mass flux boundaries in the transport model and the constant head boundaries were given a concentration of 0 in mt3dms with the exception of the inlet face of the stream cell where concentration was varied over time to represent the injection the transient solute transport model spanned 100 days initially concentration throughout the domain was set to 0 mg l and the upstream cell of the channel at the constant head boundary was specified with a concentration of 100 mg l for 4 h followed by 0 mg l to compare the four model configurations we examined concentration btcs at the three transects along the synthetic stream corresponding to our field transects transect a above the logjam when it existed transect b below the logjam when it existed and transect c a downstream control from a and fig 2 at each transect we explored the tracer response at three locations in the subsurface 1 m and 2 m below the stream and 2 m lateral to the stream for each transect fig 2 temporal moments were calculated for the nine btcs the three cells at each of the three transects see section 2 6 to analyze the movement of the tracer and assess the effect of the logjams at varying flow rates in addition to the btcs we analyzed the water flux into and out of the stream to characterize and compare the amount of hef among the models 2 6 temporal moments to look at how controlling processes vary with discharge and the presence absence of a logjam we analyzed the following moments of solute btcs from field measurements both surface and subsurface water and models subsurface only mass mean arrival time variance and skew gupta and cvetkovic 2000 harvey and gorelick 1995 the moments analyzed from the subsurface in the field were based off the bulk apparent conductivity btcs from er for qualitative comparison to one another ward et al 2010a since each field tracer test was not monitored for exactly the same time interval data were truncated so the same amount of time was used for the temporal moment calculations to prevent misrepresentations in the calculations the nth order temporal moment mn was calculated by 4 m n 0 t n c t d t 5 c e c 0 5 where t is time n is the order of the moment and c t is concentration mg l at time t concentration c is assumed to be linearly related to total dissolved solids mg l and ec us cm keller and frischknecht 1966 equation 5 to estimate moments the background electrical conductivity was first removed from the data the zeroth moment mg s l is the total tracer mass passing the observation point per unit of discharge to find the total mass passing the observation point the zeroth moment was multiplied by the average flow which was done for both the in stream and er measurements the mean arrival time t of the injected tracer at the point of observation is calculated using 6 t m 1 m 0 the variance of the pulse describes the spread of the btc and is related to the second first and zeroth temporal moments 7 σ 2 m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 2 the skewness of the data describes asymmetry of the btc based on solute retention drummond et al 2012 a more positive skewness μ3 value indicates a larger degree of tailing behavior exhibited in the btc and therefore a higher amount of hyporheic exchange 8 μ 3 m 3 m 0 3 σ 2 m 1 m 0 m 1 m 0 3 3 results we begin by describing general differences in the observed fluid and average bulk apparent conductivity as well as inverted bulk conductivity from the three transects from the field tracer experiments above and below the logjam and the downstream control without a logjam we then compare the field data with the behavior from the three transects in the numerical models both with and without a logjam for all field data there is a 3 us cm fluctuation in the background fluid conductivity values before the tracer injection the fluid conductivity in the stream increases almost immediately after the tracer injection begins plateaus during the injection around 90 100 us cm if the ec transducer was in the main flow path with a slow decrease through the peak as a function of changing stream discharge and temperature and returns to background almost immediately after the tracer tests end fig 3 si 3 and si 4 the average bulk apparent conductivities from er show a slow increase during the tracer injection plateau instead of the slight decrease in the fluid conductivity plateau as measured from ec transducers during the same time fig 3 si 3 and si 4 this is likely due to the tracer dispersing throughout the course of the tracer test so the tracer is then better resolved by the er measurements e g bethune et al 2015 the average bulk apparent conductivity does not return to background immediately like the fluid measurements at any flow rate the temporal moments for the fluid and bulk apparent conductivities were calculated at each transect to demonstrate patterns and similarities across different flows and transect locations fig 4 the background er inversions show similar patterns in subsurface bulk electrical conductivity for all three transects fig 5 a c for the june 13 14 tests si 1a c and si 2a c for the later two tests in july conductive regions under the stream and near the surface where the sediments have higher porosity and less conductive material deeper into the subsurface all transects show low bulk conductivity about a half meter below the surface which likely corresponds to the top of a cobble layer that we observed in the field in the time lapse inversions regions with large increases in bulk conductivity are where the tracer moves through the subsurface fig 5d i si 1d i and si 2d i conversely areas with little to no change in bulk conductivity are where little to no tracer is observed the resolution matrices for all transects show high resolution along the surface to about 2 m deep from where the electrodes start and end fig 5j l si 1 j l and si 2 j l the maximum temperature variation at a depth of 10 cm was 3 5 c at the control site and 2 5 c at the logjam site at any time during the tracer tests and was 2 c at the control site and 0 5 c at the logjam site at 40 cm for some of the tracer tests no temperature changes were observed at a depth of 40 cm due to the small change in temperature throughout the er observational periods no temperature corrections were made to the bulk apparent conductivity or inversions 3 1 control transect measurements the changes in inverted bulk conductivity for the control transect 1 h after the tracer injection started fig 5d si 1d si 2d show the tracer moving under the stream and into the left bank along the transect from 4 to 8 m at a depth from 0 5 to 1 m regardless of stream flow rate the left bank of the stream has a lower slope than the right and is also before a bend in the stream which would favor hyporheic exchange through the left bank there is a greater change in bulk apparent conductivity measurements from background during the june 13 14 tracer test compared to the two tests in july fig 3a si 3a si 4a which leads to the june tracer test having a larger area estimated using the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour compared to the two tests in july suggesting a larger hyporheic extent we do not calculate actual areas but just look at relative comparisons due to issues with out of plane effects in 2 d er inversions e g ward et al 2010a it becomes difficult to image the tracer once the injection ends for all three tests as the percent changes in electrical conductivity from background start to fall within the data noise in the average bulk apparent conductivity data from this transect there is also a small secondary peak after the tracer ends and then a slow return to background on the receding limb for all tracer tests fig 3a si 3a si 4a this might be caused by the release of solutes from the logjam site located upstream the mean arrival times based on the average bulk apparent conductivity are longer than those calculated from fluid conductivities 7 10 h vs 2 3 h increasing with lower flows fig 4f based on stream discharge it takes approximately 10 min for the tracer to reach the control from the injection point in the stream but transport through the aquifer would be much slower variation in higher order moments is shown in fig 4 most notable is the decrease in skew with each tracer test through time 3 2 control transect models the btcs from the cell 1 m below the stream at y 15 m z 2 m for the no logjam low flow numerical model show that concentration increases rapidly after the start of the tracer peaks and then decreases rapidly after the end of the tracer fig 6 a c the concentration at this cell drops more quickly after the tracer ends in the high flow case fig 6a c because solute exchange beneath the channel is fairly uniform along the synthetic reach the mass mean arrival time variance and skew are similar at all three transects at both high and low flow for the cell 1 m below the stream fig 7 a d observed mass mean arrival time variance and skew values 2 m lateral to the stream at y 13 m z 1 m all increase downgradient from transect a to b to c at low flow fig 7i k at high flows the btcs show similar behavior and low concentrations along the channel fig 6g i so the mass mean arrival time and variance remain relatively consistent at all three transects fig 7i l with only slight increases downgradient from transect a to b to c little to no concentration is detected in any of the locations 2 m below the stream at y 15 m z 3 m fig 6d f at high or low flows so temporal moments are not calculated flow is primarily directed down valley and dispersion does not mix the tracer to 2 m depth over the timescale of simulations despite losing conditions in the models without logjams fig si 5 at low flows the net water flux across the streambed table 3 is from the stream to the aquifer 2 10 5 m3 s and no regions of groundwater discharge to the stream occur the rate of loss is influenced by the channel hydraulic head gradient which was chosen to be similar to our field setting the water flux across the streambed integrated over the 70 m long model reach is approximately 0 17 of the daily discharge in the modeled stream which is within observations from natural mountain streams in arid regions e g payn et al 2009 at high flows the model stream is losing a greater amount compared to the low flow scenario table 3 again no regions of groundwater discharge to the stream occur the rate loss integrated over the 70 m long model reach is approximately 0 15 of the model discharge for the high flow model 3 3 above the logjam measurements the changes in inverted bulk conductivity during the tracer injection show the tracer moving through the subsurface of the less steep right bank and partially under the stream at a depth from 0 5 to 2 m along the transect from 4 to 9 m for all flows fig 5e si 1e and si 2e as at the control the tracer test from june 13 14 has a higher percent change in bulk conductivity than the other dates fig 3b si 3b si 4b and also shows the tracer moving at a greater depth compared to the july 10 11 and july 28 29 tests fig 5e si 1e si 2e similarly there is a larger area associated with the change in bulk apparent conductivity during the june 13 14 tracer test compared to the area calculated from the two tests in july the calculated tracer masses from the bulk apparent conductivity are consistently smaller than those at the control transect for both tests but have a similar magnitude to those calculated for the below logjam transect fig 4 described below the mean arrival times estimated from mean bulk apparent conductivity fig 4f range from 6 to 8 h longer than those of 2 h estimated from the fluid conductivity increasing for the two july tracer tests the mean arrival times at this transect are about 1 2 h less than those estimated from the geophysics at the control transect which is farther downgradient the temporal variance tends to be slightly smaller for the logjam transects than the control fig 4g which would indicate less dispersion of the tracer at logjam sites this makes sense given the downstream position of the control site compared to the logjam sites this additional distance would allow more time for spreading of the tracer compared to the upstream logjam sites closer to the injection 3 4 below the logjam the changes in inverted bulk conductivity one hour into the tracer injection fig 5f si 1f si 2f show the tracer moving almost solely under the stream at a depth of 0 5 to 1 m along the transect from 4 to 9 m for all three tracer tests the july 10 11 test also shows the tracer moving a little deeper in the subsurface than the other two tests and toward the left bank but the location of the tracer is otherwise largely similar between tests the tracer is difficult to see even one hour after the end of injection fig 5i si 1i and si 2i as in the other transects there is a larger change in bulk apparent conductivity from background during the june 13 14 tracer test than the two tests from july fig 3c si 3c si 4c consequently the estimated area of tracer extent in the june 13 14 transects an hour into the tracer test is larger than the two july tests fig 5f si 1f si 2f as seen at the other two transects indicating a potentially larger hyporheic zone with high flow the drop in average bulk apparent conductivity after the injection ends is more gradual during the july 28 29 test fig 3c si 3c si 4c but this is likely due to gaps in data caused by the thunderstorms the temporal moment calculations from the bulk apparent conductivity measurements fig 4e h have similar trends and values as the above logjam calculations between the logjam sites the skew and therefore the interpreted retention at the above and below logjam locations were similar for the first two of our tracer tests 3 5 logjam models at high or low flows the btc 1 m below the stream at y 15 m z 2 m for the logjam models has a similar shape and magnitude to the corresponding no jam models fig 6a c in other words the jam does not lead to strong heterogeneity in shallow solute transport 1 m below the stream the mean arrival times are relatively similar for the high and low flow models at all three transects fig 7a b at both high and low flow the variance and skew increase from above the logjam to below it transects a to b but decrease from below the logjam into the control transect transects b to c fig 7c d although values are small the concentration at 2 m below the stream at y 15 m z 3 m is much more sensitive to the existence of a jam and the btcs vary with distance downstream fig 6d f enough mass was detected 2 m below the stream in the two logjam models to calculate the higher temporal moments unlike the no logjam models fig 7f h which serves as one indication of the logjam s ability to increase the extent of tracer movement into the subsurface the low flow logjam model did not have enough detected at transect c to calculate meaningful moments although the high flow logjam model did which suggests the higher flows keep the tracer in the subsurface farther downstream the high flow logjam model s skew at transect c fig 7h is also negative here interestingly due to a secondary peak in concentration fig 8 which we also observe 2 m lateral to the stream the cell located 2 m lateral to the stream at y 13 m z 1 m also shows a higher sensitivity to the presence of a logjam at both high and low flows compared to the cell 1 m below the stream fig 6i l while the two logjam models had a higher observed tracer mass 2 m lateral to the stream compared to the no logjam models similar patterns in mean arrival time variance and skew for transects a and b exist fig 7i l at transect c the control transect we see differences between the logjam and no logjam models especially the negative skew for the low flow logjam model fig 7l due to the secondary peak in concentration 2 m lateral to the stream driven by the logjam fig 8 the logjam drives the tracer deeper into the subsurface and the tracer travels downgradient at a slower velocity than solute in the stream causing two peaks in concentration associated with rapid dispersion from the stream and slow advection along deeper flow paths figure si 5 at high flow the skew is positive at transect c the downstream control however it is not as large as it would be because of the second peak fig 7l and 8 the two logjam models are both losing streams but have localized zones of upwelling that the no logjam models lack the low flow scenario is a losing stream with 3 10 5 m3 s entering the subsurface and 1 10 5 m3 s returning to the stream table 3 the 1 10 5 m3 s returning flow represents hef occurring in this model which is created by the logjam no return flow occurs in scenarios without a jam the high flow logjam model has the largest rate of flow from stream to aquifer 1 10 4 m3 s and the highest hef 5 10 5 m3 s compared to the three other models table 3 4 discussion three important inferences can be made from our field measurements and numerical models 1 logjams increase the extent and amount of the tracer movement into the subsurface 2 logjams create complex transport pathways that can lead to bimodal btc behavior and 3 higher flow increases the extent of hef these interpretations are discussed in detail below first in relation to the field measurements and then model results the models generally agree with findings from the field and provide further insight into hyporheic processes happening in the field as described below we also outline differences between field data and generalized numerical models 4 1 jams increase the extent and amount of hef the er imaging from the three transects in the field provide an illuminating look at hyporheic processes comparing the above logjam er images fig 5e si 1e si 2e to the below logjam fig 5f si 1f si 2f and control er images fig 5d si 1d si 2d the tracer moves deeper into the subsurface and further laterally from the stream above the jam while there are many geologic and hydrologic complexities that can alter hyporheic flow paths the above and below logjam transects are only a few meters apart and therefore are as similar in terms of geology vegetation and slope as we could hope for in the field the crucial difference between them is the logjam the above logjam transect experiences the increased hydraulic resistance from the jam which causes pooling and higher amounts of downwelling based on this we conclude that the higher extent of the hefs both vertically and horizontally in the above logjam er images fig 5e si 1e si 2e are a direct result of the logjam because the below logjam er images fig 5f si 1f si 2f show the tracer only directly under the stream while the other hydraulic conditions influence the shape or paths of the larger hefs the stark contrast between the above and below logjam er images shows the impact a logjam can have on the amount and extent of groundwater surface water exchange our er images show us the affect a logjam has on increasing hef extent but we can also infer the factors that control the shape or paths of enlarged hefs near stream vegetation and streambank slope likely influence hef and their affects can be seen in our er images for example the tracer at the control transect moves underneath the streambed and into the left bank fig 5d si 1d and si 2d potentially due to the lower slope and high density of vegetation on the left bank the vegetation could induce flow away from the stream as well as create more porosity around roots which would cause hef to favor that bank e g menichino et al 2014 similarly the tracer at the above logjam transect moves mostly through the right bank of the stream fig 5e si 1e and si 2e but to a greater extent than the control the right bank at the logjam was highly vegetated had a lower slope and had standing water during high flows the standing water suggests that the water table is near the surface allowing easy exchange of water through thick saturated sediments the steepness of the left bank could also indicate bedrock at shallower depths and therefore lower hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface material bedrock geometry and valley constraint have been shown to influence hyporheic transport behavior in similar streams e g ward et al 2016 the er images and the variations among the three transects demonstrate the complexity of groundwater surface water exchange processes and reinforce the importance of logjams while our er images provide a qualitative look at hyporheic processes temporal moments let us gauge differences between the transects more quantitatively calculated skew was greater for the fluid and mean bulk apparent conductivity at both logjam transects compared to the control fig 4d and h which is interpreted as higher retention the logjam transects show a much slower return to background when compared to the rapid decrease seen in the control our er measurements and skew calculations support the observations from the er images and show that the logjam increases hef in terms of logjams increasing the extent and amount of hef the model results show tracer downwelling figure si 5 larger calculated skew values farther from the stream at 2 m deep and 2 m lateral from it fig 7h and l and the existence of upwelling return flows in the logjam models table 3 the model lacks the inherent heterogeneity in the field and thus cannot account for all effects since in the field but it does show deeper and wider exchange around the logjam figure si 5 provides a cross sectional view of the tracer through time in the subsurface for all four models and the greater depth of tracer movement above the logjam at the two different flow rates is distinct this result as well as the higher amounts of tracer 2 m below and lateral to the stream in the logjam vs no logjam models provide evidence of the increased extent of hef from a logjam the same observations were made about the logjam in the field the largest hef extent was observed above the logjam fig 5e this correlates with the large downwelling above the logjam in the model similarly wondzell et al 2009 observed downwelling upstream of major slope breaks such as those associated with logjams and upwelling downstream of these features and sawyer and cardenas 2012 showed that adding logs created upwelling zones in an otherwise losing stream from the model we see that the logjam not only drives changes in hef immediately around it but also farther downstream 4 2 higher flows increase hef around jams we find that higher flows increase the amount and extent of hef the er images from the june test show the largest hyporheic area based on the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour fig 5d f compared to the two july tests which were at lower flow figure si 1d f and si 2d f the model even with a lack of heterogeneity also shows the tracer moving deeper and wider during the high flow scenario figure si 5g l the deeper flow paths and higher change in bulk conductivity imaged by the er in june when compared to july suggest that higher flows increase the extent of hef but not necessarily the time water spends in the subsurface the mean arrival times are as long or longer at each transect for the lower stream flows compared to the higher flow fig 4b and f which is expected in terms of transport velocity in the stream jobson 2002 and its impact on flows in the subsurface at low flows the longer mean arrival times indicate that water moves through the smaller hyporheic zone more slowly skew appears to decrease with flow in the field although there are differences between the july 10 11 and july 28 29 tests despite similar flows q 0 17 and 0 18 m3 s respectively fig 4d and h this could be due to gaps in the data due to thunderstorms see section 4 4 which outlines limitations of this study regardless both july tests have lower skew values than the high flow test in june while this suggests larger tailing in the lower flows in june we know that our er data are truncated for all three tracer tests due to limitations in the field that prohibited additional observations therefore the relationship between flows and retention skew values could be different than indicated by our calculations the modeling results also show that higher flows increase the extent of hef the tracer was observed 4 m deep in the logjam high flow model two days after the injection ended while the logjam low flow model only detected the tracer to 3 m deep at the same time after the tracer test the tracer was also observed 6 m lateral to the stream two days after the end of injection for the logjam high flow model while the logjam low flow only observed tracer 4 m lateral to the stream at the same time there was also a greater amount of calculated hef in the high flow logjam model compared to the low flow logjam model table 3 these results support our field observations which show an increase in hef extent under high flows particularly when comparing the varying flows at the transect immediately above the jam the above logjam transect from the high flow tracer test in june fig 5e shows deeper flow paths and larger lateral extent again based on the 200 change in bulk conductivity contour compared to the corresponding transect at low flow figure si 1e and si 2e the numerical models also suggest that lower flows increase solute retention in streams similar to other studies e g morrice et al 1997 but this is not corroborated by the field measurements the low flow logjam model exhibits increased tailing consistently higher skew values in comparison to the high flow logjam model in every cell at all transects except where concentrations were too low for moment calculations or the second peak caused a negative skew value e g 2 m lateral to the stream at the simulated control transect c fig 7d h l while the model shows that lower flow increases retention times compared to the high flow this was not clearly observed in the field measurements on the contrary slightly higher skew values were observed for the high flow tracer test june 13 14 in the field compared to the two low flow tests july 10 11 and july 28 29 fig 4d h this is likely due to the truncation of the apparent bulk conductivity btc discussed below 4 3 bimodal transport behavior the mean bulk apparent conductivity at the control transect fig 3a si 3a and si 4a shows a secondary peak after the tracer ends for all three tracer tests that is not observed at the two logjam sites this secondary peak is also observed downstream of the logjam transect c in the numerical models with a simulated logjam fig 8 the secondary peak is likely an effect of the control transect being downstream of the logjam site and the slow movement of tracer through the subsurface and causes the skew values to be lower at the control site than would otherwise be expected because the rising limb of the second peak creates negative moments in the calculation the observed secondary peak is one of the most interesting similarities between the field measurements and the numerical model results using only field measurements the exact cause of the secondary peak is unclear but because this phenomenon was also observed in our models it is easier to interpret what may have caused the bimodal btcs in the field the secondary peak only occurs in the logjam models and the tracer remains in the subsurface between the area above the logjam near transect a to the region below transect c therefore we can infer that the secondary peak in the field data at the control is driven by tracer remaining in the subsurface from downwelling above the logjam similar observations of a secondary peak in tracer concentration have been seen in other studies toran et al 2013 sawyer et al 2015 this secondary peak demonstrates that hyporheic flows induced by the logjam remain in the subsurface for a substantial amount of time and travel distance this increase in hef residence times and extent may be a primary driver in reaction rates for nutrients such as nitrates e g triska et al 1989 briggs et al 2014 the secondary peak also explains why the skew value is lower at the control site and at transect c compared to the upstream transects fig 4d h and fig 7d h l the secondary peak introduces a left or negative skew in the calculation 4 4 limitations of this study while we attempted to identify two experimental reaches where the primary difference was the presence or absence of a logjam this is a natural stream with substantial spatial heterogeneity consequently there are undoubtedly differences in alluvial sediment width depth porosity and permeability between the logjam and control sites that influence the results in ways that are difficult to isolate or measure in fine detail the control site is also downstream of the logjam site the only feasible option for these experiments due to the existence of logjams upstream which led to additional complications since the control site was influenced by the upstream hydrologic processes at the logjam one other issue was truncation of data in the field due to limitations on human resources and unexpected weather although the correlation between increased retention times and lower flows was shown by the model the field data do not definitively support this result however if the er surveys in the field were run for longer and thus were not truncated the field results may have been more similar to the model results this issue of truncation was tested in the model stopping the monitoring period early one day after the end of the tracer injection resulted in lower or sometimes negative skew values more similarly matching the data from the field another complication in our analyses is that there were thunderstorms throughout the day on july 28 including heavy rain and lightning the former undoubtedly altered the fluid and bulk apparent conductivity and the latter forced us to halt er monitoring consequently we lost data during the tracer injection and within a few hours after the injection stopped the biggest gap in data is between 1553 and 1912 hr the end of this data gap is where the large secondary peak in the control reach occurs 4 5 implications er provides valuable information on the relative extent of hef which is an improvement over point measurements in stream especially in sites with thin alluvial cover where installing samplers is challenging because er methods can be time intensive and require a high initial cost however er is not a long term monitoring method for all restoration efforts that said it can be used to further research in restoration and the results from the er measurements could also provide a basis for more practical long term monitoring methods such as measuring stream temperature and head drops across structures like logjams river management operations such as adding large wood in streams commonly involve strategies to offset negative impacts that occurred from controlling and engineering stream systems or altering land use current river management and restoration practices that incorporate large wood placement typically use few quantitative or predictive methods for implementation advancing the predictive and quantitative basis for using large wood and logjams for restoration requires characterizing the relation between logjams and hyporheic exchange rates and this work offers a possible framework for assessment 5 conclusions our field measurements and numerical models support the conclusion that logjams increase hef longer tailing as quantified by the temporal moment skew is observed in both the field measurements and numerical modeling results for reaches with logjams compared to those without logjams also create complex flow paths in the subsurface and can result in bimodal btcs which is seen downstream of the logjam in both the model and field btcs furthermore higher flows increase the depth and lateral extent of hef paths particularly around logjams in the models substantially more tracer mass is detected at greater depth and lateral distance in the logjam model scenarios under high flow in er inversions a larger hef extent is observed during high flow above the logjam lower flows have a smaller extent of hef and they decrease the flow in the hyporheic zone possibly resulting in longer residence times while models show higher retention or skew at low flows field observations on the relationship between flow rate and retention are less conclusive perhaps due to data truncation these findings may be used to advance stream restoration and conservation efforts providing a foundation for placing wood or engineered logjams into streams credit authorship contribution statement m

5399,headwater catchments make a considerable contribution to the discharge of whole stream networks and mean transit time mtt is a fundamental factor affecting flow and storage in the hydrologic system we estimated the mtt along with the identification of subsurface water flow processes using time series measurements of stable isotopes and major solutes in the water of a small mountainous catchment with granitic bedrock under a humid temperate climate the mtt was estimated to be 1 1 1 7 years 0 5 0 8 years and 1 5 years for stream water at the catchment outlet and first order tributaries soil water and shallow groundwater respectively based on sinusoidal variation in deuterium excess in the hydrologic components and precipitation the mtt of first order streams was negatively correlated with the topographic gradient of the sub catchments the sio2 aq and cl concentrations in first order streams were used to discriminate dominant subsurface flow contributing to the streams depending on the topographic gradient soil water had a higher seasonal variability in sio2 aq and cl concentrations which were controlled by rainfall infiltration whereas shallow groundwater had significantly lower seasonal variability with a depleted isotopic signature suggesting the contribution of lateral water flows from the upgradient area the increased seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations with increasing mtt in first order streams indicated that the storage capacity and flow paths in the soil layer were determining factors for subsurface water flow in hillslope areas seasonal variation in the sio2 aq concentration at the catchment outlet revealed a major contribution of subsurface flow to stream discharge as lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface and an interflow through the soil layer in the dry and rainy seasons respectively through the integration of the mtt and seasonal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters in soil water stream water and groundwater this study demonstrates that soil depth and the soil bedrock interface were the main controls on streamflow generation in a headwater catchment with a crystalline bedrock keywords headwater catchment hillslope transit time stable isotope dissolved silica crystalline bedrock 1 introduction understanding the timescales of water flow such as the mean transit time mtt in a catchment provides insight into the hydrological processes related to water flow generation through various pathways mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the mtt in the catchment also provides an integrated tool for understanding the mixing processes of hydrological components mcdonnell et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2011 this implies that tracer inputs mix with stored water at the catchment scale to facilitate the damping and time lag between inputs and outputs kirchner et al 2000 soulsby et al 2009 the estimation of mtt provides fundamental information about the storage source and flow path of water with advection and dispersion at the catchment scale mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 spence 2000 because the distribution of mtt reflects how catchments store and release water and solutes it can be used to evaluate the response of hydrological components to climate change and the release or persistence of contaminants kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell et al 2010 mountainous regions are recognized as water towers that significantly contribute to sustainable water resources in adjacent plain and downstream areas cantafio and ryan 2014 gomi et al 2002 recent studies have reported that more than 50 of the world s potential water supply is supplied from mountainous regions although the water supply may vary depending on the climate alexander et al 2007 viviroli et al 2007 numerous studies have evaluated hydrological processes based on the mtt in small mountainous catchments including headwater streams freeman et al 2007 hofmann et al 2018 kabeya et al 2007 katsuyama et al 2009 previous studies have attempted to understand streamflow dynamics in headwater catchments by identifying relationships in mtt scaling for mountainous catchments mcglynn et al 2003 mcguire et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006 tetzlaff et al 2009 such studies have attempted to determine the spatial distribution of mtts linked to the water flow system by comparing the mtt and topographic indices such as catchment area and topographical gradient several recent studies have investigated the spatial variation in mtt based on the storage mixing and release of a catchment suggesting that mtt is mainly influenced by flow paths and storage and depends on bedrock permeability asano and uchida 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 katsuyama et al 2010 pfister et al 2017 the estimation of mtt based on an isotopic tracer technique provides general information on the hydrological cycle in the catchment but the ability to determine the proportional contribution and mixing of hydrological components is limited in this regard hydrogeochemical tracers can be used to assess the contribution of water sources and flow characteristics complementing the interpretation of transit time distribution ttd at the catchment scale banks et al 2011 frisbee et al 2011 a small number of studies have attempted to assess water flow processes in the headwater catchment using both mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters asano and uchida 2012 mueller et al 2013 soulsby et al 2006 we studied the processes of water flow in a headwater catchment with a crystalline bedrock and their responses to changes in hydrologic conditions our ultimate aim was to contribute to the establishment of a water management policy involving headwater catchments the specific objectives were to determine the mtts of various hydrologic components including soil water stream water and groundwater in a small headwater catchment with a granitic basement using a time series of stable isotopic composition and to delineate the flow paths mixing and relationships between the hydrological components by integrating the spatial distribution of the mtts and the spatial and temporal variation in isotopic and hydrogeochemical parameters 2 methods 2 1 study area the donghak catchment in gyeryongsan national park is located in the mid western part of the korea peninsula it is a small mountainous catchment of about 3 75 km2 with a gradient of 31 6 the altitude of the watershed ranges from 175 to 827 m above mean sea level fig 1 yongsucheon as one of the major tributaries of the geum river is a perennial stream that originates from the catchment the stream consists of four headwater streams and discharges into the yellow sea via the geum river the catchment is mostly covered with a quercus mongolica and punus densiflora community knps 2012 the geology of the catchment mainly consists of cretaceous to tertiary granite which has intruded into precambrian metamorphic rocks and metasedimentary rocks of the okcheon supergroup kim et al 1976 granophyre which has a high weathering resistance occupies the upper part of the catchment whereas relatively weakly weathered rocks e g gneissose granite and pink feldspar granite are distributed below the middle part of the catchment the topography is related to the weathering resistance with a v shaped ridge having developed from the west to the east of the catchment due to differential erosion weathered zones of granitic rocks are relatively well developed but alluvial sediments are poorly developed in the study catchment kowaco 2002 groundwater flow is controlled by structural discontinuity and the connectivity of fractures considering that horizontal and vertical fractures and joints are locally developed throughout the study catchment knps 2012 lee and lee 2000 jung et al 2019 reported that streamflow generation is strongly affected by seasonal groundwater discharge in the mountainous terrain including the study catchment by comparing stable isotopic compositions and tritium concentration in groundwater and stream water soils are poorly developed with an average soil depth of 27 5 cm in the catchment knps 2010 the main soil type is a sandy clay loam followed by silt loam and clay loam the soil layer depends on the topographic gradient and is relatively well developed around stream channels with a gentle slope most of the surface is covered by forest litter with a thickness of about 2 3 cm as a byproduct of vegetation processes such as leaf abscission the bulk density and porosity of soil in the catchment are 1 16 1 28 g cm3 and 52 97 respectively as the amount of organic matter in the soil increases the bulk density tends to decrease and the porosity increases the monthly average temperature during the period from 1981 to 2010 was 13 c with a range from 1 0 c in january to 25 6 c in august kma 2019 the mean annual precipitation during 1981 to 2010 was 1458 6 mm with around 71 occurring during summer june to september it is cold and dry in the winter from december to february whereas the summer from june to september is hot and humid with frequent heavy rainfall lee and lee 1999 lee et al 2003 during the study period august 2014 to august 2016 drought conditions were predominant with the average annual precipitation from 2014 to 2016 being approximately 66 of the average for the previous 30 years in 2015 only 55 of the average precipitation was recorded compared to the previous 30 years in the catchment the amount of precipitation in the middle altitude region was generally about 1 5 times higher than in the low altitude region which could be attributed to orographic lifting jung et al 2016 2 2 sample collection precipitation snowpack soil water stream water and groundwater samples were collected at approximately weekly intervals from august 2014 to august 2016 fig 1 a total of 195 rainfall and snowfall samples were collected at three stations located at altitudes of 140 431 and 790 m above mean sea level lp mp and hp respectively to estimate the input function in the catchment jung et al 2019 pre treatment method for precipitation was described in jung et al 2019 in addition daily electrical conductivity ec and water level monitoring were performed at the catchment outlet stream to evaluate the response of the stream to precipitation events from july 2015 to august 2016 soil water was sampled using a suction cup lysimeter ums ulm germany at depths of 40 and 80 cm sw 40 and sw 80 from a gentle slope adjacent to a stream outlet in the catchment seven stream water sampling points which consisted of

crds l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa at kigam analytical uncertainties of ws crds are 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h respectively more details on the isotopic analysis were reported in jung et al 2013 and jung et al 2019 2 4 determination of mean transit time many studies have evaluated the mtt in catchments using tracer techniques kirchner et al 2010 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 stewart et al 2010 tracer techniques provide an opportunity to describe mechanisms operating within catchments the mtt is usually estimated by modeling the relationship between precipitation as an input and hydrological components as outputs using conservative tracers seasonal variation in the stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h is most commonly used to determine the mtt of hydrological components maloszewski et al 1983 stewart and mcdonnell 1991 vitvar and balderer 1997 seasonal variation in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation is progressively attenuated and shifted as the transit time of water increases by mixing along the flow paths in the catchment water flows along various flow paths with wide range of transit time and actual water samples have a certain type of transit time distribution ttd not a single value of transit time in this study we assumed soil water stream water and groundwater have ttd which can be described by exponential flow model em or exponential piston flow model epm considering previous works maloszewski and zuber 1982 kabeya et al 2007 and determined mtt using temporal variation of water stable isotopic compositions for each hydrologic component we calculated the deuterium excess d excess to determine the mtt because d excess in precipitation displays a clear sinusoidal seasonal pattern previous studies have reported that d excess is a useful tracer for estimating the mtt within a catchment influenced by the asian monsoon asano and uchida 2012 kabeya et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2000 the d excess in precipitation din was transformed through a convolution integral into the output d excess dout as suggested by maloszewski and zuber 1982 1 d out t 0 g t d in t t d t where g t is the system response function which specifies the transit time distribution of water within the system in the catchment turner and barnes 1998 zuber 1986 here t is the calendar time and the integration is carried out over the transit time t the em describes a flow system with the characteristics of well mixed water in the catchment it is suitable to estimate mtts in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness and with uniform recharge asano et al 2002 hofmann et al 2018 the em has only one fitting parameter with τ being the mtt of the system the response function g t of em can be written as 2 g t 1 τ exp t τ the epm is a combination of the piston and exponential flow model concepts the epm is widely used to estimate stream flow which can follow various routes and the part of the confined aquifer which affects vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone stewart et al 2010 cartwright and hofmann 2016 the epm expresses the d excess variation influenced by the asian monsoon better than the dispersion model kabeya et al 2007 the epm has two fitting parameters τ and β which are the ratio of the total volume to the volume with an exponential distribution of transit times a value of β 1 indicates the exponential flow model maloszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 the response function of the epm can be written as 3 g t β τ exp β t τ β 1 t τ 1 1 β 4 g t 0 t τ 1 1 β the response functions of em and epm are expressed as mentioned above the time series data of d excess in precipitation soil water stream water and groundwater in the catchment can be described as sinusoidal curves as suggested by maloszewski et al 1983 stewart and mcdonnell 1991 and asano et al 2002 in this case there is a decrease in the amplitude of the d excess variation over the mtt by em and a decrease in amplitude with a phased lag by epm to estimate the goodness of fit of the model the square root of the mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were calculated the rmse and nse are widely used for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data gupta et al 2009 in particular the nse is a normalized measure that compares the mse generated by a particular model simulation to the variance of the target output sequence these were defined as 5 r m s e i 1 n x s t x o t n 6 n s e 1 t 1 n x s t x o t 2 t 1 n x o t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps xs t is the simulated value at time step t xo t is the observed value at time step t and µo is the mean deviation of the observed values the smaller the rmse value the better the model s performance between the simulated and observed values the nse has a range of infinity to 1 with nse 1 indicating a perfect model performance an nse 0 indicating a performance only as good as the use of the mean target value as a prediction and an nse 0 indicating an altogether questionable choice of model schaefli and gupta 2007 generally the simulations are considered satisfactory when r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 3 results 3 1 stable isotope composition of hydrological components the measured δ18o and δ2h values of 195 precipitation events collected at the three stations with different altitudes could be grouped along the summer local meteoric water line lmwl and winter lmwl based on the differences in the d excess fig 2 the average δ18o and δ2h values of all precipitation events were 7 9 and 47 8 respectively and had a higher standard deviation than the other hydrological components table 1 the weighted average values of δ18o and δ2h in all precipitation events were 8 7 and 56 4 respectively based on the amount of precipitation during the study period a more detailed description of the stable isotope composition of precipitation in the catchment was reported by jung et al 2019 the δ18o and δ2h for soil water stream water and groundwater which were the representative response factors of precipitation in the catchment were distributed between the summer and winter lmwls fig 2 most hydrological components were plotted close to the summer lmwl the average δ18o and δ2h values for most hydrological components except soil water at 40 and 80 cm were similar to the weighted average value of precipitation and these ranged from 8 7 to 8 5 and from 56 to 54 7 respectively table 1 in this context the standard deviation of δ18o and δ2h decreased with increasing soil depth stream water and groundwater had low standard deviations δ18o 1 and δ2h 9 compared to soil water in particular the standard deviations of δ18o and δ2h in deep groundwater from two wells were close to the level of analytical uncertainty the seasonal δ18o and δ2h values for evaporated water were calculated using a rayleigh distillation which were defined by majoube 1971 and gonfiantini 1986 the average annual air temperature and relative humidity during the study period were 13 3 c and 76 8 respectively and weighted average δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation were used as the initial values fig 2 the ranges of the δ18o and δ2h values for each hydrological component suggested that the responses to seasonal precipitation were highly variable depending on the flow path scales and mixing the average isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater were similar to the weighted average for precipitation suggesting that the infiltration of precipitation to the subsurface was proportional to the precipitation amount in various flow paths for each hydrological component the average values of all hydrological components were above the rayleigh evaporation line rel fig 2 the seasonal variation and standard deviation of shallow and deep groundwater was very small with no evaporation effect most stream water samples were also affected by a seasonal d excess variation in precipitation rather than an evaporation effect however an evaporation effect was observed in some soil water samples but not shallow groundwater collected at 120 cm the averaged δ18o values were close to the lapse rate of the study area which was defined by jung et al 2019 for most hydrological components except soil water some water components particularly shallow groundwater had depleted δ18o values due to recharge from high altitude areas and were clearly different from the soil water samples that were affected by evaporation fig 3 3 2 the mtt of various hydrologic components the time series of δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation did not show a well defined pattern of seasonal variation due to the amount effect of precipitation while that of the d excess values in precipitation had a clear seasonal variation the model simulations using d excess captured the seasonality of hydrological components particularly the different d excess patterns of precipitation between summer and winter seasons fig 4 the estimated mtts of soil water and stream water using the seasonal variation in d excess by the em and epm were almost satisfied with the fitting parameters table 2 the epm expressed the seasonal variation in d excess slightly better than em in almost all samples based on the fitted parameters the estimated mtts of soil water by epm ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 years increasing with the increase in soil depth the lag phase at the soil depths of 40 and 80 cm was closely linked to the precipitation events however shallow groundwater at 120 cm depth there was a different lag phase that was delayed by more than three times longer than that of soil water samples and was similar to the lag phase for stream water in the catchment the estimated mtt of stream water by epm ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 years and most of the stream had a similar lag phase with a maximum of 8 days based on the direction of stream flow the mtts of the second order stream indicated an mtt that reflected the influence of the first order stream convergence the d excess of deep groundwater displayed no significant seasonal fluctuations although some differences in d excess were observed for groundwater topographic indices including the area length and gradient of hillslopes and stream channels were obtained by analyzing a geographic information system gis database table 3 a 5 m digital elevation model dem from 1 5000 topographic maps was used to compute the topographic indices of first order streams and have been reported in previous studies asano and uchida 2012 mcguire et al 2005 second order streams including the stream at the catchment outlet were excluded from the topographic analyses because the mtts of second order streams had the same average index values as the first order streams that were located in the upper stream channel most topographical indices except stream length were found to have a significant correlation with the mtt of first order streams with r2 values 0 8 fig 5 in particular the hillslope gradient and the mtt of first order streams had the strongest correlation with an r2 value of 0 999 p 0 001 the mtt of first order streams increased with an increase in hillslope area and the length and gradient ratio l g of both the hillslope and stream whereas the mtt decreased with an increase in the stream and hillslope gradient 3 3 spatial variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the distribution of three major solutes ca2 sio2 aq and cl in precipitation soil water stream water and groundwater is shown in table 4 and fig 6 the major solutes in deep groundwater dg 1 were not considered because it was assumed to be affected by a nearby septic tank based on the much higher nitrate concentration average value of 39 mg l range from 3 to 100 mg l than that of other hydrological components relatively low concentrations of the three major solutes were observed in precipitation in general ca2 and sio2 aq concentrations in precipitation and groundwater were clearly different in particular there were significant differences in the sio2 aq concentration among the hydrological components based on their standard deviations the sio2 aq concentration is an indicator of water rock interactions in an area with a crystalline bedrock and the concentration increases with increasing mtt uchida et al 2003 in this study this feature was also observed in stream water with a positive correlation r2 of 0 68 between the mtt and sio2 aq concentration fig 7 however sio2 aq concentration and mtt in soil water and shallow groundwater had no correlation which is significantly different from that of stream water asano et al 2003 also reported that dissolved silica concentration are independent of contact time of water with soil minerals since the dissolved silica concentration in infiltration water in soil quickly reaches that in preexisting soil water in a granitic headwater catchment the cl concentration was highest in upper soil water samples with larger seasonal variation than in other water samples fig 6 in addition the average value and seasonal variation of cl concentration of soil water decreased with increasing mtt and soil depth figs 6 and 7 on the other hand the cl concentration in stream water generally increased with increasing mtt because the study area mainly consists of granitic rocks the supply of cl through water rock interactions is extremely small and samples with a high cl concentration are likely to be affected by evapotranspiration near the surface hayashi et al 1998 in this regard the sio2 aq concentration was considered an indicator of the natural mineralization along the flow paths while the cl concentration was considered to indicate the contribution of upper soil water to other hydrological components in the study catchment to determine the relative contribution to stream water end member mixing analyses emma were conducted using the sio2 aq and cl concentrations three end members were identified precipitation soil water at a depth of 40 cm sw 40 and deep groundwater dg 2 fig 8 the emma was performed using the different sio2 and cl concentrations of precipitation soil water and deep groundwater and the average value of stream water fell within the triangle made by these three end members the emma results indicated that the proportional contribution of deep groundwater to the first order streams was around 25 which was relatively consistent compared to the other end members however the proportional contribution of precipitation to the first order streams decreased and the proportional contribution of soil water increased with the development of the soil layer in the hillslope with a gentle topographic gradient for example fs 1 and fs 2 which had a steep topographic gradient had a relatively small contribution from soil water whereas fs 4 which had a relatively gentle topographic gradient had a larger contribution from soil water 3 4 temporal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the contribution of individual hydrological components to stream water can be highly variable with a dependence on the seasonally contrasting pattern of precipitation which is typical of the asian monsoon in this regard we assessed the temporal variation in the concentrations of major solutes according to the seasonal precipitation pattern data on daily variation in stream discharge ec and sio2 aq and cl concentrations at the catchment outlet are shown in fig 9 the ec and sio2 aq concentration increased after peak stream discharge and the variation was different from the instantaneous variation in stream discharge in particular increased ec and sio2 aq concentrations were maintained in the rainy season after an increase in the stream discharge of more than 2 m3 s which then gradually decreased over several months ec and sio2 aq concentrations were lower in the dry season than in the rainy season except after precipitation events the cl concentration displayed less variation regardless of precipitation events and there was no significant seasonal variation compared to the ec and sio2 aq concentrations fig 9 however the cl concentration temporarily increased from january to february when a heavy snowfall occurred at that time the ca2 concentration also increased at the stream outlet indicating that artificial deicing salts may have contributed to the higher cl concentration at the outlet rather than the natural water flow to identify the impact of major flow processes on the stream channel based on the seasonal variability of hydrological components we assessed the seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations in soil and stream water based on the average daily precipitation of each season fig 10 for soil water the sio2 aq concentration was relatively high in summer and autumn and was lowest in spring in soil water at 40 cm depth the cl concentration was highest in spring and lowest in autumn although daily precipitation was very similar for the two seasons by contrast the cl concentration decreased with increasing daily precipitation in soil water at 80 cm depth and there was no seasonal difference observed in shallow groundwater in the first order streams seasonal variation in the sio2 aq and cl concentrations had a negative correlation with estimated mtt for example seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations was negligible in fs 1 the stream with the shortest mtt while it was larger in fs 4 the stream with the longest mtt 4 discussion 4 1 identification of water flow dynamics using mtt the mtt of hydrological components in a catchment are controlled by various parameters such as land use soil type vegetation bedrock and topography mcguire et al 2005 rodhe et al 1996 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 reported that soil depth hydraulic conductivity and immobile mobile zones have most effect on transit time depending on the catchment scale the estimated mtt of stream water in this study was slightly lower than 2 years which is the average mtt in crystalline catchments of less than 10 km2 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2011 hale and mcdonnell 2016 found that the permeability of bedrock controls the mtt of stream water under base flow conditions in mountainous catchments pfister et al 2017 reported that the difference in storage according to bedrock permeability is also related to mixing potential i e catchment mtt given that catchment mtt gradually decreases with the higher percentage of impermeable bedrock in this regard the relatively short mtt of stream water in this study seems to be due to the low permeability of the massive crystalline bedrock in the catchment the decrease in mtt of the first order streams with increasing topographic gradient suggests that hillslope topography mainly controls the subsurface water flow through the soil layer or interflow to streamflow fig 5 through the use of topographic indices and precipitation intensity tetzlaff et al 2011 reported that soil hydrology strongly influences mountainous catchments that have relatively short mtts 4 years assuming that there is no significant difference in the hydrological response to precipitation events and based on the similarity of bedrock and land use in the catchment the mtt of the first order streams was considered to be closely related to the soil development due to hillslope gradient the emma results showed that the contribution of soil water increased with the increase in mtt for first order streams also indicating that soil development was likely to be a major factor causing mtt differences in stream water fig 8 these results suggest that the mtt of the first order streams was mainly determined by the soil depth which is related to the interflow paths and storage in the catchment the bedrock of the catchment has a low fracture density and weathered zones are poorly developed the estimated mtt of deep groundwater dg 1 and dg 2 are longer than 5 years jung et al 2019 reported that the proportion of old groundwater recharged before 1950 were generally high in most of groundwater through crystalline bedrock aquifers in mountainous terrain in this regard deep groundwater from the bedrock aquifer made only a limited contribution to streamflow in the study catchment but it is considered to play fundamental role in maintaining streamflow in the catchment the mtt of the second order stream was likely to be determined by the contribution of the first order streams rather than the increasing hillslope area indicating that streamflow in the first order streams and its confluence has a strong impact on the mtt in the downstream system in general headwater streams in mountainous regions have been found to play a key role in supplying water flows and controlling water quality in the whole stream network alexander et al 2007 gomi et al 2002 viviroli et al 2007 jung et al 2019 also reported that the stable isotope composition in the downstream areas was directly influenced by the composition in headwater streams for large river basins 4 2 integration of mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters the climate in the study area is under the influence of the asian monsoon with considerable seasonal variation in the amount and d excess values of precipitation however the average isotopic compositions of stream waters shallow groundwater and deep groundwater were similar to those of the weighted average precipitation indicating that most water sources in the catchment have a seasonally unbiased recharge and that groundwater closely related to stream flow generation processes fig 2 by contrast the upper soil water samples had enriched isotopic signatures that deviated considerably from the signatures of the remaining water furthermore the strong correlation between mtt and sio2 aq concentrations in stream water suggests that subsurface water with a long mtt made the largest contribution to streamflow fig 7 these results suggest that stable isotopes and solute concentrations may provide useful information regarding the sources and flow paths of water and their relationships with mtt in the study catchment the sio2 aq and cl concentrations were indicators of natural mineralization and evapotranspiration respectively mtt and cl concentration of soil water and shallow groundwater were strongly correlated while sio2 aq concentration showed no correlation with mtt fig 7 and had different seasonal variation at each site fig 10 suggesting a diversity of water flow depending on the precipitation pattern water flow in the soil layer was closely related to the catchment wetness which was in turn determined by the precipitation pattern zehe et al 2010 kim and jung 2014 demonstrated that the different time scales of water flow in the soil layer were dependent on matrix flow rather than bypass flow following sensitivity analyses of daily mtt using soil moisture in a headwater catchment in korea that was similar to the catchment investigated in the present study in particular the transport of solutes leading to elevated concentrations become active when a lateral downslope flow occurred with increasing wetness in the soil layer mcnamara et al 2005 kelly et al 1998 reported that evaporation and transpiration can cause enrichment of dissolved silica concentration in soil water lower part of soil layer has more silicate minerals available for weathering scanlon et al 2001 in this regard sio2 aq concentration in soil water at depth of 80 cm is likely to be increased by matrix flow when precipitation events were concentrated this could explain the considerable increases in the sio2 aq concentration in soil water during summer at all depths on the other hand the seasonal variation in the cl concentration seemed to be associated with a dilution effect due to bypass flow in the thicker soil layer vertical infiltration in the form of bypass flow may occur during the rainy season because the permeability in the soil layer decreases as the soil depth increases uhlenbrook et al 2002 which could account for the decrease in the cl concentration in the upper soil water during summer fig 10 seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations in shallow groundwater through soil bedrock interface was significantly smaller than in the soil water figs 7 and 10 in terms of hydrological processes this result suggests that hydrological connectivity between soil layer and soil bedrock interface is very poor although the layer is continuous in addition shallow groundwater is likely to be mainly recharged from higher altitude regions rather than vertical infiltration based on the depleted isotopic composition fig 3 gabrielli et al 2012 reported that a highly fractured zone within the upper one meter of bedrock acts as a lateral preferential flow path connecting saturated upslope areas with riparian zones near the stream at storm events gascuel odoux et al 2010 also reported that lateral variation in hydraulic conductivity is an important factor for determining stream dynamics and fluxes in a crystalline hillslope area in this regard the smaller seasonal variation was considered to be associated with the lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface which contains coarser particles and has a lower geochemical reactivity than the soil layer previous studies have shown strong correlations between mtt and topographical indices in catchments where lateral flow via the soil bedrock interface significantly contributes to streamflow generation asano and uchida 2012 hrachowitz et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 muñoz villers et al 2016 therefore shallow groundwater in the study catchment is considered to represent later flow through soil bedrock interface for first order streams the increased seasonal variation in the sio2 aq and cl concentrations with increasing mtt may be attributable to differences in storage capacity and the dominant flow paths in the soil layer which depend on soil depth and hillslope gradient fig 10 in a steep hillslope area with thin soil such as fs 1 overland flow and infiltration into soil bedrock interface were the dominant processes resulting in faster subsurface flow while in a gentle hillslope area with thick soil such as fs 4 matrix flow within the soil layer was the dominant process generating slower subsurface flow when the soil is sufficiently wet uhlenbrook et al 2002 at the stream outlet the variation in cl concentration was similar to that of the shallow groundwater indicating that lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface dominates the stream water most of the time figs 9 and 10 in addition the difference between the ec and sio2 aq concentration in the dry and rainy season was likely due to the varying influence of matrix flow through the soil layer which was consistent with the seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations depending on the wetness condition we constructed a conceptual model for water flow systems that was dependent on the topographic gradient in a crystalline mountainous catchment and integrated our results over two representative seasons fig 11 in the study catchment shallow groundwater through soil bedrock interface is considered to play key role in streamflow generation moreover the development of soil layer according to topographic gradient also influences flow paths of soil water and groundwater flowing to the stream this conceptual model indicated that the streamflow generation processes of first order streams were spatially different due to the impact of water flow pathways caused by storage in the soil layer a knowledge of hydrological processes in headwater catchments is essential to evaluate sustainable water resources and assess the potential impacts of increasing water use and an insecure water supply due to climate change banks et al 2011 the estimation of mtt using various hydrologic components in a mountainous headwater catchment in association with geochemical and hydrometric parameters can provide a useful tool to evaluate the responses of the stream network to inter annual variability in climate and enable the establishment of sustainable water management plans 5 conclusions time series measurements of stable isotope composition and conservative solutes cl and sio2 aq in water samples were used to evaluate water flow processes in a small mountainous catchment with granitic bedrock based on the mtt and seasonal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the mtt of soil water ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 years and increased with increasing soil depth the cl concentration in soil water was higher in the dry season due to evapotranspiration and lower in the rainy season due to vertical infiltration as bypass flow while the sio2 aq concentration in soil water increased by depths during the rainy season due to matrix flow driven by increasing wetness the mtt of the first order stream waters ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 years and increased linearly with the decrease in the topographic gradient the mtt of second order streams was controlled by the tributary junctions of the first order streams indicating that streamflow in the first order streams and its confluence had a strong impact on the mtt in the downstream system shallow groundwater had lower sio2 aq and cl concentrations compared to soil water with smaller seasonal variation and depleted isotopic signature in addition estimated mtt of shallow groundwater was 1 5 years and was closely related to the relationship between mtt and conservative solutes in stream water indicating the contribution of lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface is significant to stream flow generation in addition the sio2 aq and cl concentrations at the catchment outlet were similar to the concentrations of shallow groundwater in the dry season suggesting that lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface made a more significant contribution to stream discharge than deep groundwater through bedrock fractures given the relatively long mtt over 5 years based on the sio2 aq and cl concentrations the contribution of the faster subsurface flow through the soil bedrock interface was higher in the streams with a steep gradient while the contribution of the slower subsurface flow in the soil layer was dominant in streams with a gentle gradient in this study the integration of mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters revealed that soil depth and its spatial distribution mainly controlled the storage and dominant water flow paths in hillslope areas which was determined by the topographic gradient and soil bedrock interface in a major channel connecting the water flow in a hillslope area and the streams in the study catchment with a low permeability crystalline bedrock credit authorship contribution statement youn young jung

5399,headwater catchments make a considerable contribution to the discharge of whole stream networks and mean transit time mtt is a fundamental factor affecting flow and storage in the hydrologic system we estimated the mtt along with the identification of subsurface water flow processes using time series measurements of stable isotopes and major solutes in the water of a small mountainous catchment with granitic bedrock under a humid temperate climate the mtt was estimated to be 1 1 1 7 years 0 5 0 8 years and 1 5 years for stream water at the catchment outlet and first order tributaries soil water and shallow groundwater respectively based on sinusoidal variation in deuterium excess in the hydrologic components and precipitation the mtt of first order streams was negatively correlated with the topographic gradient of the sub catchments the sio2 aq and cl concentrations in first order streams were used to discriminate dominant subsurface flow contributing to the streams depending on the topographic gradient soil water had a higher seasonal variability in sio2 aq and cl concentrations which were controlled by rainfall infiltration whereas shallow groundwater had significantly lower seasonal variability with a depleted isotopic signature suggesting the contribution of lateral water flows from the upgradient area the increased seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations with increasing mtt in first order streams indicated that the storage capacity and flow paths in the soil layer were determining factors for subsurface water flow in hillslope areas seasonal variation in the sio2 aq concentration at the catchment outlet revealed a major contribution of subsurface flow to stream discharge as lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface and an interflow through the soil layer in the dry and rainy seasons respectively through the integration of the mtt and seasonal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters in soil water stream water and groundwater this study demonstrates that soil depth and the soil bedrock interface were the main controls on streamflow generation in a headwater catchment with a crystalline bedrock

catchment provides insight into the hydrological processes related to water flow generation through various pathways mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 the mtt in the catchment also provides an integrated tool for understanding the mixing processes of hydrological components mcdonnell et al 2010 tetzlaff et al 2011 this implies that tracer inputs mix with stored water at the catchment scale to facilitate the damping and time lag between inputs and outputs kirchner et al 2000 soulsby et al 2009 the estimation of mtt provides fundamental information about the storage source and flow path of water with advection and dispersion at the catchment scale mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 spence 2000 because the distribution of mtt reflects how catchments store and release water and solutes it can be used to evaluate the response of hydrological components to climate change and the release or persistence of contaminants kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell et al 2010 mountainous regions are recognized as water towers that significantly contribute to sustainable water resources in adjacent plain and downstream areas cantafio and ryan 2014 gomi et al 2002 recent studies have reported that more than 50 of the world s potential water supply is supplied from mountainous regions although the water supply may vary depending on the climate alexander et al 2007 viviroli et al 2007 numerous studies have evaluated hydrological processes based on the mtt in small mountainous catchments including headwater streams freeman et al 2007 hofmann et al 2018 kabeya et al 2007 katsuyama et al 2009 previous studies have attempted to understand streamflow dynamics in headwater catchments by identifying relationships in mtt scaling for mountainous catchments mcglynn et al 2003 mcguire et al 2005 soulsby et al 2006 tetzlaff et al 2009 such studies have attempted to determine the spatial distribution of mtts linked to the water flow system by comparing the mtt and topographic indices such as catchment area and topographical gradient several recent studies have investigated the spatial variation in mtt based on the storage mixing and release of a catchment suggesting that mtt is mainly influenced by flow paths and storage and depends on bedrock permeability asano and uchida 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 katsuyama et al 2010 pfister et al 2017 the estimation of mtt based on an isotopic tracer technique provides general information on the hydrological cycle in the catchment but the ability to determine the proportional contribution and mixing of hydrological components is limited in this regard hydrogeochemical tracers can be used to assess the contribution of water sources and flow characteristics complementing the interpretation of transit time distribution ttd at the catchment scale banks et al 2011 frisbee et al 2011 a small number of studies have attempted to assess water flow processes in the headwater catchment using both mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters asano and uchida 2012 mueller et al 2013 soulsby et al 2006 we studied the processes of water flow in a headwater catchment with a crystalline bedrock and their responses to changes in hydrologic conditions our ultimate aim was to contribute to the establishment of a water management policy involving headwater catchments the specific objectives were to determine the mtts of various hydrologic components including soil water stream water and groundwater in a small headwater catchment with a granitic basement using a time series of stable isotopic composition and to delineate the flow paths mixing and relationships between the hydrological components by integrating the spatial distribution of the mtts and the spatial and temporal variation in isotopic and hydrogeochemical parameters 2 methods 2 1 study area the donghak catchment in gyeryongsan national park is located in the mid western part of the korea peninsula it is a small mountainous catchment of about 3 75 km2 with a gradient of 31 6 the altitude of the watershed ranges from 175 to 827 m above mean sea level fig 1 yongsucheon as one of the major tributaries of the geum river is a perennial stream that originates from the catchment the stream consists of four headwater streams and discharges into the yellow sea via the geum river the catchment is mostly covered with a quercus mongolica and punus densiflora community knps 2012 the geology of the catchment mainly consists of cretaceous to tertiary granite which has intruded into precambrian metamorphic rocks and metasedimentary rocks of the okcheon supergroup kim et al 1976 granophyre which has a high weathering resistance occupies the upper part of the catchment whereas relatively weakly weathered rocks e g gneissose granite and pink feldspar granite are distributed below the middle part of the catchment the topography is related to the weathering resistance with a v shaped ridge having developed from the west to the east of the catchment due to differential erosion weathered zones of granitic rocks are relatively well developed but alluvial sediments are poorly developed in the study catchment kowaco 2002 groundwater flow is controlled by structural discontinuity and the connectivity of fractures considering that horizontal and vertical fractures and joints are locally developed throughout the study catchment knps 2012 lee and lee 2000 jung et al 2019 reported that streamflow generation is strongly affected by seasonal groundwater discharge in the mountainous terrain including the study catchment by comparing stable isotopic compositions and tritium concentration in groundwater and stream water soils are poorly developed with an average soil depth of 27 5 cm in the catchment knps 2010 the main soil type is a sandy clay loam followed by silt loam and clay loam the soil layer depends on the topographic gradient and is relatively well developed around stream channels with a gentle slope most of the surface is covered by forest litter with a thickness of about 2 3 cm as a byproduct of vegetation processes such as leaf abscission the bulk density and porosity of soil in the catchment are 1 16 1 28 g cm3 and 52 97 respectively as the amount of organic matter in the soil increases the bulk density tends to decrease and the porosity increases the monthly average temperature during the period from 1981 to 2010 was 13 c with a range from 1 0 c in january to 25 6 c in august kma 2019 the mean annual precipitation during 1981 to 2010 was 1458 6 mm with around 71 occurring during summer june to september it is cold and dry in the winter from december to february whereas the summer from june to september is hot and humid with frequent heavy rainfall lee and lee 1999 lee et al 2003 during the study period august 2014 to august 2016 drought conditions were predominant with the average annual precipitation from 2014 to 2016 being approximately 66 of the average for the previous 30 years in 2015 only 55 of the average precipitation was recorded compared to the previous 30 years in the catchment the amount of precipitation in the middle altitude region was generally about 1 5 times higher than in the low altitude region which could be attributed to orographic lifting jung et al 2016 2 2 sample collection precipitation snowpack soil water stream water and groundwater samples were collected at approximately weekly intervals from august 2014 to august 2016 fig 1 a total of 195 rainfall and snowfall samples were collected at three stations located at altitudes of 140 431 and 790 m above mean sea level lp mp and hp respectively to estimate the input function in the catchment jung et al 2019 pre treatment method for precipitation was described in jung et al 2019 in addition daily electrical conductivity ec and water level monitoring were performed at the catchment outlet stream to evaluate the response of the stream to precipitation events from july 2015 to august 2016 soil water was sampled using a suction cup lysimeter ums ulm germany at depths of 40 and 80 cm sw 40 and sw 80 from a gentle slope adjacent to a stream outlet in the catchment seven stream water sampling points which consisted of four headwater streams fs 1 fs 2 fs 3 and fs 4 two points of confluence of first and second order streams ss 1 ss 2 and a stream outlet so in the catchment were sampled directly from stream all stream water samples were collected during non storm and continuous flow conditions shallow groundwater through weathered zone was sampled using a piezometer at a depth of 120 cm sg deep groundwater samples through fracture bedrock were collected in two wells in the catchment with total depths of 30 dg 1 and 80 m dg 2 respectively temperature ec dissolved oxygen do and ph of all samples except the soil water from suction cup lysimeters were determined at these field sites and the samples were collected when these parameters were stable all samples were filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and were kept refrigerated at 4 c in 125 ml hdpe bottles until analyses 2 3 chemical and isotopic analyses of water samples cl and no3 concentrations were measured using ion exchange chromatography ics 1500 dionex with ionpac as14 4 mm column at the groundwater research center korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam daejeon south korea ca2 and sio2 aq concentrations were quantified using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes optima 4300du perkin elmer at the kigam analytical uncertainties of dissolved solutes were less than 3 with limits of quantitation of 0 01 mg l and 0 05 mg l for ca2 and sio2 aq respectively and of 0 1 mg l for cl and no3 water stable isotopes of 18o and 2h were determined using wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds l2120 i picarro santa clara ca usa at kigam analytical uncertainties of ws crds are 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h respectively more details on the isotopic analysis were reported in jung et al 2013 and jung et al 2019 2 4 determination of mean transit time many studies have evaluated the mtt in catchments using tracer techniques kirchner et al 2010 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 stewart et al 2010 tracer techniques provide an opportunity to describe mechanisms operating within catchments the mtt is usually estimated by modeling the relationship between precipitation as an input and hydrological components as outputs using conservative tracers seasonal variation in the stable isotope ratios of oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h is most commonly used to determine the mtt of hydrological components maloszewski et al 1983 stewart and mcdonnell 1991 vitvar and balderer 1997 seasonal variation in the stable isotopic composition of precipitation is progressively attenuated and shifted as the transit time of water increases by mixing along the flow paths in the catchment water flows along various flow paths with wide range of transit time and actual water samples have a certain type of transit time distribution ttd not a single value of transit time in this study we assumed soil water stream water and groundwater have ttd which can be described by exponential flow model em or exponential piston flow model epm considering previous works maloszewski and zuber 1982 kabeya et al 2007 and determined mtt using temporal variation of water stable isotopic compositions for each hydrologic component we calculated the deuterium excess d excess to determine the mtt because d excess in precipitation displays a clear sinusoidal seasonal pattern previous studies have reported that d excess is a useful tracer for estimating the mtt within a catchment influenced by the asian monsoon asano and uchida 2012 kabeya et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2000 the d excess in precipitation din was transformed through a convolution integral into the output d excess dout as suggested by maloszewski and zuber 1982 1 d out t 0 g t d in t t d t where g t is the system response function which specifies the transit time distribution of water within the system in the catchment turner and barnes 1998 zuber 1986 here t is the calendar time and the integration is carried out over the transit time t the em describes a flow system with the characteristics of well mixed water in the catchment it is suitable to estimate mtts in a homogeneous unconfined aquifer of constant thickness and with uniform recharge asano et al 2002 hofmann et al 2018 the em has only one fitting parameter with τ being the mtt of the system the response function g t of em can be written as 2 g t 1 τ exp t τ the epm is a combination of the piston and exponential flow model concepts the epm is widely used to estimate stream flow which can follow various routes and the part of the confined aquifer which affects vertical recharge through the unsaturated zone stewart et al 2010 cartwright and hofmann 2016 the epm expresses the d excess variation influenced by the asian monsoon better than the dispersion model kabeya et al 2007 the epm has two fitting parameters τ and β which are the ratio of the total volume to the volume with an exponential distribution of transit times a value of β 1 indicates the exponential flow model maloszewski and zuber 1982 zuber 1986 the response function of the epm can be written as 3 g t β τ exp β t τ β 1 t τ 1 1 β 4 g t 0 t τ 1 1 β the response functions of em and epm are expressed as mentioned above the time series data of d excess in precipitation soil water stream water and groundwater in the catchment can be described as sinusoidal curves as suggested by maloszewski et al 1983 stewart and mcdonnell 1991 and asano et al 2002 in this case there is a decrease in the amplitude of the d excess variation over the mtt by em and a decrease in amplitude with a phased lag by epm to estimate the goodness of fit of the model the square root of the mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were calculated the rmse and nse are widely used for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data gupta et al 2009 in particular the nse is a normalized measure that compares the mse generated by a particular model simulation to the variance of the target output sequence these were defined as 5 r m s e i 1 n x s t x o t n 6 n s e 1 t 1 n x s t x o t 2 t 1 n x o t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps xs t is the simulated value at time step t xo t is the observed value at time step t and µo is the mean deviation of the observed values the smaller the rmse value the better the model s performance between the simulated and observed values the nse has a range of infinity to 1 with nse 1 indicating a perfect model performance an nse 0 indicating a performance only as good as the use of the mean target value as a prediction and an nse 0 indicating an altogether questionable choice of model schaefli and gupta 2007 generally the simulations are considered satisfactory when r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 3 results 3 1 stable isotope composition of hydrological components the measured δ18o and δ2h values of 195 precipitation events collected at the three stations with different altitudes could be grouped along the summer local meteoric water line lmwl and winter lmwl based on the differences in the d excess fig 2 the average δ18o and δ2h values of all precipitation events were 7 9 and 47 8 respectively and had a higher standard deviation than the other hydrological components table 1 the weighted average values of δ18o and δ2h in all precipitation events were 8 7 and 56 4 respectively based on the amount of precipitation during the study period a more detailed description of the stable isotope composition of precipitation in the catchment was reported by jung et al 2019 the δ18o and δ2h for soil water stream water and groundwater which were the representative response factors of precipitation in the catchment were distributed between the summer and winter lmwls fig 2 most hydrological components were plotted close to the summer lmwl the average δ18o and δ2h values for most hydrological components except soil water at 40 and 80 cm were similar to the weighted average value of precipitation and these ranged from 8 7 to 8 5 and from 56 to 54 7 respectively table 1 in this context the standard deviation of δ18o and δ2h decreased with increasing soil depth stream water and groundwater had low standard deviations δ18o 1 and δ2h 9 compared to soil water in particular the standard deviations of δ18o and δ2h in deep groundwater from two wells were close to the level of analytical uncertainty the seasonal δ18o and δ2h values for evaporated water were calculated using a rayleigh distillation which were defined by majoube 1971 and gonfiantini 1986 the average annual air temperature and relative humidity during the study period were 13 3 c and 76 8 respectively and weighted average δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation were used as the initial values fig 2 the ranges of the δ18o and δ2h values for each hydrological component suggested that the responses to seasonal precipitation were highly variable depending on the flow path scales and mixing the average isotopic compositions of stream water and groundwater were similar to the weighted average for precipitation suggesting that the infiltration of precipitation to the subsurface was proportional to the precipitation amount in various flow paths for each hydrological component the average values of all hydrological components were above the rayleigh evaporation line rel fig 2 the seasonal variation and standard deviation of shallow and deep groundwater was very small with no evaporation effect most stream water samples were also affected by a seasonal d excess variation in precipitation rather than an evaporation effect however an evaporation effect was observed in some soil water samples but not shallow groundwater collected at 120 cm the averaged δ18o values were close to the lapse rate of the study area which was defined by jung et al 2019 for most hydrological components except soil water some water components particularly shallow groundwater had depleted δ18o values due to recharge from high altitude areas and were clearly different from the soil water samples that were affected by evaporation fig 3 3 2 the mtt of various hydrologic components the time series of δ18o and δ2h values in precipitation did not show a well defined pattern of seasonal variation due to the amount effect of precipitation while that of the d excess values in precipitation had a clear seasonal variation the model simulations using d excess captured the seasonality of hydrological components particularly the different d excess patterns of precipitation between summer and winter seasons fig 4 the estimated mtts of soil water and stream water using the seasonal variation in d excess by the em and epm were almost satisfied with the fitting parameters table 2 the epm expressed the seasonal variation in d excess slightly better than em in almost all samples based on the fitted parameters the estimated mtts of soil water by epm ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 years increasing with the increase in soil depth the lag phase at the soil depths of 40 and 80 cm was closely linked to the precipitation events however shallow groundwater at 120 cm depth there was a different lag phase that was delayed by more than three times longer than that of soil water samples and was similar to the lag phase for stream water in the catchment the estimated mtt of stream water by epm ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 years and most of the stream had a similar lag phase with a maximum of 8 days based on the direction of stream flow the mtts of the second order stream indicated an mtt that reflected the influence of the first order stream convergence the d excess of deep groundwater displayed no significant seasonal fluctuations although some differences in d excess were observed for groundwater topographic indices including the area length and gradient of hillslopes and stream channels were obtained by analyzing a geographic information system gis database table 3 a 5 m digital elevation model dem from 1 5000 topographic maps was used to compute the topographic indices of first order streams and have been reported in previous studies asano and uchida 2012 mcguire et al 2005 second order streams including the stream at the catchment outlet were excluded from the topographic analyses because the mtts of second order streams had the same average index values as the first order streams that were located in the upper stream channel most topographical indices except stream length were found to have a significant correlation with the mtt of first order streams with r2 values 0 8 fig 5 in particular the hillslope gradient and the mtt of first order streams had the strongest correlation with an r2 value of 0 999 p 0 001 the mtt of first order streams increased with an increase in hillslope area and the length and gradient ratio l g of both the hillslope and stream whereas the mtt decreased with an increase in the stream and hillslope gradient 3 3 spatial variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the distribution of three major solutes ca2 sio2 aq and cl in precipitation soil water stream water and groundwater is shown in table 4 and fig 6 the major solutes in deep groundwater dg 1 were not considered because it was assumed to be affected by a nearby septic tank based on the much higher nitrate concentration average value of 39 mg l range from 3 to 100 mg l than that of other hydrological components relatively low concentrations of the three major solutes were observed in precipitation in general ca2 and sio2 aq concentrations in precipitation and groundwater were clearly different in particular there were significant differences in the sio2 aq concentration among the hydrological components based on their standard deviations the sio2 aq concentration is an indicator of water rock interactions in an area with a crystalline bedrock and the concentration increases with increasing mtt uchida et al 2003 in this study this feature was also observed in stream water with a positive correlation r2 of 0 68 between the mtt and sio2 aq concentration fig 7 however sio2 aq concentration and mtt in soil water and shallow groundwater had no correlation which is significantly different from that of stream water asano et al 2003 also reported that dissolved silica concentration are independent of contact time of water with soil minerals since the dissolved silica concentration in infiltration water in soil quickly reaches that in preexisting soil water in a granitic headwater catchment the cl concentration was highest in upper soil water samples with larger seasonal variation than in other water samples fig 6 in addition the average value and seasonal variation of cl concentration of soil water decreased with increasing mtt and soil depth figs 6 and 7 on the other hand the cl concentration in stream water generally increased with increasing mtt because the study area mainly consists of granitic rocks the supply of cl through water rock interactions is extremely small and samples with a high cl concentration are likely to be affected by evapotranspiration near the surface hayashi et al 1998 in this regard the sio2 aq concentration was considered an indicator of the natural mineralization along the flow paths while the cl concentration was considered to indicate the contribution of upper soil water to other hydrological components in the study catchment to determine the relative contribution to stream water end member mixing analyses emma were conducted using the sio2 aq and cl concentrations three end members were identified precipitation soil water at a depth of 40 cm sw 40 and deep groundwater dg 2 fig 8 the emma was performed using the different sio2 and cl concentrations of precipitation soil water and deep groundwater and the average value of stream water fell within the triangle made by these three end members the emma results indicated that the proportional contribution of deep groundwater to the first order streams was around 25 which was relatively consistent compared to the other end members however the proportional contribution of precipitation to the first order streams decreased and the proportional contribution of soil water increased with the development of the soil layer in the hillslope with a gentle topographic gradient for example fs 1 and fs 2 which had a steep topographic gradient had a relatively small contribution from soil water whereas fs 4 which had a relatively gentle topographic gradient had a larger contribution from soil water 3 4 temporal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the contribution of individual hydrological components to stream water can be highly variable with a dependence on the seasonally contrasting pattern of precipitation which is typical of the asian monsoon in this regard we assessed the temporal variation in the concentrations of major solutes according to the seasonal precipitation pattern data on daily variation in stream discharge ec and sio2 aq and cl concentrations at the catchment outlet are shown in fig 9 the ec and sio2 aq concentration increased after peak stream discharge and the variation was different from the instantaneous variation in stream discharge in particular increased ec and sio2 aq concentrations were maintained in the rainy season after an increase in the stream discharge of more than 2 m3 s which then gradually decreased over several months ec and sio2 aq concentrations were lower in the dry season than in the rainy season except after precipitation events the cl concentration displayed less variation regardless of precipitation events and there was no significant seasonal variation compared to the ec and sio2 aq concentrations fig 9 however the cl concentration temporarily increased from january to february when a heavy snowfall occurred at that time the ca2 concentration also increased at the stream outlet indicating that artificial deicing salts may have contributed to the higher cl concentration at the outlet rather than the natural water flow to identify the impact of major flow processes on the stream channel based on the seasonal variability of hydrological components we assessed the seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations in soil and stream water based on the average daily precipitation of each season fig 10 for soil water the sio2 aq concentration was relatively high in summer and autumn and was lowest in spring in soil water at 40 cm depth the cl concentration was highest in spring and lowest in autumn although daily precipitation was very similar for the two seasons by contrast the cl concentration decreased with increasing daily precipitation in soil water at 80 cm depth and there was no seasonal difference observed in shallow groundwater in the first order streams seasonal variation in the sio2 aq and cl concentrations had a negative correlation with estimated mtt for example seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations was negligible in fs 1 the stream with the shortest mtt while it was larger in fs 4 the stream with the longest mtt 4 discussion 4 1 identification of water flow dynamics using mtt the mtt of hydrological components in a catchment are controlled by various parameters such as land use soil type vegetation bedrock and topography mcguire et al 2005 rodhe et al 1996 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 reported that soil depth hydraulic conductivity and immobile mobile zones have most effect on transit time depending on the catchment scale the estimated mtt of stream water in this study was slightly lower than 2 years which is the average mtt in crystalline catchments of less than 10 km2 hrachowitz et al 2010 soulsby et al 2009 tetzlaff et al 2011 hale and mcdonnell 2016 found that the permeability of bedrock controls the mtt of stream water under base flow conditions in mountainous catchments pfister et al 2017 reported that the difference in storage according to bedrock permeability is also related to mixing potential i e catchment mtt given that catchment mtt gradually decreases with the higher percentage of impermeable bedrock in this regard the relatively short mtt of stream water in this study seems to be due to the low permeability of the massive crystalline bedrock in the catchment the decrease in mtt of the first order streams with increasing topographic gradient suggests that hillslope topography mainly controls the subsurface water flow through the soil layer or interflow to streamflow fig 5 through the use of topographic indices and precipitation intensity tetzlaff et al 2011 reported that soil hydrology strongly influences mountainous catchments that have relatively short mtts 4 years assuming that there is no significant difference in the hydrological response to precipitation events and based on the similarity of bedrock and land use in the catchment the mtt of the first order streams was considered to be closely related to the soil development due to hillslope gradient the emma results showed that the contribution of soil water increased with the increase in mtt for first order streams also indicating that soil development was likely to be a major factor causing mtt differences in stream water fig 8 these results suggest that the mtt of the first order streams was mainly determined by the soil depth which is related to the interflow paths and storage in the catchment the bedrock of the catchment has a low fracture density and weathered zones are poorly developed the estimated mtt of deep groundwater dg 1 and dg 2 are longer than 5 years jung et al 2019 reported that the proportion of old groundwater recharged before 1950 were generally high in most of groundwater through crystalline bedrock aquifers in mountainous terrain in this regard deep groundwater from the bedrock aquifer made only a limited contribution to streamflow in the study catchment but it is considered to play fundamental role in maintaining streamflow in the catchment the mtt of the second order stream was likely to be determined by the contribution of the first order streams rather than the increasing hillslope area indicating that streamflow in the first order streams and its confluence has a strong impact on the mtt in the downstream system in general headwater streams in mountainous regions have been found to play a key role in supplying water flows and controlling water quality in the whole stream network alexander et al 2007 gomi et al 2002 viviroli et al 2007 jung et al 2019 also reported that the stable isotope composition in the downstream areas was directly influenced by the composition in headwater streams for large river basins 4 2 integration of mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters the climate in the study area is under the influence of the asian monsoon with considerable seasonal variation in the amount and d excess values of precipitation however the average isotopic compositions of stream waters shallow groundwater and deep groundwater were similar to those of the weighted average precipitation indicating that most water sources in the catchment have a seasonally unbiased recharge and that groundwater closely related to stream flow generation processes fig 2 by contrast the upper soil water samples had enriched isotopic signatures that deviated considerably from the signatures of the remaining water furthermore the strong correlation between mtt and sio2 aq concentrations in stream water suggests that subsurface water with a long mtt made the largest contribution to streamflow fig 7 these results suggest that stable isotopes and solute concentrations may provide useful information regarding the sources and flow paths of water and their relationships with mtt in the study catchment the sio2 aq and cl concentrations were indicators of natural mineralization and evapotranspiration respectively mtt and cl concentration of soil water and shallow groundwater were strongly correlated while sio2 aq concentration showed no correlation with mtt fig 7 and had different seasonal variation at each site fig 10 suggesting a diversity of water flow depending on the precipitation pattern water flow in the soil layer was closely related to the catchment wetness which was in turn determined by the precipitation pattern zehe et al 2010 kim and jung 2014 demonstrated that the different time scales of water flow in the soil layer were dependent on matrix flow rather than bypass flow following sensitivity analyses of daily mtt using soil moisture in a headwater catchment in korea that was similar to the catchment investigated in the present study in particular the transport of solutes leading to elevated concentrations become active when a lateral downslope flow occurred with increasing wetness in the soil layer mcnamara et al 2005 kelly et al 1998 reported that evaporation and transpiration can cause enrichment of dissolved silica concentration in soil water lower part of soil layer has more silicate minerals available for weathering scanlon et al 2001 in this regard sio2 aq concentration in soil water at depth of 80 cm is likely to be increased by matrix flow when precipitation events were concentrated this could explain the considerable increases in the sio2 aq concentration in soil water during summer at all depths on the other hand the seasonal variation in the cl concentration seemed to be associated with a dilution effect due to bypass flow in the thicker soil layer vertical infiltration in the form of bypass flow may occur during the rainy season because the permeability in the soil layer decreases as the soil depth increases uhlenbrook et al 2002 which could account for the decrease in the cl concentration in the upper soil water during summer fig 10 seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations in shallow groundwater through soil bedrock interface was significantly smaller than in the soil water figs 7 and 10 in terms of hydrological processes this result suggests that hydrological connectivity between soil layer and soil bedrock interface is very poor although the layer is continuous in addition shallow groundwater is likely to be mainly recharged from higher altitude regions rather than vertical infiltration based on the depleted isotopic composition fig 3 gabrielli et al 2012 reported that a highly fractured zone within the upper one meter of bedrock acts as a lateral preferential flow path connecting saturated upslope areas with riparian zones near the stream at storm events gascuel odoux et al 2010 also reported that lateral variation in hydraulic conductivity is an important factor for determining stream dynamics and fluxes in a crystalline hillslope area in this regard the smaller seasonal variation was considered to be associated with the lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface which contains coarser particles and has a lower geochemical reactivity than the soil layer previous studies have shown strong correlations between mtt and topographical indices in catchments where lateral flow via the soil bedrock interface significantly contributes to streamflow generation asano and uchida 2012 hrachowitz et al 2010 mcguire et al 2005 muñoz villers et al 2016 therefore shallow groundwater in the study catchment is considered to represent later flow through soil bedrock interface for first order streams the increased seasonal variation in the sio2 aq and cl concentrations with increasing mtt may be attributable to differences in storage capacity and the dominant flow paths in the soil layer which depend on soil depth and hillslope gradient fig 10 in a steep hillslope area with thin soil such as fs 1 overland flow and infiltration into soil bedrock interface were the dominant processes resulting in faster subsurface flow while in a gentle hillslope area with thick soil such as fs 4 matrix flow within the soil layer was the dominant process generating slower subsurface flow when the soil is sufficiently wet uhlenbrook et al 2002 at the stream outlet the variation in cl concentration was similar to that of the shallow groundwater indicating that lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface dominates the stream water most of the time figs 9 and 10 in addition the difference between the ec and sio2 aq concentration in the dry and rainy season was likely due to the varying influence of matrix flow through the soil layer which was consistent with the seasonal variation in sio2 aq and cl concentrations depending on the wetness condition we constructed a conceptual model for water flow systems that was dependent on the topographic gradient in a crystalline mountainous catchment and integrated our results over two representative seasons fig 11 in the study catchment shallow groundwater through soil bedrock interface is considered to play key role in streamflow generation moreover the development of soil layer according to topographic gradient also influences flow paths of soil water and groundwater flowing to the stream this conceptual model indicated that the streamflow generation processes of first order streams were spatially different due to the impact of water flow pathways caused by storage in the soil layer a knowledge of hydrological processes in headwater catchments is essential to evaluate sustainable water resources and assess the potential impacts of increasing water use and an insecure water supply due to climate change banks et al 2011 the estimation of mtt using various hydrologic components in a mountainous headwater catchment in association with geochemical and hydrometric parameters can provide a useful tool to evaluate the responses of the stream network to inter annual variability in climate and enable the establishment of sustainable water management plans 5 conclusions time series measurements of stable isotope composition and conservative solutes cl and sio2 aq in water samples were used to evaluate water flow processes in a small mountainous catchment with granitic bedrock based on the mtt and seasonal variation in hydrogeochemical parameters the mtt of soil water ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 years and increased with increasing soil depth the cl concentration in soil water was higher in the dry season due to evapotranspiration and lower in the rainy season due to vertical infiltration as bypass flow while the sio2 aq concentration in soil water increased by depths during the rainy season due to matrix flow driven by increasing wetness the mtt of the first order stream waters ranged from 1 1 to 1 7 years and increased linearly with the decrease in the topographic gradient the mtt of second order streams was controlled by the tributary junctions of the first order streams indicating that streamflow in the first order streams and its confluence had a strong impact on the mtt in the downstream system shallow groundwater had lower sio2 aq and cl concentrations compared to soil water with smaller seasonal variation and depleted isotopic signature in addition estimated mtt of shallow groundwater was 1 5 years and was closely related to the relationship between mtt and conservative solutes in stream water indicating the contribution of lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface is significant to stream flow generation in addition the sio2 aq and cl concentrations at the catchment outlet were similar to the concentrations of shallow groundwater in the dry season suggesting that lateral flow through the soil bedrock interface made a more significant contribution to stream discharge than deep groundwater through bedrock fractures given the relatively long mtt over 5 years based on the sio2 aq and cl concentrations the contribution of the faster subsurface flow through the soil bedrock interface was higher in the streams with a steep gradient while the contribution of the slower subsurface flow in the soil layer was dominant in streams with a gentle gradient in this study the integration of mtt and hydrogeochemical parameters revealed that soil depth and its spatial distribution mainly controlled the storage and dominant water flow paths in hillslope areas which was determined by the topographic gradient and soil bedrock interface in a major channel connecting the water flow in a hillslope area and the streams in the study catchment with a low permeability crystalline bedrock credit authorship contribution statement youn young jung
