11665,the present study aims to assess the groundwater resources in the ghard el hunishat area north western desert egypt as it is part of the national agricultural reclamation mega project new delta this involves defining the groundwater bearing zones and estimating their thicknesses and depths outlining their lateral extents besides trying to estimate the aquifer groundwater quality to achieve these objectives geoelectrical resistivity measurements with a total of thirty eight vertical electrical soundings ves distributed along seven profiles have been carried out using the schlumberger configuration ves data were acquired at a maximum electrode spacing ab 2 of 1000 m the interpreted data have been correlated and calibrated with the available borehole lithological information in the study area to minimize the uncertainty of the interpreted models data analysis and interpretation revealed that the subsurface stratigraphic sequence consists of five geo electrical layers the fourth one represents the saturated moghra aquifer unit where its resistivity ranges between 25 and 78 ω m and its thickness ranges from 116 to 172 m while the depth to the top of this layer ranges from 99 to 168 5 m the interpreted layer parameters were used to generate geo electrical cross sections and then these sections were presented in the form of a 3d fence diagram showing the lateral and vertical extents of the subsurface geological succession in the study area contour maps were also created showing the spatial distribution of the saturated aquifer parameters the current research findings can contribute to a better understanding of subsurface geological situations and assess the suitability of the investigated area for anticipated agricultural and urban developments as well as water management for related activities graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater geoelectric ves ghard el hunishat new delta project northwestern desert data availability data will be made

egypt is situated in an arid desert zone with dry and hot summers and mild winters with irregular and very low rainfall in the country s central part the nile river is the only known source of surface freshwater while many of the other water resources are found in groundwater most of the cultivated land can only be found in the nile delta and around the nile river while most of the country is a desert the western desert covers 68 of egypt s total area and has a climate characterized by aridity to hyperaridity a total of 4 of the country s land is cultivated which is heavily populated by 95 of the population fao 2016 as a result of the problems that egypt is likely to face due to the increasing population growth and the shortage of egypt s share of the nile water and to try to achieve self sufficiency in food and conserve the water of the nile river the egyptian government established new agricultural reclamation projects one of these large megaprojects in the agricultural field is the new delta national project which includes egypt future and the south dabaa axis projects fig 1 it will be established on almost a million acres the project extends to the north of oases the south of wadi el natroun the east and west of the qattara depression the south of the dabaa axis and the west of the old delta the groundwater aquifers represent a crucial source of life and are particularly important for supporting different anthropogenic and development activities identifying mapping and understanding the hydrogeological setting of these aquifers have great environmental and economic importance and are critical for the long term development of groundwater resources and for planning water management strategies as excessive pumping and drafting can lead to the collapse of socioeconomic activities the use of geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity tomography ert and vertical electrical sounding ves is widespread for geotechnical and groundwater exploration they are widely regarded as powerful tools for determining aquifer formation under various hydrogeological conditions and mapping groundwater resources haque et al 2020 bagchi et al 2021 they are extensively used in subsurface investigations as they provide a contrast between rock units with varying electrical properties while causing little or no environmental damage okrah et al 2012 store et al 2000 the geoelectrical resistivity technique is one of the geophysical methods that studies the nature of electrical current in the earth and depends on the electrical resistivity the reciprocal of conductivity which is a fundamental property of all the earth s materials in the geoelectrical resistivity exploration method four electrodes are planted on the surface of the earth two of them inject a direct current dc or a low frequency current i into the earth while the potential difference δv of the earth is measured between the other electrodes the electrical current is transmitted and propagated mainly by ions present in the pore water of soils and rocks mostly through ionic transmission through interstitial solutions and surface conduction at the boundary between solid rock particles and electrolytic solutions pfannkuch 1972 it is worth noting that the degree of electrical conductivity depends on the number of dissolved salts in the water present in the soil pores the purer the water the weaker the conductivity by knowing the intensity of the current penetrating the ground and the potential difference between the electrodes the value of the electric resistance is obtained and then the apparent resistivity of the subsurface layers can be calculated the measured data apparent resistivity ρa and electrode spacing ab is then plotted on graph paper with a logarithmic scale for further processing and interpretation bhattacharya and shalivahan 2016 the electrical resistivity technique is a simple and cost effective method it can provide useful information regarding soil succession determine the depth of groundwater zones the thickness of the aquifer system and the possible borehole locations over all lithological types compared to gpr and ert methods geoelectrical resistivity surveys by vertical electrical sounding ves have become extremely useful and economically workable over gpr and ert

planned to study the hydrogeological regime evaluate the groundwater occurrences and investigate the lateral and vertical extents of the moghra aquifer which represents the main aquifer in the investigated area an important objective of the present investigation is to develop an information database that can be used to conduct comprehensive groundwater exploration activities in the vicinity

southern and eastern parts toward the northwestern zones geomorphologically the study area and its vicinities are characterized by different landforms alluvial plains the old and the recent plains structural ridges geble el hadid tableland and marmarica tableland structural plains wadi el natrun and wadi el farigh el heneishat sand dunes chains and structural depressions the moghra depression and the qattara depression said 1962 el shamy 1968 el fayoumy and shaker 1987 hafiez 2010 the coverage of the study area with sandy deposits is a positive element for the urban and agricultural developments the hydrographic networks i e the wadi system are very faint and shallow the investigated area is part of egypt s northern western desert and is located at the western portion of the el dabaa corridor the area of study is covered mainly by sedimentary deposits figs 2 and 3 composed of sand and gravel with some clay and clayey sand intercalations that belong to the miocene and quaternary geological periods these deposits have been laid down by the ancestors of the nile river which drained the egyptian highlands and deposited its sediment loads in the low lying areas south of the al qattara depression the quaternary sediments are represented by sand sheets sand dunes and sabkhas and are composed mostly of fine to coarse sand while the lower miocene is represented by the moghra formation the moghra formation is overlain by the dabaa formation and underlain by the marmarica formation and consists of a continental to shallow marine clastic sequence of early miocene time and grades laterally to the north and to the west into the marine mamura formation while to the south into the genuine fluviatile red beds of the gabal khashab formation said 1962 tectonically the investigated area is situated inside the unstable shelf that occupies the northern part of the western desert the miocene terrain in the study area is composed of folds that trend from wnw to nw according to omara and sanad 1975 and misak 1979 several normal fault systems dissected the study area including the e w system the nw se system and the ne sw system 2 2 hydrogeologic settings the study area and its environs are characterized by two groundwater aquifers the wadi el natrun aquifer which is overlain by the nile delta aquifer with a small thickness and underlain by either the thick pliocene clay layer or the moghra aquifer which represents the main aquifer in the area under investigation and extends to the qattara depression which acts as the main discharge area for the water of this aquifer the water of this aquifer exists under different conditions either confined or semi confined in addition to the connection with the nile delta aquifer which is known by the presence of a fault located almost in the southern part and by the sharp change from the facies of porous sandstone to the facies of clay it is believed that the source of recharge of this aquifer occurs through local rains as well as from lateral seepage from the nile delta reservoir especially in the southeastern parts of the study area and may also be through vertical seepage from the deep nubian sandstone system below it while the water discharge from this aquifer occurs either from productive wells or from the evaporation process prevailing in the qattara depression the moghra aquifer can be distinguished into three water bearing zones separated by clay beds these units from top to bottom are as follows the monquar el dowi unit which is composed of sand gravel and sandstone with clay interbeds the bait owian unit which is composed of sandstone with minor claystone and is confined from the top and bottom by the presence of clay beds and the third one is the el raml unit which is deposited nearly in a fluvial environment and consists of sandstone intercalated with claystone with a thickness that can reach up to 400 m these units are hydraulically connected yousef 2013 el sabri et al 2016 3 methodology 3 1 ves data measurements a dc electrical resistivity sounding survey was acquired to investigate the vertical and lateral variations of the soil electric properties as well as to gain an understanding of the hydrogeological and geological conditions predominant in the investigated area using vertical electrical soundings the resistivities thicknesses and depths of geoelectric multilayered subsurface units can be determined consequently structures and changes in lithology can be mapped for this purpose thirty eight vertical electrical soundings were acquired in the research area they are distributed along seven profiles with three aligned nearly towards ne sw and the other four aligned nearly towards nw se figs 1 and 5 the ves data has been acquired using the schlumberger electrode arrangement fig 4 which is considered the most used in ves measurements for groundwater investigation reynolds 2011 lowrie and fichtner 2020 using the abem terrameter sas 1000 with electrode separation ab 2 from 1 m to 1000 m this will be appropriate to reach the intended depths that satisfy the study s objectives 3 2 interpretation of ves data curves in the present research analysis and interpretation of the measured ves data were done with the help of the available geological information and borehole data firstly an initial model is estimated from the forward modeling process and then a smooth model with multi layers is estimated using the occam s inversion approach constable et al 1987 afterward several iterations are executed to get the final layered model a model with a small number of layers that expresses the subsurface geoelectrical situation these iteration attempts continue until the fitting degree between the measured and calculated data increases to 95 or more data from two wells drilled near the zone of the ves locations fig 6 which are monitoring the moghra aquifer in the area has been used to assist in the correlation and calibration of ves model parameters with the borehole lithological data the interpretation of the resistivity curves reflects a relatively extensive range of resistivity values fig 7 shows examples of the data interpretation of some ves points using the ix1d 2008 program ix1d v 3 39 and accordingly table 1 presents the interpreted model parameters from the measured 38 ves points 4 results and discussion to understand the predominant hydrogeological conditions and to determine the groundwater potential in the investigated area a total of 38 ves locations were acquired to determine the favorable aquifers for groundwater prospects five geo electrical units have been interpreted with a varying range of resistivity and thickness following the ves data interpretation the results were correlated to constructed geo electrical cross sections to gain a coherent picture of the rock succession characteristics and water bearing zones for each region 4 1 interpretation of geo electrical cross sections the geoelectric cross sections can obviously indicate the prevailing subsurface geoelectrical situation and conditions within the area under investigation also the characteristics of the geoelectrical units can be quantified by delineating their thicknesses and defining their electrical resistivity values furthermore it is also possible to reach the geological explanation behind the hydrogeological situations in the studied area when a correlation is executed with the available geological information about the investigated area seven geoelectrical cross sections covering the studied area were constructed figs 8 and 9 three of them aligned nearly towards ne sw and the other four aligned nearly towards nw se figs 1 and 5 the geoelectrical cross sections were established and drawn linking the measured ves points from topmost to bottom a total of five subsurface geoelectric layers have been distinguished underneath the composed geoelectrical cross sections it is described as follows the first near surface geoelectrical unit the electrical resistivity of this unit differs from one place to another ranging between 110 ω m and 721 ω m this discrepancy is due to the difference in moisture content and the heterogeneity in its composition where its general composition is surface deposits of sand gravel and silt this layer varies in thickness from 2 m to 7 m the second geoelectrical unit this unit shows a resistivity range between 69 ω m at ves 11 and 299 ω m at ves 34 its thickness varies from 11 5 m to 50 m while the depth of this layer ranges from 2 m to 7 m this layer consists of sand and gravelly sand with some shaly sand which reflects some relatively moderate resistivity values the third geoelectrical unit this unit shows a resistivity range between 97 ω m at ves 3 and 298 ω m at ves 37 its thickness varies from 61 m to 128 m while the depth of this layer ranges from 17 m to 53 5 m this layer consists of sand and gravel with minor clay intercalations the second and third geoelectrical units represent the dry moghra sand layer of the stratigraphic succession the fourth geoelectrical unit it represents the moghra aquifer layer which consists of sand with clay intercalations saturated with brackish water which is reflected in relatively low to moderate resistivity values that range between 25 ω m at ves 11 and 78 ω m at ves 33 with an average of 51 ω m this layer s thickness varies from 116 m to 172 m with an average of 150 m while the depth ranges from 99 m to 168 5 m with an average of 130 m the uncompleted fifth geoelectrical unit this unit has low resistivity values that range between 6 ω m and 15 ω m it is attributed as shale corresponding to the lower miocene clay interbeds that perform as an impermeable aquitard intercalated with the moghra sand aquifer the depth to which this layer extends ranges from 243 m to 305 m while none of the soundings have reached the base of this layer the groundwater level was estimated by correlating the results of the resistivity sounding measurements with the groundwater level of the available boreholes with rockworks software the 2 d geoelectrical cross sections have been expressed in a 3d fence diagram displaying and clarifying the lateral and vertical lithological changes and extensions of the subsurface layers clearly fig 10 4 2 aquifer parameters contour maps for better representation of the aquifer parameters several maps have been established to show spatial changes in the aquifer resistivity thickness and depth and to express the water level changes throughout the investigated area the aquifer resistivity distribution map fig 11 a shows that the aquifer resistivity values range from 25 ω m to 78 ω m it is observed that the electrical resistivity values increase towards the south northeastern and northwestern portions of the investigated area in the northwestern part of the area the resistivity increases at ves locations v4 v5 v7 v20 v24 and v26 where it ranges from 56 ω m at v4 to 72 ω m at v5 and v20 in the northeastern part the resistivity ranges between 64 ω m at v14 and 67 ω m at v19 while in the southern part the resistivity increases to 76 ω m and 78 ω m at v34 and v33 respectively the electrical resistivity decreases towards the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area and this can be attributed to the presence of multiple clay interbeds that may significantly affect the aquifer s water salinity and cause confining layers that may adversely affect hydraulic parameters in the southwestern part the resistivity decreases to 37 ω m at v27 in the central part of the area the resistivity decreases at ves locations v1 v2 v8 v11 v12 v13 v17 v21 v22 v35 v36 and v38 where it ranges from 25 ω m at v11 to 43 ω m at v22 the aquifer thickness distribution map fig 11b shows that the thickness of the aquifer ranges from 116 m to 172 m it is observed that the thickness increases towards the northern and eastern directions at ves locations v4 v5 v6 v7 v13 v14 v16 v29 v30 v31 and v35 where it reaches 172 m at v5 v14 and v29 the aquifer s thickness decreases in the western direction towards v20 v26 and v27 where it reaches 116 m at v20 the aquifer depth map fig 11c shows that the depth to the top of the aquifer ranges from 99 m to 168 5 m it is observed that the depth to the top of the aquifer increases towards the central direction towards ves locations v3 v18 v21 v33 and v34 where it reaches 166 m at v3 and 168 5 m at v33 the depth to the top of the aquifer decreases towards the northeastern part of the investigated area at v12 v13 and v19 where it reaches 104 m at v19 and decreases towards the northwestern part at v4 v5 v6 v7 and v24 where it reaches 99 m at v4 fig 11d shows the variations in the estimated groundwater level which ranges from 54 m to 12 m it increases in the central direction towards ves locations v1 v3 v11 v18 v21 and v22 where it reaches 49 m at v11 and 55 m at v21 and increases in the southwestern direction towards v25 and v27 where it reaches 45 5 m at v27 the estimated water level decreases in the southeastern part of the investigated area towards v29 and v35 where it reaches 6 m at v29 and decreases in the northwestern part towards v4 v5 and v7 where it reaches 12 m at v4 5 conclusions the present study aims to evaluate the groundwater occurrences and investigate the lateral and vertical extents of the moghra aquifer main aquifer in the ghard el hunishat area northwestern desert egypt which is a part of the new delta national project five subsurface geoelectric layers have been obtained where the moghra aquifer is represented by the fourth layer the data has been correlated to construct seven geoelectrical cross sections distributed along the investigated area moreover contour maps have been constructed to show the distribution of the aquifer parameters throughout the investigated area the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area seem to have brackish groundwater while it is noticed that salinity decreases so that the groundwater becomes fresher in the other parts of the research area in this regard the area can be subdivided according to the priority for groundwater production into different zones the first priority zones are found in the northeastern and northwestern portions of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is relatively moderate to high the thickness is large and the depth is low the second priority zone is situated in the southern parts of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is relatively moderate to high the thickness is relatively moderate and the depth is high and the third priority zones are found in the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is low the thickness is moderate to low and the depth is moderate to high consequently the investigated area is considered highly potential for groundwater and it is highly recommended to perform groundwater drilling operations in the mentioned promising regions taking into consideration all the above information results from the present study can increase knowledge and improve understanding of the subsurface hydrogeologic conditions and provide reliable information on the groundwater system and parameters of the aquifer unit this information is significant for planning anticipated agricultural projects urban developments and water management for related activities and sustainable development

calibration of ves model parameters with the borehole lithological data the interpretation of the resistivity curves reflects a relatively extensive range of resistivity values fig 7 shows examples of the data interpretation of some ves points using the ix1d 2008 program ix1d v 3 39 and accordingly table 1 presents the interpreted model parameters from the measured 38 ves points 4 results and discussion to understand the predominant hydrogeological conditions and to determine the groundwater potential in the investigated area a total of 38 ves locations were acquired to determine the favorable aquifers for groundwater prospects five geo electrical units have been interpreted with a varying range of resistivity and thickness following the ves data interpretation the results were correlated to constructed geo electrical cross sections to gain a coherent picture of the rock succession characteristics and water bearing zones for each region 4 1 interpretation of geo electrical cross sections the geoelectric cross sections can obviously indicate the prevailing subsurface geoelectrical situation and conditions within the area under investigation also the characteristics of the geoelectrical units can be quantified by delineating their thicknesses and defining their electrical resistivity values furthermore it is also possible to reach the geological explanation behind the hydrogeological situations in the studied area when a correlation is executed with the available geological information about the investigated area seven geoelectrical cross sections covering the studied area were constructed figs 8 and 9 three of them aligned nearly towards ne sw and the other four aligned nearly towards nw se figs 1 and 5 the geoelectrical cross sections were established and drawn linking the measured ves points from topmost to bottom a total of five subsurface geoelectric layers have been distinguished underneath the composed geoelectrical cross sections it is described as follows the first near surface geoelectrical unit the electrical resistivity of this unit differs from one place to another ranging between 110 ω m and 721 ω m this discrepancy is due to the difference in moisture content and the heterogeneity in its composition where its general composition is surface deposits of sand gravel and silt this layer varies in thickness from 2 m to 7 m the second geoelectrical unit this unit shows a resistivity range between 69 ω m at ves 11 and 299 ω m at ves 34 its thickness varies from 11 5 m to 50 m while the depth of this layer ranges from 2 m to 7 m this layer consists of sand and gravelly sand with some shaly sand which reflects some relatively moderate resistivity values the third geoelectrical unit this unit shows a resistivity range between 97 ω m at ves 3 and 298 ω m at ves 37 its thickness varies from 61 m to 128 m while the depth of this layer ranges from 17 m to 53 5 m this layer consists of sand and gravel with minor clay intercalations the second and third geoelectrical units represent the dry moghra sand layer of the stratigraphic succession the fourth geoelectrical unit it represents the moghra aquifer layer which consists of sand with clay intercalations saturated with brackish water which is reflected in relatively low to moderate resistivity values that range between 25 ω m at ves 11 and 78 ω m at ves 33 with an average of 51 ω m this layer s thickness varies from 116 m to 172 m with an average of 150 m while the depth ranges from 99 m to 168 5 m with an average of 130 m the uncompleted fifth geoelectrical unit this unit has low resistivity values that range between 6 ω m and 15 ω m it is attributed as shale corresponding to the lower miocene clay interbeds that perform as an impermeable aquitard intercalated with the moghra sand aquifer the depth to which this layer extends ranges from 243 m to 305 m while none of the soundings have reached the base of this layer the groundwater level was estimated by correlating the results of the resistivity sounding measurements with the groundwater level of the available boreholes with rockworks software the 2 d geoelectrical cross sections have been expressed in a 3d fence diagram displaying and clarifying the lateral and vertical lithological changes and extensions of the subsurface layers clearly fig 10 4 2 aquifer parameters contour maps for better representation of the aquifer parameters several maps have been established to show spatial changes in the aquifer resistivity thickness and depth and to express the water level changes throughout the investigated area the aquifer resistivity distribution map fig 11 a shows that the aquifer resistivity values range from 25 ω m to 78 ω m it is observed that the electrical resistivity values increase towards the south northeastern and northwestern portions of the investigated area in the northwestern part of the area the resistivity increases at ves locations v4 v5 v7 v20 v24 and v26 where it ranges from 56 ω m at v4 to 72 ω m at v5 and v20 in the northeastern part the resistivity ranges between 64 ω m at v14 and 67 ω m at v19 while in the southern part the resistivity increases to 76 ω m and 78 ω m at v34 and v33 respectively the electrical resistivity decreases towards the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area and this can be attributed to the presence of multiple clay interbeds that may significantly affect the aquifer s water salinity and cause confining layers that may adversely affect hydraulic parameters in the southwestern part the resistivity decreases to 37 ω m at v27 in the central part of the area the resistivity decreases at ves locations v1 v2 v8 v11 v12 v13 v17 v21 v22 v35 v36 and v38 where it ranges from 25 ω m at v11 to 43 ω m at v22 the aquifer thickness distribution map fig 11b shows that the thickness of the aquifer ranges from 116 m to 172 m it is observed that the thickness increases towards the northern and eastern directions at ves locations v4 v5 v6 v7 v13 v14 v16 v29 v30 v31 and v35 where it reaches 172 m at v5 v14 and v29 the aquifer s thickness decreases in the western direction towards v20 v26 and v27 where it reaches 116 m at v20 the aquifer depth map fig 11c shows that the depth to the top of the aquifer ranges from 99 m to 168 5 m it is observed that the depth to the top of the aquifer increases towards the central direction towards ves locations v3 v18 v21 v33 and v34 where it reaches 166 m at v3 and 168 5 m at v33 the depth to the top of the aquifer decreases towards the northeastern part of the investigated area at v12 v13 and v19 where it reaches 104 m at v19 and decreases towards the northwestern part at v4 v5 v6 v7 and v24 where it reaches 99 m at v4 fig 11d shows the variations in the estimated groundwater level which ranges from 54 m to 12 m it increases in the central direction towards ves locations v1 v3 v11 v18 v21 and v22 where it reaches 49 m at v11 and 55 m at v21 and increases in the southwestern direction towards v25 and v27 where it reaches 45 5 m at v27 the estimated water level decreases in the southeastern part of the investigated area towards v29 and v35 where it reaches 6 m at v29 and decreases in the northwestern part towards v4 v5 and v7 where it reaches 12 m at v4 5 conclusions the present study aims to evaluate the groundwater occurrences and investigate the lateral and vertical extents of the moghra aquifer main aquifer in the ghard el hunishat area northwestern desert egypt which is a part of the new delta national project five subsurface geoelectric layers have been obtained where the moghra aquifer is represented by the fourth layer the data has been correlated to construct seven geoelectrical cross sections distributed along the investigated area moreover contour maps have been constructed to show the distribution of the aquifer parameters throughout the investigated area the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area seem to have brackish groundwater while it is noticed that salinity decreases so that the groundwater becomes fresher in the other parts of the research area in this regard the area can be subdivided according to the priority for groundwater production into different zones the first priority zones are found in the northeastern and northwestern portions of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is relatively moderate to high the thickness is large and the depth is low the second priority zone is situated in the southern parts of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is relatively moderate to high the thickness is relatively moderate and the depth is high and the third priority zones are found in the central and southwestern parts of the investigated area where the aquifer resistivity is low the thickness is moderate to low and the depth is moderate to high consequently the investigated area is considered highly potential for groundwater and it is highly recommended to perform groundwater drilling operations in the mentioned promising regions taking into consideration all the above information results from the present study can increase knowledge and improve understanding of the subsurface hydrogeologic conditions and provide reliable information on the groundwater system and parameters of the aquifer unit this information is significant for planning anticipated agricultural projects urban developments and water management for related activities and sustainable development

11666,this study reports new data on arsenic contamination in groundwater in laksar a pristine and semi rural region of india s himalayan state of uttarakhand based on a systematic investigation of hydrogeochemical parameters influencing arsenic mobilisation the most plausible mechanism of arsenic release into groundwater has been proposed the groundwater in the research area is mostly homogeneous with the ca mg hco3 facies accounting for 87 5 percent of groundwater samples the combined effect of silicate weathering and the dissolution of carbonate minerals predominantly influence laksar groundwater composition as evident from bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na the statistical analysis pca and correlation analysis performed on the geochemical data indicates that natural processes such as carbonate weathering reductive dissolution of fe mn minerals together with anthropogenic activities such as the utilization of fertilizers in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposal exert control on the major ion chemistry and as enrichment in groundwater the study area has extremely high arsenic concentrations ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 μg l mean 15 63 μg l with majority of groundwater samples 50 having arsenic contents exceeding the who permitted limit 10 μg l analysis of the eh ph diagram shows that as iii species h3aso3 accounts for 79 of samples whereas as v species haso4 accounts for the remaining the observed arsenic enrichment in groundwater can be attributed to as desorption from iron oxide hydroxide minerals via reductive dissolution mechanism under reducing groundwater conditions which is supported by negative eh values and high levels of fe and comparatively low levels of sulphate and nitrate graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic geochemistry groundwater eh ph reductive dissolution data availability all data used in this work have been submitted as part of the manuscript tables figures 1 introduction the presence of inorganic arsenic as in the environment has been recognized to be very harmful to human and animal life arsenic is mostly found as inorganic species in groundwater systems e g arsenite as iii and arsenate as v which are more mobile and hazardous to living organisms than organic species das et al 2016 under low redox conditions as iii predominates whereas as v is prevalent in oxidized environments smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the world health organization world health organization 2010 established a 10 μg l upper permitted limit for arsenic in groundwater however several nations have formulated their own arsenic guideline values e g the bureau of indian standards bis is 10 500 2012 the mineralogy and reactivity of aquifer sediments as well as anthropogenic contributions such as industrial wastes and agricultural pesticides all influence arsenic mobility in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2009 the reductive breakdown of iron oxyhydroxides under reducing groundwater conditions in alluvial plain regions has been identified as the principal mechanism of arsenic release in several studies bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 2000 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 harvey et al 2002 ahmed et al 2004 khan et al 2022 the most common adverse effects of as poisoning on human health include skin pigmentation rahman et al 2001 bladder and kidney cancer fletcher et al 2008 cardiovascular diseases yang 2006 chen et al 2011 skin disorders tondel et al 1999 ahmad et al 1997 rahman et al 2001 respiratory effects milton et al 2001 ahmad et al 2001 groundwater contamination with arsenic is a serious problem all around the world arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l are believed to be present in the drinking water of 35 million people in bangladesh and 6 million people in west bengal india chakraborti et al 2002 mandal and suzuki 2002 arsenic contamination of groundwater has also been observed in pakistan china vietnam laos cambodia nepal egypt and yemen tseng et al 2000 berg et al 2001 mandal and suzuki 2002 nickson et al 2005 gaillardet et al 1999 al mikhlafi 2010 kashouty et al 2012 the occurrence of high arsenic bearing 10 μg l drinking water wells in numerous locations of india s gangetic plains have been reported acharyya and shah 2004 acharyya 2005 nayak et al 2008 sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 sun et al 2008 chauhan et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 khan and rai 2022a khan and rai 2022b in both rural and urban india the most serious environmental concern and hazard to public health is a lack of safe drinking water the origin of arsenic in india s indo gangetic plain has been linked to himalayan sediments carried by rivers and entering groundwater via reductive dissolution of aquifer solid phases under reducing conditions polizzotto et al 2008 in addition to geogenic sources there can be several anthropogenic sources such as mining and various industrial and agricultural activities that can contribute towards heavy metal contamination of water resources although rapid industrialization is essential for driving economic growth of developing countries but industrial pollution becomes a major environmental and health hazard especially when it starts to pollute the water resources even in remote and pristine semi rural areas over the last two decades many large and small industrial enterprises have sprung across the himalayan state of uttarakhand in india and many of these produce industrial wastewater the installation of wastewater treatment and disposal systems particularly in small scale enterprises has been a challenge since many of them are situated in pristine and semi rural areas of the state laksar is a small hamlet town in uttarakhand situated in the himalayan foothills and it is home to several small scale industries such as sugar metal fabrication cement industries etc this study reports new data on the extent of arsenic pollution in groundwater in laksar this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the arsenic contamination in the study area and proposes the most likely mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater based on a systematic investigation of the hydrogeochemical parameters governing arsenic mobilisation in the area 2 study area 2 1 location and drainage the laksar block is situated in the south eastern region of uttarakhand s haridwar district with latitude and longitude of 29 7587 n and 78 0415 e respectively the principal drainage of the study region is formed by the ganga which originates in the himalayan gangotri glacier flows through the laksar region and drains along the western limit of the study area tributaries of ganga which also constitute the area drainage include the solani river which originates in the shiwalik series ratmau and banganga but the tributaries are only active during the monsoon season and then dry up 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the research area is located in the district s newer quaternary alluvium zone which consists primarily of fine sand silt and clay fig 1 in terms of hydrogeology the laksar block is located in khadar alluvium zones which are typically river flood plains and recent sediments deposited by rivers in the research region groundwater is found at shallow depths in unconfined settings with water levels ranging from 4 38 to 5 69 bgl in pre monsoon and 2 32 2 53 m bgl in post monsoon periods respectively cgwb 2016 3 materials and method 3 1 sample collection and preservation thirty two groundwater samples were collected in june 2019 from both private and government installed hand pump wells in the laksar block of haridwar district with depths ranging from 12 to 37 m gps was used to determine sample collection locations garmin etrex 30 before collecting water samples and measuring parameters including temperature ph and electrical conductivity hand pumps were flushed for at least 5 min to ensure that any stagnant water was flushed out millipore 0 45 m filter papers were used to filter the samples samples for trace metal analysis were collected in pre cleaned and acid washed 15 ml polyethylene bottles which were then acidified in the field with 15 8 m hno3 to a ph of 2 separate aliquots of water samples for analysis of main cations and anions were filtered and collected in 60 ml bottles without any preservatives and kept at 4 c until analysis unfiltered and unacidified samples were collected separately in 60 ml bottles for hco3 measurements 3 2 field and laboratory measurements immediately after collection samples were immediately analysed in the field for various physical parameters including ph redox potential eh temperature and electrical conductivity ec through a portable multiparameter analyser toshcon tpc 7 on the same day as the sample collection total alkalinity as hco3 was evaluated by titration with 0 01 n h2so4 methyl orange and phenolphthalein indicators the concentrations of major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were determined in the geochemistry laboratory at iit roorkee using an ion chromatographic unit metrohm ic model 930 compact ic flux analytical facility with an analytical precision of less than 3 at the institute instrumentation centre at iit roorkee inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent technology 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms was used to examine as fe and mn calculating the inorganic ion balance using the following expression was used to check the accuracy of analytical methods inorganic charge balance tz tz tz tz where tz and tz are total cations and total anions respectively all groundwater samples had charge balances that were within 10 phreeqc software interactive 3 7 was used to calculate the speciation an eh ph diagram has been calculated and plotted using the geochemist s workbench gwb software package to elucidate the possible arsenic species in groundwater statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences ibm spss version 22 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater geochemistry table 1 shows a statistical summary of groundwater geochemical parameters along with their associated who permitted limits in drinking water table 2 shows the results of the major anions and cations ec eh and ph analyses for each of the groundwater samples collected the ph values measured in groundwater samples range from 6 9 to 8 3 with a mean of 7 3 which is within the who permissible limit 7 0 8 5 for drinking water the measured ph values indicate that the groundwater is near neutral to slightly alkaline the alkaline nature of groundwater is thought to be caused through interactions between soil and rain water subramanian and saxena 1983 as evidenced by the high ph values found in some of the groundwater samples the mean eh value of groundwater is 23 28 range 147 to 157 mv indicating predominantly reducing conditions prevailing in the aquifer the ec of groundwater varies between 190 and 1240 μs cm mean value 724 μs cm with 47 of the samples collected surpassing the who defined limit 750 μs cm tables 1 and 2 the dominating anion in the groundwater samples is hco3 whereas ca2 and na are the dominant cations according to geochemical analyses the concentrations of na k ca2 and mg2 were found to range from 8 77 to 185 84 mg l 0 98 35 77 mg l 16 08 115 63 mg l and 13 23 69 5 mg l respectively table 1 none of the collected samples had quantities of na that exceeded the who permissible limit whereas 28 13 6 25 and 75 of groundwater samples had amounts of k ca2 and mg2 that exceeded the who permissible limits respectively tables 1 and 2 hco3 f cl no3 so4 2 concentrations were observed to range from 202 92 to 523 72 mg l 0 08 0 34 mg l 2 22 160 71 mg l and nd not detected to 224 63 mg l 4 36 171 61 mg l respectively table 1 hco3 concentrations in all groundwater samples exceeded the who permitted limit of 200 mg l whereas nitrate contents in 6 25 of samples exceeded the who recommended safe limit of 45 mg l table 1 it is highly possible that bulk of the hco3 ions present in groundwater were derived from dissolution of carbonate minerals and organic matter oxidation smedley et al 2003 jeong 2001 sub saturation of these minerals in groundwater as predicted from calculated saturation index values clearly point towards the origin of so4 2 ions found present in laksar groundwater to the breakdown of gypsum and anhydrite minerals table 3 fig 2 shows a colour coded map of the area clearly showing the variation in measured hydrochemical parameters such as ph ec and redox potential as well as the observed variations in the respective concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 so4 2 hco3 fe mn and as based on the analysis of groundwater samples collected across the area as shown in fig 2 samples collected from the eastern part of the block include significant amounts of na as well as high quantities of ca2 no3 and so4 2 redox sensitive elements like fe and mn show higher concentration in groundwater mean 0 45 mg l and 0 36 mg l respectively with 53 13 and 37 50 samples exceeding the who safe limit of 0 3 mg l and 0 4 mg l respectively agricultural activities using fertilisers and leaching of municipal waste appear to be the main reason for the observed high nitrate concentration in groundwater samples nizam et al 2022 table 2 from the eastern side table 1 in terms of spatial distribution high fe concentrations are mostly found on the block s western side along with high as concentrations and low eh values fig 2 the concentration of arsenic in the study area is extremely high ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 μg l mean 15 63 g l out of 32 groundwater samples 53 n 17 have as concentrations higher than the who permissible limit 10 μg l table 1 as concentrations are higher in the western part of the block where eh values are negative and no3 and so4 2 concentrations are relatively low fig 2 4 2 hydrochemical facies and chemical evolution of groundwater groundwater chemistry is primarily influenced by water aquifer sediment interaction the chemical composition of rainwater surface water recharging groundwater and the residence time of groundwater in the aquifer verma et al 2016 the piper plot fig 3 shows that the groundwater in the laksar block is predominantly homogeneous with 87 5 of groundwater samples having ca mg hco3 facies and subordinate na hco3 cl and ca mg cl water types constituting the rest fig 3 also shows that na and ca2 are the most abundant cations and hco3 is the dominant anion present in the groundwater of the study area weathering processes are also important in the chemical evolution of groundwater because the presence of easily weatherable rocks e g carbonates and evaporites and minerals can cause significant changes in the concentration of major ions ca2 mg2 and na and hco3 in groundwater hren et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2009 carbonic acid formed from atmospheric co2 and water reacts with calcium carbonate or silicate minerals in soil to form hco3 ca2 mg2 or na ions in such processes equations 1 3 1 caco3 h2co3 ca2 2hco3 calcite dissolution 2 camg co3 2 2h2co3 ca2 mg2 4hco3 dolomite dissolution 3 2naalsi3o8 2h2co3 9h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 2na 4h4sio4 2hco3 albite silicate weathering kaolinite bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na have been used to distinguish the relative importance of such processes in contributing the major ions in groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 the good correlations observed between elemental ratios mg na vs ca na r2 0 68 fig 4 a and hco3 na vs ca na r2 0 89 fig 4b indicate that the combined effect of silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution influences laksar groundwater composition but silicate weathering is the dominant process to release these ions in groundwater albite na feldspar eq 3 and orthoclase and microcline k feldspar are two possible minerals that could release na and k in groundwater das et al 2016 the dominance of ca2 and mg2 over na and k can be seen in the plots of na k versus total cations fig 4c and ca mg versus total cations fig 4d the majority of the groundwater samples plot along the silicate weathering line na k 0 5tz in fig 4c indicating that silicate weathering was responsible for the release of na and k in groundwater groundwater samples are aligned close to the ca mg equiline fig 4d but deviate from the 1 1 equiline in the case of na k fig 4c indicating that the contribution of ca mg increases with increasing tds the majority of the samples fall between the ca mg 0 5tz and 1 1 lines fig 4d indicating that silicate weathering plays an important role in the release of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater a bivariate plot of ca mg and hco3 so4 clearly shows the prevalence of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering as well as the presence of ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes data points that fall on the 1 1 equiline indicate that these ions are the result of carbonate calcite dolomite and sulphate mineral dissolution gypsum anhydrite fisher and mullican 1997 kumar et al 2006 few groundwater samples fell on the 1 1 equiline in fig 4e and the majority of the samples are plotted away from this line towards the so4 hco3 side indicating that silicate weathering along with dissolution of dolomite calcite gypsum and or anhydrite plays a dominant role in releasing these ions in groundwater the samples plotted on the ca mg side show an excess of these ions and a depletion of na and k due to reverse ion exchange whereas the samples plotted on the hco3 so4 side show direct ion exchange if the hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio is 1 the hco3 was most likely derived from carbonate mineral dissolution whereas a ratio 1 indicates that the hco3 was derived from silicate weathering or organic matter oxidation milton et al 2001 in the study area 53 of groundwater samples have an hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio 1 and 47 have a ratio 1 indicating that hco3 was derived from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering and or organic matter dissolution processes fig 4f the plot of hco3 vs na fig 4h shows the increased concentration of hco3 compared to na indicating that silicate weathering processes dominate over carbonate dissolution it also shows that the concentration of na in groundwater is reduced due to ion exchange processes which is supported by the data fig 4g the na vs ca plot fig 4g demonstrates that ca na ion exchange is also expected to increase ca concentration in groundwater based on these findings silicate weathering is thought to be the dominant process in the evolution of cations in laksar groundwater 4 3 depth profile of as fe mn and other major cations and anions groundwater samples were collected in laksar at various depths tubewell boring depths ranging from 12 19 m to 36 58 m table 1 similar to previous studies in the gangetic plains bhattacharya et al 1997a b saha et al 2010 saha and shukla 2013 mukherjee et al 2011 the depth profile of as fig 4 shows higher concentrations of arsenic greater than the who permissible limit of 10 μg l being found at relatively shallower depths 15 m 23 m when compared to samples coming from deeper depths 23 m 36 58 m as shown in fig 4 similarly higher fe concentrations are found at shallow depths 15 25 m when compared to greater depths from 25 m to 36 58 m fig 4 furthermore higher concentrations of cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions hco3 cl no3 excluding sulphate are observed at shallow depth 15 25 m than at deeper depth 25 m 36 58 m which could be attributed to soil mineralization evaporation coupled with recharge and anthropogenic sources using fertilisers fig 4 singh et al 2018 4 4 speciation calculation for estimating possible mineral phases in groundwater the saturation indices si values of the mineral phases are calculated using the chemical composition of the analysed groundwater samples and the phreeqc hydrochemical modelling technique the si values represent the tendency of the mineral phases to dissolve or precipitate in groundwater systems it also aids in understanding the various hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to the chemical characteristics of groundwater table 3 provides a statistical summary of the saturation indices values of various mineral phases of groundwater samples the groundwater samples are saturated to sub saturated in carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 rhodochrosite mnco3 and siderite feco3 table 3 this indicates that the aquifer conditions in the study area are favourable for the precipitation of these minerals and groundwater chemistry is controlled by the precipitation or dissolution of carbonate minerals furthermore the saturation states of fe and mn bearing carbonates table 3 indicate favourable conditions for potential as adsorption on these minerals surfaces groundwater samples are undersaturated in major mn oxide hydroxide phases such as manganite mnooh hausmannite mn3o4 pyrochroite mn oh 2 and pyrolusite mno2 indicating that these minerals are thermodynamically unstable and present in groundwater in dissolved form the undersaturation of these minerals also suggests that groundwater conditions are reducing resulting in high dissolved mn concentrations mean 0 36 mg l 37 5 of samples exceeding who guideline table 1 the groundwater samples are oversaturated in terms of fe iii oxyhydroxide phases such as goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 table 3 indicating that the aqueous conditions in the study site favour the precipitation of fe oxide hydroxide minerals and thus these minerals could play a potential role as a sink of arsenic and fe in laksar groundwater groundwater samples were undersaturated to sub saturated with respect to the ferrihydrite mineral phase table 3 which could be the possible mineral phase releasing arsenic in groundwater 4 5 hydrogeochemical factors responsible for as release in groundwater of laksar fig 5 a f depicts the relationships between as concentrations in groundwater and eh ph hco3 no3 so4 2 and fe arsenic release mechanisms in groundwater in different regions across the world have been extensively investigated mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 berg et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 nath et al 2008 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 among the various possible mechanisms suggested reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides in the presence of natural organic matter nom is thought to be the dominant mechanism of as release in alluvial plain reducing aquifers mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 berg et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 nath et al 2008 khan et al 2023 furthermore oxidative dissolution of fe sulphide minerals is also known to cause arsenic enrichment in groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mcarthur et al 2001a b however the low concentration of so4 2 mean 45 35 mg l table 1 slightly alkaline ph mean 7 30 table 1 and lack of correlation between as and so4 2 fig 6 d do not support this mechanism of arsenic release in laksar groundwater competitive exchange of as by other ions such as nitrate and phosphate acharyya et al 1999 and the combined effect of both reductive and oxidative dissolution of as bearing oxides and oxyhydroxides nickson et al 1998 kinniburgh and smedley 2001 mcarthur et al 2001a b have also been proposed as mechanisms for as release in groundwater all of the study area s high as bearing groundwater samples exhibit negative eh values fig 6a demonstrating that reducing conditions are the primary determinant of as mobilisation in groundwater arsenic desorption under high ph conditions alkali desorption is another possible route for arsenic release in groundwater as high concentrations of hco3 ions and oh may cause arsenate desorption due to competition for sorption sites mcbride 1994 the observed lack of correlation between as concentration and groundwater ph fig 6b and near neutral ph conditions mean 7 30 table 1 do not support the alkali desorption mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater a non linear relationship between observed as and hco3 concentrations as seen in fig 5c suggests that hco3 in groundwater in the study area has numerous sources and sinks such as carbonate mineral precipitation and organic matter decomposition milton et al 2001 the positive values of saturation indices table 3 calculated for bicarbonate minerals also support this inference the reductive dissolving processes for as mobilisation in groundwater are supported by the observed high concentrations of hco3 and fe with corresponding high as in most groundwater samples fig 5c f the reductive dissolving process of iron oxyhydroxides is largely repressed in reducing groundwater with high so4 2 concentrations due to sulphate reduction and consequent co precipitation of as with fe sulphide minerals resulting in low arsenic concentrations in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 buschmann and berg 2009 although no linear relationship exists between so4 2 and as concentrations in most groundwater samples higher as 10 g l is associated with low so4 2 generally 50 mg l fig 6d implying that sulphate reduction accompanies as reduction and mobilisation gaillardet et al 1999 because of the low sulphate concentration mean 45 35 mg l table 1 the as released by iron oxyhydroxide reduction remains in solution resulting in a high as concentration in groundwater low no3 concentrations usually 10 mg l in groundwater are mostly related with high as groundwaters fig 6e the amount of iron in groundwater mean 0 45 mg l table 1 is sufficient to adsorb higher levels of as in the presence of nitrate the adsorption of as on iron oxide hydroxide mineral surfaces in sediments is usually increased which may be caused by the oxidation of fe ii which favours as adsorption on iron hydroxides weber et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 senn and hemond 2002 hoeft et al 2002 alvarez benedí et al 2003 rhine et al 2007 sun et al 2008 this eventually leads to low arsenic concentration in groundwater the observed association of low concentration of no3 along with higher concentration of as in laksar groundwater supports the removal of as from iron hydroxide surfaces via reductive dissolution mechanism under oxidising conditions aqueous arsenic exists primarily as v species e g h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 whereas under reducing conditions as iii species h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 and aso3 3 are the dominant as species the eh ph diagram fig 7 demonstrates that as iii species h3aso3 account for around 79 of samples whereas as v species haso4 2 account for the remaining samples this conclusion is corroborated by the measured groundwater eh values tables 1 and 2 and in accordance with reducing conditions prevalent in groundwater aquifer bulk of the iron oxyhydroxides and no3 contents can be easily reduced under such reducing conditions nelson eby 2004 and the reduction of fe oxyhydroxides and subsequent mobilisation of as could coincide with the reduction of no3 and so4 2 in the study area s groundwater kar et al 2010 in agreement with previous groundwater studies in alluival aquifer regions das et al 2016 van geen et al 2006a the observed fe content in groundwater of laksar region does not correlate with as fig 6f this could be due to fe addition from other mineral phases non as bearing or fe precipitation from solution in the form of iron bearing minerals mcarthur et al 2001a b jia et al 2014 because of the low so4 2 concentration fe is not expected to precipitate as pyrite in groundwater of the study area under reducing groundwater conditions such as those prevalent in the study area with elevated levels of hco3 some ferrous iron may be removed through precipitation of fe ii minerals such as siderite the calculated saturation indices values of groundwater samples table 3 show that they are near saturation with respect to siderite which may limit the fe concentration the calculated si values given in table 3 indicate that groundwater is oversaturated with major iron oxyhydroxide phases such as hematite and goethite and sub saturated with ferrihydrite these mineral phases would also provide ideal surfaces for fe adsorption as a result of the dissolution and or precipitation of fe minerals the correlation between as and fe concentration in groundwater remains poor overall higher levels of fe mn and hco3 and comparatively lower levels of no3 and so4 2 as well as negative eh values and near neutral ph indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions and support the reductive dissolution mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater several studies have reported iron oxide hydroxide minerals in alluvial aquifers of the meghna basin hasan et al 2009 and gangetic plain hasan et al 2009 acharyya 2005 mukherjee 2012 and these minerals were considered to regulate as mobility in these regions groundwater in this study the observed arsenic enrichment in groundwater is attributed to as desorption from ferrihydrite mineral via reductive dissolution mechanism under reducing groundwater conditions which is supported by negative eh values and high levels of fe and comparatively low levels of sulphate and nitrate 4 6 statistical analysis 4 6 1 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples and different geochemical processes operating in the region which affects the overall groundwater quality and mobilizations of metals table 4 summarizes pca results for physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples having a total variance of 72 02 which corresponds to 3 factors pc 1 which accounts for 40 32 of the total variance has high loadings on ec na mg2 hco3 cl mn and as the observed high loadings between these parameters could be attributed to anthropogenic sources like usage of fertilizers in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposals in the study area the positive correlations between as and mn indicate the role of mn bearing minerals on high as groundwater besides moderate positive correlations among as k and hco3 indicate the effects of agricultural activities and microbial reduction of organic matter causes the release of as in groundwater nickson et al 2000 sridharan and nathan 2018 pc 2 shows the higher loadings for eh so4 2 no3 and as with a total variance of 18 98 the association of so4 2 with no3 indicates the anthropogenic contributions the negative correlation of as with eh so4 2 and no3 supports the release of arsenic in reducing groundwater conditions via reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides pc 3 has contributed 12 72 to the total variance and represents the relationship between ca2 mg2 and hco3 which indicates the weathering of carbonate minerals such calcite and dolomite 4 6 2 correlation analysis table 5 shows the correlation matrix of the different physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples the significant correlation corresponds to the couples ec na hco3 cl mn eh as no3 na hco3 cl hco3 ca2 mg2 cl these correlations are consistent with the findings from pca i e groundwater geochemistry is largely influenced by carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities the negative correlation between as and eh and observed high fe concentration in groundwater samples table 1 indicates reducing aquifer condition favors the mobilization of as in the study area the positive correlation between ca2 hco3 and mg2 hco3 indicates the impact of carbonate weathering in the chemical evolution of groundwater 5 conclusions this study reports new data on arsenic contamination in groundwater in laksar a pristine and semi rural region of india s himalayan state of uttarakhand this article assesses the arsenic contamination in the study region in detail and proposes the most likely mechanism of arsenic release into groundwater based on a systematic examination of the hydrogeochemical parameters influencing arsenic mobilisation in the area groundwater in the study area is predominantly homogeneous with 87 5 of groundwater samples belonging to the ca mg hco3 facies analysis of the bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na indicate that the combined effect of silicate weathering and the dissolution of minerals such as dolomite calcite gypsum and or anhydrite is responsible for laksar groundwater composition principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis indicate that different natural carbonate weathering reductive dissolution of fe mn minerals and anthropogenic utilization of fertilization in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposals activities operating in the study area exert control on the major ion chemistry and as enrichment in groundwater the concentration of arsenic in the study area is extremely high ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 g l mean 15 63 μg l most groundwater samples 50 were found to have arsenic concentrations exceeding the who permissible limit 10 μg l concentrations were found to be higher in areas with negative eh values as well as relatively low no3 and so4 2 concentrations higher concentrations of arsenic 10 g l were measured in samples originating at relatively shallower depths 15 m 23 m compared to samples coming from deeper depths 23 m 36 58 m similarly higher concentrations of fe cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions hco3 cl no3 were found in samples from shallow depths 15 25 m when compared to samples from relatively greater depths 25 m 37 m this could largely be due to soil mineralization evaporation coupled with recharge and anthropogenic sources using fertilisers although no systematic linear relationship was found between so4 2 and as concentrations in most groundwater samples higher as 10 g l was associated with low so4 2 generally 50 mg l implying that as reduction and mobilisation were accompanied by sulphate reduction the observed association of low concentration of no3 along with a higher concentration of as in laksar groundwater also supports the removal of as from iron hydroxide surfaces via a reductive dissolution mechanism analysis of the eh ph diagram shows that as iii species h3aso3 account for around 79 of samples whereas as v species account for the remaining samples haso4 2 this conclusion is corroborated by the measured groundwater eh values and is in accordance with reducing conditions prevalent in the groundwater aquifer higher levels of fe mn and hco3 and comparatively lower levels of no3 and so4 2 as well as negative eh values and near neutral ph indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions and support the reductive dissolution mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater the new findings reported in this study will benefit not only people of one of the world s most populous regions in adopting protective measures against this environmental hazard but will also aid towards the development of appropriate as mitigation and clean up initiatives future research in the study area should focus on mineralogical examination of the aquifer sediments by depth wise collection of sediment cores and subjecting them to various mineralogical and geochemical analyses to predict the more specific mineral phases and their roles in the

11666,this study reports new data on arsenic contamination in groundwater in laksar a pristine and semi rural region of india s himalayan state of uttarakhand based on a systematic investigation of hydrogeochemical parameters influencing arsenic mobilisation the most plausible mechanism of arsenic release into groundwater has been proposed the groundwater in the research area is mostly homogeneous with the ca mg hco3 facies accounting for 87 5 percent of groundwater samples the combined effect of silicate weathering and the dissolution of carbonate minerals predominantly influence laksar groundwater composition as evident from bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na the statistical analysis pca and correlation analysis performed on the geochemical data indicates that natural processes such as carbonate weathering reductive dissolution of fe mn minerals together with anthropogenic activities such as the utilization of fertilizers in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposal exert control on the major ion chemistry and as enrichment in groundwater the study area has extremely high arsenic concentrations ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 μg l mean 15 63 μg l with majority of groundwater samples 50 having arsenic contents exceeding the who permitted limit 10 μg l analysis of the eh ph diagram shows that as iii species h3aso3 accounts for 79 of samples whereas as v species haso4 accounts for the remaining the observed arsenic enrichment in groundwater can be attributed to as desorption from iron oxide hydroxide minerals via reductive dissolution mechanism under reducing groundwater conditions which is supported by negative eh values and high levels of fe and comparatively low levels of sulphate and nitrate graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic geochemistry groundwater eh ph reductive dissolution data availability all data used in this work have been submitted as part of the manuscript tables figures 1 introduction the presence of inorganic arsenic as in the environment has been recognized to be very harmful to human and animal life arsenic is mostly found as inorganic species in groundwater systems e g arsenite as iii and arsenate as v which are more mobile and hazardous to living organisms than organic species das et al 2016 under low redox conditions as iii predominates whereas as v is prevalent in oxidized environments smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the world health organization world health organization 2010 established a 10 μg l upper permitted limit for arsenic in groundwater however several nations have formulated their own arsenic guideline values e g the bureau of indian standards bis is 10 500 2012 the mineralogy and reactivity of aquifer sediments as well as anthropogenic contributions such as industrial wastes and agricultural pesticides all influence arsenic mobility in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2009 the reductive breakdown of iron oxyhydroxides under reducing groundwater conditions in alluvial plain regions has been identified as the principal mechanism of arsenic release in several studies bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 2000 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 harvey et al 2002 ahmed et al 2004 khan et al 2022 the most common adverse effects of as poisoning on human health include skin pigmentation rahman et al 2001 bladder and kidney cancer fletcher et al 2008 cardiovascular diseases yang 2006 chen et al 2011 skin disorders tondel et al 1999 ahmad et al 1997 rahman et al 2001 respiratory effects milton et al 2001 ahmad et al 2001 groundwater contamination with arsenic is a serious problem all around the world arsenic concentrations above 50 μg l are believed to be present in the drinking water of 35 million people in bangladesh and 6 million people in west bengal india chakraborti et al 2002 mandal and suzuki 2002 arsenic contamination of groundwater has also been observed in pakistan china vietnam laos cambodia nepal egypt and yemen tseng et al 2000 berg et al 2001 mandal and suzuki 2002 nickson et al 2005 gaillardet et al 1999 al mikhlafi 2010 kashouty et al 2012 the occurrence of high arsenic bearing 10 μg l drinking water wells in numerous locations of india s gangetic plains have been reported acharyya and shah 2004 acharyya 2005 nayak et al 2008 sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 sun et al 2008 chauhan et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 khan and rai 2022a khan and rai 2022b in both rural and urban india the most serious environmental concern and hazard to public health is a lack of safe drinking water the origin of arsenic in india s indo gangetic plain has been linked to himalayan sediments carried by rivers and entering groundwater via reductive dissolution of aquifer solid phases under reducing conditions polizzotto et al 2008 in addition to geogenic sources there can be several anthropogenic sources such as mining and various industrial and agricultural activities that can contribute towards heavy metal contamination of water resources although rapid industrialization is essential for driving economic growth of developing countries but industrial pollution becomes a major environmental and health hazard especially when it starts to pollute the water resources even in remote and pristine semi rural areas over the last two decades many large and small industrial enterprises have sprung across the himalayan state of uttarakhand in india and many of these produce industrial wastewater the installation of wastewater treatment and disposal systems particularly in small scale enterprises has been a challenge since many of them are situated in pristine and semi rural areas of the state laksar is a small hamlet town in uttarakhand situated in the himalayan foothills and it is home to several small scale industries such as sugar metal fabrication cement industries etc this study reports new data on the extent of arsenic pollution in groundwater in laksar this paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the arsenic contamination in the study area and proposes the most likely mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater based on a systematic investigation of the hydrogeochemical parameters governing arsenic mobilisation in the area 2 study area 2 1 location and drainage the laksar block is situated in the south eastern region of uttarakhand s haridwar district with latitude and longitude of 29 7587 n and 78 0415 e respectively the principal drainage of the study region is formed by the ganga which originates in the himalayan gangotri glacier flows through the laksar region and drains along the western limit of the study area tributaries of ganga which also constitute the area drainage include the solani river which originates in the shiwalik series ratmau and banganga but the tributaries are only active during the monsoon season and then dry up 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the research area is located in the district s newer quaternary alluvium zone which consists primarily of fine sand silt and clay fig 1 in terms of hydrogeology the laksar block is located in khadar alluvium zones which are typically river flood plains and recent sediments deposited by rivers in the research region groundwater is found at shallow depths in unconfined settings with water levels ranging from 4 38 to 5 69 bgl in pre monsoon and 2 32 2 53 m bgl in post monsoon periods respectively cgwb 2016 3 materials and method 3 1 sample collection and preservation thirty two groundwater samples were collected in june 2019 from both private and government installed hand pump wells in the laksar block of haridwar district with depths ranging from 12 to 37 m gps was used to determine sample collection locations garmin etrex 30 before collecting water samples and measuring parameters including temperature ph and electrical conductivity hand pumps were flushed for at least 5 min to ensure that any stagnant water was flushed out millipore 0 45 m filter papers were used to filter the samples samples for trace metal analysis were collected in pre cleaned and acid washed 15 ml polyethylene bottles which were then acidified in the field with 15 8 m hno3 to a ph of 2 separate aliquots of water samples for analysis of main cations and anions were filtered and collected in 60 ml bottles without any preservatives and kept at 4 c until analysis unfiltered and unacidified samples were collected separately in 60 ml bottles for hco3 measurements 3 2 field and laboratory measurements immediately after collection samples were immediately analysed in the field for various physical parameters including ph redox potential eh temperature and electrical conductivity ec through a portable multiparameter analyser toshcon tpc 7 on the same day as the sample collection total alkalinity as hco3 was evaluated by titration with 0 01 n h2so4 methyl orange and phenolphthalein indicators the concentrations of major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were determined in the geochemistry laboratory at iit roorkee using an ion chromatographic unit metrohm ic model 930 compact ic flux analytical facility with an analytical precision of less than 3 at the institute instrumentation centre at iit roorkee inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent technology 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms was used to examine as fe and mn calculating the inorganic ion balance using the following expression was used to check the accuracy of analytical methods inorganic charge balance tz tz tz tz where tz and tz are total cations and total anions respectively all groundwater samples had charge balances that were within 10 phreeqc software interactive 3 7 was used to calculate the speciation an eh ph diagram has been calculated and plotted using the geochemist s workbench gwb software package to elucidate the possible arsenic species in groundwater statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for social sciences ibm spss version 22 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater geochemistry table 1 shows a statistical summary of groundwater geochemical parameters along with their associated who permitted limits in drinking water table 2 shows the results of the major anions and cations ec eh and ph analyses for each of the groundwater samples collected the ph values measured in groundwater samples range from 6 9 to 8 3 with a mean of 7 3 which is within the who permissible limit 7 0 8 5 for drinking water the measured ph values indicate that the groundwater is near neutral to slightly alkaline the alkaline nature of groundwater is thought to be caused through interactions between soil and rain water subramanian and saxena 1983 as evidenced by the high ph values found in some of the groundwater samples the mean eh value of groundwater is 23 28 range 147 to 157 mv indicating predominantly reducing conditions prevailing in the aquifer the ec of groundwater varies between 190 and 1240 μs cm mean value 724 μs cm with 47 of the samples collected surpassing the who defined limit 750 μs cm tables 1 and 2 the dominating anion in the groundwater samples is hco3 whereas ca2 and na are the dominant cations according to geochemical analyses the concentrations of na k ca2 and mg2 were found to range from 8 77 to 185 84 mg l 0 98 35 77 mg l 16 08 115 63 mg l and 13 23 69 5 mg l respectively table 1 none of the collected samples had quantities of na that exceeded the who permissible limit whereas 28 13 6 25 and 75 of groundwater samples had amounts of k ca2 and mg2 that exceeded the who permissible limits respectively tables 1 and 2 hco3 f cl no3 so4 2 concentrations were observed to range from 202 92 to 523 72 mg l 0 08 0 34 mg l 2 22 160 71 mg l and nd not detected to 224 63 mg l 4 36 171 61 mg l respectively table 1 hco3 concentrations in all groundwater samples exceeded the who permitted limit of 200 mg l whereas nitrate contents in 6 25 of samples exceeded the who recommended safe limit of 45 mg l table 1 it is highly possible that bulk of the hco3 ions present in groundwater were derived from dissolution of carbonate minerals and organic matter oxidation smedley et al 2003 jeong 2001 sub saturation of these minerals in groundwater as predicted from calculated saturation index values clearly point towards the origin of so4 2 ions found present in laksar groundwater to the breakdown of gypsum and anhydrite minerals table 3 fig 2 shows a colour coded map of the area clearly showing the variation in measured hydrochemical parameters such as ph ec and redox potential as well as the observed variations in the respective concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 so4 2 hco3 fe mn and as based on the analysis of groundwater samples collected across the area as shown in fig 2 samples collected from the eastern part of the block include significant amounts of na as well as high quantities of ca2 no3 and so4 2 redox sensitive elements like fe and mn show higher concentration in groundwater mean 0 45 mg l and 0 36 mg l respectively with 53 13 and 37 50 samples exceeding the who safe limit of 0 3 mg l and 0 4 mg l respectively agricultural activities using fertilisers and leaching of municipal waste appear to be the main reason for the observed high nitrate concentration in groundwater samples nizam et al 2022 table 2 from the eastern side table 1 in terms of spatial distribution high fe concentrations are mostly found on the block s western side along with high as concentrations and low eh values fig 2 the concentration of arsenic in the study area is extremely high ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 μg l mean 15 63 g l out of 32 groundwater samples 53 n 17 have as concentrations higher than the who permissible limit 10 μg l table 1 as concentrations are higher in the western part of the block where eh values are negative and no3 and so4 2 concentrations are relatively low fig 2 4 2 hydrochemical facies and chemical evolution of groundwater groundwater chemistry is primarily influenced by water aquifer sediment interaction the chemical composition of rainwater surface water recharging groundwater and the residence time of groundwater in the aquifer verma et al 2016 the piper plot fig 3 shows that the groundwater in the laksar block is predominantly homogeneous with 87 5 of groundwater samples having ca mg hco3 facies and subordinate na hco3 cl and ca mg cl water types constituting the rest fig 3 also shows that na and ca2 are the most abundant cations and hco3 is the dominant anion present in the groundwater of the study area weathering processes are also important in the chemical evolution of groundwater because the presence of easily weatherable rocks e g carbonates and evaporites and minerals can cause significant changes in the concentration of major ions ca2 mg2 and na and hco3 in groundwater hren et al 2007 mukherjee et al 2009 carbonic acid formed from atmospheric co2 and water reacts with calcium carbonate or silicate minerals in soil to form hco3 ca2 mg2 or na ions in such processes equations 1 3 1 caco3 h2co3 ca2 2hco3 calcite dissolution 2 camg co3 2 2h2co3 ca2 mg2 4hco3 dolomite dissolution 3 2naalsi3o8 2h2co3 9h2o al2si2o5 oh 4 2na 4h4sio4 2hco3 albite silicate weathering kaolinite bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na have been used to distinguish the relative importance of such processes in contributing the major ions in groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 the good correlations observed between elemental ratios mg na vs ca na r2 0 68 fig 4 a and hco3 na vs ca na r2 0 89 fig 4b indicate that the combined effect of silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution influences laksar groundwater composition but silicate weathering is the dominant process to release these ions in groundwater albite na feldspar eq 3 and orthoclase and microcline k feldspar are two possible minerals that could release na and k in groundwater das et al 2016 the dominance of ca2 and mg2 over na and k can be seen in the plots of na k versus total cations fig 4c and ca mg versus total cations fig 4d the majority of the groundwater samples plot along the silicate weathering line na k 0 5tz in fig 4c indicating that silicate weathering was responsible for the release of na and k in groundwater groundwater samples are aligned close to the ca mg equiline fig 4d but deviate from the 1 1 equiline in the case of na k fig 4c indicating that the contribution of ca mg increases with increasing tds the majority of the samples fall between the ca mg 0 5tz and 1 1 lines fig 4d indicating that silicate weathering plays an important role in the release of ca2 and mg2 in groundwater a bivariate plot of ca mg and hco3 so4 clearly shows the prevalence of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering as well as the presence of ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes data points that fall on the 1 1 equiline indicate that these ions are the result of carbonate calcite dolomite and sulphate mineral dissolution gypsum anhydrite fisher and mullican 1997 kumar et al 2006 few groundwater samples fell on the 1 1 equiline in fig 4e and the majority of the samples are plotted away from this line towards the so4 hco3 side indicating that silicate weathering along with dissolution of dolomite calcite gypsum and or anhydrite plays a dominant role in releasing these ions in groundwater the samples plotted on the ca mg side show an excess of these ions and a depletion of na and k due to reverse ion exchange whereas the samples plotted on the hco3 so4 side show direct ion exchange if the hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio is 1 the hco3 was most likely derived from carbonate mineral dissolution whereas a ratio 1 indicates that the hco3 was derived from silicate weathering or organic matter oxidation milton et al 2001 in the study area 53 of groundwater samples have an hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio 1 and 47 have a ratio 1 indicating that hco3 was derived from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering and or organic matter dissolution processes fig 4f the plot of hco3 vs na fig 4h shows the increased concentration of hco3 compared to na indicating that silicate weathering processes dominate over carbonate dissolution it also shows that the concentration of na in groundwater is reduced due to ion exchange processes which is supported by the data fig 4g the na vs ca plot fig 4g demonstrates that ca na ion exchange is also expected to increase ca concentration in groundwater based on these findings silicate weathering is thought to be the dominant process in the evolution of cations in laksar groundwater 4 3 depth profile of as fe mn and other major cations and anions groundwater samples were collected in laksar at various depths tubewell boring depths ranging from 12 19 m to 36 58 m table 1 similar to previous studies in the gangetic plains bhattacharya et al 1997a b saha et al 2010 saha and shukla 2013 mukherjee et al 2011 the depth profile of as fig 4 shows higher concentrations of arsenic greater than the who permissible limit of 10 μg l being found at relatively shallower depths 15 m 23 m when compared to samples coming from deeper depths 23 m 36 58 m as shown in fig 4 similarly higher fe concentrations are found at shallow depths 15 25 m when compared to greater depths from 25 m to 36 58 m fig 4 furthermore higher concentrations of cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions hco3 cl no3 excluding sulphate are observed at shallow depth 15 25 m than at deeper depth 25 m 36 58 m which could be attributed to soil mineralization evaporation coupled with recharge and anthropogenic sources using fertilisers fig 4 singh et al 2018 4 4 speciation calculation for estimating possible mineral phases in groundwater the saturation indices si values of the mineral phases are calculated using the chemical composition of the analysed groundwater samples and the phreeqc hydrochemical modelling technique the si values represent the tendency of the mineral phases to dissolve or precipitate in groundwater systems it also aids in understanding the various hydrogeochemical processes that contribute to the chemical characteristics of groundwater table 3 provides a statistical summary of the saturation indices values of various mineral phases of groundwater samples the groundwater samples are saturated to sub saturated in carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 rhodochrosite mnco3 and siderite feco3 table 3 this indicates that the aquifer conditions in the study area are favourable for the precipitation of these minerals and groundwater chemistry is controlled by the precipitation or dissolution of carbonate minerals furthermore the saturation states of fe and mn bearing carbonates table 3 indicate favourable conditions for potential as adsorption on these minerals surfaces groundwater samples are undersaturated in major mn oxide hydroxide phases such as manganite mnooh hausmannite mn3o4 pyrochroite mn oh 2 and pyrolusite mno2 indicating that these minerals are thermodynamically unstable and present in groundwater in dissolved form the undersaturation of these minerals also suggests that groundwater conditions are reducing resulting in high dissolved mn concentrations mean 0 36 mg l 37 5 of samples exceeding who guideline table 1 the groundwater samples are oversaturated in terms of fe iii oxyhydroxide phases such as goethite feooh and hematite fe2o3 table 3 indicating that the aqueous conditions in the study site favour the precipitation of fe oxide hydroxide minerals and thus these minerals could play a potential role as a sink of arsenic and fe in laksar groundwater groundwater samples were undersaturated to sub saturated with respect to the ferrihydrite mineral phase table 3 which could be the possible mineral phase releasing arsenic in groundwater 4 5 hydrogeochemical factors responsible for as release in groundwater of laksar fig 5 a f depicts the relationships between as concentrations in groundwater and eh ph hco3 no3 so4 2 and fe arsenic release mechanisms in groundwater in different regions across the world have been extensively investigated mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 berg et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 nath et al 2008 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 among the various possible mechanisms suggested reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides in the presence of natural organic matter nom is thought to be the dominant mechanism of as release in alluvial plain reducing aquifers mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 berg et al 2001 zheng et al 2004 nath et al 2008 khan et al 2023 furthermore oxidative dissolution of fe sulphide minerals is also known to cause arsenic enrichment in groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mcarthur et al 2001a b however the low concentration of so4 2 mean 45 35 mg l table 1 slightly alkaline ph mean 7 30 table 1 and lack of correlation between as and so4 2 fig 6 d do not support this mechanism of arsenic release in laksar groundwater competitive exchange of as by other ions such as nitrate and phosphate acharyya et al 1999 and the combined effect of both reductive and oxidative dissolution of as bearing oxides and oxyhydroxides nickson et al 1998 kinniburgh and smedley 2001 mcarthur et al 2001a b have also been proposed as mechanisms for as release in groundwater all of the study area s high as bearing groundwater samples exhibit negative eh values fig 6a demonstrating that reducing conditions are the primary determinant of as mobilisation in groundwater arsenic desorption under high ph conditions alkali desorption is another possible route for arsenic release in groundwater as high concentrations of hco3 ions and oh may cause arsenate desorption due to competition for sorption sites mcbride 1994 the observed lack of correlation between as concentration and groundwater ph fig 6b and near neutral ph conditions mean 7 30 table 1 do not support the alkali desorption mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater a non linear relationship between observed as and hco3 concentrations as seen in fig 5c suggests that hco3 in groundwater in the study area has numerous sources and sinks such as carbonate mineral precipitation and organic matter decomposition milton et al 2001 the positive values of saturation indices table 3 calculated for bicarbonate minerals also support this inference the reductive dissolving processes for as mobilisation in groundwater are supported by the observed high concentrations of hco3 and fe with corresponding high as in most groundwater samples fig 5c f the reductive dissolving process of iron oxyhydroxides is largely repressed in reducing groundwater with high so4 2 concentrations due to sulphate reduction and consequent co precipitation of as with fe sulphide minerals resulting in low arsenic concentrations in groundwater appelo and postma 2005 buschmann and berg 2009 although no linear relationship exists between so4 2 and as concentrations in most groundwater samples higher as 10 g l is associated with low so4 2 generally 50 mg l fig 6d implying that sulphate reduction accompanies as reduction and mobilisation gaillardet et al 1999 because of the low sulphate concentration mean 45 35 mg l table 1 the as released by iron oxyhydroxide reduction remains in solution resulting in a high as concentration in groundwater low no3 concentrations usually 10 mg l in groundwater are mostly related with high as groundwaters fig 6e the amount of iron in groundwater mean 0 45 mg l table 1 is sufficient to adsorb higher levels of as in the presence of nitrate the adsorption of as on iron oxide hydroxide mineral surfaces in sediments is usually increased which may be caused by the oxidation of fe ii which favours as adsorption on iron hydroxides weber et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 senn and hemond 2002 hoeft et al 2002 alvarez benedí et al 2003 rhine et al 2007 sun et al 2008 this eventually leads to low arsenic concentration in groundwater the observed association of low concentration of no3 along with higher concentration of as in laksar groundwater supports the removal of as from iron hydroxide surfaces via reductive dissolution mechanism under oxidising conditions aqueous arsenic exists primarily as v species e g h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 and aso4 3 whereas under reducing conditions as iii species h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 and aso3 3 are the dominant as species the eh ph diagram fig 7 demonstrates that as iii species h3aso3 account for around 79 of samples whereas as v species haso4 2 account for the remaining samples this conclusion is corroborated by the measured groundwater eh values tables 1 and 2 and in accordance with reducing conditions prevalent in groundwater aquifer bulk of the iron oxyhydroxides and no3 contents can be easily reduced under such reducing conditions nelson eby 2004 and the reduction of fe oxyhydroxides and subsequent mobilisation of as could coincide with the reduction of no3 and so4 2 in the study area s groundwater kar et al 2010 in agreement with previous groundwater studies in alluival aquifer regions das et al 2016 van geen et al 2006a the observed fe content in groundwater of laksar region does not correlate with as fig 6f this could be due to fe addition from other mineral phases non as bearing or fe precipitation from solution in the form of iron bearing minerals mcarthur et al 2001a b jia et al 2014 because of the low so4 2 concentration fe is not expected to precipitate as pyrite in groundwater of the study area under reducing groundwater conditions such as those prevalent in the study area with elevated levels of hco3 some ferrous iron may be removed through precipitation of fe ii minerals such as siderite the calculated saturation indices values of groundwater samples table 3 show that they are near saturation with respect to siderite which may limit the fe concentration the calculated si values given in table 3 indicate that groundwater is oversaturated with major iron oxyhydroxide phases such as hematite and goethite and sub saturated with ferrihydrite these mineral phases would also provide ideal surfaces for fe adsorption as a result of the dissolution and or precipitation of fe minerals the correlation between as and fe concentration in groundwater remains poor overall higher levels of fe mn and hco3 and comparatively lower levels of no3 and so4 2 as well as negative eh values and near neutral ph indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions and support the reductive dissolution mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater several studies have reported iron oxide hydroxide minerals in alluvial aquifers of the meghna basin hasan et al 2009 and gangetic plain hasan et al 2009 acharyya 2005 mukherjee 2012 and these minerals were considered to regulate as mobility in these regions groundwater in this study the observed arsenic enrichment in groundwater is attributed to as desorption from ferrihydrite mineral via reductive dissolution mechanism under reducing groundwater conditions which is supported by negative eh values and high levels of fe and comparatively low levels of sulphate and nitrate 4 6 statistical analysis 4 6 1 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater samples and different geochemical processes operating in the region which affects the overall groundwater quality and mobilizations of metals table 4 summarizes pca results for physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples having a total variance of 72 02 which corresponds to 3 factors pc 1 which accounts for 40 32 of the total variance has high loadings on ec na mg2 hco3 cl mn and as the observed high loadings between these parameters could be attributed to anthropogenic sources like usage of fertilizers in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposals in the study area the positive correlations between as and mn indicate the role of mn bearing minerals on high as groundwater besides moderate positive correlations among as k and hco3 indicate the effects of agricultural activities and microbial reduction of organic matter causes the release of as in groundwater nickson et al 2000 sridharan and nathan 2018 pc 2 shows the higher loadings for eh so4 2 no3 and as with a total variance of 18 98 the association of so4 2 with no3 indicates the anthropogenic contributions the negative correlation of as with eh so4 2 and no3 supports the release of arsenic in reducing groundwater conditions via reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides pc 3 has contributed 12 72 to the total variance and represents the relationship between ca2 mg2 and hco3 which indicates the weathering of carbonate minerals such calcite and dolomite 4 6 2 correlation analysis table 5 shows the correlation matrix of the different physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples the significant correlation corresponds to the couples ec na hco3 cl mn eh as no3 na hco3 cl hco3 ca2 mg2 cl these correlations are consistent with the findings from pca i e groundwater geochemistry is largely influenced by carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities the negative correlation between as and eh and observed high fe concentration in groundwater samples table 1 indicates reducing aquifer condition favors the mobilization of as in the study area the positive correlation between ca2 hco3 and mg2 hco3 indicates the impact of carbonate weathering in the chemical evolution of groundwater 5 conclusions this study reports new data on arsenic contamination in groundwater in laksar a pristine and semi rural region of india s himalayan state of uttarakhand this article assesses the arsenic contamination in the study region in detail and proposes the most likely mechanism of arsenic release into groundwater based on a systematic examination of the hydrogeochemical parameters influencing arsenic mobilisation in the area groundwater in the study area is predominantly homogeneous with 87 5 of groundwater samples belonging to the ca mg hco3 facies analysis of the bivariate plots of mg na vs ca na and hco3 na vs ca na indicate that the combined effect of silicate weathering and the dissolution of minerals such as dolomite calcite gypsum and or anhydrite is responsible for laksar groundwater composition principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis indicate that different natural carbonate weathering reductive dissolution of fe mn minerals and anthropogenic utilization of fertilization in agricultural fields human and animal waste disposals activities operating in the study area exert control on the major ion chemistry and as enrichment in groundwater the concentration of arsenic in the study area is extremely high ranging from 0 60 to 91 21 g l mean 15 63 μg l most groundwater samples 50 were found to have arsenic concentrations exceeding the who permissible limit 10 μg l concentrations were found to be higher in areas with negative eh values as well as relatively low no3 and so4 2 concentrations higher concentrations of arsenic 10 g l were measured in samples originating at relatively shallower depths 15 m 23 m compared to samples coming from deeper depths 23 m 36 58 m similarly higher concentrations of fe cations na k mg2 ca2 and anions hco3 cl no3 were found in samples from shallow depths 15 25 m when compared to samples from relatively greater depths 25 m 37 m this could largely be due to soil mineralization evaporation coupled with recharge and anthropogenic sources using fertilisers although no systematic linear relationship was found between so4 2 and as concentrations in most groundwater samples higher as 10 g l was associated with low so4 2 generally 50 mg l implying that as reduction and mobilisation were accompanied by sulphate reduction the observed association of low concentration of no3 along with a higher concentration of as in laksar groundwater also supports the removal of as from iron hydroxide surfaces via a reductive dissolution mechanism analysis of the eh ph diagram shows that as iii species h3aso3 account for around 79 of samples whereas as v species account for the remaining samples haso4 2 this conclusion is corroborated by the measured groundwater eh values and is in accordance with reducing conditions prevalent in the groundwater aquifer higher levels of fe mn and hco3 and comparatively lower levels of no3 and so4 2 as well as negative eh values and near neutral ph indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions and support the reductive dissolution mechanism of arsenic release in groundwater the new findings reported in this study will benefit not only people of one of the world s most populous regions in adopting protective measures against this environmental hazard but will also aid towards the development of appropriate as mitigation and clean up initiatives future research in the study area should focus on mineralogical examination of the aquifer sediments by depth wise collection of sediment cores and subjecting them to various mineralogical and geochemical analyses to predict the more specific mineral phases and their roles in the

11667,the overexploitation of groundwater in the foothills of the himalayas at jammu has led in a steady decline of groundwater levels in the recent years the causes of the groundwater scarcity however is unknown due to a lack of long term trend analysis of groundwater monitoring and scientific investigations therefore the objective of this research is to investigate the groundwater variability in the alluvial aquifers of tawi river basin of the jammu district by applying a non parametric approach using mann kendall and sen s slope approach in addition a stochastic seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average arima model was also used for forecasting time series groundwater level the results revealed that during the pre monsoon prm season 66 6 of the monitoring wells suffered groundwater decreases compared to 53 during the post monsoon pom season across the whole study area the steepest slope was found in the kandi belt with maximum water table declined to 26 m below ground level bgl in 2018 compared to 8 44 m bgl in 2009 with an average rate of decline of 1 109 m yr in prm season siwalik region reported a decline of groundwater level at the rate of 0 173 m yr and 0 27 m yr in prm and pom respectively however water table in sirowal region improved marginally in prm and pom season with a mean raise of 0 05 m yr and 0 08 m yr respectively according to the time series forecasting by stochastic simulation if the current situation continues the groundwater level in the kandi region would decline by 9 46 m and 9 38 m respectively over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom respectively by 2025 the spatio temporal analysis showed that the groundwater extraction in the aquifers of kandi region was higher than that of the siwalik and sirowal region the spatiotemporal trend and projection of groundwater levels is quite helpful in identifying the most vulnerable places as well as addressing the current and future condition of groundwater levels for optimal resource planning and management of groundwater resources in the sustainable ways graphical abstract image 1 keywords mann kendall sen s slope tawi river arima groundwater monitoring data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water scarcity in india has led to violent community clashes during the summer which has made the alarm for water scientist and government to assess and analyse the issue of groundwater resources analysis of spatiotemporal groundwater level dynamics in overexploited aquifers aids in determining the reasons of the depletion the trend analysis modelling and prediction of groundwater fluctuation are the initial stage of effective management during dry season the groundwater trend analysis provides information for understanding the cause of groundwater decline water table behaviour direction of the trend and characteristics of trends for trend analysis a variety of statistical approaches were applied ranging from basic regression to parametric and non parametric methods the hydro meteorological data hydrogeological data streamflow measurements are often non normally distributed and hence non parametric test are used to identify trends in time series analysis mann 1945 kendall 1955 ramazanipour and roshani 2011 patle et al 2013 tabari et al 2012 samsudin et al 2011 bhat et al 2019 shyam et al 2021 karunakalage et al 2021 swain et al 2022 in the last three decades various researchers in india and abroad have studied the groundwater level in quest to know about the realm of the spatio temporal groundwater time series and fluctuations e g ghiassi et al 2008 faruk 2010 haque et al 2020 bhatnagar et al 2022 swain et al 2022 shamsudduha et al 2009 evaluated groundwater level changes and seasonality using a non parametric temporal decomposition technique in bangladesh s ganges brahmaputra meghna delta law 1974 investigated the stochastic assessment of temporal groundwater data in western part of united states among the trend analysis tests many researchers have employed non parametric trend analysis tests to identify trends in hydrological time series datasets the mann kendall mk test is the most common non parametric rank based method used to detect the trend and seasonality in the time series this test is reliable for non normal time series lu et al 2003 further mk test are not significantly affected by the presence of outliers hirsch et al 1982 as a result of its extensive use various scientific studies have been conducted to examine the strengths and limitations of this statistical test the strengths of the mk are often connected with its basic idea and the fact that being a nonparametric approach that does not assume a specific joint distribution of the data and therefore it is unaffected by deviations from normality yue and pilon 2004 the limitations of this trend test are commonly related with its own null hypothesis h0 which assumes that the data are distributed independently and identically in practice however the rejection of such h0 is commonly interpreted as evidence of the presence of a trend in a given hydrological time series following chandler and scott 2011 we may infer that this assumption is reasonable considering no trend is present in the independent distributed hydrological dataset furthermore the slope of the observed trends must be determined which provides the magnitude of the trend the non parametric robust sen s slope estimator was used to estimate slope since it is an unbiased trend estimator with significantly greater accuracy than a regression estimator when data are heavily skewed hirsch et al 1982 kawamura et al 2011 used mk trend check and sen s slope estimation to analyse groundwater level trends and slopes in hanoi hua tabari et al 2012 used the mk test and sen s slope to examine at the temporal patterns in yearly seasonal and monthly water table changes in northern part of iran from 1985 to 2007 they found that stronger increasing trends were identified in summer and spring compared to autumn and winter the arima model is a popular tool for forecasting future trends and it s been used to hydrological time series data extensively kurunç et al 2005 ghiassi et al 2008 faruk 2010 oliveira et al 2017

using the arima model the jammu region which is located in the kandi belt is the most densely populated district in the union territory of jammu and kashmir and the influx of tourists and pilgrims during the prm season which lasts from may to june is responsible for over exploitation of limited water supplies sangra 1987 and pitale 1967 conducted hydrogeological investigations in jammu district between 1974 78 and 1983 respectively and observed deeper groundwater levels in the kandi belt ranging from 2 to 30 m bgl during the prm season furthermore groundwater demand for irrigation has expanded dramatically with a total area irrigated from groundwater of 15 69 km2 cgwb 2011 2012 2018 which is also a significant cause of rapid groundwater depletion in the alluvial aquifer jasrotia et al 2019 the central ground water board cgwb 2011 2012 conducted a short term water supply investigation to gather hydrogeological data and proposed the groundwater development and replenishment of groundwater resources in the jammu and adjoining districts these investigations based on short term monitoring addresses groundwater depletion and identified potential artificial recharge zones as well as suitable artificial recharge sites however these studies did not evaluate for statistical significance of time series data therefore the associated effects of groundwater reductions are ambiguous as a result this is the first time a non parametric analysis and arima model have been employed in this study area to analyse the time series groundwater data and to forecast future groundwater trend and variability the main issue in the siwalik and the kandi belts are the presence of steep slopes boulder beds and a deep water table which causes excessive runoff soil erosion and land degradation as well as an uneven distribution of recharge in space and time jasrotia et al 2019 the study period 2009 2018 includes a prolonged decadal drought that provides an opportunity to investigate groundwater variability in the study area during the dry climatic phase fig 1 a the kandi region s groundwater table is deep and steadily dropping with rapid increases and decreases in response to recharging for the duration of the monsoon season july to october and pumping during the dry season november to june fig 1b specifically our objective were to 1 determine the direction and magnitude of trends in groundwater level trend using mk and sen s slope method and 2 to forecast future groundwater levels using arima modelling in tawi river basin of jammu district india under sustainable groundwater extraction levels it would be assumed that groundwater would respond to seasonal phases i e groundwater levels would fall during dry season and rise during rainy season groundwater levels recovering during wet periods would indicate some resilience of the system to extreme climate variability over long term this research will help to guide future management of the region s groundwater resources and will provide a basis for modelling the impacts of climatic extremes 2 study area tawi river basin at jammu district has geographical area of 631 km2 which is a part of indus river basin and a tributary of chenab river the area situated between latitude 32 55 07 32 45 30 n and longitude 74040 00 75 5 00 e surrounded by rugged mountain range in the north siwalik region and outer plains kandi and sirowal region in the south fig 1c the tawi river is the major drainage line in the study area and is a major source of drinking water to the jammu metropolitan the study area is classified as sub humid to sub tropical with mean annual rainfall is about 1146 mm jasrotia et al 2019 the south west monsoon summer monsoon beings the maximum rainfall in the month of july august and september contributes 80 of total rainfall whereas the winter monsoon december to february constitute about 10 of total rainfall and 5 6 of total rainfall occurs in march to may the temperature peaks up to 45 c in summer and drops to low as 3 c during winter with june and january being the hottest and coldest month respectively of the year temperature rises rapidly after february and drops rapidly after october supplementary fig 1 a and b based on geomorphology the study area is divided into three physiographic regions 1 siwalik region hilly area 2 kandi region and 3 sirowal region the siwalik range is dominated with rugged and strike valley dissected ridge slopes and steep mountains with an area of 56 of the total study area it lies at an altitude between 400 and 900 m above mean sea level amsl and characterised by excessive runoff soil erosion and land degradation the rock type consists of consolidated formation with hard crystalline and compact red sandstone crystalline limestone shale with conglomerates and isolated sand nodules of precambrian age the groundwater occurs as small isolated bodies in the weathered portions or joints or cracks in these rocks however the sand nodules and friable sandstone do possess primary porosity but are not potential aquifers cgwb 2018 in an altitude of 320 440 m amsl the kandi area begins at the foothills of the outermost siwalik and slopes south and south west with high gradients ranging from 1 90 to 1 120 nih 2000 the rock type in this region comprises of semi consolidated rocks mainly comprising of piedmont deposits dominated by gravel with ferruginous clay matrix nih 2000 the water holding capacity of the soils is low the kandi region merges into sirowal formation in the southwest at an altitude less than 320 m amsl with gentle slope 1 250 to 1 300 the alluvial flat topography has unconsolidated rock type of finer and younger alluvium sediment includes vast alluvial tracts flood plains river terraces with shallow groundwater table this region also faces swampy condition due to persistent clay beds occurring close the ground surface the presence of spring line demarcates the contact between the kandi in the north and the sirowal in the south in recent times the spring line has undergone deformation due to decline of water table in the outer plains 3 materials and methods

group infrared precipitation with stations chirps the cgwb provided groundwater level data m bgl for the monitoring wells located in the study area the cgwb measured groundwater levels four times a year in pre monsoon prm season in the month of may monsoon season in the month of august post monsoon pom season in the month of november and receding season in the month of january panda et al 2012 monitoring wells that had just been constructed and had fewer than ten years of observation were omitted for a consistent comparison of trend and variability bore well data from the confined aquifer were excluded the water table records for missing months were also obtained from the nearest meteorological observatory located in water management and research centre at sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology skuast jammu department of public health engineering irrigation and flood control j k government and water resources information system wris india the small quantities of missing data were imputed by removing the seasonal component from the time series first then using the mice package in r finally 30 monitoring wells were chosen for analysing groundwater level variations in the study area during a 120 month period from january 2009 to december 2018 the groundwater data for 120 months is divided into two halves in a 70 30 ratio the first 84 months 2009 2015 were utilised for calibration followed by 36 months 2016 2018 for model validation accuracy and predictability the r statistical language r development team 2007 has been emerged as an important tool for many kind of spatiotemporal analysis of data the mk trend test sen s slope and arima model are accessible in forecast and trend package in r respectively the auto arima function in r selects the finest models for all the wells in the study area on the ground of bayesian information criteria bic and the akaike information criteria aic factors 3 2 climatic phases defined by rainfall anomalies rainfall anomalies are calculated by subtracting the rainfall of a single year month from its all time average year month the yearly average rainfall from 1992 to 2018 was used to compute the rainfall anomaly to account for rainfall lag effects on groundwater levels chen et al 2004 le brocque et al 2018 the rainfall anomaly is transformed to a weighted rainfall anomaly value by adding rainfall anomalies from the previous four years to the current year s rainfall anomalies the following are the weighted rainfall anomaly values for each meteorological station p 5 y r w t d p y i p y i 1 1 y i y i 1 p y i 2 1 y i y i 2 p y i 3 1 y i y i 3 p y i 4 1 y i y i 4 where p 5 y r w t d is the weighted rainfall anomaly over 5 years y i is the year p y i is the yearly rainfall anomaly value for year i and i 1 is the preceding year s rainfall anomaly value the yearly anomalies j accumulated throughout the five recording sites n were then computed as follows t o t 5 y r w t d 1 n i 1 n p i j 5 y r w t d p y i j in this study climatic phases were classified as wet or dry based on the occurrence of two or more severe rainfall anomalies in the 90th percentile or above of long term data wet years were identified as the 1992 2018 anomalies the dry years were defined as rainfall anomalies at or below the 10th percentile of the long term 1992 2018 anomaly this method is used by hundecha and bárdossy 2005 to detect extreme periods in large amounts of climatic data three climatic phases were defined 1992 2000 2001 2006 and 2007 2018 based on a transition from positive to negative anomalies or vice versa with a magnitude of 50 or larger singh et al 2017 observed that the wettest period 1992 2000 is followed by a drying period since 2000 for the north western himalaya the study period recommended in this research is from 2009 to 2018 which corresponds to the dry climatic phase fig 1a 3 3 mann kendall test it is an important nonparametric statistical rank based technique used for determining the spatiotemporal significance of groundwater level changes mann 1945 kendall 1975 when the data is not normally distributed the mk test is highly recommended the mk technique computes kendall statistics s which is a non parametric regression analysis by comparing later measured values with earlier measured values the kendal statistics s is calculated as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s i g n y j y i where s is for mk records n stands for the quantity of data points and y j and y i stand for the data at time series i and j respectively where j i each data point y i is used as a reference point and the remainder of the data points y j are compared to it such that s i g n y j y i 1 i f y j y i 0 0 i f y j y i 0 1 i f y j y i 0 if s is positive then it suggests an increasing trend whereas if s is negative then it shows a downward tendency over time mann 1945 and kendall 1975 provide more information on the mk test the trend was only taken into account in this study if it was discovered with a statistical significance of 5 using the mk test theil sen technique thiel 1950 sen 1968 also known as sen s slope was used to compute the trend magnitude the median of the slopes derived from all of the data pairs analysed is the sen slope which is produced using sens slope estimator qi q m e d i a n y j y i x j x i f o r i 1 2 n where j 1 and j 1 to n i 1 to n 1 and n is total number of observations 3 4 arima model the arima model is one of the most popular and commonly used time series forecasting and modelling methods box and jenkins 1976 the model is written as arima p d q with p d and r representing autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma correspondingly box and jenkins 1976 data from rainfall and groundwater levels were used to model and predict rainfall and groundwater levels throughout time box and jenkins 1976 have further information and explanations on the arima equations for a certain temporal series yt can be expressed as gibrilla et al 2018 y t y 1 y 2 y 3 y t where y1 y2 y3 are observations at time t1 t2 t3 the ar component illustrates how the current and prior p observations are related if p 1 every data would be a dependent of only one previous data as indicated in the diagram below y t c φ 1 y t 1 e t if p 1 the equation becomes y t c φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p e t where yt yt 1 are the observed values for both the time t t 1 respectively et is error at time t c and φ are constant the integrated i part determines either to simulate the observation data or model fluctuations between subsequent observations for example if d 0 then data are simulated directly differences between successive data are simulated if d 1 in practise though d might be either 1 or 2 the dickey and fuller 1979 have elaborated on the purpose of differencing which is to render the time series stationary the ma component determines the connection between the observation and the prior q error similarly when q 1 then each event is determined by a single prior error i e y t c θ e t 1 e t here c is a constant et denotes the random sampling errors at time t whereas et 1 is the preceding random error at t 1 the arima time series modelling approach is divided into four steps a model identification where the temporal datasets are examined for stationary and normalcy this is done by using suitable differencing and transformation of series autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function which are denoted by acf and pacf respectively were used to determine the dataset for its seasonality and stationary nature b parameter estimation was determined from stationary data or the differenced data for non stationary series the proper order for differencing is when the acf plot decays rapidly to zero the acf and pacf provide an indication of the preliminary order for the arima model s moving average ma and autoregressive ar by comparison between the stationary data of acf pacf a preliminary model is chosen whereas p d q are calculated using maximum likelihood technique in the second stage a variety of possibilities close to the potential model were created in a random sequence aic and bic indicate improved model performance c diagnostic checking of the residuals is used to verify the model s appropriateness the robustness of a fitted model is indicated via residual analysis the residual should function as white noise in the well model random the residuals of acf and pacf were used as standard assessment criteria for arima model for regularly distributed residuals all acf and pacf spikes should fall inside the threshold values hence the process is repeated with new model until all the spike of acf and pacf lies within the threshold values d forecasting is the last stage is used to selected model with the lowest acf and pacf for each site to calculate the fitted and predicted values of groundwater anomalies root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 mean

the goodness of fit criteria used to judge the performance of the models patle et al 2013 the observed and anticipated outcomes were compared in selecting the suitable forecasting model 4 results 4 1 groundwater level fluctuations the mean monthly rainfall as well as groundwater level on spatial scale for siwalik kandi and sirowal throughout the prm and pom seasons were shown in fig 2 furthermore substantial connections between mean rainfall and mean pom groundwater level were identified for the three physiographic zones as evidenced by the high correlation coefficient r r1 however the correlation between groundwater level during prm and rainfall was observed to be weak for these three regions for that particular year because it is influenced by previous year s monsoon rainfall and anthropogenic factors leading to groundwater abstraction furthermore rising high temperatures and low rainfall supplementary fig 1b throughout the summer are expected to have an impact on groundwater levels during prm season the correlation between rainfall with prm and pom groundwater level in kandi region r1 0 37 and r 0 55 sirowal region r1 0 44 r 0 61 and siwalik region r1 0 52 r 0 57 found to be comparatively weak fig 2 a b and c pearson s correlation coefficient r was used for all correlation tests and correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 however for brevity the prm and pom groundwater levels were calculated by averaging the groundwater levels in the respective physiographic zones which represents the region s local water table dynamics during prm the groundwater levels below the ground surface are normally the lowest while the pom the groundwater levels are the highest the average groundwater level from 2009 to 2018 shows a steep decline in all the three regions both in prm and pom seasons with the maximum groundwater level declined shown in kandi region for example in 2009 the mean overall prm groundwater levels in siwalik kandi and sirowal were 4 53 9 72 and 3 76 m bgl respectively while in 2018 they were 6 31 18 91 and 5 34 m bgl respectively during pom season it is observed that the average groundwater level in siwalik kandi and sirowal were declined from 3 94 8 67 and 3 35 m bgl in the year 2009 to 4 97 15 71 and 4 86 m bgl respectively by 2018 fig 2 4 2 groundwater level tends 4 2 1 time series decomposition to evaluate the trend and fluctuation of groundwater level in our study aquifer we examined data from a representative piezometer from 2009 to 2018 using moving averages the temporal series was decomposed into random seasonal trend and observed components the trend component of the decomposed time series for well 12 exhibited a declining trend ranging across 25 m in depth that dropped constantly between 2016 and 2018 with steady seasonality over time fig 3 the amplitude of the oscillatory seasonal component is about 3 m the estimated seasonal factor showing a peak of groundwater levels in prm and a trough in the pom the residual component varies between 1 m the trend is the largest integral component followed by residual and seasonality components this test s low p value 2 2e 16 demonstrates statistically significant trend in the data as confirmed by the mk test tabari and marofi 2011 furthermore the raw time series data were examined for non stationarity to ensure that the data was not random the time series of groundwater data suggested a non stationary as the null hypothesis of all the wells were accepted with p 0 05 at 95 confidence level according to the dickey fuller adf test trend in groundwater for each monitoring well for three physiographic regions within the climatic phase of seasonal prm and pom and annual 2009 2018 time series data were calculated using mk and sen s slope statistics table 1 and table 2 show the statistical test results on the seasonal and full period applying mk z and sen s slope q of groundwater levels for each well there was a slight reduction in rainfall with an average z value of 0 26 0 30 0 36 for kandi sirowal and siwalik regions respectively which had no significant trend these analyses identified significant negative or positive trend or no trend at p 0 05 for each monitoring wells and therefore the well responses were classified into three categories a positive trend signifies declining groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface while b negative trend signifies increase in groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface c no trend means stable groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface 4 2 2 annual trends 2009 2018 the overall net response across the entire time period 2009 2018 for groundwater monitoring wells for the entire study area was a significant decline in the water table fig 4 a p 0 05 with an average rate of decline corresponds to 0 04 m yr the depth change of all monitoring wells is used to calculate this average across the entire study area 63 6 of total wells exhibited positive trend groundwater decline as against 20 improvement p 0 05 and 16 6 exhibited no significant trend p 0 05 the steepest slope was found in kandi belt for well 12 and 21 showed significant declines in the groundwater level with mean rate of decline of 0 12 and 0 1 m year respectively table 2 the major reason for the decline in groundwater levels is probably increase in urbanization and industrial growth mainly in jammu city of kandi belt for a decade cgwb 2018 few positive trend water table decline were observed in siwalik region that were mostly concentrated in north and northeast of the study area although location specific improve are observed in few wells 4 wells out of 19 with well no 4 showed significant groundwater level improvement over the years fig 4a and table 2 this is due to irrigation return and proximity of well at the tributaries of tawi however 73 6 wells in siwalik exhibits decline in groundwater levels fig 4a with maximum decline observed in northern part of the study area at a mean decline rate ranging from 0 0066 to 0 011 m yr on an average the overall reduction of groundwater levels in siwalik region is 0 02 m yr whereas the overall water table in sirowal region situated in the downstream of tawi river were stable and marginally declining at the rate of 0 002 0 006 m yr this can be due to the local factor such as recharge from irrigation shallow water table swampy conditions and presence of spring and artesian wells 4 2 3 seasonal trends the statistical analysis revealed that there was a downward trend in groundwater levels at the 95 significance level throughout the study area with an overall reduction of groundwater levels of 0 71 and 0 61 m yr in the prm and pom seasons respectively for the whole study area z values for prm and pom water table ranged from 3 21 to 1 78 and 2 68 to 1 34 respectively table 2 during prm season 66 6 of 30 monitoring wells showed a positive trend decline in groundwater levels compared to 53 percent in the pom season whereas improvement of groundwater levels in prm is 20 as against 26 6 in pom season p 0 05 however 13 and 20 of the wells demonstrate no significant trend in prm and pom season respectively p 0 05 strong seasonal positive trends were observed in kandi region fig 4 b and c declining at the rate of 1 1 and 0 85 m yr in prm and pom season respectively the steepest slopes that were observed for three wells 12 21 and 13 were located in the kandi region with an average overall decline in groundwater level of 1 44 and 1 08 m yr in prm and pom season respectively table 1 among these three wells well no 12 observed the first largest groundwater level decline at the rate of 1 693 and 1 325 m yr for prm and pom season respectively while well 21 have second largest groundwater level decline at the rate of 1 443 and 1 328 m yr in prm and pom season respectively whereas well 13 recorded third highest water table decline at the rate of 1 05 and 0 56 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 2 on the other hand the declining groundwater levels were observed in north and north east part of the for siwalik region with an average overall decline of groundwater levels of 0 47 and 0 75 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 1 although location specific positive or negative trends were observed in groundwater level during prm and pom season for example well 5 14 20 and 26 showed groundwater levels generally declined in prm fig 4a however improved in pom season fig 4b groundwater levels for well 4 and 18 situated at the tributaries of tawi in siwalik region improved gradually for both prm and pom at rate of 1 788 and 0 0429 m yr and 0 305 and 0 09 m yr respectively table 2 this may be due to some local factor such as sparse population and increase in irrigation activities may have affected its behaviour the statistical test detected a significant positive trend observed in 80 of wells in the kandi region and 78 of wells in the siwalik region during prm however 52 and 60 of wells in the siwalik and kandi regions detected significant positive trend during pom on the seasonal scale both the mk and sen s slope estimator have shown rising seasonal trends in the kandi and siwalik regions in prm and pom seasons except in the sirowal region which showed a declining seasonal trend in prm seasons results indicated that 66 of the wells in the sirowal region detected negative trend demonstrating an increase in the groundwater levels at the rate of 0 05 and 0 08 m yr during prm and pom seasons respectively table 1 it is observed that groundwater levels in well 9 and 19 improved significantly in both the seasons fig 4a and b due to aquifer recharge from irrigation return flows in this location 4 2 4 model selection and future predictions before performing any further analysis on time series data the stationarity of the data should be checked to assess the stationarity of rainfall and groundwater level data acf and pacf correlograms were shown for the kandi region fig 5 a and b and supplementary material supplementary fig 2 for the siwalik and the sirowal regions the dashed lines above and below the x axis reflect the margins for computing acf and pacf values at a 95 confidence level the lagged time steps are shown on the x axis while the correlation values for the corresponding delays are shown on the y axis the acf and pacf for rainfall and groundwater levels are demonstrated in fig 5 before differencing there are spikes above the confidence bounds in each figure after differencing the majority of the spikes are below confidence limits indicating stationary series as indicated in fig 5 the order of p and q for creating preliminary arima models for groundwater level time series was determined on acf and pacf plots 4 2 5 model validation and residuals analysis the selected models were then tested by comparing observed and fitted water table data from the years 2009 2018 all of the model evaluation variables rmse mape mae maxape and maxae were well within reasonable limits supplementary table 1 fig 6 a b c shows the residuals of acf and pacf of arima 4 1 0 0 1 1 12 for groundwater level in kandi region whereas sirowal and siwalik are provided in the supplementary material supplementary fig 3 and 4 the acf and pacf spikes are all within the 95 percent confidence level indicating that residuals are random in fig 6c the residuals plot autocorrelation of residuals and ljung box p values for the 20 lags are displayed the residuals of the models are separately distributed and all of the lags are below the threshold suggesting that there is no autocorrelation between them implying that the model is good for execution similarly residuals of acf and pacf of arima 1 1 0 0 1 1 12 model for rainfall are presented in fig 7 a b and c indicating that the model s residuals are independently distributed and that all lags are below the threshold justifies as a good model 4 2 6 groundwater levels prediction the time series of arima model simulations of rainfall along with observed and predicted groundwater levels shown in fig 8 and supplementary material supplementary fig 5 6 gentle decline in annual rainfall with an average reduction of 0 303 0 327 0 445 mm yr for kandi sirowal and siwalik regions respectively with no significant trend were observed the model calibrated period 2009 2015 illustrates the periodicity of observed groundwater level the arima model fitted close to observed groundwater level in the validation period 2016 2018 with a few exceptions the model appears to have captured the most of the peaks the exceptions are due to the stochastic model s inclusion of a randomness component on a seasonal scale groundwater levels in kandi s have been steadily declining since 2018 it is predicted that in the year 2025 groundwater levels in the kandi area will be 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom season respectively which is 9 46 m and 9 38 m lower than they were in 2018 for prm and pom respectively fig 8c and d the average rate of water table decline in this location for prm and pom is expected to be about 1 35 and 1 32 m yr respectively in the sirowal area the observed and simulated groundwater levels revealed a fairly consistent trend supplementary fig 5b it is predicted that in the year 2025 the prm and pom groundwater levels would decline by 1 35 and 0 09 m over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 5 9 and 3 5 m bgl at the average rate of about 0 22 and 1 45 m yr for prm and pom season respectively supplementary fig 5c and d while the forecasted results for siwalik region supplementary fig 6 c and d showed significant groundwater levels decline by 9 02 and 6 72 m over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 16 91 and 11 84 m bgl at an average rate of 0 91 and 0 52 m yr for prm pom respectively by 2025 studies by gibrilla et al 2018 observed a significant groundwater levels decline to about 12 m by 2020 with an average rate of decline of about 1 008 m yr in volta river basin of ghana patle et al 2013 forecasted groundwater levels decline to about 12 97 m and 12 m over the observed value in 2010 by 2050 in karnal district of indo gangetic plains 5 discussion the siwalik range is hilly and mountainous accounts for higher runoff resulting in varying degree of recharge to the groundwater the entire kandi belt of jammu region witnessed gradual depletion in groundwater resource over the years cgwb 2011 river bed material mining is prevalent in the higher altitude resulting in decreased recharge and increased runoff cgwb 2018 in the jammu region s kandi belt there are roughly 300 ponds that serve as recharge structures these ponds have been underutilised and even encroached upon and their inlets have been disrupted due to the distribution of piped water supplies some ponds are being filled by tube wells erected nearby placing stress on aquifers on contrary sirowal region has shallow groundwater table with marshy condition ideal to support agriculture during the dry climatic period this study examines the stochastic behaviour of groundwater time series data from thirty monitoring wells in the tawi river basin in jammu overall we observed that average groundwater levels declined by 0 04 m yr over the tawi basin during the study period and that groundwater recovery in wet periods was inadequate to offset decline in dry periods in this study we have observed the influence of monsoonal rainfall on the groundwater levels trend in the study area to be comparatively weak for prm and pom fig 2 studies by le brocque et al 2018 concluded that the trends between climatic phases showed groundwater level recovery during wet phases was insufficient to offset the decline in groundwater level from the previous dry phase in southern queensland australia the statistical results of the mk and sen s slope tests concluded that widespread groundwater levels declined for 66 6 and 53 of the wells in the prm and pom seasons respectively the majority of wells with significant positive trend occurred in prm tabari et al 2012 panda et al 2012 patle et al 2013 studies by panda et al 2012 observed that 58 of 555 monitoring wells showed decline in groundwater levels during prm with an overall rate of decline of 0 11 m yr in gujarat and kutch region in our study area the highest numbers of wells with significant positive trend were located in the kandi and northwest part of siwalik regions irrespective of seasons the detailed statistics of sen s slope indicated that 80 of the wells in kandi and 78 of wells in siwalik regions experienced significant positive trend decline p 0 05 in prm groundwater levels with an average overall decline of 1 44 and 0 47 m yr respectively as against 1 08 and 0 758 m yr in pom groundwater level if current levels of exploitation continue groundwater levels in the kandi region are expected to reach 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom respectively in 2025 on contrary groundwater levels improved moderately in sirowal with mean increases of 0 05 m yr and 0 08 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 1 mainly due to irrigation return and shallow depth of the groundwater table allowing groundwater to be discharged through springs and free flow artesian tube wells built for irrigation due to absence of electricity and infrastructures the large volumes of groundwater emerging from artesian tube wells flows towards pakistan perhaps these artesian flows can be channelized and diverted to drought prone areas of the kandi region that are affected by severe groundwater declining trend over the decades appropriate soil and water conservation measures and site specific artificial recharge is needed to address the drought and declining groundwater levels in the present scenarios for better future 6 conclusion using non parametric statistical approaches we attempted to detect and quantify groundwater level changes as well as pinpoint sites that are susceptible owing to anthropogenic strain on groundwater resources furthermore the trend quantification result has been utilised to forecast future groundwater levels over the course of study period we observed that the average groundwater level declined by 0 04 m yr throughout the tawi basin and that during the wet season groundwater recovery from the monsoon was not enough to make up for the reduction during the prm season the proportion of declining of groundwater levels in the wells during prm were much greater than rising recovering groundwater levels in the following pom season under climate change severe drought events are expected to become more often csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 this trend might worsen resulting in even greater decline and less recovery than we have observed so far furthermore results indicated that at 95 percent level of significance the statistical analysis of mk test shows a downward trend in groundwater levels throughout the study region sen s slope estimator revealed a fall in groundwater level in 66 6 of wells and an improvement in just 20 of 30 monitoring wells on a seasonal basis in the pom season 53 of the wells showed declined in the groundwater level and 26 6 of the wells showed improved in the water table whereas 20 of wells witnessed no significant trend the value of sen s slope varied from 1 693 to 0 305 m yr with a mean value of 0 210 m yr for prm groundwater trend similarly the value of sen s slope varied from 1 328 to 0 138 m yr with a mean value of 0 193 m yr for pom groundwater level across the basin the overall net response for groundwater monitoring wells in the study area for the entire time period 2009 2018 observed a considerable decline in groundwater levels with an average overall decrease of 0 71 and 0 61 m yr in prm and pom seasons respectively we conclude that there is evidence of a considerable net reduction in groundwater levels in the important kandi region of the tawi basin in jammu between 2009 and 2018 compared to siwalik and sirowal regions strong seasonal positive trends were seen in the kandi region with prm and pom seasons declining at rates of 1 1 and 0 85 m yr respectively groundwater levels in kandi s have been continuously dropping on a seasonal scale since 2018 and are expected to reach 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in the prm and pom seasons respectively by 2025 which is 9 46 m and 9 38 m lower than they were in 2018 whereas the simulated forecasted results for siwalik region in the year 2025 showed a significant groundwater level decline that will be predicted to reach a level of 16 91 and 11 84 m bgl in prm and pom season respectively conversely majority of the wells in the sirowal area revealed a pretty consistent trend in both the observed and simulated groundwater levels analysis of groundwater trends in prm and pom seasons demonstrates that recharging during monsoon period does not account for groundwater decline during a prolonged drought groundwater levels might drop to dangerously low levels the decline in water table level is mostly due to excessive groundwater pumping that exceeds the groundwater recharge rate rather than a decrease in recharge rate caused by rainfall groundwater management practises must be explored to secure future water availability in the study area upon simulating actual groundwater records and projecting the future groundwater situation of the study area the arima model produced encouraging results which might be useful for groundwater conservation

11667,the overexploitation of groundwater in the foothills of the himalayas at jammu has led in a steady decline of groundwater levels in the recent years the causes of the groundwater scarcity however is unknown due to a lack of long term trend analysis of groundwater monitoring and scientific investigations therefore the objective of this research is to investigate the groundwater variability in the alluvial aquifers of tawi river basin of the jammu district by applying a non parametric approach using mann kendall and sen s slope approach in addition a stochastic seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average arima model was also used for forecasting time series groundwater level the results revealed that during the pre monsoon prm season 66 6 of the monitoring wells suffered groundwater decreases compared to 53 during the post monsoon pom season across the whole study area the steepest slope was found in the kandi belt with maximum water table declined to 26 m below ground level bgl in 2018 compared to 8 44 m bgl in 2009 with an average rate of decline of 1 109 m yr in prm season siwalik region reported a decline of groundwater level at the rate of 0 173 m yr and 0 27 m yr in prm and pom respectively however water table in sirowal region improved marginally in prm and pom season with a mean raise of 0 05 m yr and 0 08 m yr respectively according to the time series forecasting by stochastic simulation if the current situation continues the groundwater level in the kandi region would decline by 9 46 m and 9 38 m respectively over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom respectively by 2025 the spatio temporal analysis showed that the groundwater extraction in the aquifers of kandi region was higher than that of the siwalik and sirowal region the spatiotemporal trend and projection of groundwater levels is quite helpful in identifying the most vulnerable places as well as addressing the current and future condition of groundwater levels for optimal resource planning and management of groundwater resources in the sustainable ways graphical abstract image 1 keywords mann kendall sen s slope tawi river arima groundwater monitoring data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water scarcity in india has led to violent community clashes during the summer which has made the alarm for water scientist and government to assess and analyse the issue of groundwater resources analysis of spatiotemporal groundwater level dynamics in overexploited aquifers aids in determining the reasons of the depletion the trend analysis modelling and prediction of groundwater fluctuation are the initial stage of effective management during dry season the groundwater trend analysis provides information for understanding the cause of groundwater decline water table behaviour direction of the trend and characteristics of trends for trend analysis a variety of statistical approaches were applied ranging from basic regression to parametric and non parametric methods the hydro meteorological data hydrogeological data streamflow measurements are often non normally distributed and hence non parametric test are used to identify trends in time series analysis mann 1945 kendall 1955 ramazanipour and roshani 2011 patle et al 2013

groundwater level in quest to know about the realm of the spatio temporal groundwater time series and fluctuations e g ghiassi et al 2008 faruk 2010 haque et al 2020 bhatnagar et al 2022 swain et al 2022 shamsudduha et al 2009 evaluated groundwater level changes and seasonality using a non parametric temporal decomposition technique in bangladesh s ganges brahmaputra meghna delta law 1974 investigated the stochastic assessment of temporal groundwater data in western part of united states among the trend analysis tests many researchers have employed non parametric trend analysis tests to identify trends in hydrological time series datasets the mann kendall mk test is the most common non parametric rank based method used to detect the trend and seasonality in the time series this test is reliable for non normal time series lu et al 2003 further mk test are not significantly affected by the presence of outliers hirsch et al 1982 as a result of its extensive use various scientific studies have been conducted to examine the strengths and limitations of this statistical test the strengths of the mk are often connected with its basic idea and the fact that being a nonparametric approach that does not assume a specific joint distribution of the data and therefore it is unaffected by deviations from normality yue and pilon 2004 the limitations of this trend test are commonly related with its own null hypothesis h0 which assumes that the data are distributed independently and identically in practice however the rejection of such h0 is commonly interpreted as evidence of the presence of a trend in a given hydrological time series following chandler and scott 2011 we may infer that this assumption is reasonable considering no trend is present in the independent distributed hydrological dataset furthermore the slope of the observed trends must be determined which provides the magnitude of the trend the non parametric robust sen s slope estimator was used to estimate slope since it is an unbiased trend estimator with significantly greater accuracy than a regression estimator when data are heavily skewed hirsch et al 1982 kawamura et al 2011 used mk trend check and sen s slope estimation to analyse groundwater level trends and slopes in hanoi hua tabari et al 2012 used the mk test and sen s slope to examine at the temporal patterns in yearly seasonal and monthly water table changes in northern part of iran from 1985 to 2007 they found that stronger increasing trends were identified in summer and spring compared to autumn and winter the arima model is a popular tool for forecasting future trends and it s been used to hydrological time series data extensively kurunç et al 2005 ghiassi et al 2008 faruk 2010 oliveira et al 2017

using the arima model the jammu region which is located in the kandi belt is the most densely populated district in the union territory of jammu and kashmir and the influx of tourists and pilgrims during the prm season which lasts from may to june is responsible for over exploitation of limited water supplies sangra 1987 and pitale 1967 conducted hydrogeological investigations in jammu district between 1974 78 and 1983 respectively and observed deeper groundwater levels in the kandi belt ranging from 2 to 30 m bgl during the prm season furthermore groundwater demand for irrigation has expanded dramatically with a total area irrigated from groundwater of 15 69 km2 cgwb 2011 2012 2018 which is also a significant cause of rapid groundwater depletion in the alluvial aquifer jasrotia et al 2019 the central ground water board cgwb 2011 2012 conducted a short term water supply investigation to gather hydrogeological data and proposed the groundwater development and replenishment of groundwater resources in the jammu and adjoining districts these investigations based on short term monitoring addresses groundwater depletion and identified potential artificial recharge zones as well as suitable artificial recharge sites however these studies did not evaluate for statistical significance of time series data therefore the associated effects of groundwater reductions are ambiguous as a result this is the first time a non parametric analysis and arima model have been employed in this study area to analyse the time series groundwater data and to forecast future groundwater trend and variability the main issue in the siwalik and the kandi belts are the presence of steep slopes boulder beds and a deep water table which causes excessive runoff soil erosion and land degradation as well as an uneven distribution of recharge in space and time jasrotia et al 2019 the study period 2009 2018 includes a prolonged decadal drought that provides an opportunity to investigate groundwater variability in the study area during the dry climatic phase fig 1 a the kandi region s groundwater table is deep and steadily dropping with rapid increases and decreases in response to recharging for the duration of the monsoon season july to october and pumping during the dry season november to june fig 1b specifically our objective were to 1 determine the direction and magnitude of trends in groundwater level trend using mk and sen s slope method and 2 to forecast future groundwater levels using arima modelling in tawi river basin of jammu district india under sustainable groundwater extraction levels it would be assumed that groundwater would respond to seasonal phases i e groundwater levels would fall during dry season and rise during rainy season groundwater levels recovering during wet periods would indicate some resilience of the system to extreme climate variability over long term this research will help to guide future management of the region s groundwater resources and will provide a basis for modelling the impacts of climatic extremes 2 study area tawi river basin at jammu district has geographical area of 631 km2 which is a part of indus river basin and a tributary of chenab river the area situated between latitude 32 55 07 32 45 30 n and longitude 74040 00 75 5 00 e surrounded by rugged mountain range in the north siwalik region and outer plains kandi and sirowal region in the south fig 1c the tawi river is the major drainage line in the study area and is a major source of drinking water to the jammu metropolitan the study area is classified as sub humid to sub tropical with mean annual rainfall is about 1146 mm jasrotia et al 2019 the south west monsoon summer monsoon beings the maximum rainfall in the month of july august and september contributes 80 of total rainfall whereas the winter monsoon december to february constitute about 10 of total rainfall and 5 6 of total rainfall occurs in march to may the temperature peaks up to 45 c in summer and drops to low as 3 c during winter with june and january being the hottest and coldest month respectively of the year temperature rises rapidly after february and drops rapidly after october supplementary fig 1 a and b based on geomorphology the study area is divided into three physiographic regions 1 siwalik region hilly area 2 kandi region and 3 sirowal region the siwalik range is dominated with rugged and strike valley dissected ridge slopes and steep mountains with an area of 56 of the total study area it lies at an altitude between 400 and 900 m above mean sea level amsl and characterised by excessive runoff soil erosion and land degradation the rock type consists of consolidated formation with hard crystalline and compact red sandstone crystalline limestone shale with conglomerates and isolated sand nodules of precambrian age the groundwater occurs as small isolated bodies in the weathered portions or joints or cracks in these rocks however the sand nodules and friable sandstone do possess primary porosity but are not potential aquifers cgwb 2018 in an altitude of 320 440 m amsl the kandi area begins at the foothills of the outermost siwalik and slopes south and south west with high gradients ranging from 1 90 to 1 120 nih 2000 the rock type in this region comprises of semi consolidated rocks mainly comprising of piedmont deposits dominated by gravel with ferruginous clay matrix nih 2000 the water holding capacity of the soils is low the kandi region merges into sirowal formation in the southwest at an altitude less than 320 m amsl with gentle slope 1 250 to 1 300 the alluvial flat topography has unconsolidated rock type of finer and younger alluvium sediment includes vast alluvial tracts flood plains river terraces with shallow groundwater table this region also faces swampy condition due to persistent clay beds occurring close the ground surface the presence of spring line demarcates the contact between the kandi in the north and the sirowal in the south in recent times the spring line has undergone deformation due to decline of water table in the outer plains 3 materials and methods

group infrared precipitation with stations chirps the cgwb provided groundwater level data m bgl for the monitoring wells located in the study area the cgwb measured groundwater levels four times a year in pre monsoon prm season in the month of may monsoon season in the month of august post monsoon pom season in the month of november and receding season in the month of january panda et al 2012 monitoring wells that had just been constructed and had fewer than ten years of observation were omitted for a consistent comparison of trend and variability bore well data from the confined aquifer were excluded the water table records for missing months were also obtained from the nearest meteorological observatory located in water management and research centre at sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology skuast jammu department of public health engineering irrigation and flood control j k government and water resources information system wris india the small quantities of missing data were imputed by removing the seasonal component from the time series first then using the mice package in r finally 30 monitoring wells were chosen for analysing groundwater level variations in the study area during a 120 month period from january 2009 to december 2018 the groundwater data for 120 months is divided into two halves in a 70 30 ratio the first 84 months 2009 2015 were utilised for calibration followed by 36 months 2016 2018 for model validation accuracy and predictability the r statistical language r development team 2007 has been emerged as an important tool for many kind of spatiotemporal analysis of data the mk trend test sen s slope and arima model are accessible in forecast and trend package in r respectively the auto arima function in r selects the finest models for all the wells in the study area on the ground of bayesian information criteria bic and the akaike information criteria aic factors 3 2 climatic phases defined by rainfall anomalies rainfall anomalies are calculated by subtracting the rainfall of a single year month from its all time average year month the yearly average rainfall from 1992 to 2018 was used to compute the rainfall anomaly to account for rainfall lag effects on groundwater levels chen et al 2004 le brocque et al 2018 the rainfall anomaly is transformed to a weighted rainfall anomaly value by adding rainfall anomalies from the previous four years to the current year s rainfall anomalies the following are the weighted rainfall anomaly values for each meteorological station p 5 y r w t d p y i p y i 1 1 y i y i 1 p y i 2 1 y i y i 2 p y i 3 1 y i y i 3 p y i 4 1 y i y i 4 where p 5 y r w t d is the weighted rainfall anomaly over 5 years y i is the year p y i is the yearly rainfall anomaly value for year i and i 1 is the preceding year s rainfall anomaly value the yearly anomalies j accumulated throughout the five recording sites n were then computed as follows t o t 5 y r w t d 1 n i 1 n p i j 5 y r w t d p y i j in this study climatic phases were classified as wet or dry based on the occurrence of two or more severe rainfall anomalies in the 90th percentile or above of long term data wet years were identified as the 1992 2018 anomalies the dry years were defined as rainfall anomalies at or below the 10th percentile of the long term 1992 2018 anomaly this method is used by hundecha and bárdossy 2005 to detect extreme periods in large amounts of climatic data three climatic phases were defined 1992 2000 2001 2006 and 2007 2018 based on a transition from positive to negative anomalies or vice versa with a magnitude of 50 or larger singh et al 2017 observed that the wettest period 1992 2000 is followed by a drying period since 2000 for the north western himalaya the study period recommended in this research is from 2009 to 2018 which corresponds to the dry climatic phase fig 1a 3 3 mann kendall test it is an important nonparametric statistical rank based technique used for determining the spatiotemporal significance of groundwater level changes mann 1945 kendall 1975 when the data is not normally distributed the mk test is highly recommended the mk technique computes kendall statistics s which is a non parametric regression analysis by comparing later measured values with earlier measured values the kendal statistics s is calculated as s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s i g n y j y i where s is for mk records n stands for the quantity of data points and y j and y i stand for the data at time series i and j respectively where j i each data point y i is used as a reference point and the remainder of the data points y j are compared to it such that s i g n y j y i 1 i f y j y i 0 0 i f y j y i 0 1 i f y j y i 0 if s is positive then it suggests an increasing trend whereas if s is negative then it shows a downward tendency over time mann 1945 and kendall 1975 provide more information on the mk test the trend was only taken into account in this study if it was discovered with a statistical significance of 5 using the mk test theil sen technique thiel 1950 sen 1968 also known as sen s slope was used to compute the trend magnitude the median of the slopes

total number of observations 3 4 arima model the arima model is one of the most popular and commonly used time series forecasting and modelling methods box and jenkins 1976 the model is written as arima p d q with p d and r representing autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma correspondingly box and jenkins 1976 data from rainfall and groundwater levels were used to model and predict rainfall and groundwater levels throughout time box and jenkins 1976 have further information and explanations on the arima equations for a certain temporal series yt can be expressed as gibrilla et al 2018 y t y 1 y 2 y 3 y t where y1 y2 y3 are observations at time t1 t2 t3 the ar component illustrates how the current and prior p observations are related if p 1 every data would be a dependent of only one previous data as indicated in the diagram below y t c φ 1 y t 1 e t if p 1 the equation becomes y t c φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p e t where yt yt 1 are the observed values for both the time t t 1 respectively et is error at time t c and φ are constant the integrated i part determines either to simulate the observation data or model fluctuations between subsequent observations for example if d 0 then data are simulated directly differences between successive data are simulated if d 1 in practise though d might be either 1 or 2 the dickey and fuller 1979 have elaborated on the purpose of differencing which is to render the time series stationary the ma component determines the connection between the observation and the prior q error similarly when q 1 then each event is determined by a single prior error i e y t c θ e t 1 e t here c is a constant et denotes the random sampling errors at time t whereas et 1 is the preceding random error at t 1 the arima time series modelling approach is divided into four steps a model identification where the temporal datasets are examined for stationary and normalcy this is done by using suitable differencing and transformation of series autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function which are denoted by acf and pacf respectively were used to determine the dataset for its seasonality and stationary nature b parameter estimation was determined from stationary data or the differenced data for non stationary series the proper order for differencing is when the acf plot decays rapidly to zero the acf and pacf provide an indication of the preliminary order for the arima model s moving average ma and autoregressive ar by comparison between the stationary data of acf pacf a preliminary model is chosen whereas p d q are calculated using maximum likelihood technique in the second stage a variety of possibilities close to the potential model were created in a random sequence aic and bic indicate improved model performance c diagnostic checking of the residuals is used to verify the model s appropriateness the robustness of a fitted model is indicated via residual analysis the residual should function as white noise in the well model random the residuals of acf and pacf were used as standard assessment criteria for arima model for regularly distributed residuals all acf and pacf spikes should fall inside the threshold values hence the process is repeated with new model until all the spike of acf and pacf lies within the threshold values d forecasting is the last stage is used to selected model with the lowest acf and pacf for each site to calculate the fitted and predicted values of groundwater anomalies root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 mean absolute percentage error mape maximum absolute percentage error max ape mean absolute error mae maximum absolute percentage error maxape maximum absolute error maxae and ljung box q statistics are the goodness of fit criteria used to judge the performance of the models patle et al 2013 the observed and anticipated outcomes were compared in selecting the suitable forecasting model 4 results 4 1 groundwater level fluctuations the mean monthly rainfall as well as groundwater level on spatial scale for siwalik kandi and sirowal throughout the prm and pom seasons were shown in fig 2 furthermore substantial connections between mean rainfall and mean pom groundwater level were identified for the three physiographic zones as evidenced by the high correlation coefficient r r1 however the correlation between groundwater level during prm and rainfall was observed to be weak for these three regions for that particular year because it is influenced by previous year s monsoon rainfall and anthropogenic factors leading to groundwater abstraction furthermore rising high temperatures and low rainfall supplementary fig 1b throughout the summer are expected to have an impact on groundwater levels during prm season the correlation between rainfall with prm and pom groundwater level in kandi region r1 0 37 and r 0 55 sirowal region r1 0 44 r 0 61 and siwalik region r1 0 52 r 0 57 found to be comparatively weak fig 2 a b and c pearson s correlation coefficient r was used for all correlation tests and correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 however for brevity the prm and pom groundwater levels were calculated by averaging the groundwater levels in the respective physiographic zones which represents the region s local water table dynamics during prm the groundwater levels below the ground surface are normally the lowest while the pom the groundwater levels are the highest the average groundwater level from 2009 to 2018 shows a steep decline in all the three regions both in prm and pom seasons with the maximum groundwater level declined shown in kandi region for example in 2009 the mean overall prm groundwater levels in siwalik kandi and sirowal were 4 53 9 72 and 3 76 m bgl respectively while in 2018 they were 6 31 18 91 and 5 34 m bgl respectively during pom season it is observed that the average groundwater level in siwalik kandi and sirowal were declined from 3 94 8 67 and 3 35 m bgl in the year 2009 to 4 97 15 71 and 4 86 m bgl respectively by 2018 fig 2 4 2 groundwater level tends 4 2 1 time series decomposition to evaluate the trend and fluctuation of groundwater level in our study aquifer we examined data from a representative piezometer from 2009 to 2018 using moving averages the temporal series was decomposed into random seasonal trend and observed components the trend component of the decomposed time series for well 12 exhibited a declining trend ranging across 25 m in depth that dropped constantly between 2016 and 2018 with steady seasonality over time fig 3 the amplitude of the oscillatory seasonal component is about 3 m the estimated seasonal factor showing a peak of groundwater levels in prm and a trough in the pom the residual component varies between 1 m the trend is the largest integral component followed by residual and seasonality components this test s low p value 2 2e 16 demonstrates statistically significant trend in the data as confirmed by the mk test tabari and marofi 2011 furthermore the raw time series data were examined for non stationarity to ensure that the data was not random the time series of groundwater data suggested a non stationary as the null hypothesis of all the wells were accepted with p 0 05 at 95 confidence level according to the dickey fuller adf test trend in groundwater for each monitoring well for three physiographic regions within the climatic phase of seasonal prm and pom and annual 2009 2018 time series data were calculated using mk and sen s slope statistics table 1 and table 2 show the statistical test results on the seasonal and full period applying mk z and sen s slope q of groundwater levels for each well there was a slight reduction in rainfall with an average z value of 0 26 0 30 0 36 for kandi sirowal and siwalik regions respectively which had no significant trend these analyses identified significant negative or positive trend or no trend at p 0 05 for each monitoring wells and therefore the well responses were classified into three categories a positive trend signifies declining groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface while b negative trend signifies increase in groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface c no trend means stable groundwater levels over time relative to the ground surface 4 2 2 annual trends 2009 2018 the overall net response across the entire time period 2009 2018 for groundwater monitoring wells for the entire study area was a significant decline in the water table fig 4 a p 0 05 with an average rate of decline corresponds to 0 04 m yr the depth change of all monitoring wells is used to calculate this average across the entire study area 63 6 of total wells exhibited positive trend groundwater decline as against 20 improvement p 0 05 and 16 6 exhibited no significant trend p 0 05 the steepest slope was found in kandi belt for well 12 and 21 showed significant declines in the groundwater level with mean rate of decline of 0 12 and 0 1 m year respectively table 2 the major reason for the decline in groundwater levels is probably increase in urbanization and industrial growth mainly in jammu city of kandi belt for a decade cgwb 2018 few positive trend water table decline were observed in siwalik region that were mostly concentrated in north and northeast of the study area although location specific improve are observed in few wells 4 wells out of 19 with well no 4 showed significant groundwater level improvement over the years fig 4a and table 2 this is due to irrigation return and proximity of well at the tributaries of tawi however 73 6 wells in siwalik exhibits decline in groundwater levels fig 4a with maximum decline observed in northern part of the study area at a mean decline rate ranging from 0 0066 to 0 011 m yr on an average the overall reduction of groundwater levels in siwalik region is 0 02 m yr whereas the overall water table in sirowal region situated in the downstream of tawi river were stable and marginally declining at the rate of 0 002 0 006 m yr this can be due to the local factor such as recharge from irrigation shallow water table swampy conditions and presence of spring and artesian wells 4 2 3 seasonal trends the statistical analysis revealed that there was a downward trend in groundwater levels at the 95 significance level throughout the study area with an overall reduction of groundwater levels of 0 71 and 0 61 m yr in the prm and pom seasons respectively for the whole study area z values for prm and pom water table ranged from 3 21 to 1 78 and 2 68 to 1 34 respectively table 2 during prm season 66 6 of 30 monitoring wells showed a positive trend decline in groundwater levels compared to 53 percent in the pom season whereas improvement of groundwater levels in prm is 20 as against 26 6 in pom season p 0 05 however 13 and 20 of the wells demonstrate no significant trend in prm and pom season respectively p 0 05 strong seasonal positive trends were observed in kandi region fig 4 b and c declining at the rate of 1 1 and 0 85 m yr in prm and pom season respectively the steepest slopes that were observed for three wells 12 21 and 13 were located in the kandi region with an average overall decline in groundwater level of 1 44 and 1 08 m yr in prm and pom season respectively table 1 among these three wells well no 12 observed the first largest groundwater level decline at the rate of 1 693 and 1 325 m yr for prm and pom season respectively while well 21 have second largest groundwater level decline at the rate of 1 443 and 1 328 m yr in prm and pom season respectively whereas well 13 recorded third highest water table decline at the rate of 1 05 and 0 56 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 2 on the other hand the declining groundwater levels were observed in north and north east part of the for siwalik region with an average overall decline of groundwater levels of 0 47 and 0 75 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 1 although location specific positive or negative trends were observed in groundwater level during prm and pom season for example well 5 14 20 and 26 showed groundwater levels generally declined in prm fig 4a however improved in pom season fig 4b groundwater levels for well 4 and 18 situated at the tributaries of tawi in siwalik region improved gradually for both prm and pom at rate of 1 788 and 0 0429 m yr and 0 305 and 0 09 m yr respectively table 2 this may be due to some local factor such as sparse population and increase in irrigation activities may have affected its behaviour the statistical test detected a significant positive trend observed in 80 of wells in the kandi region and 78 of wells in the siwalik region during prm however 52 and 60 of wells in the siwalik and kandi regions detected significant positive trend during pom on the seasonal scale both the mk and sen s slope estimator have shown rising seasonal trends in the kandi and siwalik regions in prm and pom seasons except in the sirowal region which showed a declining seasonal trend in prm seasons results indicated that 66 of the wells in the sirowal region detected negative trend demonstrating an increase in the groundwater levels at the rate of 0 05 and 0 08 m yr during prm and pom seasons respectively table 1 it is observed that groundwater levels in well 9 and 19 improved significantly in both the seasons fig 4a and b due to aquifer recharge from irrigation return flows in this location 4 2 4 model selection and future predictions before performing any further analysis on time series data the stationarity of the data should be checked to assess the stationarity of rainfall and groundwater level data acf and pacf correlograms were shown for the kandi region fig 5 a and b and supplementary material supplementary fig 2 for the siwalik and the sirowal regions the dashed lines above and below the x axis reflect the margins for computing acf and pacf values at a 95 confidence level the lagged time steps are shown on the x axis while the correlation values for the corresponding delays are shown on the y axis the acf and pacf for rainfall and groundwater levels are demonstrated in fig 5 before differencing there are spikes above the confidence bounds in each figure after differencing the majority of the spikes are below confidence limits indicating stationary series as indicated in fig 5 the order of p and q for creating preliminary arima models for groundwater level time series was determined on acf and pacf plots 4 2 5 model validation and residuals analysis the selected models were then tested by comparing observed and fitted water table data from the years 2009 2018 all of the model evaluation variables rmse mape mae maxape and maxae were well within reasonable limits supplementary table 1 fig 6 a b c shows the residuals of acf and pacf of arima 4 1 0 0 1 1 12 for groundwater level in kandi region whereas sirowal and siwalik are provided in the supplementary material supplementary fig 3 and 4 the acf and pacf spikes are all within the 95 percent confidence level indicating that residuals are random in fig 6c the residuals plot autocorrelation of residuals and ljung box p values for the 20 lags are displayed the residuals of the models are separately distributed and all of the lags are below the threshold suggesting that there is no autocorrelation between them implying that the model is good for execution similarly residuals of acf and pacf of arima 1 1 0 0 1 1 12 model for rainfall are presented in fig 7 a b and c indicating that the model s residuals are independently distributed and that all lags are below the threshold justifies as a good model 4 2 6 groundwater levels prediction the time series of arima model simulations of rainfall along with observed and predicted groundwater levels shown in fig 8 and supplementary material supplementary fig 5 6 gentle decline in annual rainfall with an average reduction of 0 303 0 327 0 445 mm yr for kandi sirowal and siwalik regions respectively with no significant trend were observed the model calibrated period 2009 2015 illustrates the periodicity of observed groundwater level the arima model fitted close to observed groundwater level in the validation period 2016 2018 with a few exceptions the model appears to have captured the most of the peaks the exceptions are due to the stochastic model s inclusion of a randomness component on a seasonal scale groundwater levels in kandi s have been steadily declining since 2018 it is predicted that in the year 2025 groundwater levels in the kandi area will be 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom season respectively which is 9 46 m and 9 38 m lower than they were in 2018 for prm and pom respectively fig 8c and d the average rate of water table decline in this location for prm and pom is expected to be about 1 35 and 1 32 m yr respectively in the sirowal area the observed and simulated groundwater levels revealed a fairly consistent trend supplementary fig 5b it is predicted that in the year 2025 the prm and pom groundwater levels would decline by 1 35 and 0 09 m over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 5 9 and 3 5 m bgl at the average rate of about 0 22 and 1 45 m yr for prm and pom season respectively supplementary fig 5c and d while the forecasted results for siwalik region supplementary fig 6 c and d showed significant groundwater levels decline by 9 02 and 6 72 m over the observed values in 2018 to reach a level of 16 91 and 11 84 m bgl at an average rate of 0 91 and 0 52 m yr for prm pom respectively by 2025 studies by gibrilla et al 2018 observed a significant groundwater levels decline to about 12 m by 2020 with an average rate of decline of about 1 008 m yr in volta river basin of ghana patle et al 2013 forecasted groundwater levels decline to about 12 97 m and 12 m over the observed value in 2010 by 2050 in karnal district of indo gangetic plains 5 discussion the siwalik range is hilly and mountainous accounts for higher runoff resulting in varying degree of recharge to the groundwater the entire kandi belt of jammu region witnessed gradual depletion in groundwater resource over the years cgwb 2011 river bed material mining is prevalent in the higher altitude resulting in decreased recharge and increased runoff cgwb 2018 in the jammu region s kandi belt there are roughly 300 ponds that serve as recharge structures these ponds have been underutilised and even encroached upon and their inlets have been disrupted due to the distribution of piped water supplies some ponds are being filled by tube wells erected nearby placing stress on aquifers on contrary sirowal region has shallow groundwater table with marshy condition ideal to support agriculture during the dry climatic period this study examines the stochastic behaviour of groundwater time series data from thirty monitoring wells in the tawi river basin in jammu overall we observed that average groundwater levels declined by 0 04 m yr over the tawi basin during the study period and that groundwater recovery in wet periods was inadequate to offset decline in dry periods in this study we have observed the influence of monsoonal rainfall on the groundwater levels trend in the study area to be comparatively weak for prm and pom fig 2 studies by le brocque et al 2018 concluded that the trends between climatic phases showed groundwater level recovery during wet phases was insufficient to offset the decline in groundwater level from the previous dry phase in southern queensland australia the statistical results of the mk and sen s slope tests concluded that widespread groundwater levels declined for 66 6 and 53 of the wells in the prm and pom seasons respectively the majority of wells with significant positive trend occurred in prm tabari et al 2012 panda et al 2012 patle et al 2013 studies by panda et al 2012 observed that 58 of 555 monitoring wells showed decline in groundwater levels during prm with an overall rate of decline of 0 11 m yr in gujarat and kutch region in our study area the highest numbers of wells with significant positive trend were located in the kandi and northwest part of siwalik regions irrespective of seasons the detailed statistics of sen s slope indicated that 80 of the wells in kandi and 78 of wells in siwalik regions experienced significant positive trend decline p 0 05 in prm groundwater levels with an average overall decline of 1 44 and 0 47 m yr respectively as against 1 08 and 0 758 m yr in pom groundwater level if current levels of exploitation continue groundwater levels in the kandi region are expected to reach 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in prm and pom respectively in 2025 on contrary groundwater levels improved moderately in sirowal with mean increases of 0 05 m yr and 0 08 m yr in prm and pom respectively table 1 mainly due to irrigation return and shallow depth of the groundwater table allowing groundwater to be discharged through springs and free flow artesian tube wells built for irrigation due to absence of electricity and infrastructures the large volumes of groundwater emerging from artesian tube wells flows towards pakistan perhaps these artesian flows can be channelized and diverted to drought prone areas of the kandi region that are affected by severe groundwater declining trend over the decades appropriate soil and water conservation measures and site specific artificial recharge is needed to address the drought and declining groundwater levels in the present scenarios for better future 6 conclusion using non parametric statistical approaches we attempted to detect and quantify groundwater level changes as well as pinpoint sites that are susceptible owing to anthropogenic strain on groundwater resources furthermore the trend quantification result has been utilised to forecast future groundwater levels over the course of study period we observed that the average groundwater level declined by 0 04 m yr throughout the tawi basin and that during the wet season groundwater recovery from the monsoon was not enough to make up for the reduction during the prm season the proportion of declining of groundwater levels in the wells during prm were much greater than rising recovering groundwater levels in the following pom season under climate change severe drought events are expected to become more often csiro and bureau of meteorology 2015 this trend might worsen resulting in even greater decline and less recovery than we have observed so far furthermore results indicated that at 95 percent level of significance the statistical analysis of mk test shows a downward trend in groundwater levels throughout the study region sen s slope estimator revealed a fall in groundwater level in 66 6 of wells and an improvement in just 20 of 30 monitoring wells on a seasonal basis in the pom season 53 of the wells showed declined in the groundwater level and 26 6 of the wells showed improved in the water table whereas 20 of wells witnessed no significant trend the value of sen s slope varied from 1 693 to 0 305 m yr with a mean value of 0 210 m yr for prm groundwater trend similarly the value of sen s slope varied from 1 328 to 0 138 m yr with a mean value of 0 193 m yr for pom groundwater level across the basin the overall net response for groundwater monitoring wells in the study area for the entire time period 2009 2018 observed a considerable decline in groundwater levels with an average overall decrease of 0 71 and 0 61 m yr in prm and pom seasons respectively we conclude that there is evidence of a considerable net reduction in groundwater levels in the important kandi region of the tawi basin in jammu between 2009 and 2018 compared to siwalik and sirowal regions strong seasonal positive trends were seen in the kandi region with prm and pom seasons declining at rates of 1 1 and 0 85 m yr respectively groundwater levels in kandi s have been continuously dropping on a seasonal scale since 2018 and are expected to reach 27 82 and 24 38 m bgl in the prm and pom seasons respectively by 2025 which is 9 46 m and 9 38 m lower than they were in 2018 whereas the simulated forecasted results for siwalik region in the year 2025 showed a significant groundwater level decline that will be predicted to reach a level of 16 91 and 11 84 m bgl in prm and pom season respectively conversely majority of the wells in the sirowal area revealed a pretty consistent trend in both the observed and simulated groundwater levels analysis of groundwater trends in prm and pom seasons demonstrates that recharging during monsoon period does not account for groundwater decline during a prolonged drought groundwater levels might drop to dangerously low levels the decline in water table level is mostly due to excessive groundwater pumping that exceeds the groundwater recharge rate rather than a decrease in recharge rate caused by rainfall groundwater management practises must be explored to secure future water availability in the study area upon simulating actual groundwater records and projecting the future groundwater situation of the study area the arima model produced encouraging results which might be useful for groundwater conservation

dietary intake rate of as through drinking water for the exposed children was observed as 17 5 μg kg bw day greater than apparently control group of children 0 2 μg kg bw day biological samples such as urine hair and nail for the exposed children showed higher accumulation of as 159 μg l 3320 μg kg and 4460 μg kg compared to controlled children 1 92 μg l 195 μg kg and 331 μg kg arsenic toxicity can eventually lead to future cancer risk which is sub clinically manifested through biological samples along with formation of micronuclei in urine epithelial cells of the affected children notably according to unpaired t test the detected numbers of micronuclei were significantly higher in the urine epithelial cells of exposed school children 3 25 1000 epithelial cells compared to the control children 0 52 1000 epithelial cells severity adjusted margin of exposure samoe value also corresponds to the huge amount of risk class 5 through drinking water consumption rice grain samples from households and mid day meal samples also fall under the category of class 4 in exposed area during the risk thermometer study the average future cancer risk to the school children from the exposed area was found to be 1 10 3 0 4 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 whilst the control group belongs to an apparently lower cancer risk zone such as 0 016 10 3 0 4 10 3 and 0 012 10 3 during the intake of domestic tube well water rice grain and school tube well water respectively simultaneously non cancer risk from drinking water is much lower in control children however rice grain poses similar amount of risk for both groups 0 3 2 2 hence corrective measures are required for the management of contaminated water along with cooking malpractices graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic school children dietary

on public health is a recurrent worldwide problem nowadays chakraborty et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2000 kumar et al 2020 shaji et al 2021 the gangetic delta basin covering india and bangladesh has witnessed such suffering from as toxicity since long chakraborti et al 2009 2013 international agency for research on cancer iarc and agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr have addressed arsenic as a group i carcinogen which can cause malignancy in lung bladder and kidneys because of its chronic exposure atsdr 2007 iarc 2004 2012 people from the exposed area are using shallow tube well water for drinking purposes even after knowing its as concentration due to the poor infrastructure and inadequate knowledge deeper tube wells are installed without checking as contamination due to the ignorance of the governing bodies kippler et al 2016 besides contaminated drinking water as contaminated rice grain is another concern to the population of exposed areas as rice is cultivated with contaminated groundwater chowdhury et al 2018a das et al 2021b thus with time as load has increased by entering into the food chain via daily diet joardar et al 2021b roychowdhury et al 2002 roychowdhury 2008 numerous cancerous and non cancerous diseases are linked to regular dietary ingestion of as by drinking water most important non cancerous health problems include cardio vascular diseases skin lesions neurological disorders and diabetes mellitus along with hypertension tseng 2007 in case of school going children the severe impact of as tainted drinking water is a subject of immense concern in as exposed areas at present ahmed et al 2022 baig et al 2016 joardar et al 2021a in contrast to skin lesions and pigmentation of various forms that display within 5 10 years of as exposure ingestion for a longer period of time can give rise to more severe conditions like cancer and neurological disorders mazumder 2007 also even in a low dose long term as poisoning can hamper neurobehavioral activities in children which can be reflected through their impaired intellect memory pattern inattentiveness loss of focus and preparedness kumar et al 2019 arsenic exposure is concomitant with neurological disorders at the early phase of an individual s life tyler and allan 2014 studies also showed that how drinking water has enforced a severe public health concern on the maturity mortality along with brain development of kids rahman et al 2013 wasserman et al 2016 despite there being no direct relation between as and dna it was shown that as can persuade dna break in numerous test systems rossman 2003 in vitro assays showed chromosomal changes sister chromatid interactions and micronuclei configuration induced by as in mammalian cells with positive clastogenic impacts gonsebatt et al 1997 as diagnosing as toxicity among children is a difficult task due to absence of arsenical symptoms evaluation of genetic damage can be performed chatterjee et al 2018 observed significantly higher micronucleus frequency in the buccal mucosa urothelial cells and lymphocytes cells of the as exposed children than the unexposed ones in early childhood as toxicity is proved in influencing the length of telomere chatterjee et al 2018 farzan et al 2021 there are limited works for as risk appraisal related to dna damage in children of the as exposed areas also there are inadequate reports on rice grain as toxicity over the children from both as contaminated and non contaminated areas therefore the present study determines the extent of acute and chronic as contamination in children as well as their future health risk as they experience sub clinical toxicity the current study highlights the collective daily as exposure in the studied school children of as exposed and apparently control areas through drinking water and rice grain apart from the comprehensive approach of accrual of as in the biological samples of the children living in as exposed and control areas the study emphasizes on the cytogenic effects of as in children through micronuclei formation in urine epithelial cells 2 methodology 2 1 choosing the cohort for the study this study population includes school goers from as exposed and apparently control sites of west bengal india the school children were selected randomly from each class standard i vi according to their age 5 12 years chak kamardanga free primary school located in basirhat 1 block barasat sadar sub division of north 24 parganas west bengal was selected as the exposed site in this study fig 1 basirhat i one of the endemic as contaminated zones in west bengal is located on the bank of ichamati river rahman et al 2003 roychowdhury 2010 talukdar et al 2009 in contrast the apparently control set of children unexposed to as were selected from tiljala brojonath tiwari school located in the central part of kolkata district fig 1 kolkata district was recognized as a partially control area according to groundwater as status especially groundwater in southern part of the city was reported as as contaminated according to the previous reports biswas et al 2019 chakraborti et al 2017 pal et al 2009 however a major part of kolkata population gets the benefit of as free water at domestic level through pipe line supply treated water ganges water by kmc kolkata municipal corporation for

collection storage and processing have been represented in our previous publications chowdhury et al 2018a 2018b b joardar et al 2021a 2021b roychowdhury 2008 the biological samples scalp hair nail and urine have been collected from the school goers of both the studied areas the first void urine samples collected in 100 ml sterile containers were transported to laboratory after placing them in a cooled ice box and preserved them at 20 c until further analysis the urine samples were processed for quantification of total as and micronucleus assay of urine epithelial cells micronucleus assay does not require any filtration rather it requires fast processing after collecting the urine first void urines were preferred because they were likely to have a greater amount of exfoliated cells biggs et al 1997 particulars regarding the sample collection maintenance processing and digestion processes of biological samples were mentioned in our prior reported works joardar et al 2021a 2021b

time of analysis the as level in standard reference material srm was checked by both types of digestion teflon bomb and hot plate methods the srm used in this entire work were rice flour 1568a nbs gaithersburg md usa and human hair erm db001 european commission jrc irmm retieseweg geel belgium respectively the as recovery percentages of rice flour and human hair were 96 and 102 during teflon bomb digestion and 86 and 83 at the time of hot plate digestion method correspondingly against their certified values of 0 29 μg g and 0 044 μg g respectively quality control and quality assurance experiments were also evaluated by analyzing duplicates and calculating the recovery after spiking as concentration in digested sample chowdhury et al 2020a 2020b b joardar et al 2021a 2021b 2 8 statistical analysis to evaluate the correlation and dependence between the input and output mechanism of as various statistical measures like histogram plot regression analysis and two tailed unpaired t test were displayed in association with excel microsoft office and graph pad prism 8 the two tailed unpaired t test has been performed to elucidate the effect of as on the formation of micronucleus in the exfoliated cells of urine 2 9 data analysis regular dietary exposure intake rate of total as content μg by drinking water and other food items rice grain and vegetables was

the methodical evaluation of as toxicity has hindered epidemiological study on probable variations in disease vulnerability and the difficulty of as metabolism therefore an as induced health risk appraisal is performed on school goers of differently exposed areas risk thermometer is a mathematical tool to evaluate the effect of any toxic element upon human health this helps the community to become aware of the consumption of toxic components directly or indirectly so the risk thermometer has been used for measuring as toxicity of school water domestic water rice grain of both the exposed and apparently control children and the calculations according to the severity adjusted margin of exposure samoe value of each part chowdhury et al 2020a 3 s a m o e t d i a f b m r x a f x s f x e

entire calculation of carcinogenic hazard appraisal of the children has been done using the general formulas of usepa 2001 joardar et al 2021a mentioned that extensive use of as contaminated drinking water can push the exposed population towards future carcinogenic hazard to determine the carcinogenic hazard the foremost evaluation is average daily dose add for each child from both the studied

2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic contamination scenario in groundwater of basirhat i block thirty five tube well water samples were collected from the studied area to identify the present condition of as contamination in the region fig 2 a distribution of the varied number of groundwater sources tube wells according to the diverse as concentration range was shown in fig 2b arsenic levels in the collected groundwater samples ranged 3 700 μg l with an average concentration of 151 μg l only one groundwater sample was found to have as level within the tolerable boundary in drinking water 10 μg l which seems to be quite an alarming situation considering the levels of as ingested by the locals who 2011 that means the inhabitants in the studied area were using as contaminated groundwater for drinking purpose due to inadequate availability of as safe drinking water the rural people are bound to use contaminated groundwater for their routine requirements along with agricultural purposes biswas et al 2019 roychowdhury 2008 among 35 samples 16 have been in the range of 10 50 μg l and 14 samples contained 50 350 μg l of as on the other hand tube well samples n 4 from premises of different schools too were found to be highly as contaminated mean 578 108 μg l range 475 700 μg l fig 2a basirhat i block showed a varied range of as concentration in groundwater with respect to its iron concentration and depth range the spearman correlation revealed that both as and iron concentrations are negatively correlated with depth i e r 0 33 and 0 46 respectively where p 0 05 supplementary table s1 with increasing depth the concentration of both iron and as declined these findings indicate that the possibility of as contamination is higher in shallow hand tube wells compared to deep tube wells chowdhury et al 1999 in their study found that as concentration in groundwater enhanced up to a definite depth and then reduced with increase of the depth in bengal delta meanwhile as concentration is found to be positively correlated with iron concentration in the studied groundwater supplementary table s1 so according to inverse depth range both the contaminants increased gradually as they shared a strong positive correlation r 0 60 p 0 01 supplementary table s1 3 1 1 arsenic contamination status in drinking water of the local schools in the studied area occurrence of elevated level of as has been observed in tube well water samples collected from various schools in the studied area fig 2a the present study has been performed considering evaluation of future health risk for children of one of the surveyed schools named chak kamardanga free primary school where school tube well water showed a mean as concentration of 500 10 μg l fig 2a simultaneously drinking water consumed by the school children from kolkata district has been examined in view of kolkata as an apparently control set water samples have been collected from different existing sources i e kmc kolkata municipality corporation supplied water and through water purifier installed at the school premises of tiljala brojonath high school for as analysis all the collected samples displayed a concentration of 3 μg l which is much lower than the acceptable concentration of as in drinking water 10 μg l 3 1 2 arsenic exposure in drinking water of the households of studied school children children with chronic contact by prolonged consumption of as tainted school tube well water and domestic tube well water are posed with major health risks the water samples n 43 collected from the households show as concentration in the range of 3 780 μg l with a mean concentration of 184 171 μg l about 7 of the samples were in the category of safe i e 10 μg l while 30 samples were in a range that has been 10 times greater than the permissible concentration another 30 of the samples ranged 100 200 μg l of as and remaining 33 samples were at stake as they had concentration 200 μg l the children in this study used the contaminated drinking water since birth from their household shallow tube wells having depth range 6 06 24 2 m arsenic concentration has been found positively correlated with iron concentration r2 0 4067 p 0 005 n 43 supplementary fig s1a the mean concentration of iron in the mentioned groundwater samples was found as 6 71 4 57 mg l range 0 16 19 5 mg l subsequently the household drinking water samples n 19 collected from the school goers of tiljala brojonath high school located in apparently control kolkata district displayed the mean as and iron concentration of 1 1 0 62 μg l range 0 25 2 14 μg l and 0 81 0 72 mg l range 0 1 2 1 mg l correspondingly both the contaminants were found positively associated with each other r2 0 5037 p 0 005 supplementary fig s1b the situation implicates on the fact that the control school children in this study were drinking as safe water it was reported earlier that as status in the drinking water of kolkata urbanites is safe because they have access to safe drinking water from kolkata municipal corporation biswas et al 2019 3 2 status of as exposure in rice grain people depending on a diet mainly consists of parboiled rice grain which contains considerable higher amounts of as compared to sunned rice grain due to the contaminated water involved at the time of post harvesting in the as affected area chowdhury et al 2018b rice grain samples n 47 collected from the house of children of contaminated area displayed as level in the range of 94 410 μg kg with a mean value of 196 67 μg kg which is greater than the suggested concentration i e 100 μg kg for exposed areas according to alarp as low as reasonably practicable principle the as inorganic concentration of 100 μg kg has shown lower amount of future risks in as contaminated areas for the consumption of rice grain meharg et al 2006 correspondingly the rice grain samples n 37 from apparently control area kolkata depicted an as level in the range of 70 284 μg kg mean value 146 45 μg kg according to the codex alimentarius commission 2017 the maximum concentration of ias in polished rice is 200 μg kg it has been already reported that as the process of ias estimation is expensive and needs progressive analytical technology so codex has decided to use total concentration of as as a method to decrease ias exposure and protect consumer health hensawang and chanpiwat 2017 3 3 regular dietary exposure of as in both the studied school children regular dietary exposure intake rate of as through drinking water rice grain including mid day meal to the school goers of contaminated area and exposure from drinking water and rice grain to the school children of apparently control area are depicted in table 1 the total as consumption by drinking water rice grain along with mid day meal in the daily diet of school goers belonging to the contaminated area is much higher than the children belonging to the apparently control area kolkata in this study the children of exposed area consumed 658 μg of as through daily diet whereas the children of apparently control area consumed 61 5 μg of as through daily diet per day table 1 these results indicate a serious health threat to the children of exposed area compared to the apparently control or uncontaminated area drinking water is solely responsible for a huge load of as in the school children of exposed area as the daily dietary intake rate value is 17 5 μg kg body wt day supplementary table s2 on contrary the same for apparently control area is 0 2 μg kg body wt day of as rice grain itself contributed 2 8 domestic source along with mid day meal and 1 8 μg kg body wt day of as to the children of both contaminated and uncontaminated area respectively biswas et al 2019 said that people from apparently control zone like kolkata are not entirely exempted from as contamination threats in the long run because they consume rice grain cultivated in the contaminated areas the observed value of as intake rate of exposed children in this study is greater than the recommended upper tolerable acceptable daily intake value of as 3 0 μg kg body wt day who 2011 3 4 acute as burden in differently exposed studied population urinary as concentration is known as a fine determining factor for current as burden and it has been used in several environmental social and industrial studies of people acutely exposed to this metalloid warner et al 1994 urine is the primary path of release for the majority arsenical species buchet et al 1981 vahter 1994 metabolized inorganic as ias forms two methylated derivatives monomethylarsonate mma and dimethylarsenate dma that excretes through urine together with an un methylated part of inorganic as aposhian 1997 researchers have confirmed that dma is mainly released through urine and generally elevated levels of ias are retained in epithelial tissues aposhian 1997 urine samples n 50 collected from the exposed school children depicted a mean as value of 159 126 μg l range 13 539 μg l simultaneously collected urine samples n 36 from apparently control school children exhibited a mean as concentration of 1 92 1 56 μg l ranging from 0 02 to 6 7 μg l table 2 a considerable positive association r2 0 66 was found among drinking water and urinary as concentration of exposed school children n 19 fig 3 a on contrary a positive correlation r2 0 4963 was also found among the apparently control children n 19 fig 3b hence this comparative study indicates that the presence of urinary as is directly proportional to the drinking water as concentration for both the population from two differently contaminated areas thus the chak kamardanga free primary school population is more susceptible compared to the kolkata school goers as they had a noticeable amount of as in their urine due to ingestion of tainted drinking water and rice grain for a long period on the other hand children from the control site are apparently in a safer zone as they drink treated drinking water which is free from as contamination 3 5 chronic as burden on the population of exposed and control area in toxicology hair and nail are the finest possible bio indicators of chronic as burden samanta et al 2004 the robust arrangement of hair helps it to endure undesirable environmental conditions and its physical and chemical attributes biological configuration and growth rate make it advantageous as a biomarker wilson 2005 in a toxic environment the hair as measurement is a longitudinal time resolved signal for chronic exposure kempson and henry 2010 according to hopps 1977 nails grow gradually with time 0 75 mm month and trace element dimensions from nail clippings reveal internal exposure depending on the length of nail various studies have shed light on the calculated as levels in toe nails that remain relatively invariable over the span of 6 years garland et al 1993 karagas et al 2001 the keratin of hair fiber mainly contains large amount of thiol groups in their cysteine residues that can easily interact with as and as a result hair shows a higher amount of as than any other biological tissue paswan 2012 yanez et al 2005 in this study the mean as level in hair and nail from chak kamardanga school goers n 45 was found to be 3320 2900 μg kg range 760 16 900 μg kg and 4460 2600 μg kg 1300 17 100 μg kg respectively table 2 simultaneously hair n 28 and nail n 33 samples have been also gathered from kolkata population mean as concentration in hair and nail samples of mentioned population was found to be 195 176 μg kg range 30 680 μg kg and 331 223 μg kg range 20 810 μg kg correspondingly the permissible limit of as in hair and nail samples are 80 250 μg kg and 430 1080 μg kg correspondingly arnold et al 1990 ioanid et al 1961 from the regression study a noteworthy positive association has been found between water hair r2 0 7787 n 25 and water nail r2 0 5964 n 29 of exposed population respectively fig 4 a and b whereas for the apparently control population a moderate positive correlation has been obtained between water hair r2 0 3767 n 20 and water nail r2 0 3139 n 23 respectively fig 4c and d joardar et al 2021a reported in their study about the considerable quantity of as deposition in hair and nail samples from the school children of gaighata block another as endemic block of west bengal and the chronic exposure was also directly proportional with water as concentration so the ongoing work provides insightful and concrete evidence that the children from the as exposed area have been chronically pre disposed to as over a substantial time period 3 6 micronucleus assay in urine epithelial cells for exposed and apparently control children a visible as concentration in biological samples of affected population indicates a cumulative exposure to as for an extensive period of time this study shows the adverse health impact on school children through chronic as intake throughout their growing period previous studies reported that the prolonged exposure of as resulted in chromosomal aberrations ostrosky wegman et al 1991 sister chromatid exchanges hsu et al 1997 and micronuclei development banerjee et al 2013 dulout et al 1996 in exposed populations apart from contaminated drinking water as contaminated rice grain also has a significant deleterious effect on the presence of micronuclei in chronically exposed inhabitants banerjee et al 2013 notably enhanced rates of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei development have been mostly found in exfoliated cells of oral mucosa and urinary bladder biggs et al 1997 considering the scenario of as exposure via drinking water and rice grain of non symptomatic exposed children bio monitoring the cytogenic effect is required exfoliated epithelial cells were conventionally used for identification of cancer and for the bio monitoring of genetic impacts on human guzmán et al 2003 the frequencies of micronuclei in exfoliated cells of urinary bladder help as a suitable guide to examine the adverse genotoxicity the occurrence of these phenomena is induced by long term as exposure since these cells are in straight communication with the multisite carcinogen smith et al 1993 during cell mitosis micronuclei are formed as extra nuclear bodies in the cytoplasm when the whole chromosome is not incorporated into daughter nuclei or acentric chromosomal fragments hulka et al 1990 micronuclei of urine epithelial cells reflect damages to the urinary bladder tissue that mainly appears 1 3 weeks earlier to the exfoliated cells in urine stich et al 1983 so the presence of micronuclei in a cluster of cells indicates chromosomal damage most of the children from chak kamardanga free primary school were found to be chronically affected through consumption of domestic tube well water school tube well water and rice grain fresh urine samples were collected from some of the selected children n 10 who had switched over to drink as safe water 3 μg l through commercially available packaged water bottle after an interval of two months from initial sampling consumption of as safe water leads to reduce as concentration in urine by approximately 80 99 for each child fig 5 however there might be a chance of cytogenic damage in individuals because of chronic exposure mean as concentration of biological samples of affected school population was extensively higher than that of children staying at kolkata area so a comparative evaluation has been made between the micronuclei frequency in urine epithelial cells of affected school goers n 10 and apparently unaffected ones n 10 children fig 6 displays the photographs of micronuclei in different urine epithelial cells of four as exposed children children no 1 3 6 and 9 according to fig 5 it revealed a statistically important rise in the number of micronuclei in urine epithelial cells on comparison to that of the apparently control children exposed children had higher frequency of micro nucleated cells than the control children the number of micronuclei was found much higher for exposed school children mean 3 25 2 79 compared to control children mean 0 52 0 31 per 1000 epithelial cells table 3 unpaired t test was applied on these exposed children n 10 with respect to the apparently control children n 10 for the micronuclei found per 1000 epithelial cells table 3 the two tailed p value equals to 0 0065 by conventional criteria the unpaired t test study concludes that the difference is considered to be very significant now the calculated value is higher than that of the critical value that leads to an acceptance of alternative hypothesis h1 so it can be said that the effect of as is very much significant for the formation of micronucleus in the exfoliated cells of urine table 3 3 7 application of risk thermometer on exposed and apparently control children for the appraisal of as toxicity the evaluation through risk thermometer has been done using the average as concentration of each dietary aspect intake amount average rate of as consumption and the exposure factor supplementary table s3 as mentioned by sand et al 2015a b the hazard from the dietary sources can be categorized into five class of concern levels i e no class 1 no low class 2 low moderate class 3 moderate high class 4 and high class 5 with samoe values of 10 1 10 0 1 1 0 01 0 1 and 0 01 respectively according to the nature of risk thermometer and associated samoe value pattern the risk for the exposed school children through consumption of cooked vegetable mid day meal domestic rice and school provided rice was observed to come under class 4 fig 7 whilst consumption of as through tube well water from both the sources school and domestic equally contributed to considerable future hazard for the population the consumption of as contaminated water leads to higher category of risk class 5 supplementary table s3 and fig 7 contrastingly hazard for an apparently control school goers ranges from class 3 to class 4 through consumption of water both domestic and school level and rice domestic level due to the consumption of as safe water the risk incurred upon the school children of apparently control area falls under class 3 fig 7 it is relevant to reveal here that the rice grains from variable sources often gets assorted collectively and transported from one place to another irrespective of exposed or control area biswas et al 2019 as a result the samoe assessment of rice grain for apparently control children falls under class 4 supplementary table s3 and fig 7 among an apparently control children rice grain intake poses a higher risk compared to the drinking water by this comparison study it can affirm that apparently control school children are presently having a much lower risk however intake of low quantity of as via rice grain for a long time could even pose health hazards in the near future 3 8 carcinogenic and non carcinogenic hazard analysis arsenic is connected with various types of anthropogenic cancers and therefore understanding the character of carcinogenic hazard is complicated and decisive goering et al 1999 the threshold limit of carcinogenic hazard caused by as is 1 10 6 usepa 2005 the mean future carcinogenic hazard for school goers from the as affected area was found to be 1 10 3 range 0 8 10 3 6 10 3 0 4 10 3 range 0 1 10 3 1 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 range 1 10 3 1 7 10 3 from domestic tube well water rice grain and school tube well water respectively supplementary table s4 contrastingly the school goers from the kolkata area were found much safer with respect to as the mean future carcinogenic hazard for the school goers from mentioned area was found 0 016 10 3 range 0 003 10 3 0 03 10 3 0 4 10 3 range 0 2 10 3 0 9 10 3 and 0 012 10 3 range 0 007 10 3 0 015 10 3 from domestic supplied water rice grain and school water respectively supplementary table s4 surprisingly both the group of school children has similar kind of future cancer risk through intake of rice grain since the as concentration is comparable usually rice grains are mostly cultivated in as contaminated districts of west bengal and get transported to apparently unaffected zones biswas et al 2019 joardar et al 2021a the future cancer risk appraisals on both the group of school children have been shown in fig 8 although cancer risk produced by as contaminated rice grain is least 14 compared to drinking water in exposed children while that contributes highest 93 in apparently control children fig 8 joardar et al 2021a reported higher cancer risk through ingestion of as tainted drinking water for the affected school goers on comparison to that of kolkata school goers in west bengal india however the risk was more or less similar while consumption of rice grain the average incremental lifetime carcinogenic hazard for primary school goers from all the central districts of pakistan was found higher compared to usepa permissible limit of as 10 6 through intake of as polluted water ahmed et al 2022 the average hazard quotient hq for non carcinogenic hazard evaluation of exposed and apparently control children were analyzed through their daily dietary intakes supplementary table s4 an objectionable stage of non carcinogenic hazard caused by as is 1 usepa 2005 the hq value was found much higher for domestic tube well water range 0 06 15 02 rice grain range 0 39 2 22 and school tube well water range 2 38 3 96 in as exposed area so these children are prone to other chronic health hazards too concurrently the hq values were found much lower for domestic supplied water range 0 006 0 07 and school water range 0 02 0 03 however considerable higher for rice grain range 05 2 05 for the school goers from kolkata area notably the hq value is quite similar in rice grain from both the studied so it might carry future non cancer risk of as by intake of rice grain for both the studied groups 4 conclusion arsenic is extensively distributed in groundwater as an unadulterated element higher level of as in drinking water is mainly accountable for chronic arsenicosis in humans a greater amount of as was found in the pediatric population which can be a sign of major risk for the entire society the present scenario of the school children of the said area is distressing the daily useable drinking water from household or school sources is highly as contaminated which propels the intake rate of as and the output values of biomarkers exceeding the reference values concentration of as in drinking water could be noticeably associated with urine hair and nail as concentration exposure to severe toxicity by drinking water has been validated through urine as scenario the biomarker study unequivocally reveals a high exposure of inorganic as in urine hair and nail with an exact acute and chronic contamination scenario in these children further cytogenic study revalidates the scenario along with statistical corroboration higher as concentration in the urine hair and nail samples of the exposed school goers proves that they are sub clinically affected by as however at present they did not reflect any arsenical skin manifestations students from exposed area face higher health hazard from contaminated drinking water than rice grain whereas the estimated health hazard in the control children is less which comes through contaminated rice only drinking water is the main risk factor and the leading future cancer risk carrying component for the community the non cancer risk assessment study too reveals non cancerous health hazards in the near future of the exposed population these results are an alarming signal of chronic health challenges for the future generation so further studies are required to appraise the strategies of treatment of contaminated water limit the inhabitants to avoid the contaminated source for their daily use the school chak kamardanga free primary school has its own as removal filter unit which effectively reduces as concentration below 10 μg l according to our report fig 2a however the students randomly choose other options for drinking purposes that are highly contaminated with as this primarily occurs due to the mass indifference and lack of awareness although a little change in choice can effectively bring an overall betterment therefore efforts must be made immediately to communicate and aware the children and teachers to use the filtered water as the primary and sole source of drinking and cooking purposes for mid day meal preparation moreover installation of deep aquifer as removal plants use of treated surface water and rain water harvesting and their proper monitoring are urgently required in the entire as endemic zones as a part of mitigation strategy to fight against the devastating calamity of as measures are also required to change the cooking malpractices which may exaggerate exposure this situation thus calls for conducting public health campaigns with the help of medical authorities to inform the affected population about their continuous chronic health threat a long term follow up study is further required to evaluate the health effects of the school children from both the exposed and control zones due to as exposure through different dietary sources investigations need to be carried out on the health effects of the school children residing in as exposed areas after providing as safe drinking water considering exposure through consumption of as contaminated foodstuffs is an unavoidable circumstance in rural bengal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11668,arsenic as contaminated dietary intake in daily routine can bring serious health hazards even in children considering drinking water ingestion and rice grain consumption pattern the daily dietary intake rate of as through drinking water for the exposed children was observed as 17 5 μg kg bw day greater than apparently control group of children 0 2 μg kg bw day biological samples such as urine hair and nail for the exposed children showed higher accumulation of as 159 μg l 3320 μg kg and 4460 μg kg compared to controlled children 1 92 μg l 195 μg kg and 331 μg kg arsenic toxicity can eventually lead to future cancer risk which is sub clinically manifested through biological samples along with formation of micronuclei in urine epithelial cells of the affected children notably according to unpaired t test the detected numbers of micronuclei were significantly higher in the urine epithelial cells of exposed school children 3 25 1000 epithelial cells compared to the control children 0 52 1000 epithelial cells severity adjusted margin of exposure samoe value also corresponds to the huge amount of risk class 5 through drinking water consumption rice grain samples from households and mid day meal samples also fall under the category of class 4 in exposed area during the risk thermometer study the average future cancer risk to the school children from the exposed area was found to be 1 10 3 0 4 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 whilst the control group belongs to an apparently lower cancer risk zone such as 0 016 10 3 0 4 10 3 and 0 012 10 3 during the intake of domestic tube well water rice grain and school tube well water respectively simultaneously non cancer risk from drinking water is much lower in control children however rice grain poses similar amount of risk for both groups 0 3 2 2 hence corrective measures are required for the management of contaminated water along with cooking malpractices graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic school children dietary

on public health is a recurrent worldwide problem nowadays chakraborty et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2000 kumar et al 2020 shaji et al 2021 the gangetic delta basin covering india and bangladesh has witnessed such suffering from as toxicity since long chakraborti et al 2009 2013 international agency for research on cancer iarc and agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr have addressed arsenic as a group i carcinogen which can cause malignancy in lung bladder and kidneys because of its chronic exposure atsdr 2007 iarc 2004 2012 people from the exposed area are using shallow tube well water for drinking purposes even after knowing its as concentration due to the poor infrastructure and inadequate knowledge deeper tube wells are installed without checking as contamination due to the ignorance of the governing bodies kippler et al 2016 besides contaminated drinking water as contaminated rice grain is another concern to the population of exposed areas as rice is cultivated with contaminated groundwater chowdhury et al 2018a das et al 2021b thus with time as load has increased by entering into the food chain via daily diet joardar et al 2021b roychowdhury et al 2002 roychowdhury 2008 numerous cancerous and non cancerous diseases are linked to regular dietary ingestion of as by drinking water most important non cancerous health problems include cardio vascular diseases skin lesions neurological disorders and diabetes mellitus along with hypertension tseng 2007 in case of school going children the severe impact of as tainted drinking water is a subject of immense concern in as exposed areas at present ahmed et al 2022 baig et al 2016 joardar et al 2021a in contrast to skin lesions and pigmentation of various forms that display within 5 10 years of as exposure ingestion for a longer period of time can give rise to more severe conditions like cancer and neurological disorders mazumder 2007 also even in a low dose long term as poisoning can hamper neurobehavioral activities in children which can be reflected through their impaired intellect memory pattern inattentiveness loss of focus and preparedness kumar et al 2019 arsenic exposure is concomitant with neurological disorders at the early phase of an individual s life tyler and allan 2014 studies also showed that how drinking water has enforced a severe public health concern on the maturity mortality along with brain development of kids rahman et al 2013 wasserman et al 2016 despite there being no direct relation between as and dna it was shown that as can persuade dna break in numerous test systems rossman 2003 in vitro assays showed chromosomal changes sister chromatid interactions and micronuclei configuration induced by as in mammalian cells with positive clastogenic impacts gonsebatt et al 1997 as diagnosing as toxicity among children is a difficult task due to absence of arsenical symptoms evaluation of genetic damage can be performed chatterjee et al 2018 observed significantly higher micronucleus frequency in the buccal mucosa urothelial cells and lymphocytes cells of the as exposed children than the unexposed ones in early childhood as toxicity is proved in influencing the length of telomere chatterjee et al 2018 farzan et al 2021 there are limited works for as risk appraisal related to dna damage in children of the as exposed areas also there are inadequate reports on rice grain as toxicity over the children from both as contaminated and non contaminated areas therefore the present study determines the extent of acute and chronic as contamination in children as well as their future health risk as they experience sub clinical toxicity the current study highlights the collective daily as exposure in the studied school children of as exposed and apparently control areas through drinking water and rice grain apart from the comprehensive approach of accrual of as in the biological samples of the children living in as exposed and control areas the study emphasizes on the cytogenic effects of as in children through micronuclei formation in urine epithelial cells 2 methodology 2 1 choosing the cohort for the study this study population includes school goers from as exposed and apparently control sites of west bengal india the school children were selected randomly from each class standard i vi according to their age 5 12 years chak kamardanga free primary school located in basirhat 1 block barasat sadar sub division of north 24 parganas west bengal was selected as the exposed site in this study fig 1 basirhat i one of the endemic as contaminated zones in west bengal is located on the bank of ichamati river rahman et al 2003 roychowdhury 2010 talukdar et al 2009 in contrast the apparently control set of children unexposed to as were selected from tiljala brojonath tiwari school located in the central part of kolkata district fig 1 kolkata district was recognized as a partially control area according to groundwater as status especially groundwater in southern part of the city was reported as as contaminated according to the previous reports biswas et al 2019 chakraborti et al 2017 pal et al 2009 however a major part of kolkata population gets the benefit of as free water at domestic level through pipe line supply treated water ganges water by kmc kolkata municipal corporation for regular drinking purposes biswas et al 2019 joardar et al 2021a 2 2 sample collection preparation and storage drinking water and uncooked rice grain samples were collected individually from the school goers of differently exposed areas water samples have been collected in pre washed polyethylene bottles with the addition of 0 1 v v concentrated hno3 acid rice grain samples have been collected in domestic level of the school children and stored in sterile zip lock bags the mid day meal samples along with the school tube well water used for drinking and meal preparation were also collected from the chak kamardanga free primary school mid day meal was not offered to the school children of apparently control area by the school authority details of water rice grain and cooked rice sample collection storage and processing have been represented in our previous publications chowdhury et al 2018a 2018b b joardar et al 2021a 2021b roychowdhury 2008 the biological samples scalp hair nail and urine have been collected from the school goers of both the studied areas the first void urine samples collected in 100 ml sterile containers were transported to laboratory after placing them in a cooled ice box and preserved them at 20 c until further analysis the urine samples were processed for quantification of total as and micronucleus assay of urine epithelial cells micronucleus assay does not require any filtration rather it requires fast processing after collecting the urine first void urines were preferred because they were likely to have a greater amount of exfoliated cells biggs et al 1997 particulars regarding the sample collection maintenance processing and digestion processes of biological samples were mentioned in our prior reported works joardar et al 2021a 2021b roychowdhury 2010 2 3 analytical reagents the analytes reagents used throughout the processing of sample storage preparation digestion and analysis were of analytical grade detailed description of chemical and reagents were mentioned in our previous reports chowdhury et al 2020a 2020b das et al 2021a joardar et al 2021a to analyze the presence of micronuclei in urine epithelial cell 0 9 normal saline solution fixative and giemsa stain were prepared all the reagents were prepared as described by basu et al 2002 2 4 digestion protocol the collected solid samples were processed maintaining the digestion protocol published in our prior reports chowdhury et al 2018b 2020b joardar et al 2021b the cooked foodstuffs have been dried inside a hot air oven at 50 c approximate 0 1 0 5 g of the solid samples hair nail foodstuffs were weighed separately and digested with concentrated nitric acid hno3 and 30 v v hydrogen peroxide h2o2 at 2 1 ratio in teflon bomb at 120 c for 6 h inside a hot air oven the digested materials were evaporated at 90 c and were diluted to a final quantity of 2 5 ml with double distilled water the filtered samples have been preserved at 4 c prior to as estimation the complete acid digestion protocols followed by evaporation and filtration have been represented in our earlier reports das et al 2021a 2021b b joardar et al 2021a 2021b 2 5 chemical analysis total concentration of as was evaluated by fi hg aas flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometer varian aa140 usa attached with vga 77 vapor generation accessory agilent technologies

fries et al 1977 2 6 micronucleus assay the collected urine samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 9 min and the supernatant was discarded about 0 9 of normal saline was added to the pellets mixed well and centrifuged for 7 min at 2000 rpm the above process was repeated twice until the final pellet was obtained about 0 5 1 0 ml of fixative was added to the pellets and mixed properly by vortexing for 5 min then it was kept for sometime approximately 10 min and over again centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and finally the pellet was collected for slide preparation the experimental slides were air dried and stained using giemsa stain after that it was washed with the help of double distilled water and kept it for air drying again the prepared slides were observed under light bright field microscope detailed description of slide preparation and observation was described by basu et al 2004 2 7 quality control and quality assurance to maintain the worth of the analytical performance about 30 of the solid samples were processed by hot plate digestion method using the same mixture solution of hno3 and h2o2 at 2 1 to substantiate and reassure the data obtained at the time of analysis the as level in standard reference material srm was checked by both types of digestion teflon bomb and hot plate methods the srm used in this entire work were rice flour 1568a nbs gaithersburg md usa and human hair erm db001 european commission jrc irmm retieseweg geel belgium respectively the as recovery percentages of rice flour and human hair were 96 and 102 during teflon bomb digestion and 86 and 83 at the time of hot plate digestion method correspondingly against their certified values of 0 29 μg g and 0 044 μg g respectively quality control and quality assurance experiments were also evaluated by analyzing duplicates and calculating the recovery after spiking as concentration in digested sample chowdhury et al 2020a 2020b b joardar et al 2021a 2021b 2 8 statistical analysis to evaluate the correlation and dependence between the input and output mechanism of as various statistical measures like histogram plot regression analysis and two tailed unpaired t test were displayed in association with excel microsoft office and graph pad prism 8 the two tailed unpaired t test has been performed to elucidate the effect of as on the formation of micronucleus in the exfoliated cells of urine 2 9 data analysis regular dietary exposure intake rate of total as content μg by drinking water and other food items rice grain and vegetables was

the methodical evaluation of as toxicity has hindered epidemiological study on probable variations in disease vulnerability and the difficulty of as metabolism therefore an as induced health risk appraisal is performed on school goers of differently exposed areas risk thermometer is a mathematical tool to evaluate the effect of any toxic element upon human health this helps the community to become aware of the consumption of toxic components directly or indirectly so the risk thermometer has been used for measuring as toxicity of school water domestic water rice grain of both the exposed and apparently control children and the calculations according to the severity adjusted margin of exposure samoe value of each part chowdhury et al 2020a 3 s a m o e t d i a f b m r x a f x s f x e

entire calculation of carcinogenic hazard appraisal of the children has been done using the general formulas of usepa 2001 joardar et al 2021a mentioned that extensive use of as contaminated drinking water can push the exposed population towards future carcinogenic hazard to determine the carcinogenic hazard the foremost evaluation is average daily dose add for each child from both the studied

2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic contamination scenario in groundwater of basirhat i block thirty five tube well water samples were collected from the studied area to identify the present condition of as contamination in the region fig 2 a distribution of the varied number of groundwater sources tube wells according to the diverse as concentration range was shown in fig 2b arsenic levels in the collected groundwater samples ranged 3 700 μg l with an average concentration of 151 μg l only one groundwater sample was found to have as level within the tolerable boundary in drinking water 10 μg l which seems to be quite an alarming situation considering the levels of as ingested by the locals who 2011 that means the inhabitants in the studied area were using as contaminated groundwater for drinking purpose due to inadequate availability of as safe drinking water the rural people are bound to use contaminated groundwater for their routine requirements along with agricultural purposes biswas et al 2019 roychowdhury 2008 among 35 samples 16 have been in the range of 10 50 μg l and 14 samples contained 50 350 μg l of as on the other hand tube well samples n 4 from premises of different schools too were found to be highly as contaminated mean 578 108 μg l range 475 700 μg l fig 2a basirhat i block showed a varied range of as concentration in groundwater with respect to its iron concentration and depth range the spearman correlation revealed that both as and iron concentrations are negatively correlated with depth i e r 0 33 and 0 46 respectively where p 0 05 supplementary table s1 with increasing depth the concentration of both iron and as declined these findings indicate that the possibility of as contamination is higher in shallow hand tube wells compared to deep tube wells chowdhury et al 1999 in their study found that as concentration in groundwater enhanced up to a definite depth and then reduced with increase of the depth in bengal delta meanwhile as concentration is found to be positively correlated with iron concentration in the studied groundwater supplementary table s1 so according to inverse depth range both the contaminants increased gradually as they shared a strong positive correlation r 0 60 p 0 01 supplementary table s1 3 1 1 arsenic contamination status in drinking water of the local schools in the studied area occurrence of elevated level of as has been observed in tube well water samples collected from various schools in the studied area fig 2a the present study has been performed considering evaluation of future health risk for children of one of the surveyed schools named chak kamardanga free primary school where school tube well water showed a mean as concentration of 500 10 μg l fig 2a simultaneously drinking water consumed by the school children from kolkata district has been examined in view of kolkata as an apparently control set water samples have been collected from different existing sources i e kmc kolkata municipality corporation supplied water and through water purifier installed at the school premises of tiljala brojonath high school for as analysis all the collected samples displayed a concentration of 3 μg l which is much lower than the acceptable concentration of as in drinking water 10 μg l 3 1 2 arsenic exposure in drinking water of the households of studied school children children with chronic contact by prolonged consumption of as tainted school tube well water and domestic tube well water are posed with major health risks the water samples n 43 collected from the households show as concentration in the range of 3 780 μg l with a mean concentration of 184 171 μg l about 7 of the samples were in the category of safe i e 10 μg l while 30 samples were in a range that has been 10 times greater than the permissible concentration another 30 of the samples ranged 100 200 μg l of as and remaining 33 samples were at stake as they had concentration 200 μg l the children in this study used the contaminated drinking water since birth from their household shallow tube wells having depth range 6 06 24 2 m arsenic concentration has been found positively correlated with iron concentration r2 0 4067 p 0 005 n 43 supplementary fig s1a the mean concentration of iron in the mentioned groundwater samples was found as 6 71 4 57 mg l range 0 16 19 5 mg l subsequently the household drinking water samples n 19 collected from the school goers of tiljala brojonath high school located in apparently control kolkata district displayed the mean as and iron concentration of 1 1 0 62 μg l range 0 25 2 14 μg l and 0 81 0 72 mg l range 0 1 2 1 mg l correspondingly both the contaminants were found positively associated with each other r2 0 5037 p 0 005 supplementary fig s1b the situation implicates on the fact that the control school children in this study were drinking as safe water it was reported earlier that as status in the drinking water of kolkata urbanites is safe because they have access to safe drinking water from kolkata municipal corporation biswas et al 2019 3 2 status of as exposure in rice grain people depending on a diet mainly consists of parboiled rice grain which contains considerable higher amounts of as compared to sunned rice grain due to the contaminated water involved at the time of post harvesting in the as affected area chowdhury et al 2018b rice grain samples n 47 collected from the house of children of contaminated area displayed as level in the range of 94 410 μg kg with a mean value of 196 67 μg kg which is greater than the suggested concentration i e 100 μg kg for exposed areas according to alarp as low as reasonably practicable principle the as inorganic concentration of 100 μg kg has shown lower amount of future risks in as contaminated areas for the consumption of rice grain meharg et al 2006 correspondingly the rice grain samples n 37 from apparently control area kolkata depicted an as level in the range of 70 284 μg kg mean value 146 45 μg kg according to the codex alimentarius commission 2017 the maximum concentration of ias in polished rice is 200 μg kg it has been already reported that as the process of ias estimation is expensive and needs progressive analytical technology so codex has decided to use total concentration of as as a method to decrease ias exposure and protect consumer health hensawang and chanpiwat 2017 3 3 regular dietary exposure of as in both the studied school children regular dietary exposure intake rate of as through drinking water rice grain including mid day meal to the school goers of contaminated area and exposure from drinking water and rice grain to the school children of apparently control area are depicted in table 1 the total as consumption by drinking water rice grain along with mid day meal in the daily diet of school goers belonging to the contaminated area is much higher than the children belonging to the apparently control area kolkata in this study the children of exposed area consumed 658 μg of as through daily diet whereas the children of apparently control area consumed 61 5 μg of as through daily diet per day table 1 these results indicate a serious health threat to the children of exposed area compared to the apparently control or uncontaminated area drinking water is solely responsible for a huge load of as in the school children of exposed area as the daily dietary intake rate value is 17 5 μg kg body wt day supplementary table s2 on contrary the same for apparently control area is 0 2 μg kg body wt day of as rice grain itself contributed 2 8 domestic source along with mid day meal and 1 8 μg kg body wt day of as to the children of both contaminated and uncontaminated area respectively biswas et al 2019 said that people from apparently control zone like kolkata are not entirely exempted from as contamination threats in the long run because they consume rice grain cultivated in the contaminated areas the observed value of as intake rate of exposed children in this study is greater than the recommended upper tolerable acceptable daily intake value of as 3 0 μg kg body wt day who 2011 3 4 acute as burden in differently exposed studied population urinary as concentration is known as a fine determining factor for current as burden and it has been used in several environmental social and industrial studies of people acutely exposed to this metalloid warner et al 1994 urine is the primary path of release for the majority arsenical species buchet et al 1981 vahter 1994 metabolized inorganic as ias forms two methylated derivatives monomethylarsonate mma and dimethylarsenate dma that excretes through urine together with an un methylated part of inorganic as aposhian 1997 researchers have confirmed that dma is mainly released through urine and generally elevated levels of ias are retained in epithelial tissues aposhian 1997 urine samples n 50 collected from the exposed school children depicted a mean as value of 159 126 μg l range 13 539 μg l simultaneously collected urine samples n 36 from apparently control school children exhibited a mean as concentration of 1 92 1 56 μg l ranging from 0 02 to 6 7 μg l table 2 a considerable positive association r2 0 66 was found among drinking water and urinary as concentration of exposed school children n 19 fig 3 a on contrary a positive correlation r2 0 4963 was also found among the apparently control children n 19 fig 3b hence this comparative study indicates that the presence of urinary as is directly proportional to the drinking water as concentration for both the population from two differently contaminated areas thus the chak kamardanga free primary school population is more susceptible compared to the kolkata school goers as they had a noticeable amount of as in their urine due to ingestion of tainted drinking water and rice grain for a long period on the other hand children from the control site are apparently in a safer zone as they drink treated drinking water which is free from as contamination 3 5 chronic as burden on the population of exposed and control area in toxicology hair and nail are the finest possible bio indicators of chronic as burden samanta et al 2004 the robust arrangement of hair helps it to endure undesirable environmental conditions and its physical and chemical attributes biological configuration and growth rate make it advantageous as a biomarker wilson 2005 in a toxic environment the hair as measurement is a longitudinal time resolved signal for chronic exposure kempson and henry 2010 according to hopps 1977 nails grow gradually with time 0 75 mm month and trace element dimensions from nail clippings reveal internal exposure depending on the length of nail various studies have shed light on the calculated as levels in toe nails that remain relatively invariable over the span of 6 years garland et al 1993 karagas et al 2001 the keratin of hair fiber mainly contains large amount of thiol groups in their cysteine residues that can easily interact with as and as a result hair shows a higher amount of as than any other biological tissue paswan 2012 yanez et al 2005 in this study the mean as level in hair and nail from chak kamardanga school goers n 45 was found to be 3320 2900 μg kg range 760 16 900 μg kg and 4460 2600 μg kg 1300 17 100 μg kg respectively table 2 simultaneously hair n 28 and nail n 33 samples have been also gathered from kolkata population mean as concentration in hair and nail samples of mentioned population was found to be 195 176 μg kg range 30 680 μg kg and 331 223 μg kg range 20 810 μg kg correspondingly the permissible limit of as in hair and nail samples are 80 250 μg kg and 430 1080 μg kg correspondingly arnold et al 1990 ioanid et al 1961 from the regression study a noteworthy positive association has been found between water hair r2 0 7787 n 25 and water nail r2 0 5964 n 29 of exposed population respectively fig 4 a and b whereas for the apparently control population a moderate positive correlation has been obtained between water hair r2 0 3767 n 20 and water nail r2 0 3139 n 23 respectively fig 4c and d joardar et al 2021a reported in their study about the considerable quantity of as deposition in hair and nail samples from the school children of gaighata block another as endemic block of west bengal and the chronic exposure was also directly proportional with water as concentration so the ongoing work provides insightful and concrete evidence that the children from the as exposed area have been chronically pre disposed to as over a substantial time period 3 6 micronucleus assay in urine epithelial cells for exposed and apparently control children a visible as concentration in biological samples of affected population indicates a cumulative exposure to as for an extensive period of time this study shows the adverse health impact on school children through chronic as intake throughout their growing period previous studies reported that the prolonged exposure of as resulted in chromosomal aberrations ostrosky wegman et al 1991 sister chromatid exchanges hsu et al 1997 and micronuclei development banerjee et al 2013 dulout et al 1996 in exposed populations apart from contaminated drinking water as contaminated rice grain also has a significant deleterious effect on the presence of micronuclei in chronically exposed inhabitants banerjee et al 2013 notably enhanced rates of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei development have been mostly found in exfoliated cells of oral mucosa and urinary bladder biggs et al 1997 considering the scenario of as exposure via drinking water and rice grain of non symptomatic exposed children bio monitoring the cytogenic effect is required exfoliated epithelial cells were conventionally used for identification of cancer and for the bio monitoring of genetic impacts on human guzmán et al 2003 the frequencies of micronuclei in exfoliated cells of urinary bladder help as a suitable guide to examine the adverse genotoxicity the occurrence of these phenomena is induced by long term as exposure since these cells are in straight communication with the multisite carcinogen smith et al 1993 during cell mitosis micronuclei are formed as extra nuclear bodies in the cytoplasm when the whole chromosome is not incorporated into daughter nuclei or acentric chromosomal fragments hulka et al 1990 micronuclei of urine epithelial cells reflect damages to the urinary bladder tissue that mainly appears 1 3 weeks earlier to the exfoliated cells in urine stich et al 1983 so the presence of micronuclei in a cluster of cells indicates chromosomal damage most of the children from chak kamardanga free primary school were found to be chronically affected through consumption of domestic tube well water school tube well water and rice grain fresh urine samples were collected from some of the selected children n 10 who had switched over to drink as safe water 3 μg l through commercially available packaged water bottle after an interval of two months from initial sampling consumption of as safe water leads to reduce as concentration in urine by approximately 80 99 for each child fig 5 however there might be a chance of cytogenic damage in individuals because of chronic exposure mean as concentration of biological samples of affected school population was extensively higher than that of children staying at kolkata area so a comparative evaluation has been made between the micronuclei frequency in urine epithelial cells of affected school goers n 10 and apparently unaffected ones n 10 children fig 6 displays the photographs of micronuclei in different urine epithelial cells of four as exposed children children no 1 3 6 and 9 according to fig 5 it revealed a statistically important rise in the number of micronuclei in urine epithelial cells on comparison to that of the apparently control children exposed children had higher frequency of micro nucleated cells than the control children the number of micronuclei was found much higher for exposed school children mean 3 25 2 79 compared to control children mean 0 52 0 31 per 1000 epithelial cells table 3 unpaired t test was applied on these exposed children n 10 with respect to the apparently control children n 10 for the micronuclei found per 1000 epithelial cells table 3 the two tailed p value equals to 0 0065 by conventional criteria the unpaired t test study concludes that the difference is considered to be very significant now the calculated value is higher than that of the critical value that leads to an acceptance of alternative hypothesis h1 so it can be said that the effect of as is very much significant for the formation of micronucleus in the exfoliated cells of urine table 3 3 7 application of risk thermometer on exposed and apparently control children for the appraisal of as toxicity the evaluation through risk thermometer has been done using the average as concentration of each dietary aspect intake amount average rate of as consumption and the exposure factor supplementary table s3 as mentioned by sand et al 2015a b the hazard from the dietary sources can be categorized into five class of concern levels i e no class 1 no low class 2 low moderate class 3 moderate high class 4 and high class 5 with samoe values of 10 1 10 0 1 1 0 01 0 1 and 0 01 respectively according to the nature of risk thermometer and associated samoe value pattern the risk for the exposed school children through consumption of cooked vegetable mid day meal domestic rice and school provided rice was observed to come under class 4 fig 7 whilst consumption of as through tube well water from both the sources school and domestic equally contributed to considerable future hazard for the population the consumption of as contaminated water leads to higher category of risk class 5 supplementary table s3 and fig 7 contrastingly hazard for an apparently control school goers ranges from class 3 to class 4 through consumption of water both domestic and school level and rice domestic level due to the consumption of as safe water the risk incurred upon the school children of apparently control area falls under class 3 fig 7 it is relevant to reveal here that the rice grains from variable sources often gets assorted collectively and transported from one place to another irrespective of exposed or control area biswas et al 2019 as a result the samoe assessment of rice grain for apparently control children falls under class 4 supplementary table s3 and fig 7 among an apparently control children rice grain intake poses a higher risk compared to the drinking water by this comparison study it can affirm that apparently control school children are presently having a much lower risk however intake of low quantity of as via rice grain for a long time could even pose health hazards in the near future 3 8 carcinogenic and non carcinogenic hazard analysis arsenic is connected with various types of anthropogenic cancers and therefore understanding the character of carcinogenic hazard is complicated and decisive goering et al 1999 the threshold limit of carcinogenic hazard caused by as is 1 10 6 usepa 2005 the mean future carcinogenic hazard for school goers from the as affected area was found to be 1 10 3 range 0 8 10 3 6 10 3 0 4 10 3 range 0 1 10 3 1 10 3 and 1 4 10 3 range 1 10 3 1 7 10 3 from domestic tube well water rice grain and school tube well water respectively supplementary table s4 contrastingly the school goers from the kolkata area were found much safer with respect to as the mean future carcinogenic hazard for the school goers from mentioned area was found 0 016 10 3 range 0 003 10 3 0 03 10 3 0 4 10 3 range 0 2 10 3 0 9 10 3 and 0 012 10 3 range 0 007 10 3 0 015 10 3 from domestic supplied water rice grain and school water respectively supplementary table s4 surprisingly both the group of school children has similar kind of future cancer risk through intake of rice grain since the as concentration is comparable usually rice grains are mostly cultivated in as contaminated districts of west bengal and get transported to apparently unaffected zones biswas et al 2019 joardar et al 2021a the future cancer risk appraisals on both the group of school children have been shown in fig 8 although cancer risk produced by as contaminated rice grain is least 14 compared to drinking water in exposed children while that contributes highest 93 in apparently control children fig 8 joardar et al 2021a reported higher cancer risk through ingestion of as tainted drinking water for the affected school goers on comparison to that of kolkata school goers in west bengal india however the risk was more or less similar while consumption of rice grain the average incremental lifetime carcinogenic hazard for primary school goers from all the central districts of pakistan was found higher compared to usepa permissible limit of as 10 6 through intake of as polluted water ahmed et al 2022 the average hazard quotient hq for non carcinogenic hazard evaluation of exposed and apparently control children were analyzed through their daily dietary intakes supplementary table s4 an objectionable stage of non carcinogenic hazard caused by as is 1 usepa 2005 the hq value was found much higher for domestic tube well water range 0 06 15 02 rice grain range 0 39 2 22 and school tube well water range 2 38 3 96 in as exposed area so these children are prone to other chronic health hazards too concurrently the hq values were found much lower for domestic supplied water range 0 006 0 07 and school water range 0 02 0 03 however considerable higher for rice grain range 05 2 05 for the school goers from kolkata area notably the hq value is quite similar in rice grain from both the studied so it might carry future non cancer risk of as by intake of rice grain for both the studied groups 4 conclusion arsenic is extensively distributed in groundwater as an unadulterated element higher level of as in drinking water is mainly accountable for chronic arsenicosis in humans a greater amount of as was found in the pediatric population which can be a sign of major risk for the entire society the present scenario of the school children of the said area is distressing the daily useable drinking water from household or school sources is highly as contaminated which propels the intake rate of as and the output values of biomarkers exceeding the reference values concentration of as in drinking water could be noticeably associated with urine hair and nail as concentration exposure to severe toxicity by drinking water has been validated through urine as scenario the biomarker study unequivocally reveals a high exposure of inorganic as in urine hair and nail with an exact acute and chronic contamination scenario in these children further cytogenic study revalidates the scenario along with statistical corroboration higher as concentration in the urine hair and nail samples of the exposed school goers proves that they are sub clinically affected by as however at present they did not reflect any arsenical skin manifestations students from exposed area face higher health hazard from contaminated drinking water than rice grain whereas the estimated health hazard in the control children is less which comes through contaminated rice only drinking water is the main risk factor and the leading future cancer risk carrying component for the community the non cancer risk assessment study too reveals non cancerous health hazards in the near future of the exposed population these results are an alarming signal of chronic health challenges for the future generation so further studies are required to appraise the strategies of treatment of contaminated water limit the inhabitants to avoid the contaminated source for their daily use the school chak kamardanga free primary school has its own as removal filter unit which effectively reduces as concentration below 10 μg l according to our report fig 2a however the students randomly choose other options for drinking purposes that are highly contaminated with as this primarily occurs due to the mass indifference and lack of awareness although a little change in choice can effectively bring an overall betterment therefore efforts must be made immediately to communicate and aware the children and teachers to use the filtered water as the primary and sole source of drinking and cooking purposes for mid day meal preparation moreover installation of deep aquifer as removal plants use of treated surface water and rain water harvesting and their proper monitoring are urgently required in the entire as endemic zones as a part of mitigation strategy to fight against the devastating calamity of as measures are also required to change the cooking malpractices which may exaggerate exposure this situation thus calls for conducting public health campaigns with the help of medical authorities to inform the affected population about their continuous chronic health threat a long term follow up study is further required to evaluate the health effects of the school children from both the exposed and control zones due to as exposure through different dietary sources investigations need to be carried out on the health effects of the school children residing in as exposed areas after providing as safe drinking water considering exposure through consumption of as contaminated foodstuffs is an unavoidable circumstance in rural bengal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11669,this paper presents the results of investigations on groundwater nitrate pollution to assess its spatial and temporal evolution through the indicator kriging method with this approach the direct estimation of the local conditional probabilities of nitrate concentrations permits the identification of areas more vulnerable to pollution without establishing a precise estimate of the physical quantities under investigation the aspect of interest is the possibility of defining areas of increased vulnerability to nitrate pollution even in the case of sample points non homogeneously distributed in this case using classical geostatistical tools such as ordinary kriging would lead to incorrect assessments on the other hand using the indicator kriging indicates areas most prone to deterioration over time and therefore need attention the selected case study can be considered a benchmark due to its high geomorphologic and structural complexity and the scarce availability of homogeneous monitoring data results indicated an increasing trend in nitrate pollution over time often exceeding the recommended threshold for drinking water use stated by the eu nitrate directive moreover there is no correspondence to either land use variation or the use of fertilisers over the same period this behaviour could depend on a long delay between the leaching of nitrates from the soil to the groundwater this finding suggests the importance of systematic monitoring of groundwater quality especially for those vulnerable systems characterized by slow response time to external pressures and of great significance in water resource supplies graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrates groundwater karst indicator kriging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater represents the largest distributed freshwater reserve worldwide and plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change it is excessively exploited especially in arid areas characterized by scarce surface water and precipitation at the same time demographic pressure and linked human activities mainly in developed coastal territories have led to a growing water demand which is often satisfied by groundwater however the overexploitation of these resources coupled with the effects of climate change leads to negative quality and quantity impacts ferguson and gleeson 2012 it is well known how high concentrations of chemical species such as heavy metals or nitrates in groundwater affect the quality and consequently human health algieri et al 2022 the occurrence of several pollutants in surface and deep water has inspired researchers to evaluate different methods and procedures for treating water such as adsorption sarkar et al 2021 coagulation and flocculation membrane separation dasgupta et al 2016 chakrabortya et al 2017 sarkar and chakarborty 2021 enzyme membrane reactors chakraborty et al 2014 regular monitoring programs are needed to obtain reliable estimates of pollutants and study groundwater s hydrochemical space time variability however although the premises are well known to all parties involved data are frequently few and far between when we analyze historical data to identify any pollution trends in a given area nitrate pollution is the most common form of groundwater contamination worldwide arumi et al 2009 many mediterranean regions present worrying concentrations of nitrate in groundwater and are consequently one of the most polluted territories across the world abascal et al 2022 moreover coastal aquifers represent complex systems whose management and protection are challenging due to overlapping natural and human drivers parisi et al 2018 in such aquifers intrinsic vulnerability commonly characterizes groundwater related to the sensitivity of those systems to human or natural impacts vrba and zaporozec 1994 generally human activities produce high pollution loads resulting in severe consequences on groundwater quality and groundwater dependent ecosystems particularly with coastal phreatic aquifers numerous causes can give rise to nitrate contamination generally we can distinguish them into two macro categories geogenic and anthropogenic origin however the massive presence of nitrates in the environment depends on the second category from distinct sources like the atmosphere degraded soil organic material from fertilised and unfertilised crop residues livestock waste as well as sewage or industrial wastewater discharge panno et al 2006 menció et al 2016 protecting groundwater from pollution has been a problem for more than 50 years keller and smith 1967 it is strategic to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of nitrate pollution the nitrate ion being a non reactive tracer accumulates on the surface and is only leached out after significant rainfall events and particular drought conditions of the land an infrequent sampling may detect neither the peaks of concentration nor the dynamic of groundwater pollution the issue is even more sensitive in the case of heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers such as karst aquifers the set of fracture and fissures and subsurface karst forms with a patchy distribution makes it difficult to identify methodologies capable of analyzing such complex systems the qualitative degradation of groundwater severely detriment the economy of those areas where surface resources are practically absent due to their karstic nature moreover in karstic aquifers of arid or semi arid areas percolation water and pollutants accumulate in the epikarst during periods of drought or low recharge changing their chemical characteristics based on their residence time after recharge events that follow periods of drought or low recharge incoming water mixes with residual water diluting stored pollutants and moving them underground by piston effect when the epikarst becomes saturated fidelibus et al 2017 nitrate monitoring is fundamental since excessive concentrations in water resources may affect the quality of crops and also causes several human health disorders majumdar and gupta 2000 thus different organizations and countries have imposed drinking and irrigation water standards for nitrate and other chemical parameters to safeguard public health along with directives aiming to protect water resources from nitrate contamination among these in 1991 the european union published the nitrates directive 91 676 cee that indicates as vulnerable zones those areas where water is affected or the areas that are prone to get involved by high nitrate concentrations of agricultural origin the main aim of this directive is to reduce water pollution from nitrates of agricultural origin and prevent further deterioration the directive establishes mandatory action programs for the eu countries to promote and safeguard good agricultural practices the salento aquifer a coastal karst system located in the apulia region southern italy is affected by all these issues the general scarcity of water resources global climate worsening and groundwater pollution even though the latter is less directly recognizable by the users the high degree of anisotropy due to both fracturing and karstification and the regional flow pattern facilitate the development of pollutant preferential pathways resulting in diffuse groundwater quality degradation for this purpose this study aimed to deal with the evolution in space and time of nitrate concentrations in the salento aquifer whose water demand for drinking and irrigation purposes relies on groundwater the intrinsic vulnerability of this territory is critical due to its complex geomorphological and structural characteristics the presence of saltwater beneath freshwater intensive exploitation and climate change passarella et al 2020 nitrate pollution was recognized in the salento region as early as the 1990s when in certain limited areas tulipano and fidelibus 1993 found concentrations over 100 mg l 1 several different chemical surveys from 1995 to 2021 were organized into two time datasets to focus on the spatio temporal evolution of nitrate concentrations in a complex coastal karst aquifer aware of the differences between the analysed data of the monitoring surveys especially for the low monitoring frequency and the complexity of the investigated system this study defines a global framework of nitrate pollution in the salento area the study is novel because the adopted geostatistical method was applied to a complex case study characterized by a regional groundwater flow system and concerned a dataset of nitrates concentration measured over the last 25 years on pumping and static wells 2 material and methods 2 1 case study salento peninsula is in the south eastern portion of the apulia region it extends from the adriatic sea to the ionian sea for about 2760 km2 fig 1 roughly coinciding with the administrative territory of lecce province it belongs to the apulia carbonate platform which represents the main deep aquifer salento peninsula is constituted by a well bedded succession of jurassic cretaceous carbonate rocks the thickness of which varies from 3 to 5 km fractured and karstified layers and banks of limestone and dolomitic limestone of the cretaceous age crop out in extensive areas the covers mainly consist of sand silty or sandy clay and calcarenite of miocene to pleistocene age ciaranfi et al 1988 the compartmentalization of the aquifer at the regional scale is a result of principal faults which are likely to influence groundwater flow by exhibiting conduit conduit barrier or barrier behaviour from place to place fidelibus and pulido bosch 2018 groundwater mainly circulates in phreatic conditions though because of the heterogeneity of the rock masses circulation occurs locally in pressure ephemeral stream networks drain the karst surface although they are mostly dry and prone to flash floods when heavy rains occur the area receives about 600 700 mm of precipitation per year which is most significant during autumn and winter alfio et al 2020 identified several drought episodes between 1949 and 2011 in the salento peninsula currently the territory is going through a drought period that is even more severe than the past ones in some areas balacco et al 2022a nowadays the economy of salento is mainly based on agriculture and tourist attractions some family run small sized manufacturing industrial activities are also present all these activities rely on groundwater due to the scarcity of surface water resources therefore monitoring groundwater quality and quantity is essential to safeguard aquifer health especially under climate changes overexploitation and human activities since the 1980s the apulia region government has been carrying out several monitoring surveys on pumping and static wells different employed instrumentations and personnel diverse and uneven sampling frequencies and changes of wells from one survey to another prevent an accurate temporal assessment of the aquifer status aware of these issues the present study attempts to evaluate the whole trend of nitrate concentrations in the salento aquifer from 1995 to 2021 working on a bulk dataset to describe the complexity of this system and highlight the necessity of a systematic monitoring plan regarding water pollution and specifically nitrates contamination the apulia region in implementation of the eu directive 91 676 cee from 2005 and with a four yearly update approved the perimeter and designation of the zvn agricultural nitrate vulnerable zones which concerned the areas where predisposing elements and particularly evident analytical findings attributable to pollution from diffuse sources of agricultural origin coexisted at the same time the areas where the origin of the contamination was not clearly defined or anomalies recorded in the analytical monitoring data from the 2008 2011 period were identified to be subjected to specific in depth monitoring 2 2 dataset the selected dataset originates from a regional database which includes chemical analyses conducted over the last 25 years on static and pumping wells belonging to the regional monitoring network and consortia the regional agency performed laboratory analyses for environmental prevention and protection arpa https www arpa puglia it according to the analytical procedures available at https www arpa puglia it pagina3128 qualit html unfortunately the measurements differ for sampling frequency techniques and instruments water sample storage transport and laboratory procedures the dataset was selected to assess the qualitative evolution in space and time of nitrate pollution while being aware of the non homogeneity of the data and the three dimensional vulnerability of the study area the used dataset is composed of nitrate concentrations no3 measured from 1995 to 2021 in groundwater samples from pumping and static wells for 13 575 groundwater samples it is organized into two time periods 1995 2006 and 2007 2021 to evaluate the potential variability of nitrate pollution over time table 1 summarizes the main statistics of nitrate concentrations related to the two selected periods data show an average increase of no3 concentrations over time we can observe a significant increase in nitrate concentrations for pumping and static wells since the first period the maximum value has been significantly higher than the european normative threshold of 50 mg l 1 for pumping and static wells the minimum values are close to zero in both cases the variability of the two analysed dataset compared to the mean value increased in time as demonstrated by the standard deviation sd values reported in table 1 3 methods geostatistic has been a helpful tool for the spatial analysis of countless variables for more than 50 years matheron 1963 however when the variable to describe is characterized by extreme spatial variability such as nitrates using classical geostatistical methods can lead to a misleading representation of the analysed phenomenon in the case of asymmetric distributions the presence of outliers affects the quality of classical geostatistical techniques for prediction at unknown points in the spatial domain this aspect requires a more sophisticated method of selecting the mean of the values if over estimation or under estimation is to be avoided glacken and blackney 1998 in these cases it is more beneficial to use a representation of the phenomenon based on the probability of exceeding fixed thresholds to this end one of the most suitable methods is the indicator kriging ik introduced by journel 1983 it is a spatial interpolation technique aimed at estimating the conditional cumulative distribution function of a variable at an unsampled location in contrast to simple and ordinary kriging the success factor is that ik is a nonparametric method ik does not use the actual values of the variable to be estimated but uses new indicator variables to obtain a prediction about the deals the first step is to establish the thresholds that will then be used to create the cumulative distribution function based on the distribution of the data and initial statistical analysis ik transforms the original data into binary data with 0 if the value exceeds the threshold and 1 if it does not once obtained the binary transformation of the data the procedure is the same as that used for ordinary kriging with a consequent definition of the variogram the prediction made by ik is interpreted as the probability of exceeding the threshold value at an unknown point this is an estimate of the proportion of values in a vicinity of a point that are higher than the indicator or threshold value the essence of the ik method is the definition of an indicator function i x z that can respectively assume the value 1 or 0 depending on the set threshold z k 1 i x z k 1 i f z x z k 0 z k ik does not estimate the indicator variable but provides a method for least squares estimation of the cumulative distribution function at the threshold z k 2 i ˆ x 0 z k e x 0 z k n where n represents the proximity of other values at the point x 0 due to the way the random indicator function i x z is constructed the expected value of i x z corresponds to the cumulative distribution function of the random function z x in fact 3 e i x z 1 p r o b z x z 0 p r o b z x z 4 e i x z p r o b z x z f z therefore the estimation of the indicator variable at threshold z becomes 5 i ˆ x 0 z k e x 0 z k n p r o b z x 0 z n 6 i ˆ x 0 z k i 1 n w x i z i x i z 1 i 1 n w x i z f z in this case the w x i z are the weights assigned to the threshold z the thresholds set for this study follow the 2000 60 ec and 2006 118 ec european water framework directives and are 20 good quality 40 intermediate quality and 50 mg l 1 poor quality as largely used in the scientific literature chica olmo et al 2014 piccini et al 2012 4 results 4 1 statistical analysis a preliminary statistical analysis of nitrate concentrations has been conducted on the whole dataset and for each well to identify their temporal trend for brevity fig 2 reports the nitrate concentration patterns for six monitoring wells that highlight the pollution process detected in the salento aquifer over the last 25 years data indicate a considerable increase in nitrate concentrations over time and exceeding the recommended threshold of the eu nitrate directive nitrate directive 1991 values around 40 mg l 1 are often sampled in the early 1990s e g sal w35 sal w79 and sal w94 wells fig 3 shows nitrate boxplots of the same monitoring wells represented in fig 2 for each well we can observe boxplots as the dataset is divided into two reference periods the mean values of nitrate concentrations were slightly lower than the normative threshold during the first reference period 1995 2006 a remarkable average value rise is instead detected in these wells during the second reference period 2007 2021 ranging from 50 to 60 mg l 1 some outliers above 70 mg l 1 were identified during the second period e g sal w79 as well as in other monitoring wells that are not reported for brevity the sampling results of nitrate concentration values monitored in the two reference periods provide a reconstruction of groundwater quality in salento over time however from a statistical point of view the analysis of the average and maximum values provides a rough idea of the variability of water quality in each monitoring well nevertheless the exceedance of a certain threshold may be an occasional occurrence related to mere instrumental or operator errors to investigate this aspect we calculated frequency curves for a portion of wells 152 for which we had a significant number of samples considering nitrate groundwater samples from 1995 to 2021 for illustrative purposes only fig 4 shows nitrates concentration percent exceedance probability curves mg l 1 for the same selected monitoring wells analysed until now table 2 summarizes the frequency at which the set thresholds were exceeded considering all available wells and depending on the number of samples collected over time for each one of them this information is essential in providing helpful information on the frequency at which certain thresholds were exceeded the frequency curves show that all the considered wells almost exceed the 20 mg l 1 threshold indeed wells exceed this threshold 90 of the time for 96 wells over 152 in contrast the data for 40 and 50 mg l 1 show different results for one third of the wells 48 the 40 mg l 1 threshold exceeded more than 10 of the time while only about one sixth of the wells 22 showed concentration values above 50 mg l 1 for more than 10 of the investigated period most worryingly however the number of wells exceeding the 40 mg l 1 threshold more than 50 of the time is relatively high amounting to around one sixth of those analysed 4 2 indicator kriging analysis indicator kriging analyses were performed to directly estimate the local conditional probabilities of nitrate concentrations for the two reference periods using sampled available wells 277 and 257 wells respectively the thresholds of 20 40 and 50 mg l 1 were selected for the local estimation of the probability content in an unsampled location category maps representing the spatial distribution of these water quality thresholds have been obtained as a result average nitrate concentrations were considered for each available well since no significant differences between wet and dry months were detected in the exploratory analysis of the whole dataset the resulting maps of each reference period and threshold were reported below with the corresponding standard deviation maps that represent a measure of errors the probability of nitrate concentrations above 20 mg l 1 fig 5 greatly expanded throughout the salento aquifer compared with 1995 2006 affecting coastal and inland areas with a percentage exceedance of around 90 the probability of exceeding 40 mg l 1 evolved significantly between the first and second periods from a mean percentage value of 20 to about 60 fig 6 fig 7 represents the nitrate probability maps corresponding to a threshold exceedance of 50 mg l 1 a considerable variation is also observed between the two periods with more than 50 exceeding the threshold for many coastal and inland areas table 3 reports the percentage areas at four probability intervals exceeding the threshold value the areas affected by a probability of exceeding the threshold value of 20 mg l 1 greater than 50 expanded by about half of the total aquifer between the first and second period regarding the threshold of 40 mg l 1 almost the total area of the salento aquifer during the first period presented a probability of exceedance of less than 25 however this percentage area was distributed during the second period with higher exceedance probabilities a similar situation is detected for a threshold of 50 mg l 1 therefore there is an increase in the probability of exceedance with consequent enlargement of the involved zones between the two periods compared to the previous period areas with a probability of exceeding the threshold of under 25 are wider and potentially more vulnerable for the nitrates concentration for nitrates vulnerable zones delineation results obtained by the indicator kriging analysis have shown that the probability of finding high nitrate concentrations in groundwater changed throughout the study area over time it is known that groundwater quality depends on anthropogenic factors including land management livestock activities and the use of pesticides and fertilisers in agriculture can lead to an increase in chemical concentrations in groundwater oyarzun et al 2007 in the absence of a census of agricultural activities distributed in the area it was only possible to investigate whether and how land use could influence water resource pollution for this purpose two corine land cover maps https land copernicus eu global for the years 2000 and 2018 were compared and results are reported in table 4 as percentage variations of land use areas the first row of the table refers to artificial regions while the diagonal reports the areas unchanged over the considered period agricultural land which constitutes about 87 of the study area has not experienced significant changes many of these agricultural areas are mainly planted with olive groves 38 non irrigated arable crops 19 complex cultivation patterns 17 and vineyards 5 the remaining areas include fruit trees berry plantations and permanently irrigated land which are all equally distributed throughout the territory nitrogen surplus data of different agricultural areas were collected to identify areas most vulnerable to nitrate pollution in the water protection plan of the apulia region sogesid 2009 the following values of nitrogen surplus were used 66 kg ha for olive groves 60 kg ha for vineyards 42 kg ha for fruit trees 25 kg ha for temporary crops associated with permanent crops and non irrigated arable crops and 0 kg ha for vegetable and herbaceous crops fig 8 shows the variation in the nitrogen surplus in the agricultural areas from 2000 to 2018 red areas identify territories where the nitrogen surplus has increased over time while the green ones represent the zones where the nitrogen surplus has decreased the remaining areas are those where nitrogen surplus remained unchanged over time i orange pink and blue areas correspond to zones with high medium and low nitrogen surplus respectively ii grey areas refer to zones with no nitrogen surplus iii while the white ones are those where nitrogen surplus was not detected like artificial areas wetlands and water bodies the nitrogen surplus areas identified by comparing the two corine land cover maps do not match those detected by the indicator kriging therefore the nitrate increase observed in the second reference period 2007 2021 seems not to be justified by the results shown in fig 8 the nitrogen surplus is distributed over the entire territory in contrast to the results derived from indicator kriging which instead clearly identify distinct zones potentially affected by nitrate pollution 5 discussion data collected over the last 25 years for the salento region show a somewhat generalised increase trend for groundwater nitrate concentrations moreover this data does not justify the polices adopted at national and regional levels in the nitrates directive 91 676 eec framework results obtained by using the indicator kriging method suggest that the conditional probabilities exceedance of nitrate concentration at three set thresholds is significantly changed between the two reference periods the current situation appears worrying as most of the territory has values exceeding 20 mg l 1 and in a portion of areas higher thresholds are already reached the approach is of considerable interest since it can identify more vulnerable areas without establishing a precise estimate of the physical quantities under investigation despite the high complexity of the case study and the scarce availability of monitoring data results obtained from the adopted approach are satisfactory and could be helpful for programming specific monitoring activities furthermore looking at istat data http dati istat it index aspx queryid 23961 from 2003 to 2020 regarding the distribution of fertilisers for agricultural use in the apulia region including fertilisers soil conditioners and correctives an essential reduction in total nitrogen input is reported fig 9 demonstrates a general reduction in the distribution of fertilisers with a sharp reduction from 2014 additionally data indicate a percentage reduction of 95 45 in total fertilisers and 95 95 for nitrates nitrogen fertilizer used to exclude the origin of nitrate concentrations from wastewater discharges we also verified the spatial distribution of sewage treatment systems with final discharge into the superficial soil layers it turns out that there is no relationship between the location of these systems and the areas that are most affected to nitrate pollution several studies have demonstrated that it can take decades for nitrates leached from the soil to reach groundwater due to the temporary deposition and accumulation of long nitrates in the unsaturated zone wang et al 2013 a similar process can cause a long delay between the input of nitrates into the soil and the change in nitrate concentrations in groundwater moreover stuart et al 2010 demonstrated that the residence time of nitrate recorded in the malta s deep aquifer a karst system much similar to our case study can be estimated in about 25 years in addition isotopic analyses could help understanding the potential sources of this increasing nitrate concentrations in groundwater heaton et al 2012 the calculation of the time lag is of critical importance from a policy and monitoring perspective bain et al 2012 numerous factors influence the effectiveness of water policies and environmental management strategies some of these do not depend on anthropogenic pressure such as the hydrological and biochemical factors the latter can lead to a substantial delay in the arrival of nitrates in groundwater with peak concentrations being observed long after environmental regulations and policies to reduce nitrogen input have been introduced sometimes this process can frustrate governments expectations of immediate results in the presence of nitrates in the subsoil or even be misleading in the eyes of those who read these data superficially policymakers must know a priori this time lag before defining the most suitable environmental policy since groundwater s response time affects the success of the implemented mitigation measures huebsch et al 2013 moreover they need to have a clear idea on the regional hydrodynamics and evolution mechanisms of the aquifers however current environmental management strategies rarely consider the existence of this nitrate time lag vero et al 2018 but assume a rapid response of water quality to land management practices and reduced nitrogen input that should lead to a decrease of nitrate concentrations in groundwater burt et al 2011 recent literature wriedt and rode 2006 lasagna et al 2015 wang et al 2016 has shown that the correlation between the success of a legislative instrument and the current state of water quality is not always assured sometimes groundwater quality does not depend on causes that can be attributed to the immediate but sometimes to causes further back in time if the situation is already naturally complex due to the aforementioned factors the process becomes even more intricate in karstic systems huebsch et al 2013 highlighted the key controlling factors that regulate and control nitrate mobilisation in karst systems the combination of land use hydrological conditions and the type of karst can lead to different responses in nitrate concentrations wang et al 2022 a general slow response to recharge processes was already observed for the salento aquifer balacco et al 2022a and balacco et al 2022b verified with different methodologies that the effect of precipitation is reflected in the salento aquifer after hundreds of days this response varies depending on the investigated area and the event intensity it is also essential to examine the role of hydrochemistry in this system because for example prevailing or reducing environments may lead to high nitrogen concentrations but in the reduced forms of nitrogen not nitrates these aspects could also justify the spatial variability of nitrate concentrations detected in this study some areas may have already dissipated these effects while in other areas of salento we are still experiencing the peaks caused by the massive use of fertilisers and pesticides in the past 6 conclusions the data from analyses carried out on wells in the salento region over 25 years albeit with the limits of sampling carried out at different times and not always in the same wells provide a worrying description of the quality status of the salento aquifer nitrate concentrations have risen sharply since 2006 and average values currently stand at thresholds very close to the limits set by the nitrates directive the probability of exceeding the set thresholds outlines a critical situation regarding nitrate pollution as most of the territory has experienced an increase over the past 25 years that is gradually affecting large areas however the data on land use change over the period under investigation and the distribution of nitrate producing fertilisers are apparently unrelated to the nitrate concentrations observed in the second reference period from 2007 onwards nevertheless the data kept in the most recent period could be justified by the time lag observed in many cases cited in the literature mcdowell et al 2021 weitzman et al 2022 if this were true it would be enough to wait for the arrival of a recessionary limb that would bring nitrate concentration values back from their peaks to more moderate values finally groundwater quality data will be consistent with current regulations and practices that tend to reduce the causes of deteriorating groundwater quality this result is a crucial advice for future groundwater monitoring planning as it outlines a challenging situation in managing the resources groundwater quality improvement in response to implementing practices that should reduce pollution is delayed in time and therefore difficult to control the adopted geostatistical method represents a novelty in the framework of nitrate pollution s spatial and temporal evolution the indicator kriging represents a valuable instrument to identify the most prone areas to nitrates contamination in case sample points are non homogeneously distributed in this case classical geostatistical alternatives would lead to the groundwater nitrate concentration map not being statistically correct the method used in this work could be a viable tool to identify the most vulnerable areas to groundwater pollution that are already affected by a specific pollutant and plan specific future monitoring and mitigation measures however a critical issue concerns the historical timing of this nitrate pollution in fact due to high nitrate travel time it is tricky to argue whether the current concentrations are already the response to mitigation measures or are still a reflection of past pollution for this purpose it is essential to constantly monitor data on groundwater quality attempting to clarify whether what appears today is merely the result of the uncontrolled use of fertilisers up to the first decade of the current century to this end apart from considering the data on total nitrogen input in the region it would be useful to deploy a monitoring program on the residual nitrogen in soil following the completion of the cultivation period along with the total applied nitrogen following the basic fertilization period the uncertainty of where precisely the nitrates come from and the time lag of their transfer to the deep aquifer provide

11669,this paper presents the results of investigations on groundwater nitrate pollution to assess its spatial and temporal evolution through the indicator kriging method with this approach the direct estimation of the local conditional probabilities of nitrate concentrations permits the identification of areas more vulnerable to pollution without establishing a precise estimate of the physical quantities under investigation the aspect of interest is the possibility of defining areas of increased vulnerability to nitrate pollution even in the case of sample points non homogeneously distributed in this case using classical geostatistical tools such as ordinary kriging would lead to incorrect assessments on the other hand using the indicator kriging indicates areas most prone to deterioration over time and therefore need attention the selected case study can be considered a benchmark due to its high geomorphologic and structural complexity and the scarce availability of homogeneous monitoring data results indicated an increasing trend in nitrate pollution over time often exceeding the recommended threshold for drinking water use stated by the eu nitrate directive moreover there is no correspondence to either land use variation or the use of fertilisers over the same period this behaviour could depend on a long delay between the leaching of nitrates from the soil to the groundwater this finding suggests the importance of systematic monitoring of groundwater quality especially for those vulnerable systems characterized by slow response time to external pressures and of great significance in water resource supplies graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrates groundwater karst indicator kriging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater represents the largest distributed freshwater reserve worldwide and plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change it is excessively exploited especially in arid areas characterized by scarce surface water and precipitation at the same time demographic pressure and linked human activities mainly in developed coastal territories have led to a growing water demand which is often satisfied by groundwater however the overexploitation of these resources coupled with the effects of climate change leads to negative quality and quantity impacts ferguson and gleeson 2012 it is well known how high concentrations of chemical species such as heavy metals or nitrates in groundwater affect the quality and consequently human health algieri et al 2022 the occurrence of several pollutants in surface and deep water has inspired researchers to evaluate different methods and procedures for treating water such as adsorption sarkar et al 2021 coagulation and flocculation membrane separation dasgupta et al 2016 chakrabortya et al 2017 sarkar and chakarborty 2021 enzyme membrane reactors chakraborty et al 2014 regular monitoring programs are needed to obtain reliable estimates of pollutants and study groundwater s hydrochemical space time variability however although the premises are well known to all parties involved data are frequently few and far between when we analyze historical data to identify any pollution trends in a given area nitrate pollution is the most common form of groundwater contamination worldwide arumi et al 2009 many mediterranean regions present worrying concentrations of nitrate in groundwater and are consequently one of the most polluted territories across the world abascal et al 2022 moreover coastal aquifers represent complex systems whose management and protection are challenging due to overlapping natural and human drivers parisi et al 2018 in such aquifers intrinsic vulnerability commonly characterizes groundwater related to the sensitivity of those systems to human or natural impacts vrba and zaporozec 1994 generally human activities produce high pollution loads resulting in severe consequences on groundwater quality and groundwater dependent ecosystems particularly with coastal phreatic aquifers numerous causes can give rise to nitrate contamination generally we can distinguish them into two macro categories geogenic and anthropogenic origin however the massive presence of nitrates in the environment depends on the second category from distinct sources like the atmosphere degraded soil organic material from fertilised and unfertilised crop residues livestock waste as well as sewage or industrial wastewater discharge panno et al 2006 menció et al 2016 protecting groundwater from pollution has been a problem for more than 50 years keller and smith 1967 it is strategic to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of nitrate pollution the nitrate ion being a non reactive tracer accumulates on the surface and is only leached out after significant rainfall events and particular drought conditions of the land an infrequent sampling may detect neither the peaks of concentration nor the dynamic of groundwater pollution the issue is even more sensitive in the case of heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers such as karst aquifers the set of fracture and fissures and subsurface karst forms with a patchy distribution makes it difficult to identify methodologies capable of analyzing such complex systems the qualitative degradation of groundwater severely detriment the economy of those areas where surface resources are practically absent due to their karstic nature moreover in karstic aquifers of arid or semi arid areas percolation water and pollutants accumulate in the epikarst during periods of drought or low recharge changing their chemical characteristics based on their residence time after recharge events that follow periods of drought or low recharge incoming water mixes with residual water diluting stored pollutants and moving them underground by piston effect when the epikarst becomes saturated fidelibus et al 2017 nitrate monitoring is fundamental since excessive concentrations in water resources may affect the quality of crops and also causes several human health disorders majumdar and gupta 2000 thus different organizations and countries have imposed drinking and irrigation water standards for nitrate and other chemical parameters to safeguard public health along with directives aiming to protect water resources from nitrate contamination among these in 1991 the european union published the nitrates directive 91 676 cee that indicates as vulnerable zones those areas where water is affected or the areas that are prone to get involved by high nitrate concentrations of agricultural origin the main aim of this directive is to reduce water pollution from nitrates of agricultural origin and prevent further deterioration the directive establishes mandatory action programs for the eu countries to promote and safeguard good agricultural practices the salento aquifer a coastal karst system located in the apulia region southern italy is affected by all these issues the general scarcity of water resources global climate worsening and groundwater pollution even though the latter is less directly recognizable by the users the high degree of anisotropy due to both fracturing and karstification and the regional flow pattern facilitate the development of pollutant preferential pathways resulting in diffuse groundwater quality degradation for this purpose this study aimed to deal with the evolution in space and time of nitrate concentrations in the salento aquifer whose water demand for drinking and irrigation purposes relies on groundwater the intrinsic vulnerability of this territory is critical due to its complex geomorphological and structural characteristics the presence of saltwater beneath freshwater intensive exploitation and climate change passarella et al 2020 nitrate pollution was recognized in the salento region as early as the 1990s when in certain limited areas tulipano and fidelibus 1993 found concentrations over 100 mg l 1 several different chemical surveys from 1995 to 2021 were organized into two time datasets to focus on the spatio temporal evolution of nitrate concentrations in a complex coastal karst aquifer aware of the differences between the analysed data of the monitoring surveys especially for the low monitoring frequency and the complexity of the investigated system this study defines a global framework of nitrate pollution in the salento area the study is novel because the adopted geostatistical method was applied to a complex case study characterized by a regional groundwater flow system and concerned a dataset of nitrates concentration measured over the last 25 years on pumping and static wells 2 material and methods 2 1 case study salento peninsula is in the south eastern portion of the apulia region it extends from the adriatic sea to the ionian sea for about 2760 km2 fig 1 roughly coinciding with the administrative territory of lecce province it belongs to the apulia carbonate platform which represents the main deep aquifer salento peninsula is constituted by a well bedded succession of jurassic cretaceous carbonate rocks the thickness of which varies from 3 to 5 km fractured and karstified layers and banks of limestone and dolomitic limestone of the cretaceous age crop out in extensive areas the covers mainly consist of sand silty or sandy clay and calcarenite of miocene to pleistocene age ciaranfi et al 1988 the compartmentalization of the aquifer at the regional scale is a result of principal faults which are likely to influence groundwater flow by exhibiting conduit conduit barrier or barrier behaviour from place to place fidelibus and pulido bosch 2018 groundwater mainly circulates in phreatic conditions though because of the heterogeneity of the rock masses circulation occurs locally in pressure ephemeral stream networks drain the karst surface although they are mostly dry and prone to flash floods when heavy rains occur the area receives about 600 700 mm of precipitation per year which is most significant during autumn and winter alfio et al 2020 identified several drought episodes between 1949 and 2011 in the salento peninsula currently the territory is going through a drought period that is even more severe than the past ones in some areas balacco et al 2022a nowadays the economy of salento is mainly based on agriculture and tourist attractions some family run small sized manufacturing industrial activities are also present all these activities rely on groundwater due to the scarcity of surface water resources therefore monitoring groundwater quality and quantity is essential to safeguard aquifer health especially under climate changes overexploitation and human activities since the 1980s the apulia region government has been carrying out several monitoring surveys on pumping and static wells different employed instrumentations and personnel diverse and uneven sampling frequencies and changes of wells from one survey to another prevent an accurate temporal assessment of the aquifer status aware of these issues the present study attempts to evaluate the whole trend of nitrate concentrations in the salento aquifer from 1995 to 2021 working on a bulk dataset to describe the complexity of this system and highlight the necessity of a systematic monitoring plan regarding water pollution and specifically nitrates contamination the apulia region in implementation of the eu directive 91 676 cee from 2005 and with a four yearly update approved the perimeter and designation of the zvn agricultural nitrate vulnerable zones which concerned the areas where predisposing elements and particularly evident analytical findings attributable to pollution from diffuse sources of agricultural origin coexisted at the same time the areas where the origin of the contamination was not clearly defined or anomalies recorded in the analytical monitoring data from the 2008 2011 period were identified to be subjected to specific in depth monitoring 2 2 dataset the selected dataset originates from a regional database which includes chemical analyses conducted over the last 25 years on static and pumping wells belonging to the regional monitoring network and consortia the regional agency performed laboratory analyses for environmental prevention and protection arpa https www arpa puglia it according to the analytical procedures available at https www arpa puglia it pagina3128 qualit html unfortunately the measurements differ for sampling frequency techniques and instruments water sample storage transport and laboratory procedures the dataset was selected to assess the qualitative evolution in space and time of nitrate pollution while being aware of the non homogeneity of the data and the three dimensional vulnerability of the study area the used dataset is composed of nitrate concentrations no3 measured from 1995 to 2021 in groundwater samples from pumping and static wells for 13 575 groundwater samples it is organized into two time periods 1995 2006 and 2007 2021 to evaluate the potential variability of nitrate pollution over time table 1 summarizes the main statistics of nitrate concentrations related to the two selected periods data show an average increase of no3 concentrations over time we can observe a significant increase in nitrate concentrations for pumping and static wells since the first period the maximum value has been significantly higher than the european normative threshold of 50 mg l 1 for pumping and static wells the minimum values are close to zero in both cases the variability of the two analysed dataset compared to the mean value increased in time as demonstrated by the standard deviation sd values reported in table 1 3 methods geostatistic has been a helpful tool for the spatial analysis of countless variables for more than 50 years matheron 1963 however when the variable to describe is characterized by extreme spatial variability such as nitrates using classical geostatistical methods can lead to a misleading representation of the analysed phenomenon in the case of asymmetric distributions the presence of outliers affects the quality of classical geostatistical techniques for prediction at unknown points in the spatial domain this aspect requires a more sophisticated method of selecting the mean of the values if over estimation or under estimation is to be avoided glacken and blackney 1998 in these cases it is more beneficial to use a representation of the phenomenon based on the probability of exceeding fixed thresholds to this end one of the most suitable methods is the indicator kriging ik introduced by journel 1983 it is a spatial interpolation technique aimed at estimating the conditional cumulative distribution function of a variable at an unsampled location in contrast to simple and ordinary kriging the success factor is that ik is a nonparametric method ik does not use the actual values of the variable to be estimated but uses new indicator variables to obtain a prediction about the deals the first step is to establish the thresholds that will then be used to create the cumulative distribution function based on the distribution of the data and initial statistical analysis ik transforms the original data into binary data with 0 if the value exceeds the threshold and 1 if it does not once obtained the binary transformation of the data the procedure is the same as that used for ordinary kriging with a consequent definition of the variogram the prediction made by ik is interpreted as the probability of exceeding the threshold value at an unknown point this is an estimate of the proportion of values in a vicinity of a point that are higher than the indicator or threshold value the essence of the ik method is the definition of an indicator function i x z that can respectively assume the value 1 or 0 depending on the set threshold z k 1 i x z k 1 i f z x z k 0 z k ik does not estimate the indicator variable but provides a method for least squares estimation of the cumulative distribution function at the threshold z k 2 i ˆ x 0 z k e x 0 z k n where n represents the proximity of other values at the point x 0 due to the way the random indicator function i x z is constructed the expected value of i x z corresponds to the cumulative distribution function of the random function z x in fact 3 e i x z 1 p r o b z x z 0 p r o b z x z 4 e i x z p r o b z x z f z therefore the estimation of the indicator variable at threshold z becomes 5 i ˆ x 0 z k e x 0 z k n p r o b z x 0 z n 6 i ˆ x 0 z k i 1 n w x i z i x i z 1 i 1 n w x i z f z in this case the w x i z are the weights assigned to the threshold z the thresholds set for this study follow the 2000 60 ec and 2006 118 ec european water framework directives and are 20 good quality 40 intermediate quality and 50 mg l 1 poor quality as largely used in the scientific literature chica olmo et al 2014 piccini et al 2012 4 results 4 1 statistical analysis a preliminary statistical analysis of nitrate concentrations has been conducted on the whole dataset and for each well to identify their temporal trend for brevity fig 2 reports the nitrate concentration patterns for six monitoring wells that highlight the pollution process detected in the salento aquifer over the last 25 years data indicate a considerable increase in nitrate concentrations over time and exceeding the recommended threshold of the eu nitrate directive nitrate directive 1991 values around 40 mg l 1 are often sampled in the early 1990s e g sal w35 sal w79 and sal w94 wells fig 3 shows nitrate boxplots of the same monitoring wells represented in fig 2 for each well we can observe boxplots as the dataset is divided into two reference periods the mean values of nitrate concentrations were slightly lower than the normative threshold during the first reference period 1995 2006 a remarkable average value rise is instead detected in these wells during the second reference period 2007 2021 ranging from 50 to 60 mg l 1 some outliers above 70 mg l 1 were identified during the second period e g sal w79 as well as in other monitoring wells that are not reported for brevity the sampling results of nitrate concentration values monitored in the two reference periods provide a reconstruction of groundwater quality in salento over time however from a statistical point of view the analysis of the average and maximum values provides a rough idea of the variability of water quality in each monitoring well nevertheless the exceedance of a certain threshold may be an occasional occurrence related to mere instrumental or operator errors to investigate this aspect we calculated frequency curves for a portion of wells 152 for which we had a significant number of samples considering nitrate groundwater samples from 1995 to 2021 for illustrative purposes only fig 4 shows nitrates concentration percent exceedance probability curves mg l 1 for the same selected monitoring wells analysed until now table 2 summarizes the frequency at which the set thresholds were exceeded considering all available wells and depending on the number of samples collected over time for each one of them this information is essential in providing helpful information on the frequency at which certain thresholds were exceeded the frequency curves show that all the considered wells almost exceed the 20 mg l 1 threshold indeed wells exceed this threshold 90 of the time for 96 wells over 152 in contrast the data for 40 and 50 mg l 1 show different results for one third of the wells 48 the 40 mg l 1 threshold exceeded more than 10 of the time while only about one sixth of the wells 22 showed concentration values above 50 mg l 1 for more than 10 of the investigated period most worryingly however the number of wells exceeding the 40 mg l 1 threshold more than 50 of the time is relatively high amounting to around one sixth of those analysed 4 2 indicator kriging analysis indicator kriging analyses were performed to directly estimate the local conditional probabilities of nitrate concentrations for the two reference periods using sampled available wells 277 and 257 wells respectively the thresholds of 20 40 and 50 mg l 1 were selected for the local estimation of the probability content in an unsampled location category maps representing the spatial distribution of these water quality thresholds have been obtained as a result average nitrate concentrations were considered for each available well since no significant differences between wet and dry months were detected in the exploratory analysis of the whole dataset the resulting maps of each reference period and threshold were reported below with the corresponding standard deviation maps that represent a measure of errors the probability of nitrate concentrations above 20 mg l 1 fig 5 greatly expanded throughout the salento aquifer compared with 1995 2006 affecting coastal and inland areas with a percentage exceedance of around 90 the probability of exceeding 40 mg l 1 evolved significantly between the first and second periods from a mean percentage value of 20 to about 60 fig 6 fig 7 represents the nitrate probability maps corresponding to a threshold exceedance of 50 mg l 1 a considerable variation is also observed between the two periods with more than 50 exceeding the threshold for many coastal and inland areas table 3 reports the percentage areas at four probability intervals exceeding the threshold value the areas affected by a probability of exceeding the threshold value of 20 mg l 1 greater than 50 expanded by about half of the total aquifer between the first and second period regarding the threshold of 40 mg l 1 almost the total area of the salento aquifer during the first period presented a probability of exceedance of less than 25 however this percentage area was distributed during the second period with higher exceedance probabilities a similar situation is detected for a threshold of 50 mg l 1 therefore there is an increase in the probability of exceedance with consequent enlargement of the involved zones between the two periods compared to the previous period areas with a probability of exceeding the threshold of under 25 are wider and potentially more vulnerable for the nitrates concentration for nitrates vulnerable zones delineation results obtained by the indicator kriging analysis have shown that the probability of finding high nitrate concentrations in groundwater changed throughout the study area over time it is known that groundwater quality depends on anthropogenic factors including land management livestock activities and the use of pesticides and fertilisers in agriculture can lead to an increase in chemical concentrations in groundwater oyarzun et al 2007 in the absence of a census of agricultural activities distributed in the area it was only possible to investigate whether and how land use could influence water resource pollution for this purpose two corine land cover maps https land copernicus eu global for the years 2000 and 2018 were compared and results are reported in table 4 as percentage variations of land use areas the first row of the table refers to artificial regions while the diagonal reports the areas unchanged over the considered period agricultural land which constitutes about 87 of the study area has not experienced significant changes many of these agricultural areas are mainly planted with olive groves 38 non irrigated arable crops 19 complex cultivation patterns 17 and vineyards 5 the remaining areas include fruit trees berry plantations and permanently irrigated land which are all equally distributed throughout the territory nitrogen surplus data of different agricultural areas were collected to identify areas most vulnerable to nitrate pollution in the water protection plan of the apulia region sogesid 2009 the following values of nitrogen surplus were used 66 kg ha for olive groves 60 kg ha for vineyards 42 kg ha for fruit trees 25 kg ha for temporary crops associated with permanent crops and non irrigated arable crops and 0 kg ha for vegetable and herbaceous crops fig 8 shows the variation in the nitrogen surplus in the agricultural areas from 2000 to 2018 red areas identify territories where the nitrogen surplus has increased over time while the green ones represent the zones where the nitrogen surplus has decreased the remaining areas are those where nitrogen surplus remained unchanged over time i orange pink and blue areas correspond to zones with high medium and low nitrogen surplus respectively ii grey areas refer to zones with no nitrogen surplus iii while the white ones are those where nitrogen surplus was not detected like artificial areas wetlands and water bodies the nitrogen surplus areas identified by comparing the two corine land cover maps do not match those detected by the indicator kriging therefore the nitrate increase observed in the second reference period 2007 2021 seems not to be justified by the results shown in fig 8 the nitrogen surplus is distributed over the entire territory in contrast to the results derived from indicator kriging which instead clearly identify distinct zones potentially affected by nitrate pollution 5 discussion data collected over the last 25 years for the salento region show a somewhat generalised increase trend for groundwater nitrate concentrations moreover this data does not justify the polices adopted at national and regional levels in the nitrates directive 91 676 eec framework results obtained by using the indicator kriging method suggest that the conditional probabilities exceedance of nitrate concentration at three set thresholds is significantly changed between the two reference periods the current situation appears worrying as most of the territory has values exceeding 20 mg l 1 and in a portion of areas higher thresholds are already reached the approach is of considerable interest since it can identify more vulnerable areas without establishing a precise estimate of the physical quantities under investigation despite the high complexity of the case study and the scarce availability of monitoring data results obtained from the adopted approach are satisfactory and could be helpful for programming specific monitoring activities furthermore looking at istat data http dati istat it index aspx queryid 23961 from 2003 to 2020 regarding the distribution of fertilisers for agricultural use in the apulia region including fertilisers soil conditioners and correctives an essential reduction in total nitrogen input is reported fig 9 demonstrates a general reduction in the distribution of fertilisers with a sharp reduction from 2014 additionally data indicate a percentage reduction of 95 45 in total fertilisers and 95 95 for nitrates nitrogen fertilizer used to exclude the origin of nitrate concentrations from wastewater discharges we also verified the spatial distribution of sewage treatment systems with final discharge into the superficial soil layers it turns out that there is no relationship between the location of these systems and the areas that are most affected to nitrate pollution several studies have demonstrated that it can take decades for nitrates leached from the soil to reach groundwater due to the temporary deposition and accumulation of long nitrates in the unsaturated zone wang et al 2013 a similar process can cause a long delay between the input of nitrates into the soil and the change in nitrate concentrations in groundwater moreover stuart et al 2010 demonstrated that the residence time of nitrate recorded in the malta s deep aquifer a karst system much similar to our case study can be estimated in about 25 years in addition isotopic analyses could help understanding the potential sources of this increasing nitrate concentrations in groundwater heaton et al 2012 the calculation of the time lag is of critical importance from a policy and monitoring perspective bain et al 2012 numerous factors influence the effectiveness of water policies and environmental management strategies some of these do not depend on anthropogenic pressure such as the hydrological and biochemical factors the latter can lead to a substantial delay in the arrival of nitrates in groundwater with peak concentrations being observed long after environmental regulations and policies to reduce nitrogen input have been introduced sometimes this process can frustrate governments expectations of immediate results in the presence of nitrates in the subsoil or even be misleading in the eyes of those who read these data superficially policymakers must know a priori this time lag before defining the most suitable environmental policy since groundwater s response time affects the success of the implemented mitigation measures huebsch et al 2013 moreover they need to have a clear idea on the regional hydrodynamics and evolution mechanisms of the aquifers however current environmental management strategies rarely consider the existence of this nitrate time lag vero et al 2018 but assume a rapid response of water quality to land management practices and reduced nitrogen input that should lead to a decrease of nitrate concentrations in groundwater burt et al 2011 recent literature wriedt and rode 2006 lasagna et al 2015 wang et al 2016 has shown that the correlation between the success of a legislative instrument and the current state of water quality is not always assured sometimes groundwater quality does not depend on causes that can be attributed to the immediate but sometimes to causes further back in time if the situation is already naturally complex due to the aforementioned factors the process becomes even more intricate in karstic systems huebsch et al 2013 highlighted the key controlling factors that regulate and control nitrate mobilisation in karst systems the combination of land use hydrological conditions and the type of karst can lead to different responses in nitrate concentrations wang et al 2022 a general slow response to recharge processes was already observed for the salento aquifer balacco et al 2022a and balacco et al 2022b verified with different methodologies that the effect of precipitation is reflected in the salento aquifer after hundreds of days this response varies depending on the investigated area and the event intensity it is also essential to examine the role of hydrochemistry in this system because for example prevailing or reducing environments may lead to high nitrogen concentrations but in the reduced forms of nitrogen not nitrates these aspects could also justify the spatial variability of nitrate concentrations detected in this study some areas may have already dissipated these effects while in other areas of salento we are still experiencing the peaks caused by the massive use of fertilisers and pesticides in the past 6 conclusions the data from analyses carried out on wells in the salento region over 25 years albeit with the limits of sampling carried out at different times and not always in the same wells provide a worrying description of the quality status of the salento aquifer nitrate concentrations have risen sharply since 2006 and average values currently stand at thresholds very close to the limits set by the nitrates directive the probability of exceeding the set thresholds outlines a critical situation regarding nitrate pollution as most of the territory has experienced an increase over the past 25 years that is gradually affecting large areas however the data on land use change over the period under investigation and the distribution of nitrate producing fertilisers are apparently unrelated to the nitrate concentrations observed in the second reference period from 2007 onwards nevertheless the data kept in the most recent period could be justified by the time lag observed in many cases cited in the literature mcdowell et al 2021 weitzman et al 2022 if this were true it would be enough to wait for the arrival of a recessionary limb that would bring nitrate concentration values back from their peaks to more moderate values finally groundwater quality data will be consistent with current regulations and practices that tend to reduce the causes of deteriorating groundwater quality this result is a crucial advice for future groundwater monitoring planning as it outlines a challenging situation in managing the resources groundwater quality improvement in response to implementing practices that should reduce pollution is delayed in time and therefore difficult to control the adopted geostatistical method represents a novelty in the framework of nitrate pollution s spatial and temporal evolution the indicator kriging represents a valuable instrument to identify the most prone areas to nitrates contamination in case sample points are non homogeneously distributed in this case classical geostatistical alternatives would lead to the groundwater nitrate concentration map not being statistically correct the method used in this work could be a viable tool to identify the most vulnerable areas to groundwater pollution that are already affected by a specific pollutant and plan specific future monitoring and mitigation measures however a critical issue concerns the historical timing of this nitrate pollution in fact due to high nitrate travel time it is tricky to argue whether the current concentrations are already the response to mitigation measures or are still a reflection of past pollution for this purpose it is essential to constantly monitor data on groundwater quality attempting to clarify whether what appears today is merely the result of the uncontrolled use of fertilisers up to the first decade of the current century to this end apart from considering the data on total nitrogen input in the region it would be useful to deploy a monitoring program on the residual nitrogen in soil following the completion of the cultivation period along with the total applied nitrogen following the basic fertilization period the uncertainty of where precisely the nitrates come from and the time lag of their transfer to the deep aquifer provide
