6525,a single fracture is the basic unit of fracture medium and the roughness of the fracture surface is an important factor influencing hydraulic characteristics of the flow in bedrock fracture however effects of the shape and density of roughness elements various bulges pits on rough fracture wall surfaces on water flow in a single fracture have not been thoroughly understood thus the water flow in a single fracture with different shapes and densities of roughness elements was simulated by using fluent software in this study the results showed that the existence of roughness elements could enhance the flow resistance and cause nonlinear flow the shape difference of roughness elements i e the value variation of the included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness element and the streamline direction could change their influence degree on the flow regime increasing the density of roughness elements could bring more violent turbulent reduce the relative aperture of fracture and decrease the discharge per unit width correspondingly with the increase of flow velocity forchheimer equation could fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient better than izbash equation in addition the variation of flow regime in rough fracture from laminar flow to turbulent flow was a process of the gradual dominance of inertial force

fracture could be related to many engineering practices such as underground engineering geotechnical applications hydropower engineering petroleum reservoir exploitation mining and geothermal energy extraction and liquid waste disposal brown 1987 cook 1992 berkowitz 2002 molinero et al 2002 chen et al 2008 pan et al 2010 wu et al 2011 wen et al 2013 chen et al 2015 qian et al 2015 ren et al 2015 qian et al 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 dou et al 2018a single fracture is the basic unit of bedrock fractures which include complex fracture 3d three dimensional fracture and fracture network and roughness of fracture surface follow the self affine distribution brandt et al 1993 schmittbuhl et al 1993 hence some of the research results on single fracture flow can be extended to the study on the complex fracture 3d fracture and fracture network being discovered in 1856 the darcy s law at low flow velocity had been widely applied in porous medium and fracture medium qian et al 2005 wang et al 2013 rong et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 with the increase of flow velocity or the appearance of eddies near rough surface in fracture medium nonlinear flow would usually occur and the darcy s law was not suitable for describing the flow in fracture then how to describe the flow in fracture became a problem snow 1968 firstly carried out the flow experiment in smooth parallel plates fracture and proposed the famous local cubic law lcl indicating that the discharge per unit width in fracture is proportional to the three power of the fracture aperture after that the single fracture was usually simplified as a pair of smooth parallel plates and cubic law was usually employed to characterize the water flow in the fracture media wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 however because the influence of surface roughness was neglected the model of smooth parallel plates seemed to be oversimplified and the cubic law based on smooth parallel plates had some shortcomings such as the overestimation of velocity and flow witherspoon et al 1980 brown et al 1995 ge 1997 nicholl et al 2011 rong et al 2017 despite these shortcomings the cubic law still had some applicability in rough fracture flow but it must be revised to accurately describe the water flow in fracture a lot of work had been done to reveal the relationship between the discharge and the aperture in rough fracture and many theories to improve and modify the cubic law had been proposed brush and thomson 2003 qian et al 2007 wang et al 2015 roughness is an important factor affecting fracture flow when the fluid flowed through a rough fracture the fluid streamline close to the rough wall surface might be disturbed and intercepted by the roughness elements then small backflows which referred in particular to the eddies caused by roughness elements blocking nearby streamlines might occur in the spaces between the roughness elements not all roughness elements could lead to backflows inevitably but once backflow occurs the whole flow would be affected by it more or less chen et al 2017 meanwhile the existence of eddies indirectly narrowed down the flow channel increased the resistance of solute transport and then enhanced the characteristics of non fickian transport dou et al 2018b water flow and solute transport in the fracture could be affected by fracture roughness tortuosity and aperture so fracture aperture is another important factor affecting fracture flow louis 1974 brown 1987 wang and su 2002 mallikamas and rajaram 2010 qian et al 2011a for the fracture medium the fracture aperture is the vertical distance between adjacent fracture walls the aperture value is a constant in ideal fracture between smooth parallel plates while it is a variable due to the rough and uneven surface of the actual fracture moreover the backflow also indirectly reduced the aperture of the actually flow path renshaw 1995 chaudhary et al 2011 in 2d two dimensional rough fracture because the eddies indirectly narrowed down the flow channel of the water the effective fracture aperture decreased and the reduced value of effective fracture aperture was two times the average height of roughness elements du 2000 but if the relative roughness the ratio of roughness element height to fracture aperture was less than 0 033 the effect of roughness on the flow could be neglected li et al 2016 chen et al 2017 in order to study the mechanism of nonlinear flow some scholars applied izbash equation and forchheimer equation to fracture medium respectively which were previously used only in porous media to describe nonlinear flow when the reynolds number the ratio of liquid inertia force to viscous force also re ρvd μ where ρ v and μ are the density velocity and viscous coefficient of the fluid d is a characteristic length was over 20 the flow q and hydraulic gradient j in the cubic law would present the square relationship as showed in forchheimer model zimmerman 2004 chaudhary et al 2011 in a word these two formulas darcy s law and cubic law so far can not clearly describe the relationship among the discharge roughness and aperture of the rough fracture clearly therefore it is necessary to explore the flow characteristics which is particularly affected by the shape and density of roughness elements in a single fracture and to further explore the relationship between roughness fracture aperture flow rate and hydraulic gradient previous studies mostly based on the combination of theoretical derivation and physical simulation in recent years with the development and application of computer and new technology numerical simulation has been applied to the research field of fractured water the numerical simulation is a supplement to the physical simulation experiment it can save cost and manpower and show intuitive and visual results the finite difference method has been used to simulate the flow and solute transport in a real fracture and the three dimensional laser scanning method has been employed to measure the surface and aperture of the fracture medium lanaro 2000 lespinasse and sausse 2000 bryant et al 2003 fluent is a popular commercial cfd computational fluid dynamics software package in the world recently it has been widely used to simulate complex flow from incompressible to highly compressible so it is also suitable for the study of fracture water flow zhou et al 2003 ma et al 2007 liu et al 2008 balogh et al 2012 xu et al 2014 based on this the current work will use the numerical simulation method to study on fracture flow roughness elements fracture aperture hydraulic gradient and their relationships it should be pointed out that either the roughness or tortuosity of the fracture has an effect on the flow when both of them act simultaneously their respective influence factors can not be distinguished in order to avoid confusion roughness will be taken as the main research object in this study without considering the effect of fracture tortuosity on flow by using fluent software the current work aims to 1 simulate the water flow in a single fracture under the conditions of different densities of roughness elements with triangle rectangular and sinusoidal models and give the visualization results 2 investigate the influence of shape and density of roughness elements on flow regime velocity and discharge per unit width 3 simulate the variation trend from laminar flow to turbulent flow and analyze the flow mechanism in a single fracture 2 theoretical background of fracture water flow in fracture 2 1 basic equations of water flow in fracture the flow velocity in the fracture between ideal smooth parallel plates could be described as the flowing equation 1 u x dp 2 μ y 2 e 2 2 u y 0 where e is the aperture of

bodvarsson 1996 the darcy s law 3 q k a dp dx the permeability coefficient is obtained through eqs 2 and 3 4 k e 2 12 μ the eq 4 shows that the permeability coefficient k is affected both by the fracture medium characteristic e and the flow characteristic μ where e is the aperture of fracture and μ is the fluid motion viscosity coefficient 2 2 discharge per unit width the cubic law lcl shows that in fracture section the discharge per unit width is proportional to the three power of the fracture aperture 5 q g e 3 12 μ j where q is discharge per unit width g is gravitational acceleration j

known as joint roughness coefficient which denotes the degree of roughness of fracture surface the value of δ in discontinuous rough fracture is 4 and in smooth flat fracture is 0 5 recently wang et al 2015 put forward more advanced mclc theory modified lcl which further improved the modified version of lcl by louis 1967 and brush and thomson 2003 2 3 nonlinear theory of water flow in fracture the flow motion in an actual fracture is so complicated that it s very difficult to find a universal equation to describe it so far some empirical or semi empirical formulas are generally used during which the forchheimer equation and the izbash equation are commonly used forchheimer equation 8 j a v b v 2 where j is hydraulic gradient v is average velocity of flow a b are the ratio of influence of viscous force and inertia force to the loss of water head respectively izbash equation 9 j m v n where m n are empirical constants the value of exponent n is between 1 0 and 2 0 3 designation of numerical model in a rough single fracture 3 1 physical model this study mainly considers the effects of density and shape of roughness elements on streamlines fig 1 illustrates the flow regime near the roughness elements in the fracture the roughness elements density a can be expressed as the ratio b a of roughness elements interval distance b to the height a of the rough elements a 2d fracture model was employed in the simulation in the model one fracture wall was rough while another one was smooth the length of the fracture was set as 100 mm in the model and the height fracture aperture was 3 4 5 6 and 7 mm respectively the size of the z direction was ignored and the default value was 1000 mm the water flows in the fractures with different shapes of roughness elements triangular rectangular and trapezoidal were individually simulated here the roughness elements of triangle sine and rectangle which could approximately represent the shapes of most of the real bulges pits on rough surface were selected for the simulation in the current work and the value of included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of three kinds of roughness elements and the streamline direction increased gradually which could roughly cover the angle range of 40 90 meanwhile the density values of roughness elements were from small to large which corresponded to various situations of real fracture from smooth to rough the height of roughness elements a was set as 1 mm and the density of roughness elements was a a b a where b was the distance between the axes of adjacent roughness elements and the value of b was 4 5 and 6 mm respectively the model and mesh structure diagrams are shown in figs 2 to 10 and the size was 0 2 0 2 mm the mesh size was much smaller than the fracture aperture or the roughness elements size so the influence of mesh size on the flow field could be ignored 3 2 governing equation and turbulence model the continuity equation and momentum equation of fluid can be expressed as follows 10 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 11 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x i p x i x i μ μ t u i x j u j x i where ρ is density t is time u i and u j are velocity components x i

applications but it is only suitable for the simulation of completely turbulent flow process rng k ε model and realizable k ε model are better for solving the problems of low reynolds number and near wall flow calculation especially the latter has better prediction results for phenomena including rotation boundary layer with large backpressure gradient separation and backflow wang 2017 yan et al 2015 considering the effect of boundary layer separation and the occurrence of eddies on the flow field in the fracture media the realizable k ε model was chosen in the simulation and the wall surface

dimensional double precision 2ddp three dimensional single precision 3d and three dimensional double precision 3ddp when single precision operation is used the memory consumption is small and the operation speed is fast so the single precision calculation can satisfy the general situation for meshes with large area ratio high heat conductivity closed areas with large pressure difference connected by multiple small diameter narrow calculation area and single precision can not meet the requirements double precision should be considered in this simulation the computational domain length is 100 mm and the maximum width was 7 mm the single precision calculation could meet the demand so the single precision two dimensional solver 2d was chosen fluent has three kinds of solver namely segregated solver coupled solver implicit and coupled solver explicit the difference between separated solution and coupled solution is that the methods of solving continuum equation momentum equation energy equation and component equation are different separated solution is generally used to calculate incompressible flow and the convergence rate is faster coupled solutions are often used to calculate high speed compressible flows in this simulation incompressible flow was studied by using segregated solver some other settings time option was steady space option was 2d two dimensional

and discussion 4 1 numerical simulation results a 2d model was employed to simulate the water flow in a rough single fracture the shapes of roughness elements were triangular rectangular and sinusoidal the densities a of roughness elements were 4 5 and 6 respectively and the roughness element height was 1 mm because the variation trends of numerical simulation under the same conditions were similar the simulation results of three different roughness elements under the condition of different densities between 4 and 6 and the reynolds number 2000 are listed here the enlarged views of the velocity distribution nephogram corresponding to the three shapes of roughness elements triangular rectangular and sinusoidal are shown in figs 11 13 as illustrated by the figs 11 13 the streamlines near the roughness elements were very complicated and the flow motions were different in the fractures with different roughness elements shapes this phenomenon could be due to the variation of the shapes of roughness elements when the water flowed aside the roughness elements the streamlines would be hindered by roughness elements thereafter backflow phenomenon might occur inducing the streamlines near the wall surface separated from the origin streamline and attached it again see fig 1 and all of them would bring resistance for the flow so the roughness elements could induce the occurrence of vortexes and increase the flow resistance as shown from figs 11 12 and 13 rectangle roughness elements had the greatest impact on water flow and triangular roughness elements had the least influence on it the value of angle is rectangle sine triangle the result might be correlated with the value of the angle between the tangent and streamline direction at the beginning of the roughness element meanwhile as shown from figs 11 12 and 13 turbulence of flow might be strengthened with an increase of roughness elements density indicating that the motion of water flow in fracture could be affected by the densities of roughness elements significantly for the fracture with three kinds of densities of roughness elements higher roughness density decreased the effective average aperture of fracture thus indirectly increased the relative roughness the ratio of the height of roughness element to the average fracture aperture the height of the roughness element was a fixed value hence the phenomenon of turbulence became obvious with the increase of the density of roughness elements consequently the relative roughness was an important parameter in investigating flow in fracture water flow had pressure on the surface of fracture wall the roughness elements affected the original straight flow streamline and the backflows and vortices would cause the redistribution of pressure the pressure distribution nephograms of rough fracture are shown in figs 14 to 16 as shown in the figures the maximum pressure was near the entrance of the fracture and the farther away from the entrance the less obvious the pressure redistribution was with the increase of the density of the roughness elements the pressure redistribution at the entrance tended to be obvious but the influence distance decreased because of the strong influence on the flow motion induced by the rectangular roughness elements the pressure redistribution mainly concentrated on those roughness elements near the entrance 4 2 discharge per unit width and hydraulic gradient based on the ideal smooth parallel plate fracture model the cubic law indicated that the discharge per unit width q was proportional to the three power of the fracture aperture e however it must be modified for the sake of the influence of roughness element on the water flow motion in the actual fracture in this paper the modified formula of louis was employed to calculate the value of discharge per unit width and the value was compared with the simulated value q0 qm and ql were the values of discharge per unit width obtained from the cubic law numerical simulation and louis modified formula eq 6 respectively a represented the degree of density of roughness elements a b a in order to study the effect of the density of roughness elements on the discharge per unit width three values of density 4 5 and 6 were set to calculate the discharge per unit width corresponded different shapes and densities of roughness elements in a single fracture table 1 shows the details for the discharge per unit width of different shapes and densities of roughness elements the discharges per unit width calculated by using the cubic law numerical simulation and louis modified formula eq 6 for the triangular roughness element are shown in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the values of the discharges per unit width calculated by the three methods were close at the lower velocity with the increase of the hydraulic gradient j the variation of the discharge per unit width increased correspondingly by comparing the calculated values under different roughness elements densities it was found that the difference between the simulated value and calculated value of cubic law decreased with the increase of the density of the roughness elements indicating that the density of the roughness elements influenced the discharge per unit width the increase of roughness element density would result in smaller discharge when the roughness element shape was triangle the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 4 to 6 times of simulated qm and 2 to 3 times of louis modified formula value ql the discharge per unit width value based on cubic law was overestimated and this result was consistent with the existing research conclusions brown et al 1995 nicholl and detwiler 2011 witherspoon et al 1980 therefore the lcl should be revised it can be seen in the mclc theory wang et al 2015 when the roughness element shape was rectangle the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 2 to 3 times of the simulated qm and 3 to 5 times of ql calculated with louis modified formula when the roughness element shape was sine the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 1 2 to 2 times of the simulated qm and 4 to 5 times of the value of ql calculated with louis modified formula the results showed that the shape of roughness elements also influenced the discharge per unit width the discharge per unit width calculated by cubic law was obviously larger and the deviation value of triangular roughness element could be more than 5 times while the discharge calculated by the modified cubic law was close to the simulated value because of the intense effect on the flow motion induced by the rectangular roughness elements both the simulation value and the calculation value by modified cubic law in rectangular roughness elements fracture were always smaller than the value in triangle or sine roughness elements fracture 4 3 average flow velocity and hydraulic gradient the flow regime of water in fractured media can be divided into laminar flow transitional flow and turbulent flow according to reynolds number and it can also be named linear flow and non linear flow according to the relationship between velocity and hydraulic gradient flow in real fracture is very complex and non linear flow might occur in laminar flow chaudhary et al 2011 when the velocity is small the viscous force dominates and the average velocity is linear with the hydraulic gradient when the velocity gradually increases to a certain value the inertia force dominates and the average velocity becomes non linear with the hydraulic gradient suggesting the unsuitability of darcy s law for describing their relationship hence empirical or semi empirical formulas were used to describe it during which the forchheimer equation and the izbash equation are commonly used in order to find out the relationship between the average velocity of water flow and hydraulic gradient in a single rough fracture taking triangular roughness element as an example darcy s law forchheimer equation and izbash equation were used to fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient respectively the results are shown in fig 18 as shown in fig 18 the nonlinear relationship between them was obvious when the velocity stayed a small value both forchheimer equation and izbash equation could fit well the relationship between the average velocity of water flow and hydraulic gradient with the increasing of velocity forchheimer equation fitted it better than izbash equation did to investigate the effects of the shape and density of roughness elements on the flow average velocity and hydraulic gradient some different roughness elements were chosen to simulate the flow motion the height of roughness elements was set as 1 mm the shapes were respectively triangle rectangles and sinusoids and the densities were set as 4 5 and 6 respectively the simulation result is shown in fig 19 in the fracture medium with different shapes and densities roughness elements it was obviously that there was always a nonlinear relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient the v j relationship curves corresponding to roughness elements with different shapes were various suggesting that the shape of roughness element could affect the varying speed of average velocity when the fracture was under the condition of same shape but different densities of the roughness elements the corresponding curves of v j relationship were also different the denser the distribution of roughness elements was the faster the velocity changed it should be noted that the linear and nonlinear relationships in this paper were darcy and non darcy relationships respectively it was different from the laminar and turbulent flows in hydraulics because laminar flows included both darcy and non darcy flows and turbulence flow must be non darcy one for the sake of the complexity of the mechanism of nonlinear flow some empirical or semi empirical formulas such as izbash equation and forchheimer equation were used to replace darcy s law to study nonlinear flow table 2 shows the fitting and analyzing results of the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient when forchheimer equation was used the fitting effect was pretty good and the correlation coefficients were always more than 0 999 the simulation results in table 2 also showed that in fracture medium with triangular rectangular and sinusoidal roughness elements the relative fracture aperture decreased with the increase of the density of roughness elements inducing the increase of relative roughness correspondingly the coefficient value of quadratic term in the forchheimer equation increased 4 4 process of laminar flow to turbulent flow when the semi empirical forchheimer equation was used to study the nonlinear flow the result showed that the laminar flow could transfer to turbulent flow gradually with an increase of ν in forchheimer equation j aν bν 2 aν was one order term and meant the linear effect of viscous force and bv 2 was quadratic term and meant the super linear effect of inertial force at the initial stage of seepage flow the velocity value is small at which time the viscous force dominated and the flow remained laminar with the increase of velocity the influence of inertial force on flow increased gradually when the velocity increased to a certain value which was usually called critical velocity the influence of inertial force gradually exceeded the viscous force thus the nonlinear flow got strengthened with an increase of quadratic coefficient induced by velocity in order to study the physical meaning of forchheimer equation which could describe the characteristic of the forchheimer flow clearly the linear jv aν and the quadratic terms ji bν2 in forchheimer equation were studied here in general the two terms were considered as the water head loses caused primarily by the viscosity and the inertial forces respectively with this notation eq 8 becomes 17 j j v j i when ji jv the inertial flow is dominating when jv ji the viscous flow is dominating if ji and jv are at the same order of magnitude both inertial and viscous flows should be considered by comparing the values of jv j and ji j flow condition can be analyzed qian et al 2011b triangular roughness element was chosen to simulate the rough single fracture medium with five different apertures a 3 mm b 4 mm c 5 mm d 6 mm and e 7 mm and the effect of the variation of the fracture apertures on the critical velocity corresponding to jv ji was studied here the height of roughness elements was 1 mm and with the mechanical fracture aperture increased the corresponding relative roughness decreased the simulation results are shown in fig 20 when jv ji the viscous force dominated and the flow was laminar flow with the increase of velocity jv ji the influence of inertia force gradually exceeded the viscous force and it turned into a nonlinear flow slowly when jv was far below ji jv ji turbulent flow occurred fig 20 indicated that one order term in forchheimer equation gradually decreases and the quadratic term gradually increased and dominated in accordance with the results of qian et al 2011b as shown in fig 20 the corresponding critical velocities velocity of laminar flow converting to turbulence of fracture aperture a b c d and e are 0 0054 m s 0 0056 m s 0 0071 m s 0 0078 m s and 0 00844 m s respectively hence the velocity of laminar turbulent transition increased with a decrease of relative roughness the larger the relative roughness the smaller and the more sensitive the critical velocity was indicating the earlier appearance of the critical velocity consequently the wall roughness was an important factor affecting the flow characteristics in fractured medium due to the small fracture aperture in general the effects of roughness elements and fracture aperture on fracture flow through 2d simulation were discussed here without considering the effect of fracture tortuosity crossed fractures fracture network and 3d fracture flow characteristics to better understand the fracture flow mechanism the effect of above factors would be the focus of the future research after all 2d fracture is only a highly simplified model while 3d fracture flow and larger scale fracture media are more complex and closer to the condition in a real fracture 5 conclusion effects of the shape density and height of roughness elements and the aperture of fracture on the water flow were investigated by using a 2d physical model in fluent simulation software the main conclusions are drawn as followings 1 in a single fracture the phenomena of backflow flow streamlines separation and reattachment the origin streamlines route would occur when the water flowed through roughness elements and consequently the flow resistance grew bigger the value of included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness elements and the streamline direction could change the influence degree on the flow motion and bigger angle value would bring more violent turbulent with the increase of the density of roughness elements the influence on water flow got strengthened and the phenomenon of turbulence tended to be obvious all the above conclusions had been visualized by numerical simulation 2 because of the reason of the above included angle value the rectangular roughness elements affected the water flow more seriously so the discharge per unit width in rectangular roughness element fracture was smaller than those of triangle and sinusoidal when the density of roughness elements increased the discharge per unit width decreased the value of discharge per unit width calculated by louis modified formula was more close to the simulated value 3 in rough fracture medium the nonlinear relationship between the average velocity and hydraulic gradient appeared obvious when the velocity is small both forchheimer equation and izbash equation could fit well the relationship between the average velocity and hydraulic gradient with the increasing of velocity forchheimer equation fitted it better than izbash equation did with the increase of density of the roughness elements the nonlinear relationship between the flow velocity and the hydraulic gradient became more obvious 4 the phenomenon of rough fracture water from laminar flow to turbulent flow was indeed a process that a decrease of viscous force and an increase and gradual dominance of inertial force which had been described by the forchheimer equation with the increase of the relative roughness of the fracture the critical velocity trended to decrease and the turbulent flow would appear earlier acknowledgements this study was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 41831289 grant no 41772250 grant no

6525,a single fracture is the basic unit of fracture medium and the roughness of the fracture surface is an important factor influencing hydraulic characteristics of the flow in bedrock fracture however effects of the shape and density of roughness elements various bulges pits on rough fracture wall surfaces on water flow in a single fracture have not been thoroughly understood thus the water flow in a single fracture with different shapes and densities of roughness elements was simulated by using fluent software in this study the results showed that the existence of roughness elements could enhance the flow resistance and cause nonlinear flow the shape difference of roughness elements i e the value variation of the included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness element and the streamline direction could change their influence degree on the flow regime increasing the density of roughness elements could bring more violent turbulent reduce the relative aperture of fracture and decrease the discharge per unit width correspondingly with the increase of flow velocity forchheimer equation could fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient better than izbash equation in addition the variation of flow regime in rough fracture from laminar flow to turbulent flow was a process of the gradual dominance of inertial force

the complex fracture 3d fracture and fracture network being discovered in 1856 the darcy s law at low flow velocity had been widely applied in porous medium and fracture medium qian et al 2005 wang et al 2013 rong et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 with the increase of flow velocity or the appearance of eddies near rough surface in fracture medium nonlinear flow would usually occur and the darcy s law was not suitable for describing the flow in fracture then how to describe the flow in fracture became a problem snow 1968 firstly carried out the flow experiment in smooth parallel plates fracture and proposed the famous local cubic law lcl indicating that the discharge per unit width in fracture is proportional to the three power of the fracture aperture after that the single fracture was usually simplified as a pair of smooth parallel plates and cubic law was usually employed to characterize the water flow in the fracture media wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 however because the influence of surface roughness was neglected the model of smooth parallel plates seemed to be oversimplified and the cubic law based on smooth parallel plates had some shortcomings such as the overestimation of velocity and flow witherspoon et al 1980 brown et al 1995 ge 1997 nicholl et al 2011 rong et al 2017 despite these shortcomings the cubic law still had some applicability in rough fracture flow but it must be revised to accurately describe the water flow in fracture a lot of work had been done to reveal the relationship between the discharge and the aperture in rough fracture and many theories to improve and modify the cubic law had been proposed brush and thomson 2003 qian et al 2007 wang et al 2015 roughness is an important factor affecting fracture flow when the fluid flowed through a rough fracture the fluid streamline close to the rough wall surface might be disturbed and intercepted by the roughness elements then small backflows which referred in particular to the eddies caused by roughness elements blocking nearby streamlines might occur in the spaces between the roughness elements not all roughness elements could lead to backflows inevitably but once backflow occurs the whole flow would be affected by it more or less chen et al 2017 meanwhile the existence of eddies indirectly narrowed down the flow channel increased the resistance of solute transport and then enhanced the characteristics of non fickian transport dou et al 2018b water flow and solute transport in the fracture could be affected by fracture roughness tortuosity and aperture so fracture aperture is another important factor affecting fracture flow louis 1974 brown 1987 wang and su 2002 mallikamas and rajaram 2010 qian et al 2011a for the fracture medium the fracture aperture is the vertical distance between adjacent fracture walls the aperture value is a constant in ideal fracture between smooth parallel plates while it is a variable due to the rough and uneven surface of the actual fracture moreover the backflow also indirectly reduced the aperture of the actually flow path renshaw 1995 chaudhary et al 2011 in 2d two dimensional rough fracture because the eddies indirectly narrowed down the flow channel of the water the effective fracture aperture decreased and the reduced value of effective fracture aperture was two times the average height of roughness elements du 2000 but if the relative roughness the ratio of roughness element height to fracture aperture was less than 0 033 the effect of roughness on the flow could be neglected li et al 2016 chen et al 2017 in order to study the mechanism of nonlinear flow some scholars applied izbash equation and forchheimer equation to fracture medium respectively which were previously used only in porous media to describe nonlinear flow when the reynolds number the ratio of liquid inertia force to viscous force also re ρvd μ where ρ v and μ are the density velocity and viscous coefficient of the fluid d is a characteristic length was over 20 the flow q and hydraulic gradient j in the cubic law would present the square relationship as showed in forchheimer model zimmerman 2004 chaudhary et al 2011 in a word these two formulas darcy s law and cubic law so far can not clearly describe the relationship among the discharge roughness and aperture of the rough fracture clearly therefore it is necessary to explore the flow characteristics which is particularly affected by the shape and density of roughness elements in a single fracture and to further explore the relationship between roughness fracture aperture flow rate and hydraulic gradient previous studies mostly based on the combination of theoretical derivation and physical simulation in recent years with the development and application of computer and new technology numerical simulation has been applied to the research field of fractured water the numerical simulation is a supplement to the physical simulation experiment it can save cost and manpower and show intuitive and visual results the finite difference method has been used to simulate the flow and solute transport in a real fracture and the three dimensional laser scanning method has been employed to measure the surface and aperture of the fracture medium lanaro 2000 lespinasse and sausse 2000 bryant et al 2003 fluent is a popular commercial cfd computational fluid dynamics software package in the world recently it has been widely used to simulate complex flow from incompressible to highly compressible so it is also suitable for the study of fracture water flow zhou et al 2003 ma et al 2007 liu et al 2008 balogh et al 2012 xu et al 2014 based on this the current work will use the numerical simulation method to study on fracture flow roughness elements fracture aperture hydraulic gradient and their relationships it should be pointed out that either the roughness or tortuosity of the fracture has an effect on the flow when both of them act simultaneously their respective influence factors can not be distinguished in order to avoid confusion roughness will be taken as the main research object in this study without considering the effect of fracture tortuosity on flow by using fluent software the current work aims to 1 simulate the water flow in a single fracture under the conditions of different densities of roughness elements with triangle rectangular and sinusoidal models and give the visualization results 2 investigate the influence of shape and density of roughness elements on flow regime velocity and discharge per unit width 3 simulate the variation trend from laminar flow to turbulent flow and analyze the flow mechanism in a single fracture 2 theoretical background of fracture water flow in fracture 2 1 basic equations of water flow in fracture the flow velocity in the fracture between ideal smooth parallel plates could be described as the flowing equation 1 u x dp 2 μ y 2 e 2 2 u y 0 where e is the aperture of

bodvarsson 1996 the darcy s law 3 q k a dp dx the permeability coefficient is obtained through eqs 2 and 3 4 k e 2 12 μ the eq 4 shows that the permeability coefficient k is affected both by the fracture medium characteristic e and the flow characteristic μ where e is the aperture of fracture and μ is the fluid motion viscosity coefficient 2 2 discharge per unit width the cubic law lcl shows

known as joint roughness coefficient which denotes the degree of roughness of fracture surface the value of δ in discontinuous rough fracture is 4 and in smooth flat fracture is 0 5 recently wang et al 2015 put forward more advanced mclc theory modified lcl which further improved the modified version of lcl by louis 1967 and brush and thomson 2003 2 3 nonlinear theory of water flow in fracture the flow motion in an actual fracture is so complicated that it s very difficult to find a universal equation to describe it so far some empirical or semi empirical formulas are generally used during which the forchheimer equation and the izbash equation are commonly used forchheimer equation 8 j a v b v 2 where j is hydraulic gradient v is average velocity of flow a b are the ratio of influence of viscous force and inertia force to the loss of water head respectively izbash equation 9 j m v n where m n are empirical constants the value of exponent n is between 1 0 and 2 0 3 designation of numerical model in a rough single fracture 3 1 physical model this study mainly considers the effects of density and shape of roughness elements on streamlines fig 1 illustrates the flow regime near the roughness elements in the fracture the roughness elements density a can be expressed as the ratio b a of roughness elements interval distance b to the height a of the rough elements a 2d fracture model was employed in the simulation in the model one fracture wall was rough while another one was smooth the length of the fracture was set as 100 mm in the model and the height fracture aperture was 3 4 5 6 and 7 mm respectively the size of the z direction was ignored and the default value was 1000 mm the water flows in the fractures with different shapes of roughness elements triangular rectangular and trapezoidal were individually simulated here the roughness elements of triangle sine and rectangle which could approximately represent the shapes of most of the real bulges pits on rough surface were selected for the simulation in the current work and the value of included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of three kinds of roughness elements and the streamline direction increased gradually which could roughly cover the angle range of 40 90 meanwhile the density values of roughness elements were from small to large which corresponded to various situations of real fracture from smooth to rough the height of roughness elements a was set as 1 mm and the density of roughness elements was a a b a where b was the distance between the axes of adjacent roughness elements and the value of b was 4 5 and 6 mm respectively the model and mesh structure diagrams are shown in figs 2 to 10 and the size was 0 2 0 2 mm the mesh size was much smaller than the fracture aperture or the roughness elements size so the influence of mesh size on the flow field could be ignored 3 2 governing equation and turbulence model the continuity equation and

applications but it is only suitable for the simulation of completely turbulent flow process rng k ε model and realizable k ε model are better for solving the problems of low reynolds number and near

2015 considering the effect of boundary layer separation and the occurrence of eddies on the flow field in the fracture media the realizable k ε model was chosen in the simulation and the wall surface

dimensional double precision 2ddp three dimensional single precision 3d and three dimensional double precision 3ddp when single precision operation is used the memory consumption is small and the operation speed is fast so the single precision calculation can satisfy the general situation for meshes with large area ratio high heat conductivity closed areas with large pressure difference connected by multiple small diameter narrow calculation area and single precision can not meet the requirements double precision should be considered in this simulation the computational domain length is 100 mm and the maximum width was 7 mm the single precision calculation could meet the demand so the single precision two dimensional solver 2d was chosen fluent has three kinds of solver namely segregated solver coupled solver implicit and coupled solver explicit the difference between separated solution and coupled solution is that the methods of solving continuum equation momentum equation energy equation and component equation are different separated solution is generally used to calculate incompressible flow and the convergence rate is faster coupled solutions are often used to calculate high speed compressible flows in this simulation incompressible flow was studied by using segregated solver some other settings time option was steady space option was 2d two dimensional

and discussion 4 1 numerical simulation results a 2d model was employed to simulate the water flow in a rough single fracture the shapes of roughness elements were triangular rectangular and sinusoidal the densities a of roughness elements were 4 5 and 6 respectively and the roughness element height was 1 mm because the variation trends of numerical simulation under the same conditions were similar the simulation results of three different roughness elements under the condition of different densities between 4 and 6 and the reynolds number 2000 are listed here the enlarged views of the velocity distribution nephogram corresponding to the three shapes of roughness elements triangular rectangular and sinusoidal are shown in figs 11 13 as illustrated by the figs 11 13 the streamlines near the roughness elements were very complicated and the flow motions were different in the fractures with different roughness elements shapes this phenomenon could be due to the variation of the shapes of roughness elements when the water flowed aside the roughness elements the streamlines would be hindered by roughness elements thereafter backflow phenomenon might occur inducing the streamlines near the wall surface separated from the origin streamline and attached it again see fig 1 and all of them would bring resistance for the flow so the roughness elements could induce the occurrence of vortexes and increase the flow resistance as shown from figs 11 12 and 13 rectangle roughness elements had the greatest impact on water flow and triangular roughness elements had the least influence on it the value of angle is rectangle sine triangle the result might be correlated with the value of the angle between the tangent and streamline direction at the beginning of the roughness element meanwhile as shown from figs 11 12 and 13 turbulence of flow might be strengthened with an increase of roughness elements density indicating that the motion of water flow in fracture could be affected by the densities of roughness elements significantly for the fracture with three kinds of densities of roughness elements higher roughness density decreased the effective average aperture of fracture thus indirectly increased the relative roughness the ratio of the height of roughness element to the average fracture aperture the height of the roughness element was a fixed value hence the phenomenon of turbulence became obvious with the increase of the density of roughness elements consequently the relative roughness was an important parameter in investigating flow in fracture water flow had pressure on the surface of fracture wall the roughness elements affected the original straight flow streamline and the backflows and vortices would cause the redistribution of pressure the pressure distribution nephograms of rough fracture are shown in figs 14 to 16 as shown in the figures the maximum pressure was near the entrance of the fracture and the farther away from the entrance the less obvious the pressure redistribution was with the increase of the density of the roughness elements the pressure redistribution at the entrance tended to be obvious but the influence distance decreased because of the strong influence on the flow motion induced by the rectangular roughness elements the pressure redistribution mainly concentrated on those roughness elements near the entrance 4 2 discharge per unit width and hydraulic gradient based on the ideal smooth parallel plate fracture model the cubic law indicated that the discharge per unit width q was proportional to the three power of the fracture aperture e however it must be modified for the sake of the influence of roughness element on the water flow motion in the actual fracture in this paper the modified formula of louis was employed to calculate the value of discharge per unit width and the value was compared with the simulated value q0 qm and ql were the values of discharge per unit width obtained from the cubic law numerical simulation and louis modified formula eq 6 respectively a represented the degree of density of roughness elements a b a in order to study the effect of the density of roughness elements on the discharge per unit width three values of density 4 5 and 6 were set to calculate the discharge per unit width corresponded different shapes and densities of roughness elements in a single fracture table 1 shows the details for the discharge per unit width of different shapes and densities of roughness elements the discharges per unit width calculated by using the cubic law numerical simulation and louis modified formula eq 6 for the triangular roughness element are shown in fig 17 as shown in fig 17 the values of the discharges per unit width calculated by the three methods were close at the lower velocity with the increase of the hydraulic gradient j the variation of the discharge per unit width increased correspondingly by comparing the calculated values under different roughness elements densities it was found that the difference between the simulated value and calculated value of cubic law decreased with the increase of the density of the roughness elements indicating that the density of the roughness elements influenced the discharge per unit width the increase of roughness element density would result in smaller discharge when the roughness element shape was triangle the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 4 to 6 times of simulated qm and 2 to 3 times of louis modified formula value ql the discharge per unit width value based on cubic law was overestimated and this result was consistent with the existing research conclusions brown et al 1995 nicholl and detwiler 2011 witherspoon et al 1980 therefore the lcl should be revised it can be seen in the mclc theory wang et al 2015 when the roughness element shape was rectangle the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 2 to 3 times of the simulated qm and 3 to 5 times of ql calculated with louis modified formula when the roughness element shape was sine the value of q0 calculated with cubic law was 1 2 to 2 times of the simulated qm and 4 to 5 times of the value of ql calculated with louis modified formula the results showed that the shape of roughness elements also influenced the discharge per unit width the discharge per unit width calculated by cubic law was obviously larger and the deviation value of triangular roughness element could be more than 5 times while the discharge calculated by the modified cubic law was close to the simulated value because of the intense effect on the flow motion induced by the rectangular roughness elements both the simulation value and the calculation value by modified cubic law in rectangular roughness elements fracture were always smaller than the value in triangle or sine roughness elements fracture 4 3 average flow velocity and hydraulic gradient the flow regime of water in fractured media can be divided into laminar flow transitional flow and turbulent flow according to reynolds number and it can also be named linear flow and non linear flow according to the relationship between velocity and hydraulic gradient flow in real fracture is very complex and non linear flow might occur in laminar flow chaudhary et al 2011 when the velocity is small the viscous force dominates and the average velocity is linear with the hydraulic gradient when the velocity gradually increases to a certain value the inertia force dominates and the average velocity becomes non linear with the hydraulic gradient suggesting the unsuitability of darcy s law for describing their relationship hence empirical or semi empirical formulas were used to describe it during which the forchheimer equation and the izbash equation are commonly used in order to find out the relationship between the average velocity of water flow and hydraulic gradient in a single rough fracture taking triangular roughness element as an example darcy s law forchheimer equation and izbash equation were used to fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient respectively the results are shown in fig 18 as shown in fig 18 the nonlinear relationship between them was obvious when the velocity stayed a small value both forchheimer equation and izbash equation could fit well the relationship between the average velocity of water flow and hydraulic gradient with the increasing of velocity forchheimer equation fitted it better than izbash equation did to investigate the effects of the shape and density of roughness elements on the flow average velocity and hydraulic gradient some different roughness elements were chosen to simulate the flow motion the height of roughness elements was set as 1 mm the shapes were respectively triangle rectangles and sinusoids and the densities were set as 4 5 and 6 respectively the simulation result is shown in fig 19 in the fracture medium with different shapes and densities roughness elements it was obviously that there was always a nonlinear relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient the v j relationship curves corresponding to roughness elements with different shapes were various suggesting that the shape of roughness element could affect the varying speed of average velocity when the fracture was under the condition of same shape but different densities of the roughness elements the corresponding curves of v j relationship were also different the denser the distribution of roughness elements was the faster the velocity changed it should be noted that the linear and nonlinear relationships in this paper were darcy and non darcy relationships respectively it was different from the laminar and turbulent flows in hydraulics because laminar flows included both darcy and non darcy flows and turbulence flow must be non darcy one for the sake of the complexity of the mechanism of nonlinear flow some empirical or semi empirical formulas such as izbash equation and forchheimer equation were used to replace darcy s law to study nonlinear flow table 2 shows the fitting and analyzing results of the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient when forchheimer equation was used the fitting effect was pretty good and the correlation coefficients were always more than 0 999 the simulation results in table 2 also showed that in fracture medium with triangular rectangular and sinusoidal roughness elements the relative fracture aperture decreased with the increase of the density of roughness elements inducing the increase of relative roughness correspondingly the coefficient value of quadratic term in the forchheimer equation increased 4 4 process of laminar flow to turbulent flow when the semi empirical forchheimer equation was used to study the nonlinear flow the result showed that the laminar flow could transfer to turbulent flow gradually with an increase of ν in forchheimer equation j aν bν 2 aν was one order term and meant the linear effect of viscous force and bv 2 was quadratic term and meant the super linear effect of inertial force at the initial stage of seepage flow the velocity value is small at which time the viscous force dominated and the flow remained laminar with the increase of velocity the influence of inertial force on flow increased gradually when the velocity increased to a certain value which was usually called critical velocity the influence of inertial force gradually exceeded the viscous force thus the nonlinear flow got strengthened with an increase of quadratic coefficient induced by velocity in order to study the physical meaning of forchheimer equation which could describe the characteristic of the forchheimer flow clearly the linear jv aν and the quadratic terms ji bν2 in forchheimer equation were studied here in general the two terms were considered as the water head loses caused primarily by the viscosity and the inertial forces respectively with this notation eq 8 becomes 17 j j v j i when ji jv the inertial flow is dominating when jv ji the viscous flow is dominating if ji and jv are at the same order of magnitude both inertial and viscous flows should be considered by comparing the values of jv j and ji j flow condition can be analyzed qian et al 2011b triangular roughness element was chosen to simulate the rough single fracture medium with five different apertures a 3 mm b 4 mm c 5 mm d 6 mm and e 7 mm and the effect of the variation of the fracture apertures on the critical velocity corresponding to jv ji was studied here the height of roughness elements was 1 mm and with the mechanical fracture aperture increased the corresponding relative roughness decreased the simulation results are shown in fig 20 when jv ji the viscous force dominated and the flow was laminar flow with the increase of velocity jv ji the influence of inertia force gradually exceeded the viscous force and it turned into a nonlinear flow slowly when jv was far below ji jv ji turbulent flow occurred fig 20 indicated that one order term in forchheimer equation gradually decreases and the quadratic term gradually increased and dominated in accordance with the results of qian et al 2011b as shown in fig 20 the corresponding critical velocities velocity of laminar flow converting to turbulence of fracture aperture a b c d and e are 0 0054 m s 0 0056 m s 0 0071 m s 0 0078 m s and 0 00844 m s respectively hence the velocity of laminar turbulent transition increased with a decrease of relative roughness the larger the relative roughness the smaller and the more sensitive the critical velocity was indicating the earlier appearance of the critical velocity consequently the wall roughness was an important factor affecting the flow characteristics in fractured medium due to the small fracture aperture in general the effects of roughness elements and fracture aperture on fracture flow through 2d simulation were discussed here without considering the effect of fracture tortuosity crossed fractures fracture network and 3d fracture flow characteristics to better understand the fracture flow mechanism the effect of above factors would be the focus of the future research after all 2d fracture is only a highly simplified model while 3d fracture flow and larger scale fracture media are more complex and closer to the condition in a real fracture 5 conclusion effects of the shape density and height of roughness elements and the aperture of fracture on the water flow were investigated by using a 2d physical model in fluent simulation software the main conclusions are drawn as followings 1 in a single fracture the phenomena of backflow flow streamlines separation and reattachment the origin streamlines route would occur when the water flowed through roughness elements and consequently the flow resistance grew bigger the value of included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness elements and the streamline direction could change the influence degree on the flow motion and bigger angle value would bring more violent turbulent with the increase of the density of roughness elements the influence on water flow got strengthened and the phenomenon of turbulence tended to be obvious all the above conclusions had been visualized by numerical simulation 2 because of the reason of the above included angle value the rectangular roughness elements affected the water flow more seriously so the discharge per unit width in rectangular roughness element fracture was smaller than those of triangle and sinusoidal when the density of roughness elements increased the discharge per unit width decreased the value of discharge per unit width calculated by louis modified formula was more close to the simulated value 3 in rough fracture medium the nonlinear relationship between the average velocity and hydraulic gradient appeared obvious when the velocity is small both forchheimer equation and izbash equation could fit well the relationship between the average velocity and hydraulic gradient with the increasing of velocity forchheimer equation fitted it better than izbash equation did with the increase of density of the roughness elements the nonlinear relationship between the flow velocity and the hydraulic gradient became more obvious 4 the phenomenon of rough fracture water from laminar flow to turbulent flow was indeed a process that a decrease of viscous force and an increase and gradual dominance of inertial force which had been described by the forchheimer equation with the increase of the relative roughness of the fracture the critical velocity trended to decrease and the turbulent flow would appear earlier acknowledgements this study was supported by national natural science foundation of china grant no 41831289 grant no 41772250 grant no

6526,forest ecosystem plays a major role in controlling moisture dynamics over the continents particularly in the humid tropics the montane forest ecosystem in south india supports a characteristic warm tropical climate which affects the weather pattern and the monsoon system this study focuses on better understanding of the influence of dual monsoonal rainfall on the surface water and groundwater in south west india and the role of the western ghats mountain belt in governing the water isotope characteristics i e isotopic elevation rainfall amount and continental effects in the humid tropics of south india this is achieved through a spatial study of stable isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h collected from different tropical river basins located between kozhikode kerala 10 30 n and udupi karnataka 13 30 n in the wettest places and highest peaks of the western ghats between 2011 and 2014 the results on stable isotope ratios of ground water river water and springs show that the water from the tropical mountain belt of the western ghats exhibit a low elevation effect with an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 100 m for δ18o up to 2050 m asl beyond 2050 m asl a considerable effect of elevation with an isotopic lapse rate of 2 5 100 m for δ18o is observed the water samples from the nilgiri ranges 1950 2300 m asl exhibited higher isotopic lapse rate of 1 5 100 m for δ18o unlike that of the mountains ezhimala agumbe and chembra close to the eastern arabian sea the difference in isotopic lapse rate is mainly dependent on i the dominating seasonality of oceanic source moisture over the subcontinent leading to higher depletion of heavy isotopes for more inland groundwater during the winter monsoon on the eastern slopes of the western ghats ii the degree of terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms along windward slopes of the ghats belt i e arabian sea coast of india leading to relative enrichment of heavy isotopes in groundwater fed by the highly recycled vapour sources rather than depletion due to amount elevation or continental effect and iii deep cooling of orographically uplifted air moisture at high elevations of inland tropical mountains the observed isotopic elevation effect on the groundwater and surface water is unique and constrained by specific time scale and mountain ranges within the western ghats belt this study provides new understanding on factors controlling hydrological budget along higher parts of the western ghats mountain belt in south india experiencing humid tropical climate keywords water cycle ecohydrology stable isotope isotopic elevation altitude effect tropical mountainous river spring groundwater indian monsoon western ghats 1 introduction the rich terrestrial biodiversity in the world is harboured by the humid tropical forests which cover about 19 6 million km2 of earth s surface pimm and sugden 1994 asia has the second largest humid tropical forest area after south america with its huge amazon basin the humid tropical forests are localized over the hills and mountains in asia particularly in the indian subcontinent and play a crucial role in controlling the regional moisture dynamics about half the world population lives in this part of asia where agriculture mainly rice and wheat depends on the monsoon rainfall the disequilibrium in heating system of water and land over the earth s surface leads to change in moisture laden wind direction which in turn supports seasonality of monsoon rainfall during the summer monsoon season june september there is a large flow of air moisture from the ocean towards land and this flow is reversed during the winter monsoon season october december leading to dual monsoon system in the subcontinent the availability of continuous flow of moisture over the humid tropical regions makes it a prominent zone of anthropogenic activities although anthropogenic influence has been active in tropical regions for thousands of years the encroachment over the humid forest ecosystem has been intense in recent decades this rapid pace of change in the humid tropical forest directly impacted the global climate vitousek et al 1997 however the seasonal climatic variability over the tropics is caused by the monsoonal precipitation which is largely influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz as the itczs do not remain the same throughout the year the tropical zones experience a wet summer monsoon and a dry winter monsoon as a part of the hadley cycle consequently the tropical regions exhibit less seasonal variability in stable isotope ratios oxygen isotope ratio δ18o and hydrogen isotope ratio δ2h of precipitation with temperature compared to other climatic regions as the precipitation is predominantly convective in nature sturm et al 2007 in addition the small seasonal temperature variability in the tropical region results in lesser seasonal variability of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation clark and fritz 1997 thus it is necessary to determine whether the variability in precipitation over the tropics is limited to the strong seasonality of monsoon moisture source or strongly influenced by topography and the moisture feedback mechanisms over the continent 1 1 motivation the impact of land sea thermal contrast between indian ocean and tibetan plateau has been critical for the onset and variability of asian summer monsoon li and yanai 1996 the major source of indian summer monsoon ism is the moisture brought by south westerly winds from northern indian ocean and arabian sea leading to rain along the west coast of india and in the central and eastern parts of the peninsula the winter monsoon rain derives moisture carried by the north easterly winds moving from the bay of bengal south china sea and continental vapour sources to provide precipitation to the eastern and south eastern parts of the peninsular india mooley and shukla 1987 these two sources of moisture in the two monsoon seasons are known to have distinct stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h whose imprints are identifiable in the geographic distribution of isotopes in groundwater and surface water deshpande et al 2003 tripti et al 2016 and rain water lekshmy et al 2014 warrier et al 2010 a swift transition in monsoonal moisture distribution across short distances due to orography is also well documented in the south asian region biasutti et al 2012 xie et al 2006 in india the two mountain ranges i e the himalayas 5000 8000 m asl in the north and the western ghats 700 2500 m asl in the south act as critical barriers for the moisture laden winds leading to non uniform monsoon rains over the subcontinent in general the orographically induced monsoon regions experience heavy rainfall on the windward side whereas a higher aridity is observed on the leeward side of the mountain ranges day et al 2015 this non uniform distribution of moisture over the continent is evident from the distinct signatures of stable isotope ratios of rain water monitored for a particular location plateau and individual river basin in south india rahul et al 2016 resmi et al 2016 yadava et al 2007 the δ2h data compiled for the precipitation and surface water over the indian subcontinent shows homogenous signature in southern part with relatively higher isotope ratio δ2h 20 than the north and northeast india due to larger influence of southwest monsoon hobson et al 2012 the initial analysis on impact of climatic conditions on water budgeting and local moisture recycling in the central part of the western ghats through stable isotopes of rain water river water and groundwater have been reported in our earlier study tripti et al 2016 this study is carried out to provide a spatial monitoring of water isotopes on a synoptic scale of the western ghats to account for the hydrological budgeting and monsoonal climate along the humid tropical high mountains 1 2 historical background and current status to understand the hydrological cycle and its controlling secondary processes in large ecologically sensitive and critical geomorphic area there is a need to apply adapted tools and models mcdonnell and beven 2014 stable isotope hydrology is based on interpretation of isotope ratio δ2h δ18o and its secondary parameter deuterium excess d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 variability in precipitation which are governed by the origin of moisture and cloud processes kaseke et al 2018 stumpp et al 2014 following the pioneering stable isotope works in 1960s craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 epstein and mayeda 1953 there has been a significant improvement in our understanding of hydrological cycle on a global scale several studies have reported the main factors controlling composition of natural isotopes in precipitation and established their huge potential for the identification of water origin and characterization of hydrological systems froehlich et al 1998 vitvar et al 2004 stable isotopes were used to address watershed scale analysis only later in 1970s stable isotope tracers have proven to be useful in addressing basic water focused questions such as origin flow path mixing and residence time in the watershed dinçer et al 1970 kendall and mcdonnell 1993 1998 sklash 1990 these questions form the basis for understanding water availability biogeochemical cycling microbial production and other ecological processes mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 west et al 2006 it has been well documented that the distribution of precipitation isotopes depends on the local temperature latitude and elevation dansgaard 1964 friedman et al 1964 for instance in the temperate regions isotopic variations in precipitation have been correlated with mean surface air temperatures aggarwal et al 2012 araguás araguás et al 2000 bowen 2008 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 sánchez murillo et al 2016 whereas in the tropics several studies have reported the rainfall amount effect as the main controlling factor bowen and revenaugh 2003 rozanski et al 1993 these controlling parameters create an observable spatial and temporal variability in isotopic composition of water over a geographic region which is large enough to trace regional and global patterns bowen et al 2009 further few studies on the tropical mountainous regions lachniet and patterson 2002 2006 2009 vuille et al 2003 guswa et al 2007 rhodes et al 2010 bruijnzeel et al 2011 highlight the need for long term monitoring networks to trace the impact of orographic effect moisture recycling and canopy interception intense evapotranspiration and microclimate on the variability of isotopic composition of water this study on the western ghats india aims to bring a better understanding on this tropical mountain belt influencing the monsoonal rainfall characteristics through stable isotope investigation of surface and sub surface water over a period of four years observation 2011 2014 in particular this work deals with three major factors i the elevation effect ii the rainfall amount effect and iii the continental effect this is discussed in detail below i the elevation effect stable isotopes of water have been a useful proxy for understanding the paleo elevation changes of the mountains from different geographical regions chamberlain and poage 2000 moreover the stable isotopes of water are conservative in their mixing relationship and for explaining flow paths mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 it is well documented that water at higher elevation is highly depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h because of rayleigh distillation and orography poage and chamberlain 2001 although there are several secondary processes such as evaporation and isotope exchange with ambient vapour which can modify these isotopic signatures dansgaard 1964 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 in general the orographically uplifted cooler air mass condenses to form vapour and precipitation which are lighter 16o and 1h in their isotopic composition relative to the original oceanic moisture brought by advection consequently there is a relatively higher input of lighter isotopes resulting in low δ18o to groundwater and surface water at high elevations and or on the leeward side of mountain ranges than on the lower elevations of the windward side gonfiantini et al 2001 ii the rainfall amount effect in addition to the elevation effect there is a substantial temporal and spatial variability in the stable isotope ratios of precipitation in different ecosystems due to the rainfall amount effect dansgaard 1964 garcia et al 1998 gat 1996 gonfiantini et al 2001 rozanski et al 1992 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 windhorst et al 2013 these studies have reported that the precipitation of higher amount exhibits lower stable isotope ratio due to enrichment of lighter isotopes whereas the lower precipitation amount exhibits higher stable isotope ratio due to enrichment of heavy isotopes however this difference in the stable isotope ratios with precipitation amount tends to be smaller in the tropical ecosystems scholl et al 2009 tripti et al 2016 although there is a large variability in precipitation amount there are also studies reporting the reversed rainfall amount effect on the stable isotope ratios i e a positive correlation of δ18o and δ2h with precipitation amount of precipitation in the tropical region yadava et al 2007 iii the continental effect this effect explains how the rainout system affects the isotopic composition of the rainfall and groundwater the mean δ18o of groundwater in both across and along the region between eastern arabian sea coast and the western slopes of the western ghats is around 3 0 5 and depicts the signature of homogeneous summer monsoon moisture input rather than that from the rainout history deshpande et al 2003 tripti et al 2016 recently the rain out effect has been reported for the west draining river basins of the western ghats where it is observed that the effect is limited only to the onset of summer monsoon and before the availability of excess moisture for undergoing recycling process tripti et al 2018 several studies deshpande et al 2003 kumar et al 1982 negrel et al 2011 have reported that more inland in the deccan plateau the contribution of the north east monsoon is significant and the mean groundwater exhibits higher depletion of heavy isotopes with δ18o varying from 4 to 6 however in the tropical semi arid climatic region evaporation and post evaporation processes have a greater impact on water isotopes most of the streams are ephemeral and evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall farmers rely on groundwater for agriculture which leads to over pumping problems and water table decline in this region of south india the identification of potential influence of these three effects on stable isotope ratio of water is crucial for a better understanding of hydrological budgeting ecohydrology microclimate conditions and the past climatic changes as observed from paleo records preserved in natural archives like paleowater tree ring speleothem paleosol etc 1 3 objectives of this study the present study focuses on determining the elevation effect on the isotopic composition of surface and sub surface water along the western ghats and its adjacent plateau in south india the aim is to account for the major factors controlling the surface and sub surface hydrology along the higher parts of mountain belt experiencing tropical monsoonal climate using stable water isotopes as a tracer the study involves investigation of stable isotopic composition of groundwater from the arabian sea coast and contrasting hydrologic and climatic regions towards inland between latitude 10 30 n and 13 30 n i e from thrissur kerala to agumbe karnataka whenever there was no well to access groundwater water samples were taken from spring rivulet and pond lake the three objectives of this study were to evaluate the following effects i the elevation effect on stable isotope ratio of surface and sub surface water in the humid tropical mountain belt water samples were collected from higher peaks of the western ghats in kudremukh 1100 m asl charmadi ghats 1800 m asl mullayanagiri peak 1930 m asl and the doddabetta peak in the nilgiri range 2600 m asl and compared with samples from lower elevations ii the rainfall amount effect along the tropical monsoon forest belt where there are discernible differences in the rainfall amount the surface and sub surface water from wetter inland places of the western ghats such as agumbe karnataka and the wayanad plateau around sultan bathery kerala were sampled and compared with those of coastal stations such as bakrabail and kozhikode kerala iii the effect of terrestrial factors continental effect on the stable isotope ratios of water in the humid tropical mountain ecosystem water samples were collected from different hills of the western ghats that are very close to the arabian sea within 5 km at ezhimala 200 m asl up to the peaks inland within a distance of about 110 km from the sea at doddabetta 2600 m asl these objectives primarily provide the structural sub headings used in the following sections 2 5 2 study area and sampling sites 2 1 study area the western ghats or the sahyadri range are often referred as the water tower of south indian rivers as they form the headwaters of several major and small in terms of length rivers in south india ramachandra et al 2016 the western ghats mountain belt stretches in parallel to the eastern arabian sea coast for about 1600 km covering an area of around 140 000 km2 which is interrupted only by the 30 km palghat gap at around 11 n latitude in kerala south india this mountain belt hosts a globally significant geomorphic feature with its unique influence on the wide scale biophysical and ecological processes over the indian peninsula unesco 2012 the western ghats provide orography required for the summer monsoon winds in its western part and acts as a climate barrier gunnell 1998 tawde and singh 2015 which makes the plateau arid in the eastern part due to rain shadow effect the monsoon current strikes the west coast of peninsula from west and south west meets the western ghats which presents an almost uninterrupted barrier ranging from 610 to 2134 m asl the air mass moving across the western ghats deposits most of its moisture on the windward side of the mountain ranges and then sweeps across the leeward side and interior of the peninsula in the east the orographic rainfall system leads to variability in the amount of precipitation along the mountain ranges of the western ghats the higher monsoon moisture deposited over the ghats crest results in the origin of several rivers at higher elevations and the formation of different upper watersheds on either side of the ghats slopes jain et al 2007 on the western part of the western ghats scarp several indentations have been created by a large number of short perennial torrential west flowing rivers e g nethravati gurupur swarna chaliyar periyar sharavati kali etc which traverse the narrow coastal plains before discharging into the arabian sea through narrow outlets creeks and estuaries see fig 1a most of the larger south indian rivers e g godavari krishna and kaveri which flow in the east towards the bay of bengal have their origin in the western ghats the krishna river which is the fourth largest river in terms of basin area in india originates in the middle of the western ghats near mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about 1300 m asl the southern basins are formed by its major tributaries tunga and bhadra rivers which originate at elevations 1100 m asl on the leeward side of kudremukh peak in karnataka see fig 1a further south the kaveri cauvery river originates at talakaveri on the brahmagiri hills of the kodagu district at an elevation of 1341 m asl the river flows in a south eastern direction for about 800 km through states like karnataka kerala and tamil nadu and descending the eastern ghats in a series of great falls achyuthan et al 2010 it also hosts tributaries from the nilgiris bhavani and annamalai amaravati the two highest peaks 2600 m asl in south india these river basins host larger tropical forest ecosystems the river basins of south india receive their maximum rainfall during the south west monsoon however the depressions in the bay of bengal causing widespread heavy rains and cyclones contribute moisture to the river basins in the eastern part of the western ghats during the winter monsoon period the rainfall map of south india is given in fig 1b where the asymmetry induced by the western ghats is well represented on the windward side the narrow arabian sea coast of india exhibit annual monsoon rainfall from 2500 to 4000 mm with mostly a unimodal type dominant summer monsoon on the leeward side the monsoon is of bimodal type dual monsoon system representing summer and winter monsoons with annual rainfall dropping rapidly from 2500 to 500 mm the regional monthly rainfall india meteorological department government of india of the sampling locations during 2013 2014 is given in fig 1c and the sampling month is marked by blue rectangle between october and december representing the period after the summer monsoon the annual rainfall amount and oxygen isotope ratio for selected locations is given in fig 1d 2 2 sampling sites earlier works gurumurthy et al 2015 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 2018 involved groundwater and river water sampling from southern karnataka on the arabian sea coast within the river basins of swarna and nethravati and the nearby ghats kudremukh and charmadi ghats for the purpose of this study we sampled mainly groundwater river spring and pond water at higher elevations on the arabian sea coastal side of the western ghats and also groundwater river and lake water at the sources of east flowing rivers with their watersheds draining the eastern part of the western ghats field sites have been selected for collecting representative samples to address the three major factors like elevation rainfall amount and continental effects as described in the following sections 2 2 1 elevation effect to test the elevation effect we have sampled water from isolated peaks exhibiting elevation greater than 2000 m asl from the nilgiri ranges covers 2500 km2 area and hosts 24 peaks which include doddabetta peak 2640 m asl and mukurthi peak 2550 m asl the elevations of these isolated peaks are higher than the average typical mountain hills 600 1300 m asl of the western ghats before stating of minimal isotopic elevation effect in the western ghats there was a need for spatial sampling at the level of the highest mountain belt of the nilgiris 2 2 2 rainfall amount effect outside the rain shadow effects of eastern side of the western ghats there is strong rainfall amount variability along the west coast and at higher peaks in south india figs 1b and 1c the mean annual rainfall increases from south to north i e thrissur latitude 10 30 n annual rainfall 3000 mm to udupi latitude 13 30 n annual rainfall 4500 mm which is nearly the maximum for a coastal station gunnell 1998 to test the rainfall effect we sampled two wettest places of the western ghats in karnataka at agumbe with rainfall traversing through udupi with a mean value of 5500 mm and in kerala i e the wayanad plateau at vythiri with rainfall traversing through kozhikode with a mean value of 3800 mm these stations display similar geographic features relatively lower elevation 600 800 masl close to the arabian sea 40 45 km and surrounded by higher peaks to intercept the monsoon rainfall with an increase of 500 1000 mm year relative to the corresponding coastal station 2 2 3 continental effect to test the distance from the sea coastline and possible continental effect sampling was performed in a midland station of north kerala at bakrabail and in the inland mountains like agumbe and nilgiris during november 2013 which are located at different distances from the arabian sea refer table 1 additional sampling was undertaken during october 2014 from locations adjacent to coast at ezhimala hill 12 01 n 75 12 e and thottada 11 50 n 75 24 e to obtain the signatures of the direct sea moisture this area of north kerala is unique as it is the single place of abrupt rocky spur 286 m asl facing directly the arabian sea along the long sandy coast in southwest india which was sampled for this study 3 materials and methods the methodology followed to investigate the three research questions i e isotopic elevation effect rainfall amount effect and continental effect in view to understand the hydrological cycle in the study area geographic stretch from agumbe to ooty include sampling of the available groundwater spring and lake on a wider scale of elevation dry and wet areas and their distance from the arabian sea here after referred as distance to coastline sea in this study water sampling has been performed with the same hydrological condition under average water level condition during the end of the monsoon from october to december depending on the location fig 1c the main criteria of the sampled water were its isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h values and water conductivity and temperature whenever available 3 1 sampling and analysis of water for stable isotopes about 50 water samples were collected during the winter monsoon season soon after the withdrawal of summer monsoon in november 2013 and october 2014 fig 1c for the study of the elevation effect thirteen water samples groundwater rivulet spring and lake were collected during november 2013 in the area of mukurthi peak pykara lake and doddabetta peak between 1990 m and 2630 m asl for the study of the rainfall amount effect six water samples groundwater rivulet and pond were collected in the area of agumbe during november 2013 and seven groundwater rivulet and spring in the area of the wayanad plateau during october 2014 in addition water samples rivulet ponds spring and horizontal pipe flow water from soil sub surface layer were collected during november 2013 in the area of bakrabail n 5 and during october 2014 in the area of ezhimala n 16 for the study of the continental effect the groundwater samples were collected from dug wells or open well ow and hand pumps or bore well bw dug wells and hand pumps that are regularly used were chosen for sampling in case of dug well sampling the samples were collected by lifting the water using a polythene bucket when dug well or hand pump were not available water samples were taken from spring or rivulet and pond or lake at a depth of 50 cm to avoid any surface evaporation effect for each location water samples in 10 ml glass vials with tight capswere collected for isotopic measurements water temperature c only in 2013 and electrical conductivity µs cm were determined on site using hach multi parameter probes the exact positions of the sample sites were located with a gps all the sampling sites are shown in fig 1a and details are given in table 1 the samples were kept under room temperature until analysis of their stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h on an isoprime 100 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime cheadle hulme uk coupled with a geo multiflow for water gas equilibration elementar hanau germany the stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen are defined with δ notation and unit as suggested by craig 1961 and redefined by coplen 2011 the δ18o value of oxygen isotope is defined as δ 18 o vsmow slap 18 o 16 o sample 18 o 16 o standard 1 for hydrogen isotope the δ2h value is defined as δ 2 h vsmow slap 2 h 1 h sample 2 h 1 h standard 1 in the laboratory 0 3 ml aliquot of water was transferred into capped 3 7 ml vial for analysis the sample vials used for δ18o measurements were flushed offline with a gas mixture of 5 co2in helium the operating vials were then left to equilibrate at 40 c for about 8 hr the analytical precision of the measurements was 0 2 in order to measure the δ2h signatures of the samples hokko beads were added to the 3 7 ml vials containing water samples and internal standards before the vials were flushed offline with a gas mixture of 5 h2in helium the operating vials were then left to equilibrate at 40 c for about 8 hr the measurements were made in replicate and the typical reproducibility was 2 0 four internal standards were used namely w 1 δ 18 o 1 5 0 2 δ 2 h 5 0 2 w 2 δ 18 o 6 2 0 2 δ 2 h 38 0 2 w 3 δ 18 o 10 5 0 2 δ 2 h 68 0 1 7 w 4 δ 18 o 15 5 0 2 δ 2 h 110 0 2 7 they were regularly checked against international reference standards v smow and v slap provided by the international atomic energy agency iaea vienna the deuterium excess d excess was calculated according to craig s formula craig 1961 as explained by dansgaard 1964 i e d excess δ2h 8 δ18o 3 2 air masses trajectory analysis in order to better understand the hydrological conditions during sampling and origin of the previous rainfall an air mass back trajectory model was used the program for hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has been run for the sampling dates of main stations this model is run for the air masses back trajectories upto five days to check if any short term severe cyclonic event generally the case during the winter monsoon over indian subcontinent has impacted the hydrological systems in the western ghats prior to sampling 3 3 statistical analysis the simple mean standard deviation and regression were calculated using microsoft excel 2016 whereas the multiple linear regression analysis was performed using past v 3 15 the dependent variable was the δ18o values and the independent variables were the elevation elevation effect the distance to coastline continental effect and the annual rainfall amount rainfall amount effect 4 results the physico chemical parameters temperature and electrical conductivity and stable isotopic composition of water samples collected in hills and plateaus along the western ghats stretch are given in table 2 the temperature of water measured onsite is reported here to understand its influence on the stable isotope ratios it is observed that the water samples display lower oxygen isotope ratios i e more negative δ18o values at low temperature regions fig 2a the relationship of measured δ18o with water temperature for the study period exhibits a similar trend as observed for the global water dδ18o dt 0 66 c dansgaard 1964 but with a lower slope dδ18o dt 0 36 c as the monitored water samples correspond to higher temperature range 10 30 c the electrical conductivity is also provided as it forms a proxy to predict the geologic bedrock composition and the water residence time most of the sampled groundwater and spring water except in the bore well bw and lake display low ionic content with a mean conductivity of 39 20 µs cm n 33 and close to that of rain water 20 µs cm this is due to the presence of the dominant silicate rock in the basin and the abundant tropical monsoon rainfall which further leads to dilution the highest conductivity values are measured in lakes where the water is stored for a longer time and in bore well compared to open well with a mean value of 229 126 µs cm n 11 human activity also leads to an increased conductivity as observed for the open well in the middle of the town of sultan bathery 231 µs cm and for the ooty lake 450 µs cm the high values for the coastal sampling of the river and rivulet at thottada up to 387 µs cm arise certainly from moderate saline intrusion thus the conductivity of sampled water in these tropical mountainous regions varies between 20 µs cm and 500 µs cm depicting higher rain water input to more water rock interaction and anthropogenic interventions respectively the relationship between conductivity and δ18o values is shown in fig 2b the overall relationship of δ18o versus δ2h is shown in fig 3 most of the samples fall on the global meteoric water line gmwl as defined by craig 1961 few samples of pond and lake are located below the gmwl with deuterium excess d excess values ranging from 2 1 to 5 3 showing evaporation effect on the isotope ratios of larger surface water bodies on the contrary mainly at low elevation of the forested area high d excess suggests that the source vapour of the available water was formed from recycled moisture with d excess values ranging from 13 25 to 18 68 it is for the first time that such depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen δ18o 8 in water has been observed in south india few rainfall samples obtained at ooty during the nighttime in november 2013 display δ18o values between 16 and 17 9 not plotted in fig 3 4 1 elevation effect in general under the influence of warm tropical climate the surface and sub surface water temperature is close to air temperature 26 2 c for the low to middle elevation 1500 m asl but in the nilgiri mountains as the elevation reaches 2000 m asl the temperature decreases rapidly table 2 on the summit of the nilgiris in doddabetta peak spring water temperature of about 12 c has been measured during november 2013 and the case of frost was reported earlier at the meteorological station on the hilltop negi 1996 the δ18o values of water samples from mountainous regions between arabian sea coast and western ghats are plotted against the elevation of sampling location to identify the presence of elevation effect on the stable isotope ratios of water fig 4 clearly two groups of samples are observed the first set of samples for elevation below 2050 m asl with a low slope 0 09 100 m r2 0 4 and a second set beyond 2050 m asl with a higher slope 2 5 100 m r2 0 7 table 3 summarizes the reported studies on isotopic elevation effect from the pioneer works to more focus on tropical areas and indian terrain the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 data points reported in table 1 the elevation effect is very significant r2 0 7 p 0 0001 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 2 rainfall amount effect the mean stable isotope ratios of rain water groundwater and river water in the wettest river basins annual rainfall amount of 5500 1500 mm in swarna and nethravati basins of the western ghats in karnataka was reported to be around 3 05 0 2 for δ18o with d excess of about 17 7 3 1 tripti et al 2016 water samples of agumbe the wettest place in south india as well as along the spatial stretch of the western ghats display an average isotope ratio of about 3 14 0 6 for δ18o with d excess of about 10 16 4 7 excluding pond and waterfall table 2 the observed stable isotope ratios of groundwater in the wet locations of the western ghats stretch in karnataka show less depletion of heavy isotopes in water compared to its coastal track at udupi and bakrabail rain water δ18o 2 84 0 28 and d excess 16 5 2 1 tripti et al 2016 which receives relatively lower annual rainfall amount of about 4000 500 mm the isotope ratios of water samples from the wayanad plateau around sultan battery the wettest place annual rainfall up to 4000 mm in kerala display mean values of about 3 36 0 57 for δ18o and 12 95 5 06 for d excess table 2 this isotopic ratio of groundwater is relatively lower than that of the long term mean rainfall δ18o 2 97 0 73 and d excess 10 66 0 72 warrier et al 2010 in the corresponding coastal station of kozhikode receiving annual rainfall amount of 3000 mm it can be observed from fig 5 that except the near shore areas like ezhimala and thottada and the inland region close to the nilgiri range pykara and doddabetta all other water sample locations independent of their annual rainfall present a mean δ18o value similar to that of the west coast groundwater δ18o 3 1 0 3 tripti et al 2016 the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 points reported in table 1 the annual rainfall parameter or rainfall amount effect is not significant r2 0 4 p 0 39 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 3 continental effect when the air masses move away from the arabian sea towards the inland until the western ghats mountain belt there is a significant continental effect on stable isotope ratios of water the variability in mean δ18o values as a function of distance to the arabian sea for nine sampling regions is plotted in fig 5 water samples located close to the sea distance 5 km show δ18o values of about 2 which then decreases to 3 towards the inland i e 5 km distance 40 km along the western part of the western ghats including the sample location on the moderate elevation mountains like agumbe and wayanad only the water samples from stations located far away from the sea distance 100 km like the nilgiris display more depleted oxygen isotopes of about 8 the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 data points reported in table 1 the distance to the sea or continental effect is not significant r2 0 56 p 0 18 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 4 air masses trajectories the results of the hysplit simulations are given in fig 6 for the stations along the arabian sea coast agumbe and bakrabail of mid november 2013 there is an influence of north east monsoon with continental effect at low elevation and an influence of the arabian sea side is observed at higher elevation for the lower elevation stations on the nilgiris ooty and pykara of november 19 2013 the air masses come from the north east monsoon with coastal and maritime effect for the sampling stations in doddabetta madikeri thrissur respectively on november18 december 02 and december 05 during 2013 and ezhimala october 14 2014 mainly it is the influence of bay of bengal with maritime trajectories as observed in fig 6 overall the sampling was performed under north east winter monsoon conditions with more continental effects for mid november sampling to more maritime effects for the early december sampling 5 discussion in this section we review the main factors elevation amount and continental effects controlling the water isotope ratios in perspective with the new results obtained for the western ghats mountain belt covering a latitudinal stretch of about 500 km between 10 30 n and 14 n in south india 5 1 elevation effect most of the climatological ecological and geophysical studies reported the effect of elevation on stable isotope ratio of water as altitude effect which has been now rephrased as elevation effect mcvicar and körner 2013 the compilation of 68 studies by poage and chamberlain 2001 reports an isotopic lapse rate ranging from 0 10 to 0 51 100 m asl on δ18o values except extreme latitudes 0 62 to 1 83 100 m asl with a mean value of 0 28 0 03 100 m asl in the himalayas the isotopic lapse rate ranges between 0 14 100 m asl on the indian slope and up to 0 25 100 m asl on the tibetan plateau poage and chamberlain 2001 limited studies focused on the elevation effect in south india the study on groundwater isotopes by deshpande et al 2003 detected a possible elevation effect of 0 4 100 m asl for δ18o in well water located at an elevation between 400 and 1000 m asl in southwest india but from the recalculation of slope for the whole set of points located between arabian sea coast and 914 m asl as displayed in fig 8a of deshpande et al 2003 the isotopic lapse rate is only 0 11 100 m asl similar values 0 12 100 m asl scholl et al 2009 of isotopic depletion with elevation has been reported for the tropical coastal forest in puerto rico recent study on the precipitation across the pamba river kerala suggest an isotopic lapse rate of about 0 10 100 m asl resmi et al 2016 table 3 summarizes the reported studies on isotopic elevation effect from the pioneer works to more focus on tropical areas and indian terrain in sri lanka edirisinghe et al 2017 have reported the isotopic lapse rate of 0 6 100 m asl for the north east monsoon but no value for the south west monsoon has been reported as there was no enough rain water collectors on the south west of sri lanka in our earlier studies lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 the sampling along the hill slopes of kudremukh charmadi ghats 1300 1800 m asl and mullayanigiri 1900 m asl highest peak of karnataka did not show any isotopic elevation effect for δ18o variability the data on stable isotope ratio of water samples from this work show an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 100 m for stations below 2050 m asl which is similar to that reported in other tropical areas table 3 but for the region at elevation greater than 2050 m asl in the western ghats belt of south india a stronger isotopic lapse rate of about 2 5 100 m asl is found with water highly depleted in heavy isotopes of oxygen δ18o 9 5 as recorded in high mountains of the nilgiri ranges at doddabetta peak the water samples from the nilgiri ranges 1950 2300 m asl exhibit higher isotopic lapse rate of 1 5 100 m asl for δ18o whereas the mountains close to the eastern arabian sea like ezhimala agumbe and chembra exhibit no such depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen with elevation fig 4 this indicates that there exists a unique relationship between elevation and stable isotope ratios of surface and sub surface water in different mountain ranges of the western ghats when we recalculate the overall isotopic elevation effect from 0 to 2300 m asl the overall slope value is 0 31 100 m the overall isotopic effect observed for the water of the western ghats is slightly higher than the global mean isotopic lapse rate in the humid tropical areas the isotopic elevation effect on the stable isotope ratios of water is lower around 0 10 100 m asl due to the moisture contribution from higher air vapour recycling but when reaching higher elevation of relatively less humid region our study reveals that the stable isotope ratios of water are largely controlled by elevation effect in the western ghats mountain belt until now such depletion in heavy isotope 18o of oxygen 9 5 δ18o 7 3 present study has not been reported for river and groundwater in the literature for south india although the closer values are reported in few studies achyuthan et al 2010 hameed et al 2015 firstly for the west flowing chaliyar river the lowest δ18o reported is 5 30 hameed et al 2015 for the water originating at the foothills of the chembra and mukurthi range secondly lower oxygen isotope ratios δ18o 7 7 achyuthan et al 2010 have been reported for the east flowing kaveri river near mettur dam due to significant contribution of the tributary flowing from the nilgiri range similar depleted water isotopes were observed during our sampling in november 2013 where a river in mule hole basin display δ18o 6 7 lambs et al under preparation all these studies with oxygen isotope ratios much lower than 4 5 indicate a possible depletion of heavy isotopes in water at higher peaks of the western ghats with elevation greater than 2000 m asl for other east flowing rivers of south india originating in the western ghats higher variability of stable isotope ratios has been reported i e for the maheshwaram watershed δ18o 4 7 negrel et al 2011 and for the mahanadi and godavari rivers respectively 6 1 and 5 5 lambs et al 2005 as they are largely influenced by north east monsoon it can be noted that the small isotopic elevation effect 1 on the δ18o scale observed here for the western ghats below 2000 m asl is similar to that reported for the cloud forest where there is a secondary control from strong water vapour recycling process scholl et al 2009 with a slope of 0 12 100 m as given in table 3 on the contrary in the same arabian sea coast further north as well as in the south higher isotopic elevation effect is found even below 2000 m asl in the drier regions for instance the stable isotope measurements carried out on groundwater in sri lanka north west and south west slopes on the central mountains and rajasthan on the south west slope of the aravalli mountain range represent an isotopic lapse rate of 0 18 100 m asl fig 7 data from lambs under preparation for the δ18o values it is also observed that these water samples display lower oxygen isotope ratios 8 δ18o 6 at 1400 m asl it is also important to consider the possible contribution by isotopic spike effect lambs et al 2018 of storm during the north east monsoon which leads to higher depletion of heavy isotopes in precipitation water compared with normal tropical rainfall the tropical storms display distinct depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen in water during large tropical storms the strong convective effect generates 18o depleted rainfall with much lower oxygen isotope ratios between 12 and 8 as reported by lawrence 1998 and more recently by lambs et al 2018 the water samples obtained from inland regions in the nilgiri ranges during november 17 19 2013 show an impact from the isotopic spike effect of storms there was effectively an extremely severe cyclonic storm named phailin over the bay of bengal during october 04 14 2013 but entered the indian coast further north east in orissa of the sampling sites at a later stage during november 13 17 the storm originating from a strong depression in the bay of bengal entered the tamil nadu coast and during november 18 21 severe cyclone helen made its entry through andhra pradesh in south india the hysplit simulation fig 6 shows effectively that the air mass over the doddabetta peak had its original path from the bay of bengal more close to the andaman island from where the cyclone helen originated however the sampled water will not have much influence of storm from cyclone helen as samples were collected prior to its first landfall rain over the indian coast the water isotope ratios for the rainfall obtained during this period in the nilgiri range were effectively depleted in heavy isotopes with δ18o of about 17 0 9 rain water in equilibrium with cooler water vapour but the results are from only few samples n 2 nevertheless the huge water reservoir in ooty the ooty lake which covers an area of 3 9 km2 displays depletion in heavy oxygen isotope with δ18o value of about 5 3 it is noted that the water from this lake has a d excess value of 2 1 which shows a strong evaporation of the lake water this suggests that the original lake water exhibited more depletion of 18o in water before undergoing evaporation certainly similar to the groundwater isotope ratios δ18o 7 3 as observed for the ooty village this also indicates that the storm effect was uniform over the nilgiris and the immediate water sampling displayed a strong elevation effect in this region of the western ghats thus it is important to note that along with the northeast monsoon influence the earlier storms from cyclone phailin and bay of bengal depression had an effective contribution towards the surface water and sub surface water in the nilgiris this has led to lower water isotope ratios at higher elevations inland compared to the coastal groundwater along the eastern arabian sea side the study determines that the water from the higher mountains of the western ghats depicts the global elevation effect soon after the strong influence of the monsoon and much before the dominance of secondary processes like evaporation and contribution of recycled vapours from evapo transpiration this reveals that the time scale of observation plays a major factor poage and chamberlain 2001 in monitoring the relationship between elevation and stable isotope ratios of surface and sub surface water in the western ghats mountain belt 5 2 rainfall amount effect the highest rainfall 21 32 mm day tawde and singh 2015 in south india during summer monsoon season is observed over windward side of the western ghats mountain range in karnataka centered at 13 13 n latitude close to udupi the variability in monsoonal rainfall fig 1d with changing longitude west east direction and latitude south north direction i e across and along the western ghats gunnell 1997 corresponds to the topographic structures of the mountain barriers and the contribution from seasonal monsoon sources it is reported that the maximum rainfall due to orography of the western ghats during summer monsoon season is on an average 50 km before the highest peak and corresponds to an elevation of about 600 m asl beyond that the rainfall decreases tawde and singh 2015 it is at this middle elevation that the wettest places are found in karnataka hulikal at 13 43 n and agumbe at 13 30 n and in kerala vythiri on the edge of the wayanad plateau at 11 33 n and walakkad in the silent valley at 11 03 n tropical coastal areas are typically characterized by rain water with δ18o of about 3 1 gnip database and the groundwater of several tropical coasts and islands reflect similar mean δ18o values lambs et al 2016 2018 this is also the case for the west coast of south india with similar groundwater stable isotope ratios at udupi δ18o 3 09 0 05 n 34 tripti et al 2016 this δ18o value corresponds with the rainfall mean weighted values in the nearest gnip station kozhikode δ18o 2 97 0 73 warrier et al 2010 only the water from the eastern part of south india which is mainly influenced by the north east winter monsoon and higher continental effect display lower isotope ratios δ18o 6 deshpande et al 2003 in this study the mean oxygen isotope ratios of water at sampling stations of agumbe δ18o 2 95 0 66 n 6 bakrabail δ18o 3 05 0 34 n 5 and thrissur δ18o 3 11 are very similar although these stations received contrasting annual rainfall amount from 6000 mm agumbe to 3000 mm thrissur similar case is found further south between the wayanad plateau around sultan bathery mean groundwater δ18o 3 1 0 5 and the relative drier coastal station at kozhikode δ18o 2 97 0 73 warrier et al 2010 all these sampling stations confirm the low rainfall amount effect on the water isotopic ratio along the spatial stretch of the western ghats belt the study on stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h of groundwater surface water and rainfall from coast to inland in south west of karnataka shows weaker rainfall amount effect on the water isotope ratios due to the influence of higher continental vapour recycling process as represented by higher d excess values of about 15 in the two humid tropical basins of the western ghats tripti et al 2016 on the contrary a reversed rainfall amount effect on the δ18o variability was observed for the precipitation over mangalore yadava et al 2007 although they still show a weaker rainfall amount effect within the monsoonal months at kunnamangalam 12 km inland of kozhikode kerala the study by warrier et al 2010 shows a poor correlation between rainfall amount and δ18o δ2h values over the three years period from 2005 to 2007 the authors stated that the region receives a continuous supply of moist air masses as the south west monsoon currents move across extended marine regions before reaching kozhikode in addition the study on the δ18o variability in precipitation along the kerala stretch suggests the influence of large scale convection and cloud spread lekshmy et al 2014 rather than the rainfall amount effect recent studies hameed et al 2016 resmi et al 2016 on the spatial variability of stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h of precipitation over the kerala region also support weaker rainfall amount effect and have attributed it to the steady state supply of moisture and also vapour recycling over the continent thus the water in the west coast and along moderate elevations of the western ghats stretch in south india does not display a high correlation between the stable isotope ratios of water and precipitation amount 5 3 continental and seasonal effects as stated in the previous section precipitation rain water along the tropical coasts display δ18o value of about 3 1 gnip database and represents relative depletion of heavy isotopes than that of the seawater δ18o 0 by definition the two gnip stations in south india kozhikode and tirunelveli fig 1b display very similar weighted mean δ18o values of about 2 97 and 2 79 respectively in our earlier studies lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 it was reported that there is a homogeneity in the groundwater isotopic signature from coastal plain up to the moderate elevation 1500 masl of the ghats the mean value of δ18o in water samples was around 3 15 0 63 close to the gnip rain water δ18o value 2 97 of kozhikode fig 1b only the coastal stations adjacent to the arabian sea like the groundwater in the estuarine zone of the swarna river at hude displayed enrichment of heavy isotopes with δ18o value of about 2 26 in this study the costal stations of ezhimala and thottada which receive directly the sea moisture display respectively δ18o 1 92 0 55 n 8 and δ18o 2 31 0 74 n 8 further inland the groundwater at low elevation stations show a homogenous groundwater with δ18o around 3 this is clearly represented in fig 5 where the water isotope ratios δ18o vary between 2 95 and 3 36 except for the sample stations of ezhimala and thottada this represents that for the region stretching to about 500 km distance along the western ghats i e from udupi karnataka to thrissur kerala the groundwater and surface water display a similar oxygen isotope ratio δ18o of about 3 0 0 5 before any evaporation it is interesting that water homogeneity extends till 50 to 70 km inland including moderately elevated plateaus like agumbe madikeri and wayanad of the western ghats the higher moisture availability and the thick vegetation cover favour higher continental vapour recycling in this region the higher continental moisture recycling in the western part of the western ghats and the uniform distribution of recycled water over the short distance led to homogenous signatures in the stable isotope ratios of groundwater however there is a shift in this homogeneity further inland extending beyond 100 km from the arabian sea coast at higher elevations in the western ghats with groundwater exhibiting higher depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 7 0 1 5 as observed for the nilgiri ranges the water in this inland region exhibited colder temperature relative to that of the coastal and moderate elevation stations in the western ghats in addition these inland stations receive relatively higher north east monsoon precipitation than the west coast and thus the surface water and sub surface water are recharged with more continental rainfall characterized by water with higher depletion of heavy isotopes 5 4 variability of deuterium excess there is a higher variability of d excess in the surface and subsurface water of the western ghats with mean values ranging from 6 5 to 13 42 the plot fig 8 of d excess as a function of distance from the coastline and elevation displays a lower increasing trend unlike that of the global water bershaw 2018 associated either with source moisture mixing or sub cloud evaporation the calculated d excess ranges between 3 and 20 the observed d excess variability in this humid tropical region corresponds to that reported in the jeju island korea and northeast asia lee et al 2003 however the d excess variability observed in this study corresponds less to the seasonal moisture source contribution as the west coast samples which are dominated by precipitation input from hot humid tropical marine air mass from arabian sea exhibit higher values and a larger range of d excess this is mainly dependent on the degree of regional continental moisture recycling process and distribution of the recycled vapours tripti et al 2016 influencing the incoming marine source moisture along the eastern arabian sea coast of india 5 5 statistical analysis multiple linear regression analysis was carried out for determining the extent to which the elevation effect continental effect and rainfall amount effect influence the δ18o values when running the statistical test for the whole set of points n 51 the elevation effect appears to be the most significant explicative parameter and the influence of two other effects remain insignificant if we split the dataset into two groups like in fig 4 for the first 42 points with elevation lower than 2050 m asl table 4 there is neither a strong nor a significant contribution from one specific parameter it is a global contribution which enables observation of the δ18o values to decrease from 2 along the eastern coast of arabian sea to 4 0 more inland at 1800 m asl in the western ghats for the last 9 points i e above 2050 m asl the elevation effect and the rainfall amount effect become significant r2 0 77 p 0 1 and r2 0 81 p 0 05 respectively in controlling stable isotope ratios of water at high elevation of the western ghats this suggests that for the tropical mountains of high elevation and with less relative humidity the lower isotopic ratios of surface water and sub surface water were characteristics of deep cooling due to high orographic upliftment of seasonal air moisture severe storm effect and higher annual rainfall input 5 6 implications of stable isotopes of water in the western ghats mountain belt this study and the earlier reported work lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 2018 suggest that in the tropical monsoon climate region of the western ghats the high water vapour recycling is due to higher precipitation warmer temperature wetlands and large vegetation cover around 40 of forest the higher moisture input 2000 mm annual precipitation 6000 mm fig 1b from the nearby oceanic source coupled with suitable temperature i e 20 t 30 c and land use land cover i e vegetation in the continent supports high relative air humidity 75 100 which triggers higher vapour recycling breitenbach et al 2010 in this region this indicates the dominance of terrestrial moisture recycling process over the western ghats rather than the rayleigh distillation process of moisture from oceanic source this is reflected by the higher stable isotope ratios of water over the continent leading to less depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 3 and higher d excess values 15 for the wetter regions of west coast however the effect of vapour recycling on the isotopic signature of incoming moisture becomes less dominant in the region where the moisture input is relatively minimal annual precipitation 2000 mm from the summer monsoon mainly due to the rain shadow effect however these inland regions exhibit relatively cooler temperature i e t 20 c due to high air lifting and contribution from north east monsoon there is a higher reflection of original moisture source and the mixing process on the stable isotope ratios of water in such semi arid tropical regions thus a clear indication of rayleigh distillation or elevation effect is observed on the isotopic signatures of moisture which in turn leads to more depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 6 in water present in inland regions this shows that the continental vapour recycling process and their role in controlling moisture flux froehlich et al 2002 risi et al 2013 sturm et al 2007 are important factors even in the humid coastal regions receiving higher precipitation although there could be several factors that control the moisture isotopic signatures and their subsequent reflection in the groundwater and surface water this study shows that temperature coupled with higher seasonal moisture input mainly precipitation amount and vegetation cover play a significant role in governing the stable isotope ratios of water over the regional scale and the subsequent water cycle over the highlands of the western ghats mountain belt in india also it is important to note that the stable isotopes of water show homogenous signature up to moderate elevation i e 2000 m asl for the humid tropical mountains and the isotopic elevation effect is observed only in the mountains of elevation greater than 2000 m asl of the western ghats the findings of this study are significant as it has implications on the studies involving past climate and paleoelevation of the tropical mountain belt using records preserved in paleoarchives this will help in improving the understanding of isotopic signatures of paleowater tree ring speleothem and other geological records found in south india with less gnip observations stationed in south india the present study though the observation is mainly from surface and subsurface water adds to the global database as it provides the new evidence on the isotopic elevation effect along the highlands of tropical mountain rainforest ecosystem of india this also has larger implications on the ecohydrological functioning and indian monsoonal climate and further helps in the sustainable water resource management in south india 6 conclusions humid tropical mountains display a lower isotopic elevation effect due to limited temperature gradient high relative humidity evergreen forest evapotranspiration and high water vapour recycling the western ghats mountain belt of south india has similar characteristics and as such the stable isotope ratios of rainfall and water bodies exhibits lower variability with elevation up to 2000 m asl with a mean oxygen isotope ratio δ18o of about 2 5 0 5 and a limited seasonal effect maximum difference in mean δ18o between seasons is 0 5 for larger river basins and 0 2 for smaller basins the homogeneity in the ground water isotope ratio along the western coastal plain from udupi to thrissur in south india is explained by the wide scale marine moisture distribution from the dominant south west summer monsoon system the moisture characteristics on the foothills of the western ghats are more affected by the water vapour recycling as observed from the higher d excess around 15 particularly in the vegetation covered and wetland regions the present study reveals for the first time that beyond 2000 m asl in the western ghats such as in the nilgiri ranges the surface and subsurface water exhibit relatively lower stable isotope ratios with δ18o values ranging from 5 3 for the lake to 9 5 for the springs and open wells of hills at higher elevation this reflects a very strong isotopic elevation effect 1 8 100 m for δ18o for the water from the western ghats mountain belt between 2000 and 2600 m asl where the cold air temperature i e 10 20 c prevails the water contribution from the recycled vapours masks the strong effect of elevation rainfall amount and continental effect on water isotope ratios under the following conditions i when there is an increased availability of terrestrial moisture to undergo secondary processes like recycling and evaporation and ii after the vapours from short severe storm effect recedes the present study fills the gap in undestanding of isotopic elevation effect on precipitation and its subsequent reflection on isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water of the western ghats which received less scientific attention unlike that of the himalayas in northern and northeast india as the western ghats mountain belt forms the source of major south indian rivers and provides a platform for the dual monsoon system observation this study has a global implication with a new understanding on the dynamic role of tropical mountains in monitoring the humid climatic system the indian monsoon and regional hydrology of south india the monsoon arrival and its interannual variability affect numerous people living in these fertile mountain ranges and in the context of global climate change emphasize the sensitive response of these tropical mountains to anthropogenic influences thus a minor change in the land use land cover such as deforestation agricultural activities and urbanization and topography of the western ghats can have a significant impact on the degree of atmospheric moisture feedback mechanisms and is directly reflected by the climatic conditions of tropical monsoon forest ecosystem in india acknowledgements this work was funded by

6526,forest ecosystem plays a major role in controlling moisture dynamics over the continents particularly in the humid tropics the montane forest ecosystem in south india supports a characteristic warm tropical climate which affects the weather pattern and the monsoon system this study focuses on better understanding of the influence of dual monsoonal rainfall on the surface water and groundwater in south west india and the role of the western ghats mountain belt in governing the water isotope characteristics i e isotopic elevation rainfall amount and continental effects in the humid tropics of south india this is achieved through a spatial study of stable isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h collected from different tropical river basins located between kozhikode kerala 10 30 n and udupi karnataka 13 30 n in the wettest places and highest peaks of the western ghats between 2011 and 2014 the results on stable isotope ratios of ground water river water and springs show that the water from the tropical mountain belt of the western ghats exhibit a low elevation effect with an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 100 m for δ18o up to 2050 m asl beyond 2050 m asl a considerable effect of elevation with an isotopic lapse rate of 2 5 100 m for δ18o is observed the water samples from the nilgiri ranges 1950 2300 m asl exhibited higher isotopic lapse rate of 1 5 100 m for δ18o unlike that of the mountains ezhimala agumbe and chembra close to the eastern arabian sea the difference in isotopic lapse rate is mainly dependent on i the dominating seasonality of oceanic source moisture over the subcontinent leading to higher depletion of heavy isotopes for more inland groundwater during the winter monsoon on the eastern slopes of the western ghats ii the degree of terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms along windward slopes of the ghats belt i e arabian sea coast of india leading to relative enrichment of heavy isotopes in groundwater fed by the highly recycled vapour sources rather than depletion due to amount elevation or continental effect and iii deep cooling of orographically uplifted air moisture at high elevations of inland tropical mountains the observed isotopic elevation effect on the groundwater and surface water is unique and constrained by specific time scale and mountain ranges within the western ghats belt this study provides new understanding on factors controlling hydrological budget along higher parts of the western ghats mountain belt in south india experiencing humid tropical climate keywords water cycle ecohydrology stable isotope isotopic elevation altitude effect tropical mountainous river spring groundwater indian monsoon western ghats 1 introduction the rich terrestrial biodiversity in the world is harboured by the humid tropical forests which cover about 19 6 million km2 of earth s surface pimm and sugden 1994 asia has the second largest humid tropical forest area after south america with its huge amazon basin the humid tropical forests are localized over the hills and mountains in asia particularly in the indian subcontinent and play a crucial role in controlling the regional moisture dynamics about half the world population lives in this part of asia where agriculture mainly rice and wheat depends on the monsoon rainfall the disequilibrium in heating system of water and land over the earth s surface leads to change in moisture laden wind direction which in turn supports seasonality of monsoon rainfall during the summer monsoon season june september there is a large flow of air moisture from the ocean towards land and this flow is reversed during the winter monsoon season october december leading to dual monsoon system in the subcontinent the availability of continuous flow of moisture over the humid tropical regions makes it a prominent zone of anthropogenic activities although anthropogenic influence has been active in tropical regions for thousands of years the encroachment over the humid forest ecosystem has been intense in recent decades this rapid pace of change in the humid tropical forest directly impacted the global climate vitousek et al 1997 however the seasonal climatic variability over the tropics is caused by the monsoonal precipitation which is largely influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz as the itczs do not remain the same throughout the year the tropical zones experience a wet summer monsoon and a dry winter monsoon as a part of the hadley cycle consequently the tropical regions exhibit less seasonal variability in stable isotope ratios oxygen isotope ratio δ18o and hydrogen isotope ratio δ2h of precipitation with temperature compared to other climatic regions as the precipitation is predominantly convective in nature sturm et al 2007 in addition the small seasonal temperature variability in the tropical region results in lesser seasonal variability of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation clark and fritz 1997 thus it is necessary to determine whether the variability in precipitation over the tropics is limited to the strong seasonality of monsoon moisture source or strongly influenced by topography and the moisture feedback mechanisms over the continent 1 1 motivation the impact of land sea thermal contrast between indian ocean and tibetan plateau has been critical for the onset and variability of asian summer monsoon li and yanai 1996 the major source of indian summer monsoon ism is the moisture brought by south westerly winds from northern indian ocean and arabian sea leading to rain along the west coast of india and in the central and eastern parts of the peninsula the winter monsoon rain derives moisture carried by the north easterly winds moving from the bay of bengal south china sea and continental vapour sources to provide precipitation to the eastern and south eastern parts of the peninsular india mooley and shukla 1987 these two sources of moisture in the two monsoon seasons are known to have distinct stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h whose imprints are identifiable in the geographic distribution of isotopes in groundwater and surface water deshpande et al 2003 tripti et al 2016 and rain water lekshmy et al 2014 warrier et al 2010 a swift transition in monsoonal moisture distribution across short distances due to orography is also well documented in the south asian region biasutti et al 2012 xie et al 2006 in india the two mountain ranges i e the himalayas 5000 8000 m asl in the north and the western ghats 700 2500 m asl in the south act as critical barriers for the moisture laden winds leading to non uniform monsoon rains over the subcontinent in general the orographically induced monsoon regions experience heavy rainfall on the windward side whereas a higher aridity is observed on the leeward side of the mountain ranges day et al 2015 this non uniform distribution of moisture over the continent is evident from the distinct signatures of stable isotope ratios of rain water monitored for a particular location plateau and individual river basin in south india rahul et al 2016 resmi et al 2016 yadava et al 2007 the δ2h data compiled for the precipitation and surface water over the indian subcontinent shows homogenous signature in southern part with relatively higher isotope ratio δ2h 20 than the north and northeast india due to larger influence of southwest monsoon hobson et al 2012 the initial analysis on impact of climatic conditions on water budgeting and local moisture recycling in the central part of the western ghats through stable isotopes of rain water river water and groundwater have been reported in our earlier study tripti et al 2016 this study is carried out to provide a spatial monitoring of water isotopes on a synoptic scale of the western ghats to account for the hydrological budgeting and monsoonal climate along the humid tropical high mountains 1 2 historical background and current status to understand the hydrological cycle and its controlling secondary processes in large ecologically sensitive and critical geomorphic area there is a need to apply adapted tools and models mcdonnell and beven 2014 stable isotope hydrology is based on interpretation of isotope ratio δ2h δ18o and its secondary parameter deuterium excess d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 variability in precipitation which are governed by the origin of moisture and cloud processes kaseke et al 2018 stumpp et al 2014 following the pioneering stable isotope works in 1960s craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 epstein and mayeda 1953 there has been a significant improvement in our understanding of hydrological cycle on a global scale several studies have reported the main factors controlling composition of natural isotopes in precipitation and established their huge potential for the identification of water origin and characterization of hydrological systems froehlich et al 1998 vitvar et al 2004 stable isotopes were used to address watershed scale analysis only later in 1970s stable isotope tracers have proven to be useful in addressing basic water focused questions such as origin flow path mixing and residence time in the watershed dinçer et al 1970 kendall and mcdonnell 1993 1998 sklash 1990 these questions form the basis for understanding water availability biogeochemical cycling microbial production and other ecological processes mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 west et al 2006 it has been well documented that the distribution of precipitation isotopes depends on the local temperature latitude and elevation dansgaard 1964 friedman et al 1964 for instance in the temperate regions isotopic variations in precipitation have been correlated with mean surface air temperatures aggarwal et al 2012 araguás araguás et al 2000 bowen 2008 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 sánchez murillo et al 2016 whereas in the tropics several studies have reported the rainfall amount effect as the main controlling factor bowen and revenaugh 2003 rozanski et al 1993 these controlling parameters create an observable spatial and temporal variability in isotopic composition of water over a geographic region which is large enough to trace regional and global patterns bowen et al 2009 further few studies on the tropical mountainous regions lachniet and patterson 2002 2006 2009 vuille et al 2003 guswa et al 2007 rhodes et al 2010 bruijnzeel et al 2011 highlight the need for long term monitoring networks to trace the impact of orographic effect moisture recycling and canopy interception intense evapotranspiration and microclimate on the variability of isotopic composition of water this study on the western ghats india aims to bring a better understanding on this tropical mountain belt influencing the monsoonal rainfall characteristics through stable isotope investigation of surface and sub surface water over a period of four years observation 2011 2014 in particular this work deals with three major factors i the elevation effect ii the rainfall amount effect and iii the continental effect this is discussed in detail below i the elevation effect stable isotopes of water have been a useful proxy for understanding the paleo elevation changes of the mountains from different geographical regions chamberlain and poage 2000 moreover the stable isotopes of water are conservative in their mixing relationship and for explaining flow paths mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 it is well documented that water at higher elevation is highly depleted in heavy isotopes 18o and 2h because of rayleigh distillation and orography poage and chamberlain 2001 although there are several secondary processes such as evaporation and isotope exchange with ambient vapour which can modify these isotopic signatures dansgaard 1964 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 in general the orographically uplifted cooler air mass condenses to form vapour and precipitation which are lighter 16o and 1h in their isotopic composition relative to the original oceanic moisture brought by advection consequently there is a relatively higher input of lighter isotopes resulting in low δ18o to groundwater and surface water at high elevations and or on the leeward side of mountain ranges than on the lower elevations of the windward side gonfiantini et al 2001 ii the rainfall amount effect in addition to the elevation effect there is a substantial temporal and spatial variability in the stable isotope ratios of precipitation in different ecosystems due to the rainfall amount effect dansgaard 1964 garcia et al 1998 gat 1996 gonfiantini et al 2001 rozanski et al 1992 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 windhorst et al 2013 these studies have reported that the precipitation of higher amount exhibits lower stable isotope ratio due to enrichment of lighter isotopes whereas the lower precipitation amount exhibits higher stable isotope ratio due to enrichment of heavy isotopes however this difference in the stable isotope ratios with precipitation amount tends to be smaller in the tropical ecosystems scholl et al 2009 tripti et al 2016 although there is a large variability in precipitation amount there are also studies reporting the reversed rainfall amount effect on the stable isotope ratios i e a positive correlation of δ18o and δ2h with precipitation amount of precipitation in the tropical region yadava et al 2007 iii the continental effect this effect explains how the rainout system affects the isotopic composition of the rainfall and groundwater the mean δ18o of groundwater in both across and along the region between eastern arabian sea coast and the western slopes of the western ghats is around 3 0 5 and depicts the signature of homogeneous summer monsoon moisture input rather than that from the rainout history deshpande et al 2003 tripti et al 2016 recently the rain out effect has been reported for the west draining river basins of the western ghats where it is observed that the effect is limited only to the onset of summer monsoon and before the availability of excess moisture for undergoing recycling process tripti et al 2018 several studies deshpande et al 2003 kumar et al 1982 negrel et al 2011 have reported that more inland in the deccan plateau the contribution of the north east monsoon is significant and the mean groundwater exhibits higher depletion of heavy isotopes with δ18o varying from 4 to 6 however in the tropical semi arid climatic region evaporation and post evaporation processes have a greater impact on water isotopes most of the streams are ephemeral and evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall farmers rely on groundwater for agriculture which leads to over pumping problems and water table decline in this region of south india the identification of potential influence of these three effects on stable isotope ratio of water is crucial for a better understanding of hydrological budgeting ecohydrology microclimate conditions and the past climatic changes as observed from paleo records preserved in natural archives like paleowater tree ring speleothem paleosol etc 1 3 objectives of this study the present study focuses on determining the elevation effect on the isotopic composition of surface and sub surface water along the western ghats and its adjacent plateau in south india the aim is to account for the major factors controlling the surface and sub surface hydrology along the higher parts of mountain belt experiencing tropical monsoonal climate using stable water isotopes as a tracer the study involves investigation of stable isotopic composition of groundwater from the arabian sea coast and contrasting hydrologic and climatic regions towards inland between latitude 10 30 n and 13 30 n i e from thrissur kerala to agumbe karnataka whenever there was no well to access groundwater water samples were taken from spring rivulet and pond lake the three objectives of this study were to evaluate the following effects i the elevation effect on stable isotope ratio of surface and sub surface water in the humid tropical mountain belt water samples were collected from higher peaks of the western ghats in kudremukh 1100 m asl charmadi ghats 1800 m asl mullayanagiri peak 1930 m asl and the doddabetta peak in the nilgiri range 2600 m asl and compared with samples from lower elevations ii the rainfall amount effect along the tropical monsoon forest belt where there are discernible differences in the rainfall amount the surface and sub surface water from wetter inland places of the western ghats such as agumbe karnataka and the wayanad plateau around sultan bathery kerala were sampled and compared with those of coastal stations such as bakrabail and kozhikode kerala iii the effect of terrestrial factors continental effect on the stable isotope ratios of water in the humid tropical mountain ecosystem water samples were collected from different hills of the western ghats that are very close to the arabian sea within 5 km at ezhimala 200 m asl up to the peaks inland within a distance of about 110 km from the sea at doddabetta 2600 m asl these objectives primarily provide the structural sub headings used in the following sections 2 5 2 study area and sampling sites 2 1 study area the western ghats or the sahyadri range are often referred as the water tower of south indian rivers as they form the headwaters of several major and small in terms of length rivers in south india ramachandra et al 2016 the western ghats mountain belt stretches in parallel to the eastern arabian sea coast for about 1600 km covering an area of around 140 000 km2 which is interrupted only by the 30 km palghat gap at around 11 n latitude in kerala south india this mountain belt hosts a globally significant geomorphic feature with its unique influence on the wide scale biophysical and ecological processes over the indian peninsula unesco 2012 the western ghats provide orography required for the summer monsoon winds in its western part and acts as a climate barrier gunnell 1998 tawde and singh 2015 which makes the plateau arid in the eastern part due to rain shadow effect the monsoon current strikes the west coast of peninsula from west and south west meets the western ghats which presents an almost uninterrupted barrier ranging from 610 to 2134 m asl the air mass moving across the western ghats deposits most of its moisture on the windward side of the mountain ranges and then sweeps across the leeward side and interior of the peninsula in the east the orographic rainfall system leads to variability in the amount of precipitation along the mountain ranges of the western ghats the higher monsoon moisture deposited over the ghats crest results in the origin of several rivers at higher elevations and the formation of different upper watersheds on either side of the ghats slopes jain et al 2007 on the western part of the western ghats scarp several indentations have been created by a large number of short perennial torrential west flowing rivers e g nethravati gurupur swarna chaliyar periyar sharavati kali etc which traverse the narrow coastal plains before discharging into the arabian sea through narrow outlets creeks and estuaries see fig 1a most of the larger south indian rivers e g godavari krishna and kaveri which flow in the east towards the bay of bengal have their origin in the western ghats the krishna river which is the fourth largest river in terms of basin area in india originates in the middle of the western ghats near mahabaleshwar at an elevation of about 1300 m asl the southern basins are formed by its major tributaries tunga and bhadra rivers which originate at elevations 1100 m asl on the leeward side of kudremukh peak in karnataka see fig 1a further south the kaveri cauvery river originates at talakaveri on the brahmagiri hills of the kodagu district at an elevation of 1341 m asl the river flows in a south eastern direction for about 800 km through states like karnataka kerala and tamil nadu and descending the eastern ghats in a series of great falls achyuthan et al 2010 it also hosts tributaries from the nilgiris bhavani and annamalai amaravati the two highest peaks 2600 m asl in south india these river basins host larger tropical forest ecosystems the river basins of south india receive their maximum rainfall during the south west monsoon however the depressions in the bay of bengal causing widespread heavy rains and cyclones contribute moisture to the river basins in the eastern part of the western ghats during the winter monsoon period the rainfall map of south india is given in fig 1b where the asymmetry induced by the western ghats is well represented on the windward side the narrow arabian sea coast of india exhibit annual monsoon rainfall from 2500 to 4000 mm with mostly a unimodal type dominant summer monsoon on the leeward side the monsoon is of bimodal type dual monsoon system representing summer and winter monsoons with annual rainfall dropping rapidly from 2500 to 500 mm the regional monthly rainfall india meteorological department government of india of the sampling locations during 2013 2014 is given in fig 1c and the sampling month is marked by blue rectangle between october and december representing the period after the summer monsoon the annual rainfall amount and oxygen isotope ratio for selected locations is given in fig 1d 2 2 sampling sites earlier works gurumurthy et al 2015 lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 2018 involved groundwater and river water sampling from southern karnataka on the arabian sea coast within the river basins of swarna and nethravati and the nearby ghats kudremukh and charmadi ghats for the purpose of this study we sampled mainly groundwater river spring and pond water at higher elevations on the arabian sea coastal side of the western ghats and also groundwater river and lake water at the sources of east flowing rivers with their watersheds draining the eastern part of the western ghats field sites have been selected for collecting representative samples to address the three major factors like elevation rainfall amount and continental effects as described in the following sections 2 2 1 elevation effect to test the elevation effect we have sampled water from isolated peaks exhibiting elevation greater than 2000 m asl from the nilgiri ranges covers 2500 km2 area and hosts 24 peaks which include doddabetta peak 2640 m asl and mukurthi peak 2550 m asl the elevations of these isolated peaks are higher than the average typical mountain hills 600 1300 m asl of the western ghats before stating of minimal isotopic elevation effect in the western ghats there was a need for spatial sampling at the level of the highest mountain belt of the nilgiris 2 2 2 rainfall amount effect outside the rain shadow effects of eastern side of the western ghats there is strong rainfall amount variability along the west coast and at higher peaks in south india figs 1b and 1c the mean annual rainfall increases from south to north i e thrissur latitude 10 30 n annual rainfall 3000 mm to udupi latitude 13 30 n annual rainfall 4500 mm which is nearly the maximum for a coastal station gunnell 1998 to test the rainfall effect we sampled two wettest places of the western ghats in karnataka at agumbe with rainfall traversing through udupi with a mean value of 5500 mm and in kerala i e the wayanad plateau at vythiri with rainfall traversing through kozhikode with a mean value of 3800 mm these stations display similar geographic features relatively lower elevation 600 800 masl close to the arabian sea 40 45 km and surrounded by higher peaks to intercept the monsoon rainfall with an increase of 500 1000 mm year relative to the corresponding coastal station 2 2 3 continental effect to test the distance from the sea coastline and possible continental effect sampling was performed in a midland station of north kerala at bakrabail and in the inland mountains like agumbe and nilgiris during november 2013 which are located at different distances from the arabian sea refer table 1 additional sampling was undertaken during october 2014 from locations adjacent to coast at ezhimala hill 12 01 n 75 12 e and thottada 11 50 n 75 24 e to obtain the signatures of the direct sea moisture this area of north kerala is unique as it is the single place of abrupt rocky spur 286 m asl facing directly the arabian sea along the long sandy coast in southwest india which was sampled for this study 3 materials and methods the methodology followed to investigate the three research questions i e isotopic elevation effect rainfall amount effect and continental effect in view to understand the hydrological cycle in the study area geographic stretch from agumbe to ooty include sampling of the available groundwater spring and lake on a wider scale of elevation dry and wet areas and their distance from the arabian sea here after referred as distance to coastline sea in this study water sampling has been performed with the same hydrological condition under average water level condition during the end of the monsoon from october to december depending on the location fig 1c the main criteria of the sampled water were its isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h values and water conductivity and temperature whenever available 3 1 sampling and analysis of water for stable isotopes about 50 water samples were collected during the winter monsoon season soon after the withdrawal of summer monsoon in november 2013 and october 2014 fig 1c for the study of the elevation effect thirteen water samples groundwater rivulet spring and lake were collected during november 2013 in the area of mukurthi peak pykara lake and doddabetta peak between 1990 m and 2630 m asl for the study of the rainfall amount effect six water samples groundwater rivulet and pond were collected in the area of agumbe during november 2013 and seven groundwater rivulet and spring in the area of the wayanad plateau during october 2014 in addition water samples rivulet ponds spring and horizontal pipe flow water from soil sub surface layer were collected during november 2013 in the area of bakrabail n 5 and during october 2014 in the area of ezhimala n 16 for the study of the continental effect the groundwater samples were collected from dug wells or open well ow and hand pumps or bore well bw dug wells and hand pumps that are regularly used were chosen for sampling in case of dug well sampling the samples were collected by lifting the water using a polythene bucket when dug well or hand pump were not available water samples were taken from spring or rivulet and pond or lake at a depth of 50 cm to avoid any surface evaporation effect for each location water samples in 10 ml glass vials with tight capswere collected for isotopic measurements water temperature c only in 2013 and electrical conductivity µs cm were determined on site using hach multi parameter probes the exact positions of the sample sites were located with a gps all the sampling sites are shown in fig 1a and details are given in table 1 the samples were kept under room temperature until analysis of their stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h on an isoprime 100 continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime cheadle hulme uk coupled with a geo multiflow for water gas equilibration elementar hanau germany the stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen are defined with δ notation and unit as suggested by craig 1961 and redefined by coplen 2011 the δ18o value of oxygen isotope is defined as δ 18 o vsmow slap 18 o 16 o sample 18 o 16 o standard 1 for hydrogen isotope the δ2h value is defined as δ 2 h vsmow slap 2 h 1 h sample 2 h 1 h standard 1 in the laboratory 0 3 ml aliquot of water was transferred into capped 3 7 ml vial for analysis the sample vials used for δ18o measurements were flushed offline with a gas mixture of 5 co2in helium the operating vials were then left to equilibrate at 40 c for about 8 hr the analytical precision of the measurements was 0 2 in order to measure the δ2h signatures of the samples hokko beads were added to the 3 7 ml vials containing water samples and internal standards before the vials were flushed offline with a gas mixture of 5 h2in helium the operating vials were then left to equilibrate at 40 c for about 8 hr the measurements were made in replicate and the typical reproducibility was 2 0 four internal standards were used namely w 1 δ 18 o 1 5 0 2 δ 2 h 5 0 2 w 2 δ 18 o 6 2 0 2 δ 2 h 38 0 2 w 3 δ 18 o 10 5 0 2 δ 2 h 68 0 1 7 w 4 δ 18 o 15 5 0 2 δ 2 h 110 0 2 7 they were regularly checked against international reference standards v smow and v slap provided by the international atomic energy agency iaea vienna the deuterium excess d excess was calculated according to craig s formula craig 1961 as explained by dansgaard 1964 i e d excess δ2h 8 δ18o 3 2 air masses trajectory analysis in order to better understand the hydrological conditions during sampling and origin of the previous rainfall an air mass back trajectory model was used the program for hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit developed by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa has been run for the sampling dates of main stations this model is run for the air masses back trajectories upto five days to check if any short term severe cyclonic event generally the case during the winter monsoon over indian subcontinent has impacted the hydrological systems in the western ghats prior to sampling 3 3 statistical analysis the simple mean standard deviation and regression were calculated using microsoft excel 2016 whereas the multiple linear regression analysis was performed using past v 3 15 the dependent variable was the δ18o values and the independent variables were the elevation elevation effect the distance to coastline continental effect and the annual rainfall amount rainfall amount effect 4 results the physico chemical parameters temperature and electrical conductivity and stable isotopic composition of water samples collected in hills and plateaus along the western ghats stretch are given in table 2 the temperature of water measured onsite is reported here to understand its influence on the stable isotope ratios it is observed that the water samples display lower oxygen isotope ratios i e more negative δ18o values at low temperature regions fig 2a the relationship of measured δ18o with water temperature for the study period exhibits a similar trend as observed for the global water dδ18o dt 0 66 c dansgaard 1964 but with a lower slope dδ18o dt 0 36 c as the monitored water samples correspond to higher temperature range 10 30 c the electrical conductivity is also provided as it forms a proxy to predict the geologic bedrock composition and the water residence time most of the sampled groundwater and spring water except in the bore well bw and lake display low ionic content with a mean conductivity of 39 20 µs cm n 33 and close to that of rain water 20 µs cm this is due to the presence of the dominant silicate rock in the basin and the abundant tropical monsoon rainfall which further leads to dilution the highest conductivity values are measured in lakes where the water is stored for a longer time and in bore well compared to open well with a mean value of 229 126 µs cm n 11 human activity also leads to an increased conductivity as observed for the open well in the middle of the town of sultan bathery 231 µs cm and for the ooty lake 450 µs cm the high values for the coastal sampling of the river and rivulet at thottada up to 387 µs cm arise certainly from moderate saline intrusion thus the conductivity of sampled water in these tropical mountainous regions varies between 20 µs cm and 500 µs cm depicting higher rain water input to more water rock interaction and anthropogenic interventions respectively the relationship between conductivity and δ18o values is shown in fig 2b the overall relationship of δ18o versus δ2h is shown in fig 3 most of the samples fall on the global meteoric water line gmwl as defined by craig 1961 few samples of pond and lake are located below the gmwl with deuterium excess d excess values ranging from 2 1 to 5 3 showing evaporation effect on the isotope ratios of larger surface water bodies on the contrary mainly at low elevation of the forested area high d excess suggests that the source vapour of the available water was formed from recycled moisture with d excess values ranging from 13 25 to 18 68 it is for the first time that such depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen δ18o 8 in water has been observed in south india few rainfall samples obtained at ooty during the nighttime in november 2013 display δ18o values between 16 and 17 9 not plotted in fig 3 4 1 elevation effect in general under the influence of warm tropical climate the surface and sub surface water temperature is close to air temperature 26 2 c for the low to middle elevation 1500 m asl but in the nilgiri mountains as the elevation reaches 2000 m asl the temperature decreases rapidly table 2 on the summit of the nilgiris in doddabetta peak spring water temperature of about 12 c has been measured during november 2013 and the case of frost was reported earlier at the meteorological station on the hilltop negi 1996 the δ18o values of water samples from mountainous regions between arabian sea coast and western ghats are plotted against the elevation of sampling location to identify the presence of elevation effect on the stable isotope ratios of water fig 4 clearly two groups of samples are observed the first set of samples for elevation below 2050 m asl with a low slope 0 09 100 m r2 0 4 and a second set beyond 2050 m asl with a higher slope 2 5 100 m r2 0 7 table 3 summarizes the reported studies on isotopic elevation effect from the pioneer works to more focus on tropical areas and indian terrain the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 data points reported in table 1 the elevation effect is very significant r2 0 7 p 0 0001 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 2 rainfall amount effect the mean stable isotope ratios of rain water groundwater and river water in the wettest river basins annual rainfall amount of 5500 1500 mm in swarna and nethravati basins of the western ghats in karnataka was reported to be around 3 05 0 2 for δ18o with d excess of about 17 7 3 1 tripti et al 2016 water samples of agumbe the wettest place in south india as well as along the spatial stretch of the western ghats display an average isotope ratio of about 3 14 0 6 for δ18o with d excess of about 10 16 4 7 excluding pond and waterfall table 2 the observed stable isotope ratios of groundwater in the wet locations of the western ghats stretch in karnataka show less depletion of heavy isotopes in water compared to its coastal track at udupi and bakrabail rain water δ18o 2 84 0 28 and d excess 16 5 2 1 tripti et al 2016 which receives relatively lower annual rainfall amount of about 4000 500 mm the isotope ratios of water samples from the wayanad plateau around sultan battery the wettest place annual rainfall up to 4000 mm in kerala display mean values of about 3 36 0 57 for δ18o and 12 95 5 06 for d excess table 2 this isotopic ratio of groundwater is relatively lower than that of the long term mean rainfall δ18o 2 97 0 73 and d excess 10 66 0 72 warrier et al 2010 in the corresponding coastal station of kozhikode receiving annual rainfall amount of 3000 mm it can be observed from fig 5 that except the near shore areas like ezhimala and thottada and the inland region close to the nilgiri range pykara and doddabetta all other water sample locations independent of their annual rainfall present a mean δ18o value similar to that of the west coast groundwater δ18o 3 1 0 3 tripti et al 2016 the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 points reported in table 1 the annual rainfall parameter or rainfall amount effect is not significant r2 0 4 p 0 39 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 3 continental effect when the air masses move away from the arabian sea towards the inland until the western ghats mountain belt there is a significant continental effect on stable isotope ratios of water the variability in mean δ18o values as a function of distance to the arabian sea for nine sampling regions is plotted in fig 5 water samples located close to the sea distance 5 km show δ18o values of about 2 which then decreases to 3 towards the inland i e 5 km distance 40 km along the western part of the western ghats including the sample location on the moderate elevation mountains like agumbe and wayanad only the water samples from stations located far away from the sea distance 100 km like the nilgiris display more depleted oxygen isotopes of about 8 the multiple linear regression shows that for the 51 data points reported in table 1 the distance to the sea or continental effect is not significant r2 0 56 p 0 18 table 4 to explain the δ18o values 4 4 air masses trajectories the results of the hysplit simulations are given in fig 6 for the stations along the arabian sea coast agumbe and bakrabail of mid november 2013 there is an influence of north east monsoon with continental effect at low elevation and an influence of the arabian sea side is observed at higher elevation for the lower elevation stations on the nilgiris ooty and pykara of november 19 2013 the air masses come from the north east monsoon with coastal and maritime effect for the sampling stations in doddabetta madikeri thrissur respectively on november18 december 02 and december 05 during 2013 and ezhimala october 14 2014 mainly it is the influence of bay of bengal with maritime trajectories as observed in fig 6 overall the sampling was performed under north east winter monsoon conditions with more continental effects for mid november sampling to more maritime effects for the early december sampling 5 discussion in this section we review the main factors elevation amount and continental effects controlling the water isotope ratios in perspective with the new results obtained for the western ghats mountain belt covering a latitudinal stretch of about 500 km between 10 30 n and 14 n in south india 5 1 elevation effect most of the climatological ecological and geophysical studies reported the effect of elevation on stable isotope ratio of water as altitude effect which has been now rephrased as elevation effect mcvicar and körner 2013 the compilation of 68 studies by poage and chamberlain 2001 reports an isotopic lapse rate ranging from 0 10 to 0 51 100 m asl on δ18o values except extreme latitudes 0 62 to 1 83 100 m asl with a mean value of 0 28 0 03 100 m asl in the himalayas the isotopic lapse rate ranges between 0 14 100 m asl on the indian slope and up to 0 25 100 m asl on the tibetan plateau poage and chamberlain 2001 limited studies focused on the elevation effect in south india the study on groundwater isotopes by deshpande et al 2003 detected a possible elevation effect of 0 4 100 m asl for δ18o in well water located at an elevation between 400 and 1000 m asl in southwest india but from the recalculation of slope for the whole set of points located between arabian sea coast and 914 m asl as displayed in fig 8a of deshpande et al 2003 the isotopic lapse rate is only 0 11 100 m asl similar values 0 12 100 m asl scholl et al 2009 of isotopic depletion with elevation has been reported for the tropical coastal forest in puerto rico recent study on the precipitation across the pamba river kerala suggest an isotopic lapse rate of about 0 10 100 m asl resmi et al 2016 table 3 summarizes the reported studies on isotopic elevation effect from the pioneer works to more focus on tropical areas and indian terrain in sri lanka edirisinghe et al 2017 have reported the isotopic lapse rate of 0 6 100 m asl for the north east monsoon but no value for the south west monsoon has been reported as there was no enough rain water collectors on the south west of sri lanka in our earlier studies lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2016 the sampling along the hill slopes of kudremukh charmadi ghats 1300 1800 m asl and mullayanigiri 1900 m asl highest peak of karnataka did not show any isotopic elevation effect for δ18o variability the data on stable isotope ratio of water samples from this work show an isotopic lapse rate of 0 09 100 m for stations below 2050 m asl which is similar to that reported in other tropical areas table 3 but for the region at elevation greater than 2050 m asl in the western ghats belt of south india a stronger isotopic lapse rate of about 2 5 100 m asl is found with water highly depleted in heavy isotopes of oxygen δ18o 9 5 as recorded in high mountains of the nilgiri ranges at doddabetta peak the water samples from the nilgiri ranges 1950 2300 m asl exhibit higher isotopic lapse rate of 1 5 100 m asl for δ18o whereas the mountains close to the eastern arabian sea like ezhimala agumbe and chembra exhibit no such depletion in heavy isotopes of oxygen with elevation fig 4 this indicates that there exists a unique relationship between elevation and stable isotope ratios of surface and sub surface water in different mountain ranges of the western ghats when we recalculate the overall isotopic elevation effect from 0 to 2300 m asl the overall slope value is 0 31 100 m the overall isotopic effect observed for the water of the western ghats is slightly higher than the global mean isotopic lapse rate in the humid tropical areas the isotopic elevation effect on the stable isotope ratios of water is lower around 0 10 100 m asl due to the moisture contribution from higher air vapour recycling but when reaching higher elevation of relatively less humid region our study reveals that the stable isotope ratios of water are largely controlled by elevation effect in the western ghats mountain belt until now such depletion in heavy isotope 18o of oxygen 9 5 δ18o 7 3 present study has not been reported for river and groundwater in the literature for south india although the closer values are reported in few studies achyuthan et al 2010 hameed et al 2015 firstly for the west flowing chaliyar river the lowest δ18o reported is 5 30 hameed et al 2015 for the water originating at the foothills of the chembra and mukurthi range secondly lower oxygen isotope ratios δ18o 7 7 achyuthan et al 2010 have been reported for the east flowing kaveri river near mettur dam due to significant contribution of the tributary flowing from the nilgiri range similar depleted water isotopes were observed during our sampling in november 2013 where a river in mule hole basin display δ18o 6 7 lambs et al under preparation all these studies with oxygen isotope ratios much lower than 4 5 indicate a possible depletion of heavy isotopes in water at higher peaks of the western ghats with elevation greater than 2000 m asl for other east flowing rivers of south india originating in the western ghats higher variability of stable isotope ratios has been reported i e for the maheshwaram watershed δ18o 4 7 negrel et al 2011 and for the mahanadi and godavari rivers respectively 6 1 and 5 5 lambs et al 2005 as they are largely influenced by north east monsoon it can be noted that the small isotopic elevation effect 1 on the δ18o scale observed here for the western ghats below 2000 m asl is similar to that reported for the cloud forest where there is a secondary control from strong water vapour recycling process scholl et al 2009 with a slope of 0 12 100 m as given in table 3 on the contrary in the same arabian sea coast further north as well as in the south higher isotopic elevation effect is found even below 2000 m asl in the drier regions for instance the stable isotope measurements carried out on groundwater in sri lanka north west and south west slopes on the central mountains and rajasthan on the south west slope of the aravalli mountain range represent an isotopic lapse rate of 0 18 100 m asl fig 7 data from lambs under preparation for the δ18o values it is also observed that these water samples display lower oxygen isotope ratios 8 δ18o 6 at 1400 m asl it is also important to consider the possible contribution by isotopic spike effect lambs et al 2018 of storm during the north east monsoon which leads to higher depletion of heavy isotopes in precipitation water compared with normal tropical rainfall the tropical storms display distinct depletion of heavy isotopes of oxygen in water during large tropical storms the strong convective effect generates 18o depleted rainfall with much lower oxygen isotope ratios between 12 and 8 as reported by lawrence 1998 and more recently by lambs et al 2018 the water samples obtained from inland regions in the nilgiri ranges during november 17 19 2013 show an impact from the isotopic spike effect of storms there was effectively an extremely severe cyclonic storm named phailin over the bay of bengal during october 04 14 2013 but entered the indian coast further north east in orissa of the sampling sites at a later stage during november 13 17 the storm originating from a strong depression in the bay of bengal entered the tamil nadu coast and during november 18 21 severe cyclone helen made its entry through andhra pradesh in south india the hysplit simulation fig 6 shows effectively that the air mass over the doddabetta peak had its original path from the bay of bengal more close to the andaman island from where the cyclone helen originated however the sampled water will not have much influence of storm from cyclone helen as samples were collected prior to its first landfall rain over the indian coast the water isotope ratios for the rainfall obtained during this period in the nilgiri range were effectively depleted in heavy isotopes with δ18o of about 17 0 9 rain water in equilibrium with cooler water vapour but the results are from only few samples n 2 nevertheless the huge water reservoir in ooty the ooty lake which covers an area of 3 9 km2 displays depletion in heavy oxygen isotope with δ18o value of about 5 3 it is noted that the water from this lake has a d excess value of 2 1 which shows a strong evaporation of the lake water this suggests that the original lake water exhibited more depletion of 18o in water before undergoing evaporation certainly similar to the groundwater isotope ratios δ18o 7 3 as observed for the ooty village this also indicates that the storm effect was uniform over the nilgiris and the immediate water sampling displayed a strong elevation effect in this region of the western ghats thus it is important to note that along with the northeast monsoon influence the earlier storms from cyclone phailin and bay of bengal depression had an effective contribution towards the surface water and sub surface water in the nilgiris this has led to lower water isotope ratios at higher elevations inland compared to the coastal groundwater along the eastern arabian sea side the study determines that the water from the higher mountains of the western ghats depicts the global elevation effect soon after the strong influence of the monsoon and much before the dominance of secondary processes like evaporation and contribution of recycled vapours from evapo transpiration this reveals that the time scale of observation plays a major factor poage and chamberlain 2001 in monitoring the relationship between elevation and stable isotope ratios of surface and sub surface water in the western ghats mountain belt 5 2 rainfall amount effect the highest rainfall 21 32 mm day tawde and singh 2015 in south india during summer monsoon season is observed over windward side of the western ghats mountain range in karnataka centered at 13 13 n latitude close to udupi the variability in monsoonal rainfall fig 1d with changing longitude west east direction and latitude south north direction i e across and along the western ghats gunnell 1997 corresponds to the topographic structures of the mountain barriers and the contribution from seasonal monsoon sources it is reported that the maximum rainfall due to orography of the western ghats during summer monsoon season is on an average 50 km before the highest peak and corresponds to an elevation of about 600 m asl beyond that the rainfall decreases tawde and singh 2015 it is at this middle elevation that the wettest places are found in karnataka hulikal at 13 43 n and agumbe at 13 30 n and in kerala vythiri on the edge of the wayanad plateau at 11 33 n and walakkad in the silent valley at 11 03 n tropical coastal areas are typically characterized by rain water with δ18o of about 3 1 gnip database and the groundwater of several tropical coasts and islands reflect similar mean δ18o values lambs et al 2016 2018 this is also the case for the west coast of south india with similar groundwater stable isotope ratios at udupi δ18o 3 09 0 05 n 34 tripti et al 2016 this δ18o value corresponds with the rainfall mean weighted values in the nearest gnip station kozhikode δ18o 2 97 0 73 warrier et al 2010 only the water from the eastern part of south india which is mainly influenced by the north east winter monsoon and higher continental effect display lower isotope ratios δ18o 6 deshpande et al 2003 in this study the mean oxygen isotope ratios of water at sampling stations of agumbe δ18o 2 95 0 66 n 6 bakrabail δ18o 3 05 0 34 n 5 and thrissur δ18o 3 11 are very similar although these stations received contrasting annual rainfall amount from 6000 mm agumbe to 3000 mm thrissur similar case is found further south between the wayanad plateau around sultan bathery mean groundwater δ18o 3 1 0 5 and the relative drier coastal station at kozhikode δ18o 2 97 0 73 warrier et al 2010 all these sampling stations confirm the low rainfall amount effect on the water isotopic ratio along the spatial stretch of the western ghats belt the study on stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h of groundwater surface water and rainfall from coast to inland in south west of karnataka shows weaker rainfall amount effect on the water isotope ratios due to the influence of higher continental vapour recycling process as represented by higher d excess values of about 15 in the two humid tropical basins of the western ghats tripti et al 2016 on the contrary a reversed rainfall amount effect on the δ18o variability was observed for the precipitation over mangalore yadava et al 2007 although they still show a weaker rainfall amount effect within the monsoonal months at kunnamangalam 12 km inland of kozhikode kerala the study by warrier et al 2010 shows a poor correlation between rainfall amount and δ18o δ2h values over the three years period from 2005 to 2007 the authors stated that the region receives a continuous supply of moist air masses as the south west monsoon currents move across extended marine regions before reaching kozhikode in addition the study on the δ18o variability in precipitation along the kerala stretch suggests the influence of large scale convection and cloud spread lekshmy et al 2014 rather than the rainfall amount effect recent studies hameed et al 2016 resmi et al 2016 on the spatial variability of stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h of precipitation over the kerala region also support weaker rainfall amount effect and have attributed it to the steady state supply of moisture and also vapour recycling over the continent thus the water in the west coast and along moderate elevations of the western ghats stretch in south india does not display a high correlation between the stable isotope ratios of water and precipitation amount 5 3 continental and seasonal effects as stated in the previous section precipitation rain water along the tropical coasts display δ18o value of about 3 1 gnip database and represents relative depletion of heavy isotopes than that of the seawater δ18o 0 by definition the two gnip stations in south india kozhikode and tirunelveli fig 1b display very similar weighted mean δ18o values of about 2 97 and 2 79 respectively in our earlier studies lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 it was reported that there is a homogeneity in the groundwater isotopic signature from coastal plain up to the moderate elevation 1500 masl of the ghats the mean value of δ18o in water samples was around 3 15 0 63 close to the gnip rain water δ18o value 2 97 of kozhikode fig 1b only the coastal stations adjacent to the arabian sea like the groundwater in the estuarine zone of the swarna river at hude displayed enrichment of heavy isotopes with δ18o value of about 2 26 in this study the costal stations of ezhimala and thottada which receive directly the sea moisture display respectively δ18o 1 92 0 55 n 8 and δ18o 2 31 0 74 n 8 further inland the groundwater at low elevation stations show a homogenous groundwater with δ18o around 3 this is clearly represented in fig 5 where the water isotope ratios δ18o vary between 2 95 and 3 36 except for the sample stations of ezhimala and thottada this represents that for the region stretching to about 500 km distance along the western ghats i e from udupi karnataka to thrissur kerala the groundwater and surface water display a similar oxygen isotope ratio δ18o of about 3 0 0 5 before any evaporation it is interesting that water homogeneity extends till 50 to 70 km inland including moderately elevated plateaus like agumbe madikeri and wayanad of the western ghats the higher moisture availability and the thick vegetation cover favour higher continental vapour recycling in this region the higher continental moisture recycling in the western part of the western ghats and the uniform distribution of recycled water over the short distance led to homogenous signatures in the stable isotope ratios of groundwater however there is a shift in this homogeneity further inland extending beyond 100 km from the arabian sea coast at higher elevations in the western ghats with groundwater exhibiting higher depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 7 0 1 5 as observed for the nilgiri ranges the water in this inland region exhibited colder temperature relative to that of the coastal and moderate elevation stations in the western ghats in addition these inland stations receive relatively higher north east monsoon precipitation than the west coast and thus the surface water and sub surface water are recharged with more continental rainfall characterized by water with higher depletion of heavy isotopes 5 4 variability of deuterium excess there is a higher variability of d excess in the surface and subsurface water of the western ghats with mean values ranging from 6 5 to 13 42 the plot fig 8 of d excess as a function of distance from the coastline and elevation displays a lower increasing trend unlike that of the global water bershaw 2018 associated either with source moisture mixing or sub cloud evaporation the calculated d excess ranges between 3 and 20 the observed d excess variability in this humid tropical region corresponds to that reported in the jeju island korea and northeast asia lee et al 2003 however the d excess variability observed in this study corresponds less to the seasonal moisture source contribution as the west coast samples which are dominated by precipitation input from hot humid tropical marine air mass from arabian sea exhibit higher values and a larger range of d excess this is mainly dependent on the degree of regional continental moisture recycling process and distribution of the recycled vapours tripti et al 2016 influencing the incoming marine source moisture along the eastern arabian sea coast of india 5 5 statistical analysis multiple linear regression analysis was carried out for determining the extent to which the elevation effect continental effect and rainfall amount effect influence the δ18o values when running the statistical test for the whole set of points n 51 the elevation effect appears to be the most significant explicative parameter and the influence of two other effects remain insignificant if we split the dataset into two groups like in fig 4 for the first 42 points with elevation lower than 2050 m asl table 4 there is neither a strong nor a significant contribution from one specific parameter it is a global contribution which enables observation of the δ18o values to decrease from 2 along the eastern coast of arabian sea to 4 0 more inland at 1800 m asl in the western ghats for the last 9 points i e above 2050 m asl the elevation effect and the rainfall amount effect become significant r2 0 77 p 0 1 and r2 0 81 p 0 05 respectively in controlling stable isotope ratios of water at high elevation of the western ghats this suggests that for the tropical mountains of high elevation and with less relative humidity the lower isotopic ratios of surface water and sub surface water were characteristics of deep cooling due to high orographic upliftment of seasonal air moisture severe storm effect and higher annual rainfall input 5 6 implications of stable isotopes of water in the western ghats mountain belt this study and the earlier reported work lambs et al 2011 tripti et al 2013 2016 2018 suggest that in the tropical monsoon climate region of the western ghats the high water vapour recycling is due to higher precipitation warmer temperature wetlands and large vegetation cover around 40 of forest the higher moisture input 2000 mm annual precipitation 6000 mm fig 1b from the nearby oceanic source coupled with suitable temperature i e 20 t 30 c and land use land cover i e vegetation in the continent supports high relative air humidity 75 100 which triggers higher vapour recycling breitenbach et al 2010 in this region this indicates the dominance of terrestrial moisture recycling process over the western ghats rather than the rayleigh distillation process of moisture from oceanic source this is reflected by the higher stable isotope ratios of water over the continent leading to less depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 3 and higher d excess values 15 for the wetter regions of west coast however the effect of vapour recycling on the isotopic signature of incoming moisture becomes less dominant in the region where the moisture input is relatively minimal annual precipitation 2000 mm from the summer monsoon mainly due to the rain shadow effect however these inland regions exhibit relatively cooler temperature i e t 20 c due to high air lifting and contribution from north east monsoon there is a higher reflection of original moisture source and the mixing process on the stable isotope ratios of water in such semi arid tropical regions thus a clear indication of rayleigh distillation or elevation effect is observed on the isotopic signatures of moisture which in turn leads to more depletion of heavy isotopes δ18o 6 in water present in inland regions this shows that the continental vapour recycling process and their role in controlling moisture flux froehlich et al 2002 risi et al 2013 sturm et al 2007 are important factors even in the humid coastal regions receiving higher precipitation although there could be several factors that control the moisture isotopic signatures and their subsequent reflection in the groundwater and surface water this study shows that temperature coupled with higher seasonal moisture input mainly precipitation amount and vegetation cover play a significant role in governing the stable isotope ratios of water over the regional scale and the subsequent water cycle over the highlands of the western ghats mountain belt in india also it is important to note that the stable isotopes of water show homogenous signature up to moderate elevation i e 2000 m asl for the humid tropical mountains and the isotopic elevation effect is observed only in the mountains of elevation greater than 2000 m asl of the western ghats the findings of this study are significant as it has implications on the studies involving past climate and paleoelevation of the tropical mountain belt using records preserved in paleoarchives this will help in improving the understanding of isotopic signatures of paleowater tree ring speleothem and other geological records found in south india with less gnip observations stationed in south india the present study though the observation is mainly from surface and subsurface water adds to the global database as it provides the new evidence on the isotopic elevation effect along the highlands of tropical mountain rainforest ecosystem of india this also has larger implications on the ecohydrological functioning and indian monsoonal climate and further helps in the sustainable water resource management in south india 6 conclusions humid tropical mountains display a lower isotopic elevation effect due to limited temperature gradient high relative humidity evergreen forest evapotranspiration and high water vapour recycling the western ghats mountain belt of south india has similar characteristics and as such the stable isotope ratios of rainfall and water bodies exhibits lower variability with elevation up to 2000 m asl with a mean oxygen isotope ratio δ18o of about 2 5 0 5 and a limited seasonal effect maximum difference in mean δ18o between seasons is 0 5 for larger river basins and 0 2 for smaller basins the homogeneity in the ground water isotope ratio along the western coastal plain from udupi to thrissur in south india is explained by the wide scale marine moisture distribution from the dominant south west summer monsoon system the moisture characteristics on the foothills of the western ghats are more affected by the water vapour recycling as observed from the higher d excess around 15 particularly in the vegetation covered and wetland regions the present study reveals for the first time that beyond 2000 m asl in the western ghats such as in the nilgiri ranges the surface and subsurface water exhibit relatively lower stable isotope ratios with δ18o values ranging from 5 3 for the lake to 9 5 for the springs and open wells of hills at higher elevation this reflects a very strong isotopic elevation effect 1 8 100 m for δ18o for the water from the western ghats mountain belt between 2000 and 2600 m asl where the cold air temperature i e 10 20 c prevails the water contribution from the recycled vapours masks the strong effect of elevation rainfall amount and continental effect on water isotope ratios under the following conditions i when there is an increased availability of terrestrial moisture to undergo secondary processes like recycling and evaporation and ii after the vapours from short severe storm effect recedes the present study fills the gap in undestanding of isotopic elevation effect on precipitation and its subsequent reflection on isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water of the western ghats which received less scientific attention unlike that of the himalayas in northern and northeast india as the western ghats mountain belt forms the source of major south indian rivers and provides a platform for the dual monsoon system observation this study has a global implication with a new understanding on the dynamic role of tropical mountains in monitoring the humid climatic system the indian monsoon and regional hydrology of south india the monsoon arrival and its interannual variability affect numerous people living in these fertile mountain ranges and in the context of global climate change emphasize the sensitive response of these tropical mountains to anthropogenic influences thus a minor change in the land use land cover such as deforestation agricultural activities and urbanization and topography of the western ghats can have a significant impact on the degree of atmospheric moisture feedback mechanisms and is directly reflected by the climatic conditions of tropical monsoon forest ecosystem in india acknowledgements this work was funded by

6527,hydrological modeling has provided key insights into the mechanisms of land use change impacts on runoff however the uncertainty of this impact is poorly understood this paper examines the uncertainty originated from hydrological models parameters and structure in simulating hydrological responses to land use change on daily monthly and annual time scales two hydrological models swat and hspf were applied to simulate the runoff response in the xitiaoxi basin of eastern china the effects of three land use scenarios in 1985 2002 and 2014 were analyzed with respect to the expansion of urban areas and reduction of cropland and forests the changes in streamflow with multi timescales between two models were compared at the whole basin and the sub basin scales the parameter uncertainty was estimated based on a sequential uncertainty analysis method sufi 2 the results indicate that the two models swat and hspf could reproduce the observed daily and seasonal flows well but they cannot accurately reconstruct the extreme flows such as annual 7 day minimum discharge r 7dmin the effect of parameter uncertainty on streamflow varies over time scales the simulated annual and monthly runoff change values show large discrepancies but with same trends the simulated changes for annual maximum discharge r 1dmax and r 7dmin often show different signs the average width of the predictive interval in the relative change of different flow characteristics exceeded 100 of the average relative changes for both models hspf tends to present larger relative changes for the annual and monthly runoffs compared to swat moreover the model choice could affect the direction change in r 1dmax and r 7dmin however when land use change was significant to a certain degree both models simulated increased r 1dmax and decreased r 7dmin but with different significance levels the study suggests that the model structure represents an additional uncertainty which should be accounted for in the land use change impact assessment keywords land use change hydrological modelling uncertainty relative change in runoff swat hspf 1 introduction land use change caused by human activities is an important driver that alters the hydrological and ecological processes over a range of temporal and spatial scales it influences canopy interception infiltration and evaporation thus causing flood drought disasters and ecological complications e g chang 2007 chen et al 2009 chu et al 2013 lin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive understanding and assessment of land use change impacts on hydrological processes is essential for environmental policies and decisions which should provide managerial options that focus on water resource allocations riparian ecosystem protection and river restoration etc chu et al 2013 sharifi et al 2017 in the last two decades many efforts were made to better understand the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes the spatially distributed hydrological models were widely employed to predict the hydrological responses to land use change singh et al 2015 li et al 2018b conventionally this is done by setting up a hydrological model for a baseline land use scenario lus after calibrating and validating the model it is then re processed for different luss using the same meteorological inputs subsequently the differences between these simulations are compared however it is widely acknowledged that hydrological modelling is subject to a wide range of uncertainties which are commonly from the measured input data model parameters and model structure xu et al 2007 ma et al 2018 considering these sources of uncertainty it seems reasonable to doubt the reliability of the estimated hydrological responses to land use change especially when minor or moderate responses were observed brath et al 2006 huisman et al 2009 yin et al 2017 although much attention has been paid to the model predictive uncertainties less for uncertainties in the context of impact assessment of land use change model structural and parameter uncertainties can generally be considered as the two main sources in the hydrological modeling process brigode et al 2013 parameter uncertainty represents the prediction uncertainty derived from parameter non uniqueness due to parameter interactions and model complexity jiang et al 2015 eckhardt et al 2003 and breuer et al 2006 examined the parameter uncertainty in the hydrological response to land use change based on a monte carlo simulation and their results suggest a significant output uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the model parameterization in a recent study niraula et al 2015 found that the values for both absolute and relative changes in runoff due to land use change were significantly different for different calibration approaches i e an uncalibrated a single outlet calibrated and a spatially calibrated mode these varied calibration approaches reflect the impacts of the different parameter sets to some extent previous studies show that the uncertainty related to the hydrological model parameters could be significant and it should not be overlooked in land use change impact studies in terms of structural uncertainty it is generally caused by the limited understanding and simplification of real hydrological systems all model structures contain errors to some extent athira et al 2018 however most of the studies employ a single hydrological model in impact assessment of land use change and disregard any structural uncertainty therein the selected hydrological model might strongly affect the hydrological response to land use change the luchem assessing the impact of land use change on hydrology by ensemble modeling project breuer and huisman 2009 huisman et al 2009 applied an ensemble of 10 hydrological models in the dill catchment of germany to address the impact of land use change the results indicated that there was a general agreement between the direction change in the mean annual discharge similarly cornelissen et al 2013 and morán tejeda et al 2015 addressed the model structural uncertainty in the evaluation of hydrological sensitivity to land use and climate changes based on different hydrological model types and different process based hydrological models the results from both studies indicated that the model choice could exert a significant influence on hydrological response to land use change however these studies have employed different calibration techniques or various objective functions to calibrate the hydrological models the differences in calibration schemes may affect the simulated hydrological responses between the models niraula et al 2015 although all the above studies indicated that the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters or model structure has significant influence on the impact assessment of land use change they mainly focused on the impacts of model uncertainty in annual or monthly runoff rather than daily scale or extreme conditions until now how the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters and model structure affects the land use change impacts on a daily scale remains unknown thus the main objective of this study is to assess 1 the influence of parameter uncertainty and 2 the effects of model structure uncertainty in simulation of land use change impacts on catchment runoff at annual monthly and daily time scales at the xitiaoxi basin which is one of the most important catchments in the taihu lake basin china it has been undergoing intensive land use change due to rapid economic growth and urbanization in the past decades zhang et al 2014a runoff change characteristics due to land use change in the xitiaoxi basin are therefore important in helping to manage the taihu lake in a sustainable healthy manner zhou et al 2013 to this end two watershed models the soil and water assessment tool swat and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and three historical luss were used to simulate the hydrological response at annual monthly and daily time scales in the xitiaoxi basin the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the study area and land use change then the details about the two hydrological models the model calibration method and the uncertainty estimation methods for impact assessment of land use change are given in section 3 in section 4 the model calibration results as well as the results to the two objectives of the study are demonstrated and analyzed these results are discussed and compared to those of other studies in section 5 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area 2 1 geographical overview the xitiaoxi river is one of the most important tributaries of the taihu lake basin and it contributes 27 7 of the lake s water volume the drainage area controlled by the hengtangcun streamflow gauge is 1273 km2 there are two large multipurpose reservoirs established i e fushi and laoshikan reservoirs in the upstream region of the xitaoxi basin serving the main function of flood control due to the great disturbance posed on the streamflow the area between the hengtangcun stream gauge and the two reservoirs is chosen for the current study with the total area of 727 km2 fig 1 the climate in the study area is subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 15 5 c and 1465 8 mm respectively more than 75 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october the major land use types are forest mainly including mixed forest and broadleaf forest with high fractional vegetation cover cropland including rice and dryland and urban areas major soil types in the watershed are yellowish red soil paddy soil red soil and yellow soil 2 2 land use change in the past decades considerable land use changes have occurred within the study area and three historical luss referring to the years 1985 2002 and 2014 were used to investigate the land use changes the 1985 and 2002 land use maps were acquired by digitizing the land use maps 1 100 000 in 1985 and 2002 the 2014 map was obtained from landsat enhanced thematic mapper etm image based on supervised classification and manual interpretation as well as ground truthing and the overall accuracy of land cover classification was about 89 8 the land use was categorized into five major types forest cropland urban water and bare land the land use changes are summarized in fig 2 it is seen from the figure that the major change in the past 30 years is a rapid expansion of the urban areas at the expense of cropland and forest the urban area has increased from 35 43 km2 4 9 in 1985 to 60 96 km2 8 4 in 2002 and to 124 12 km2 17 0 in 2014 it has significantly increased by 250 from 1985 to 2014 the increase was counterbalanced by the decrease in cropland and forest by 40 2 and 5 8 respectively from 1985 to 2014 the forest area decreased from 522 01 km2 71 7 in 1985 to 509 73 km2 70 0 in 2002 and 491 65 km2 67 5 in 2014 while the cropland area decreased from 150 04 km2 20 6 in 1985 to 135 80 km2 18 6 in 2002 and to 896 99 km2 12 3 in 2014 water and bare land areas both increased decreased slightly during 1985 to 2014 in addition compared to the land use change between 1985 and 2002 the watershed experienced a more significant change from 2002 to 2014 3 material and methods 3 1 description of the hspf and swat models in this study hspf and swat were both applied for assessing the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes both models are semi distributed and widely used by the hydrology community the two models differ in model structures and process representations as well as complexity the models basic characteristics and inputs are summarized in table 1 while the text presents detailed descriptions of the most important differences in process representation between hspf and swat hspf is based on the original stanford watershed model iv crawford and linsley 1966 johnson et al 2003 it is a comprehensive continuous semi distributed conceptual model that simulates the various hydrological processes and water quality components of a watershed bicknell et al 2001 hspf consists of three main modules perlnd implnd and rchres the perlnd module simulates water quantity in a pervious land including interception et surface detention surface runoff infiltration interflow base flow and deep percolation donigian et al 1995 the implnd module simulates hydrological processes in impervious land and only the surface detention and surface runoff components are simulated the rchres module simulates the processes which occur in the stream reaches and reservoirs in a watershed swat is a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that was designed to predict continuous long time runoff sediment and agricultural chemical yields in a watershed swat divides the hydrological processes into a land phase and a routing phase the land phase calculates the input of water sediment nutrients and pesticides to the main channel in each sub basin cibin et al 2010 this is performed based on the water balance concept that considers the most important processes such as precipitation et interception surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow the routing phase connects all sub basins by means of the main channel and simulates the movement of water sediment to the basin outlet hsfp and swat subdivide the watershed into a number of sub basins based on the digital elevation model dem and subsequently the sub basins are delineated into hydrological response units hrus swat creates hrus based on a homogeneous combination of land use soil type and slope class arnold et al 1993 while hspf partitions the sub basins to pervious and impervious land segments based on land use and meteorological conditions gebremariam et al 2014 whereas swat divides the soil into numerical layers hspf divides the soil into two storage components i e upper and lower zones upper zone storage is filled by rainfall that is not captured by interception and runoff while lower zone storage is filled by infiltration or percolation which was determined by the water level in upper zone storage and its nominal storage lzsn hspf and swat differ in their representation of interflow in swat interflow is calculated using a linear function that consists of slope length and angle saturated conductivity drainable porosity and the amount of water that is stored in the saturated zone cornelissen et al 2013 in hspf interflow is calculated on the basis of a linear relation between the conceptual interflow storage volume and lateral flow as a function of the interflow recession coefficient irc in addition hspf and swat adopt a linear storage approach to calculate baseflow they simulate one inactive groundwater storage and one active groundwater storage the inactive groundwater storage does not contribute to baseflow while the active groundwater storage is linked to the river system 3 2 data sources the input data required by swat and hspf are summarized in table 2 the climate precipitation and discharge data were collected as daily total or averages for the period 1977 2014 identical climate and precipitation data fig 1 were used to run the models while the periodicity of the data for the hspf model was disaggregated into hourly intervals in contrast to the daily data used for swat the disaggregation was done at the reference station that has hourly precipitation data based on the data disaggregation tool in the watershed data management utility wdmutil of hspf fig 1 3 3 model setup and calibration 3 3 1 model setup hspf and swat were run on the same sub watershed delineation data swat application was set up using arcswat the study area was divided into 23 sub basins with 178 209 and 206 hrus for 1985 2002 and 2014 luss respectively the sub basin delineation was based on land uses soil types and slope classes that contributed more than 5 10 and 20 to each sub basin respectively land use codes such as agrr frst urmd and watr refer to cropland forest urban and water respectively hspf was set up using the basins interface version 4 0 to maintain similarity the sub basins and stream reaches from swat were imported into basins by manually editing the user control input uci file of hspf generated using the winhspf interface the same land use codes of swat were adopted for hspf 3 3 2 model calibration sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed for swat and hspf using the same methods sensitivity analysis was conducted using the morris 1991 method which perturbed one parameter and measured the change in the model output the method proposed two sensitivity measures to analyze the data μ which estimates the overall effect of each input on the output and σ which estimates the higher order effects such as nonlinearity and interactions between inputs the morris suggests evaluating a graphical representation of μ vs σ to determine the most important factors the details of the morris method can be referred to campolongo et al 2007 and tong 2008 a sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi 2 was used for auto calibration abbaspour et al 2004 the sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach that uses a global search method along with the latin hypercube sampling technique lhs iman and conover 1980 to examine the behavior of objective functions abbaspour et al 2004 sufi 2 is a model independent calibration approach it changes the related model input files for the model during the calibration process the details of sufi 2 can be referred to abbaspour et al 2004 in this study the sufi 2 was implemented using a swat cup software abbaspour 2007 for swat a hspf py package that was developed in python by the authors was used for auto calibration of sufi 2 for hspf ideally when a hydrological model is used to evaluate the impact of land use change it should be validated by comparing with the scenario after the land use change huisman et al 2009 considering the land use change because of the urbanization in the study area fig 2 we select the periods close to the year of land use maps available for calibration or validation therefore calibrations for swat and hspf in the period of 1981 to1989 were performed using the land use data in 1985 while validations in the period of 1998 to 2006 were performed using the land use in 2002 the years of 1981 and 1998 were regarded as warm up periods for model simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is the most widely used criterion for assessing the performance of hydrologic models was chosen as the objective function in this study besides the nse other conventional model performance statistics including percent bias pbias the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the error variance ve were also calculated to evaluate the performances of the hydrological models these statistics are defined as 1 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 pbias i 1 n s i o i 100 i 1 n o i 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 4 mae i 1 n s i o n 5 ve 1 i 1 n s i o i 1 n o i 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where oi and si are observed and simulated flows at the ith time step and o and s are the average values of the observed and simulated flows respectively 3 4 quantification of flow changes in multi timescales due to land use change with uncertainty for a better assessment of the runoff at different time scales due to land use change the analyses have been conducted at the whole basin and sub basin scales in particular the effects of land use change on streamflow have a greater magnitude in relative terms in the selected sub basin than that in the whole basin the most significant increases in urban area occurred in sub basin 4 the urban area has increased significantly from 1985 to 2014 by 1257 65 correspondingly the percentage of urban area has increased from 5 8 in 1985 to 13 1 in 2002 and to 78 0 in 2014 fig 2 b therefore the uncertainties in land use change impacts were analyzed at the whole basin and the sub basin 4 3 4 1 temporal change analysis hydrological response due to land use change was simulated by fixing the climate data from 1978 to 2014 and altering the lus referred from the data of years 1985 2002 and 2014 different flow characteristics at different time scales were analyzed including the average annual runoff average monthly runoff annual 1 day maximum flow r 1dmax and the mean annual 7 day minimum flow r 7dmin the r 1dmax and r 7dmin were used to assess the effect of land use change on extremely high and low flows respectively the relative change rc was adopted to investigate the impact of luss on flow indicators it assesses the sign of the change and quantifies its magnitude relative to a base reference the lus of 1985 was used as the baseline control scenario against all changes it is expressed as 7 rc r y r x r x 100 where r y and r x are the values of the flow characteristics for the lus y 2002 or 2014 and the baseline lus x 1985 3 4 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty in the hydrological response to land use change can be introduced from different sources but with the main source of parameter uncertainty zhang et al 2014b several methods for investigating the parameter uncertainty such as glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation mcmc markov chain monte carlo and sufi 2 methods have been developed yang et al 2008 compared the results of five techniques for parameter uncertainty analysis in a swat application the sufi 2 algorithm is found to be most efficient in terms of computational effort to reach a satisfactory simulation sufi 2 is used for the parameter uncertainty analysis in the study the uncertainty in parameterization is quantified for behavioral parameters identified during the model calibration by sufi 2 for the two models hspf and swat the uncertainty of model simulation results is analyzed using 95ppu that is calculated as the difference of 2 5 and 97 5 levels of cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through lhs here the uncertainty is quantified by a p factor and a r factor the p factor represents the percentage of observed data within the 95ppu band and the r factor is the average width of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the observed data an ideal case would result in a p factor of about 1 and a r factor near 0 however an ideal situation cannot be achieved for real cases due to the multiple sources of uncertainties the r factor and p factor are defined as follows 8 r 1 n t i 1 n y t i 97 5 m y t i 2 5 m 9 r r σ obs 10 p n q in n 100 where y t i 97 5 m and y t i 2 5 m represent the upper and lower levels of the 95ppu n is the number of data records σobs is the standard deviation of the observed data and nqin is the measured value number bracketed by the 95ppu more details can be found in abbaspour et al 2004 as demonstrated by bastola et al 2011 the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters in model prediction is expressed in terms of the average width of prediction interval pi of average relative change the pi is quantified as 11 pi s t s t s t 100 where s t and s t represent the upper and lower 95 confidence limits of the simulated rc for the behavioral parameter sets and s t represents the average value for the behavioral parameter sets respectively in order to reduce the impact of different signs of s t the values of rc for each parameter set between 1978 and 2014 must be standardized with the formula x s t d z x i x m i n x m a x x m i n another uncertainty source considered in this study is the model structure the average change value in the flow characteristics of the behavioral parameters for each model is regarded as a true value for the model parameter subsequently the results from the hspf and the swat models are compared to estimate the uncertainty due to the model structure 4 results 4 1 evaluation of models performance sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the influence of uncertainty factors on the output of a function the morris method is used to identify the sensitive parameters affecting the simulations of output variables touhami et al 2013 based on the morris results fig 3 there were six sensitive parameters namely infilt agwrc irc deepfr basetp and uzsn for hspf while nine sensitive parameters including cn2 ch n2 alpha bf sol k esco sol awc rchrg dp gw revap and surlag for swat table 3 table 3 shows the sensitive parameters and their initial ranges the initial ranges were determined primarily according to hsfp and swat manuals and authors knowledge of the xitiaoxi basin the sufi 2 method was employed for calibration at a daily time step and three iterations with 1000 runs were executed for both models the optimum simulation results were obtained from parameter sets with the maximum nse values the model performance indices for the calibration and validation periods are presented in table 4 moriasi et al 2007 proposed that stream flow simulations are considered satisfactory for swat when nse 0 5 and pbias 25 the models were considered very good for simulating daily flows at the hengtangcun station for the calibration and validation periods with a nse 0 85 and a pbias 10 when the wet and dry seasons were considered separately each model performed well at simulating the observed daily flows with a nse 0 70 and a pbais 15 based on the pbias a majority of the discharge values were underestimated except during the wet season for the swat model in the calibration period and overestimated for both models in the validation period based on the entire performance statistics it is difficult to judge on the outperformance of one model over the other for example hspf had consistently better nse r 2 and ve values not only for the daily flows during the calibration and validation periods but also in the wet season compared to those of swat however except for the daily flow during the dry season the swat model showed lower i e better pbias values than hspf at daily and seasonal time steps during both periods table 4 according to wu et al 2015 when nse 0 7 and r 2 0 7 p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 the model simulation results are acceptable and the parameter uncertainty ranges are considered as appropriate the results from the third iteration for hspf and swat were considered as appropriate based on the above criteria the two measures the p factor and r factor are summarized in table 4 the r factor values for both models were much lower than 1 which indicate that the model simulation results are satisfactory the p factor values of swat were higher than those of the hspf for both calibration and validation periods which imply that swat has a larger contribution of parameter uncertainty to the simulation uncertainty than hspf this could be explained as a larger number of high nse values were attained for the hspf model than for the swat model the median nse values for hspf and swat were 0 89 and 0 85 in the calibration period while 0 92 and 0 86 in the validation period respectively this leads to a smaller band of 95ppu for hspf which comprised fewer observed values it can also be seen from the r factor values of hspf which were much lower than those of swat moreover both models had lower p factors for the dry season which suggest that the models may not completely capture the baseflow component of the hydrological process 4 2 effects of parameter uncertainty on the impact assessment of land use change the average values of relative changes with behavioral parameter sets in the annual and monthly runoffs due to land use change from 1985 to 2014 are shown in fig 4 along with the related uncertainty in model prediction arising from model parameters of hspf and swat in the luss 2002 and 2014 both models simulate increases at the 95 confidence level in the annual and monthly discharges for land use change from cropland and forest to urban areas at the whole basin scale although hspf and swat simulated the same direction of change in the annual and monthly discharges the impacts of uncertainty derived from model parameters on the relative changes cannot be neglected as illustrated in table 5 in the luss 2002 and 2014 at an annual scale the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 157 3 and 173 9 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 151 7 and 152 0 for hspf respectively for the monthly scale hspf and swat showed the same pattern of variation it was found that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of annual and monthly runoffs of hspf were lower than those of swat similar to the whole basin sub basin 4 presented the same change characteristics for the annual and monthly discharges fig 5 it is seen from fig 4 that for high and low flows both models showed large variations in magnitude the two models had inconsistent trends e g negative and positive relative changes co exist of relative changes at the 95 confidence level under the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin for high flows the simulated relative changes in r 1dmax showed an inconsistent trend between 1978 and 2014 at the 95 confidence level however the relative changes for most years exhibited a consistent increase in the luss 2002 and 2014 the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 162 9 and 165 2 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 213 4 and 206 3 for hspf respectively it indicates that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 1dmax of hspf were higher than those of swat unlike the changes for the whole basin both models simulated increases in the r 1dmax in sub basin4 in the lus 2014 fig 5 for r 7dmin both models simulated inconsistent trends of relative changes from 1978 to 2014 at the 95 confidence level under the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin moreover compared to the r 1dmax the inter annual variations of the average relative changes in the r 7dmin were larger for both models in the luss 2002 and 2014 the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 117 3 and 100 1 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 158 0 and 150 4 for hspf respectively table 5 it indicates that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 7dmax of hspf were higher than those of swat at the sub basin 4 we found that both models simulated inconsistent trends of relative changes in r 7dmin from 1978 to 2014 at a 95 confidence level even under the lus 2014 however unlike the changes in the whole basin the relative changes for most years exhibited a consistent decrease and the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 7dmax of swat were higher than those of hspf 4 3 effects of models structure on the impact assessment of land use change in order to evaluate the effects of model structural uncertainty on the land use change impacts the values of the average relative change in flow index based on the behavioral parameter sets for swat and hspf were compared as presented in figs 4 5 and table 5 the magnitude of the relative change in annual and monthly discharges varied between the two models the hspf showed more sensitivity to land use change than swat at the whole basin and the subbasin 4 the differences of the magnitude of relative change in annual and monthly discharges were larger when a significant land use change occurred in 2014 figs 6 and 7 present the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the average relative changes in r 1dmax and r 7dmin for the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin and the subbaisn 4 respectively the cdfs are plotted to reflect the uncertainty in land use impacts arising from model structure at the whole basin for the luss 2002 and 2014 the r 1dmax increases for all years using swat while the changes in r 1max are bidirectional e g negative and positive relative changes co exist using hspf the changes in r 7dmin are also bidirectional for hspf and swat for the lus 2014 the larger differences in the likelihood of decreased r 7dmin between swat and hspf were found it indicates that the model choice could affect the direction change e g to negative or positive direction in r 1dmax and r 7dmin in terms of sub basin 4 for the lus 2014 both models simulated increases in r 1dmax and decreases in r 7dmin however there are larger differences in cdfs between hspf and swat than that for the whole basin in table 5 for the lus 2014 the average values of relative changes of hspf and swat were 34 74 and 50 86 for r 7dmin and 109 31 and 20 92 for r 1dmax for sub basin 4 respectively swat produced larger hydrological changes in r 7dmin due to land use change while hspf showed more sensitivity to change in r 1dmax the results suggest that when the land use change rate is beyond a certain level both models simulate the same trend in r 1dmax and r 7dmin for the sub basin 4 however the difference of the simulated relative change between the two models could be significant 5 discussion 5 1 effects of parameter uncertainty on the land use change impact assessment both models indicated increases in annual and monthly discharges due to urbanization with the trends consistent with previous studies e g choi et al 2003 tang et al 2005 hurkmans et al 2009 kim et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 niraula et al 2015 li et al 2018a the uncertainty due to model parameters did not alter the trend of annual and monthly discharge changes due to land use change however a considerable variation in the magnitude of hydrological response for the different luss was observed similar conclusions have been reported by breuer et al 2006 who found a significant output uncertainty in the absolute change of annual and seasonal discharge between luss due to the uncertainty in plant parameterization although not entirely related to model parameter uncertainty niraula et al 2015 found that the relative changes in annual streamflow produced with single outlet calibrated and spatially distributed calibrated models were significantly different and the differences in the calibration approach for model simulation were reflected in the different parameter sets in addition we found that the uncertainty derived from the behavioral model parameters for each model for the luss 2002 and 2014 exceeds 100 of estimated average relative change of annual monthly flow this indicates that the impact of land use change could be potentially hidden by the simulation uncertainty derived from model parameters at the 95 confidence level the parameter uncertainty in extreme runoffs is different compared to that in monthly and annual runoffs the parameter uncertainty not only results in considerable magnitude variations of relative change but also alters the trend of the hydrological response this indicates a considerable insufficiency in the use of hydrological models calibrated against daily streamflow in the evaluation of changes in extreme runoffs due to land use change larger uncertainty bounds and inconsistent trends in relative change of extreme flows may be due to the inability of models to accurately predict flows table 6 and fig 8 show that both models yield systematic underestimation of extreme flows and highly biased predictions for r 7dmin although both models have been calibrated to match the daily average streamflow well the weakness in predicting extreme flows has been reported for swat borah et al 2007 gebremariam et al 2014 lian et al 2007 pfannerstill et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b and hspf ackerman et al 2005 lian et al 2007 gebremariam et al 2014 the highly biased prediction of the models in r 7dmin is caused partly by the calibration method the objective function nse adopted in this study tends to emphasize flood features zhang et al 2015 lin et al 2017 found that the nse value was not sensitive to the simulation results of r 7dmin furthermore the possible reason for such a large bias in r 7dmin is the deficiency of the model structure for example both models simulate one active groundwater storage and they adopt linear storage approach to calculate baseflow which cannot fully reproduce nonlinearities of groundwater processes guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014 an improved swat performance during the dry season was reported when a multi storage groundwater module was incorporated into the swat model pfannerstill et al 2014 5 2 effects of models structure on the assessment of land use change impact although many hydrological models have been applied in land use change impacts studies the uncertainty stemming from model structure is always ignored the evident differences in hydrological response predictions to land use change between hspf and swat were observed this indicates that the selection of a hydrological model plays a significant role in land use change impact analysis this is similar to the studies by morán tejeda et al 2015 and sharifi et al 2017 in this study hspf produced larger changes in monthly or annual runoffs compared to swat the differences in hydrological responses may be due to the different equations for hydrological processes i e direct runoff et in swat and hspf for swat a modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method is used to calculate the direct runoff generation once the land use altered the cn changes accordingly which leads to a variation for runoff in hspf an infiltration excess model is employed which divides precipitation inputs into infiltrating and non infiltrating fractions according to three conceptual parameters a surface storage capacity value uzsn an interflow inflow index intfw and an infiltration capacity index infilt once the land use altered the uzsn infilt and intfw change accordingly which result in differences for runoff the actual et which is a key factor influencing the water yield also varies with land use change the two models estimate the actual et by different methods swat estimates the actual et as sum of the actual et from soil and plant water evaporation these et components are represented mainly by two parameters the maximum canopy storage canmx and the soil evaporation compensation coefficient esco guse et al 2014 however these two parameters do not change with different luss du et al 2013 summarized that no study has adopted varied parameter values except the cn for the new lus when applying the swat model to simulate the hydrological response to land use change the parameters associated with the et process are assumed to be identical hspf simulates the actual et based on the potential et demand and amount of water available in the soil and on the land surface for et since there is no plant growth component in hspf the effect of vegetation type density root growth and stage of development along with the moisture characteristics of the soil layer are lumped into the lower zone et parameter lzetp which controls actual et from the lower zone storage singh et al 2005 moreover the lzetp values varied with the land use types in this paper and were the case in other studies e g im et al 2003 xu et al 2007 ribarova et al 2008 ames et al 2014 baloch et al 2015 taking the best parameter set based on the maximum nse value under the lus 2014 as an example the actual et estimated by hspf decreased by 5 15 and by 1 12 for swat hspf showed a larger relative change than swat for the actual et in terms of the changes for r 1dmax and r 7dmin we found that the model choice could impact the direction change however when land use changes are significant to a certain degree e g the lus 2014 in sub basin 4 both models simulated increased r 1dmax and decreased r 7dmin but with different significances for r 1dmax hspf simulated more significant change than swat while swat simulated more significant change than hspf for r 7dmin there appear to be two possible reasons for the magnitude of r 1dmax is smaller in swat than that in hspf one is the use of cn2 in swat versus infiltration in hspf and the other is hourly time step of precipitation data in hspf versus daily time step of precipitation data in swat the cn2 methods and daily time step cannot allow swat to consider the rainfall intensity and duration well but only total rainfall volume butcher et al 2014 comparison of watershed response to land use change using hspf and swat suggests that one should be caution when attempts to estimate the relative change using models with different underlying concept and formulations it is difficult to identify which model provides a more accurate estimate of hydrological change although swat is said to be a physically based model while hspf is a conceptual model when look at the main processes involved in water yield it is revealed that most of hydrological processes of swat are computed through empirical equations swat is less than ideal for assessing runoff response to land use change for a variety of reasons including simplified simulation of direct runoff using cn2 and simplified simulation of groundwater in addition a fixed parameterization strategy is adopted in this study and most cases when applying swat to simulate the hydrological response to land use change du et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yin et al 2017 it cannot simulate the influence of land use changes on et and channel flow and so on on the other hand hspf uses an infiltration excess mechanism to simulate overland flow which may be not suitable for a certain environment for example in the study area the runoff tends to be generated by a mixture of infiltration excess flow and saturation excess process depending on the season and places in the catchment additionally the semi distributed conceptual nature of hspf limits its use for predicting spatial distribution of soil moisture content as well as other physically measurable parameters at specific location within the watershed johnson et al 2003 hspf aggregates soil moisture content which is generally related to a specific pervious land unit across the entire watershed whereas the predictions of moisture content distribution are geographically specific by swat therefore it is hard to evaluate which model provides more accurate estimation of land use change impacts further analysis of model simulation against more observations e g soil moisture content is needed to determine an optimum model it should be evaluated in land use change impacts analysis and the estimation of structural uncertainty could be explored by combining their predictions in a systematic manner 5 3 effects of other uncertainty sources on the assessment of land use change impact apart from model parameters and structure the input data for example land use data precipitation also cause uncertainties in land use change impact assessments in this study different sources of land use data with almost equally the same resolution were used to investigate the land use change impacts numerous publications acknowledged the uncertainty contribution in hydrological models due to land use data endreny et al 2003 alfieri et al 2007 miller et al 2010 sharifi and kalin 2010 pai and saraswat 2013 yen et al 2015 bahareh et al 2017 some of these have analyzed the effect of land use categorical errors in hydrological model output finke et al 1999 miller et al 2010 pai and saraswat 2013 some of these evaluated the model prediction error due to different sources of land use data endreny et al 2003 sharifi and kalin 2010 yen et al 2015 endreny et al 2003 found that peak flows were sensitive to the source of land use data which could cause a range of uncertainty from 35 underestimation to 20 overestimation for hspf however the spatial resolutions of three alternative land cover maps adopted in endreny et al 2003 were different sharifi and kalin 2010 reported that the results of using different land use data sets coming from different sources based on no calibrated swat model have a close r 2 in flow but biased in the volume of flow they emphasize that land use maps do generate uncertainty in model predictions which could be reduced by calibration yen et al 2015 found that flow prediction was fairly unaffected by the source of land use data and model parameters may be transferable by using different sources of land use data on the same watershed in swat similar to the result of yen et al 2015 bahareh et al 2017 found that runoff seems to be less sensitive to different land use sources in swat but land use data have impacts on different components of water balance such as soil water and et therefore based on the previous and our studies we conclude that the discharge prediction seems to be less sensitive to different land use sources but the components of water balance may be sensitive to land use sources on the other hand it is widely acknowledged that the uncertainty in precipitation data has a critical effect on the accuracy of hydrological model predictions li and xu 2014 cristiano et al 2018 swat adopted daily inputs while hspf requires hourly weather inputs and hourly hspf results were aggregated to a daily time step prior to the comparison the difference of input meteorological data at multiple time steps represents the discrepancy of model structures therefore the uncertainty of model structure contains the uncertainty related with different temporal resolution of weather inputs in hspf and swat furthermore for usage of hspf daily precipitation data were disaggregated into hourly data on the reference station that has hourly precipitation data using the data disaggregation tool in wdmutil of hspf the errors in hourly weather data due to disaggregation in hspf could cause uncertainty the impact of rainfall errors on predicted flow has been highlighted by many studies e g xu et al 2006 moulin et al 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 engeland et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 cocca and doherty 2003 found that a 5 random error in precipitation generated a large range in predictions and thus significant predictive uncertainty in hspf strauch et al 2012 indicate that parameter uncertainty varied significantly depending upon the method used for precipitation data set generation in swat it was not our intention in this work to evaluate the influence of precipitation errors but this will be carried out in future research to better understand the uncertainties in land use change impacts related to models 6 conclusions this study investigated the uncertainties in hydrological modeling associated with parameters and structure in assessing the hydrologic response to land use change the study was conducted over different time scales using the hspf and swat models at the whole basin and the sub basin scales in the xitiaoxi basin of eastern china hspf and swat performed well to simulate daily and seasonal streamflows however both models showed inadequacies for the extreme flows it is difficult to arbitrarily judge a model that provides a consistently better result than the other simply based on performance metrics the parameter uncertainty in simulated streamflow changes that are induced by land use change varies over time scales the simulated r 1dmax and r 7dmin changes often show different directions this result suggests a considerable limitation on the usage of hydrological models for the variations of extreme runoffs due to land use change even if with a high nse at daily time step the impacts of land use change could be potentially hidden by the simulation uncertainty results from model parameters apart from the model parameters the model structure represents an additional source of uncertainty in hydrological response to land use change the model selection could impact the change direction of extreme runoff when minor or moderate changes of hydrological responses were observed this study demonstrates that the uncertainty in hydrological modeling that stems from model parameters and structure has a significant influence and should be considered in land use change impact assessment especially for decision maker for future land use impact analysis a multi model ensemble approach bastola et al 2011 could be adopted to improve the reliability of model predictions and the decision making process by better assessing the hydrological modeling uncertainty declaration of interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of

6527,hydrological modeling has provided key insights into the mechanisms of land use change impacts on runoff however the uncertainty of this impact is poorly understood this paper examines the uncertainty originated from hydrological models parameters and structure in simulating hydrological responses to land use change on daily monthly and annual time scales two hydrological models swat and hspf were applied to simulate the runoff response in the xitiaoxi basin of eastern china the effects of three land use scenarios in 1985 2002 and 2014 were analyzed with respect to the expansion of urban areas and reduction of cropland and forests the changes in streamflow with multi timescales between two models were compared at the whole basin and the sub basin scales the parameter uncertainty was estimated based on a sequential uncertainty analysis method sufi 2 the results indicate that the two models swat and hspf could reproduce the observed daily and seasonal flows well but they cannot accurately reconstruct the extreme flows such as annual 7 day minimum discharge r 7dmin the effect of parameter uncertainty on streamflow varies over time scales the simulated annual and monthly runoff change values show large discrepancies but with same trends the simulated changes for annual maximum discharge r 1dmax and r 7dmin often show different signs the average width of the predictive interval in the relative change of different flow characteristics exceeded 100 of the average relative changes for both models hspf tends to present larger relative changes for the annual and monthly runoffs compared to swat moreover the model choice could affect the direction change in r 1dmax and r 7dmin however when land use change was significant to a certain degree both models simulated increased r 1dmax and decreased r 7dmin but with different significance levels the study suggests that the model structure represents an additional uncertainty which should be accounted for in the land use change impact assessment keywords land use change hydrological modelling uncertainty relative change in runoff swat hspf 1 introduction land use change caused by human activities is an important driver that alters the hydrological and ecological processes over a range of temporal and spatial scales it influences canopy interception infiltration and evaporation thus causing flood drought disasters and ecological complications e g chang 2007 chen et al 2009 chu et al 2013 lin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 therefore a comprehensive understanding and assessment of land use change impacts on hydrological processes is essential for environmental policies and decisions which should provide managerial options that focus on water resource allocations riparian ecosystem protection and river restoration etc chu et al 2013 sharifi et al 2017 in the last two decades many efforts were made to better understand the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes the spatially distributed hydrological models were widely employed to predict the hydrological responses to land use change singh et al 2015 li et al 2018b conventionally this is done by setting up a hydrological model for a baseline land use scenario lus after calibrating and validating the model it is then re processed for different luss using the same meteorological inputs subsequently the differences between these simulations are compared however it is widely acknowledged that hydrological modelling is subject to a wide range of uncertainties which are commonly from the measured input data model parameters and model structure xu et al 2007 ma et al 2018 considering these sources of uncertainty it seems reasonable to doubt the reliability of the estimated hydrological responses to land use change especially when minor or moderate responses were observed brath et al 2006 huisman et al 2009 yin et al 2017 although much attention has been paid to the model predictive uncertainties less for uncertainties in the context of impact assessment of land use change model structural and parameter uncertainties can generally be considered as the two main sources in the hydrological modeling process brigode et al 2013 parameter uncertainty represents the prediction uncertainty derived from parameter non uniqueness due to parameter interactions and model complexity jiang et al 2015 eckhardt et al 2003 and breuer et al 2006 examined the parameter uncertainty in the hydrological response to land use change based on a monte carlo simulation and their results suggest a significant output uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the model parameterization in a recent study niraula et al 2015 found that the values for both absolute and relative changes in runoff due to land use change were significantly different for different calibration approaches i e an uncalibrated a single outlet calibrated and a spatially calibrated mode these varied calibration approaches reflect the impacts of the different parameter sets to some extent previous studies show that the uncertainty related to the hydrological model parameters could be significant and it should not be overlooked in land use change impact studies in terms of structural uncertainty it is generally caused by the limited understanding and simplification of real hydrological systems all model structures contain errors to some extent athira et al 2018 however most of the studies employ a single hydrological model in impact assessment of land use change and disregard any structural uncertainty therein the selected hydrological model might strongly affect the hydrological response to land use change the luchem assessing the impact of land use change on hydrology by ensemble modeling project breuer and huisman 2009 huisman et al 2009 applied an ensemble of 10 hydrological models in the dill catchment of germany to address the impact of land use change the results indicated that there was a general agreement between the direction change in the mean annual discharge similarly cornelissen et al 2013 and morán tejeda et al 2015 addressed the model structural uncertainty in the evaluation of hydrological sensitivity to land use and climate changes based on different hydrological model types and different process based hydrological models the results from both studies indicated that the model choice could exert a significant influence on hydrological response to land use change however these studies have employed different calibration techniques or various objective functions to calibrate the hydrological models the differences in calibration schemes may affect the simulated hydrological responses between the models niraula et al 2015 although all the above studies indicated that the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters or model structure has significant influence on the impact assessment of land use change they mainly focused on the impacts of model uncertainty in annual or monthly runoff rather than daily scale or extreme conditions until now how the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters and model structure affects the land use change impacts on a daily scale remains unknown thus the main objective of this study is to assess 1 the influence of parameter uncertainty and 2 the effects of model structure uncertainty in simulation of land use change impacts on catchment runoff at annual monthly and daily time scales at the xitiaoxi basin which is one of the most important catchments in the taihu lake basin china it has been undergoing intensive land use change due to rapid economic growth and urbanization in the past decades zhang et al 2014a runoff change characteristics due to land use change in the xitiaoxi basin are therefore important in helping to manage the taihu lake in a sustainable healthy manner zhou et al 2013 to this end two watershed models the soil and water assessment tool swat and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and three historical luss were used to simulate the hydrological response at annual monthly and daily time scales in the xitiaoxi basin the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 introduces the study area and land use change then the details about the two hydrological models the model calibration method and the uncertainty estimation methods for impact assessment of land use change are given in section 3 in section 4 the model calibration results as well as the results to the two objectives of the study are demonstrated and analyzed these results are discussed and compared to those of other studies in section 5 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 study area 2 1 geographical overview the xitiaoxi river is one of the most important tributaries of the taihu lake basin and it contributes 27 7 of the lake s water volume the drainage area controlled by the hengtangcun streamflow gauge is 1273 km2 there are two large multipurpose reservoirs established i e fushi and laoshikan reservoirs in the upstream region of the xitaoxi basin serving the main function of flood control due to the great disturbance posed on the streamflow the area between the hengtangcun stream gauge and the two reservoirs is chosen for the current study with the total area of 727 km2 fig 1 the climate in the study area is subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 15 5 c and 1465 8 mm respectively more than 75 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season from april to october the major land use types are forest mainly including mixed forest and broadleaf forest with high fractional vegetation cover cropland including rice and dryland and urban areas major soil types in the watershed are yellowish red soil paddy soil red soil and yellow soil 2 2 land use change in the past decades considerable land use changes have occurred within the study area and three historical luss referring to the years 1985 2002 and 2014 were used to investigate the land use changes the 1985 and 2002 land use maps were acquired by digitizing the land use maps 1 100 000 in 1985 and 2002 the 2014 map was obtained from landsat enhanced thematic mapper etm image based on supervised classification and manual interpretation as well as ground truthing and the overall accuracy of land cover classification was about 89 8 the land use was categorized into five major types forest cropland urban water and bare land the land use changes are summarized in fig 2 it is seen from the figure that the major change in the past 30 years is a rapid expansion of the urban areas at the expense of cropland and forest the urban area has increased from 35 43 km2 4 9 in 1985 to 60 96 km2 8 4 in 2002 and to 124 12 km2 17 0 in 2014 it has significantly increased by 250 from 1985 to 2014 the increase was counterbalanced by the decrease in cropland and forest by 40 2 and 5 8 respectively from 1985 to 2014 the forest area decreased from 522 01 km2 71 7 in 1985 to 509 73 km2 70 0 in 2002 and 491 65 km2 67 5 in 2014 while the cropland area decreased from 150 04 km2 20 6 in 1985 to 135 80 km2 18 6 in 2002 and to 896 99 km2 12 3 in 2014 water and bare land areas both increased decreased slightly during 1985 to 2014 in addition compared to the land use change between 1985 and 2002 the watershed experienced a more significant change from 2002 to 2014 3 material and methods 3 1 description of the hspf and swat models in this study hspf and swat were both applied for assessing the impacts of land use change on hydrological processes both models are semi distributed and widely used by the hydrology community the two models differ in model structures and process representations as well as complexity the models basic characteristics and inputs are summarized in table 1 while the text presents detailed descriptions of the most important differences in process representation between hspf and swat hspf is based on the original stanford watershed model iv crawford and linsley 1966 johnson et al 2003 it is a comprehensive continuous semi distributed conceptual model that simulates the various hydrological processes and water quality components of a watershed bicknell et al 2001 hspf consists of three main modules perlnd implnd and rchres the perlnd module simulates water quantity in a pervious land including interception et surface detention surface runoff infiltration interflow base flow and deep percolation donigian et al 1995 the implnd module simulates hydrological processes in impervious land and only the surface detention and surface runoff components are simulated the rchres module simulates the processes which occur in the stream reaches and reservoirs in a watershed swat is a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that was designed to predict continuous long time runoff sediment and agricultural chemical yields in a watershed swat divides the hydrological processes into a land phase and a routing phase the land phase calculates the input of water sediment nutrients and pesticides to the main channel in each sub basin cibin et al 2010 this is performed based on the water balance concept that considers the most important processes such as precipitation et interception surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow the routing phase connects all sub basins by means of the main channel and simulates the movement of water sediment to the basin outlet hsfp and swat subdivide the watershed into a number of sub basins based on the digital elevation model dem and subsequently the sub basins are delineated into hydrological response units hrus swat creates hrus based on a homogeneous combination of land use soil type and slope class arnold et al 1993 while hspf partitions the sub basins to pervious and impervious land segments based on land use and meteorological conditions gebremariam et al 2014 whereas swat divides the soil into numerical layers hspf divides the soil into two storage components i e upper and lower zones upper zone storage is filled by rainfall that is not captured by interception and runoff while lower zone storage is filled by infiltration or percolation which was determined by the water level in upper zone storage and its nominal storage lzsn hspf and swat differ in their representation of interflow in swat interflow is calculated using a linear function that consists of slope length and angle saturated conductivity drainable porosity and the amount of water that is stored in the saturated zone cornelissen et al 2013 in hspf interflow is calculated on the basis of a linear relation between the conceptual interflow storage volume and lateral flow as a function of the interflow recession coefficient irc in addition hspf and swat adopt a linear storage approach to calculate baseflow they simulate one inactive groundwater storage and one active groundwater storage the inactive groundwater storage does not contribute to baseflow while the active groundwater storage is linked to the river system 3 2 data sources the input data required by swat and hspf are summarized in table 2 the climate precipitation and discharge data were collected as daily total or averages for the period 1977 2014 identical climate and precipitation data fig 1 were used to run the models while the periodicity of the data for the hspf model was disaggregated into hourly intervals in contrast to the daily data used for swat the disaggregation was done at the reference station that has hourly precipitation data based on the data disaggregation tool in the watershed data management utility wdmutil of hspf fig 1 3 3 model setup and calibration 3 3 1 model setup hspf and swat were run on the same sub watershed delineation data swat application was set up using arcswat the study area was divided into 23 sub basins with 178 209 and 206 hrus for 1985 2002 and 2014 luss respectively the sub basin delineation was based on land uses soil types and slope classes that contributed more than 5 10 and 20 to each sub basin respectively land use codes such as agrr frst urmd and watr refer to cropland forest urban and water respectively hspf was set up using the basins interface version 4 0 to maintain similarity the sub basins and stream reaches from swat were imported into basins by manually editing the user control input uci file of hspf generated using the winhspf interface the same land use codes of swat were adopted for hspf 3 3 2 model calibration sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed for swat and hspf using the same methods sensitivity analysis was conducted using the morris 1991 method which perturbed one parameter and measured the change in the model output the method proposed two sensitivity measures to analyze the data μ which estimates the overall effect of each input on the output and σ which estimates the higher order effects such as nonlinearity and interactions between inputs the morris suggests evaluating a graphical representation of μ vs σ to determine the most important factors the details of the morris method can be referred to campolongo et al 2007 and tong 2008 a sequential uncertainty fitting program sufi 2 was used for auto calibration abbaspour et al 2004 the sufi 2 is a combined optimization approach that uses a global search method along with the latin hypercube sampling technique lhs iman and conover 1980 to examine the behavior of objective functions abbaspour et al 2004 sufi 2 is a model independent calibration approach it changes the related model input files for the model during the calibration process the details of sufi 2 can be referred to abbaspour et al 2004 in this study the sufi 2 was implemented using a swat cup software abbaspour 2007 for swat a hspf py package that was developed in python by the authors was used for auto calibration of sufi 2 for hspf ideally when a hydrological model is used to evaluate the impact of land use change it should be validated by comparing with the scenario after the land use change huisman et al 2009 considering the land use change because of the urbanization in the study area fig 2 we select the periods close to the year of land use maps available for calibration or validation therefore calibrations for swat and hspf in the period of 1981 to1989 were performed using the land use data in 1985 while validations in the period of 1998 to 2006 were performed using the land use in 2002 the years of 1981 and 1998 were regarded as warm up periods for model simulation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is the most widely used criterion for assessing the performance of hydrologic models was chosen as the objective function in this study besides the nse other conventional model performance statistics including percent bias pbias the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the error variance ve were also calculated to evaluate the performances of the hydrological models these statistics are defined as 1 nse 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 pbias i 1 n s i o i 100 i 1 n o i 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 4 mae i 1 n s i o n 5 ve 1 i 1 n s i o i 1 n o i 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 where oi and si are observed and simulated flows at the ith time step and o and s are the average values of the observed and simulated flows respectively 3 4 quantification of flow changes in multi timescales due to land use change with uncertainty for a better assessment of the runoff at different time scales due to land use change the analyses have been conducted at the whole basin and sub basin scales in particular the effects of land use change on streamflow have a greater magnitude in relative terms in the selected sub basin than that in the whole basin the most significant increases in urban area occurred in sub basin 4 the urban area has increased significantly from 1985 to 2014 by 1257 65 correspondingly the percentage of urban area has increased from 5 8 in 1985 to 13 1 in 2002 and to 78 0 in 2014 fig 2 b therefore the uncertainties in land use change impacts were analyzed at the whole basin and the sub basin 4 3 4 1 temporal change analysis hydrological response due to land use change was simulated by fixing the climate data from 1978 to 2014 and altering the lus referred from the data of years 1985 2002 and 2014 different flow characteristics at different time scales were analyzed including the average annual runoff average monthly runoff annual 1 day maximum flow r 1dmax and the mean annual 7 day minimum flow r 7dmin the r 1dmax and r 7dmin were used to assess the effect of land use change on extremely high and low flows respectively the relative change rc was adopted to investigate the impact of luss on flow indicators it assesses the sign of the change and quantifies its magnitude relative to a base reference the lus of 1985 was used as the baseline control scenario against all changes it is expressed as 7 rc r y r x r x 100 where r y and r x are the values of the flow characteristics for the lus y 2002 or 2014 and the baseline lus x 1985 3 4 2 uncertainty analysis the uncertainty in the hydrological response to land use change can be introduced from different sources but with the main source of parameter uncertainty zhang et al 2014b several methods for investigating the parameter uncertainty such as glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation mcmc markov chain monte carlo and sufi 2 methods have been developed yang et al 2008 compared the results of five techniques for parameter uncertainty analysis in a swat application the sufi 2 algorithm is found to be most efficient in terms of computational effort to reach a satisfactory simulation sufi 2 is used for the parameter uncertainty analysis in the study the uncertainty in parameterization is quantified for behavioral parameters identified during the model calibration by sufi 2 for the two models hspf and swat the uncertainty of model simulation results is analyzed using 95ppu that is calculated as the difference of 2 5 and 97 5 levels of cumulative distribution of an output variable obtained through lhs here the uncertainty is quantified by a p factor and a r factor the p factor represents the percentage of observed data within the 95ppu band and the r factor is the average width of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the observed data an ideal case would result in a p factor of about 1 and a r factor near 0 however an ideal situation cannot be achieved for real cases due to the multiple sources of uncertainties the r factor and p factor are defined as follows 8 r 1 n t i 1 n y t i 97 5 m y t i 2 5 m 9 r r σ obs 10 p n q in n 100 where y t i 97 5 m and y t i 2 5 m represent the upper and lower levels of the 95ppu n is the number of data records σobs is the standard deviation of the observed data and nqin is the measured value number bracketed by the 95ppu more details can be found in abbaspour et al 2004 as demonstrated by bastola et al 2011 the uncertainty stemming from the model parameters in model prediction is expressed in terms of the average width of prediction interval pi of average relative change the pi is quantified as 11 pi s t s t s t 100 where s t and s t represent the upper and lower 95 confidence limits of the simulated rc for the behavioral parameter sets and s t represents the average value for the behavioral parameter sets respectively in order to reduce the impact of different signs of s t the values of rc for each parameter set between 1978 and 2014 must be standardized with the formula x s t d z x i x m i n x m a x x m i n another uncertainty source considered in this study is the model structure the average change value in the flow characteristics of the behavioral parameters for each model is regarded as a true value for the model parameter subsequently the results from the hspf and the swat models are compared to estimate the uncertainty due to the model structure 4 results 4 1 evaluation of models performance sensitivity analysis is used to estimate the influence of uncertainty factors on the output of a function the morris method is used to identify the sensitive parameters affecting the simulations of output variables touhami et al 2013 based on the morris results fig 3 there were six sensitive parameters namely infilt agwrc irc deepfr basetp and uzsn for hspf while nine sensitive parameters including cn2 ch n2 alpha bf sol k esco sol awc rchrg dp gw revap and surlag for swat table 3 table 3 shows the sensitive parameters and their initial ranges the initial ranges were determined primarily according to hsfp and swat manuals and authors knowledge of the xitiaoxi basin the sufi 2 method was employed for calibration at a daily time step and three iterations with 1000 runs were executed for both models the optimum simulation results were obtained from parameter sets with the maximum nse values the model performance indices for the calibration and validation periods are presented in table 4 moriasi et al 2007 proposed that stream flow simulations are considered satisfactory for swat when nse 0 5 and pbias 25 the models were considered very good for simulating daily flows at the hengtangcun station for the calibration and validation periods with a nse 0 85 and a pbias 10 when the wet and dry seasons were considered separately each model performed well at simulating the observed daily flows with a nse 0 70 and a pbais 15 based on the pbias a majority of the discharge values were underestimated except during the wet season for the swat model in the calibration period and overestimated for both models in the validation period based on the entire performance statistics it is difficult to judge on the outperformance of one model over the other for example hspf had consistently better nse r 2 and ve values not only for the daily flows during the calibration and validation periods but also in the wet season compared to those of swat however except for the daily flow during the dry season the swat model showed lower i e better pbias values than hspf at daily and seasonal time steps during both periods table 4 according to wu et al 2015 when nse 0 7 and r 2 0 7 p factor 0 5 and r factor 1 the model simulation results are acceptable and the parameter uncertainty ranges are considered as appropriate the results from the third iteration for hspf and swat were considered as appropriate based on the above criteria the two measures the p factor and r factor are summarized in table 4 the r factor values for both models were much lower than 1 which indicate that the model simulation results are satisfactory the p factor values of swat were higher than those of the hspf for both calibration and validation periods which imply that swat has a larger contribution of parameter uncertainty to the simulation uncertainty than hspf this could be explained as a larger number of high nse values were attained for the hspf model than for the swat model the median nse values for hspf and swat were 0 89 and 0 85 in the calibration period while 0 92 and 0 86 in the validation period respectively this leads to a smaller band of 95ppu for hspf which comprised fewer observed values it can also be seen from the r factor values of hspf which were much lower than those of swat moreover both models had lower p factors for the dry season which suggest that the models may not completely capture the baseflow component of the hydrological process 4 2 effects of parameter uncertainty on the impact assessment of land use change the average values of relative changes with behavioral parameter sets in the annual and monthly runoffs due to land use change from 1985 to 2014 are shown in fig 4 along with the related uncertainty in model prediction arising from model parameters of hspf and swat in the luss 2002 and 2014 both models simulate increases at the 95 confidence level in the annual and monthly discharges for land use change from cropland and forest to urban areas at the whole basin scale although hspf and swat simulated the same direction of change in the annual and monthly discharges the impacts of uncertainty derived from model parameters on the relative changes cannot be neglected as illustrated in table 5 in the luss 2002 and 2014 at an annual scale the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 157 3 and 173 9 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 151 7 and 152 0 for hspf respectively for the monthly scale hspf and swat showed the same pattern of variation it was found that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of annual and monthly runoffs of hspf were lower than those of swat similar to the whole basin sub basin 4 presented the same change characteristics for the annual and monthly discharges fig 5 it is seen from fig 4 that for high and low flows both models showed large variations in magnitude the two models had inconsistent trends e g negative and positive relative changes co exist of relative changes at the 95 confidence level under the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin for high flows the simulated relative changes in r 1dmax showed an inconsistent trend between 1978 and 2014 at the 95 confidence level however the relative changes for most years exhibited a consistent increase in the luss 2002 and 2014 the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 162 9 and 165 2 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 213 4 and 206 3 for hspf respectively it indicates that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 1dmax of hspf were higher than those of swat unlike the changes for the whole basin both models simulated increases in the r 1dmax in sub basin4 in the lus 2014 fig 5 for r 7dmin both models simulated inconsistent trends of relative changes from 1978 to 2014 at the 95 confidence level under the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin moreover compared to the r 1dmax the inter annual variations of the average relative changes in the r 7dmin were larger for both models in the luss 2002 and 2014 the average widths of pi arising from uncertainties associated with the parameterization were 117 3 and 100 1 of the average values of relative change for swat respectively and were 158 0 and 150 4 for hspf respectively table 5 it indicates that the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 7dmax of hspf were higher than those of swat at the sub basin 4 we found that both models simulated inconsistent trends of relative changes in r 7dmin from 1978 to 2014 at a 95 confidence level even under the lus 2014 however unlike the changes in the whole basin the relative changes for most years exhibited a consistent decrease and the parameter uncertainties in the relative changes of r 7dmax of swat were higher than those of hspf 4 3 effects of models structure on the impact assessment of land use change in order to evaluate the effects of model structural uncertainty on the land use change impacts the values of the average relative change in flow index based on the behavioral parameter sets for swat and hspf were compared as presented in figs 4 5 and table 5 the magnitude of the relative change in annual and monthly discharges varied between the two models the hspf showed more sensitivity to land use change than swat at the whole basin and the subbasin 4 the differences of the magnitude of relative change in annual and monthly discharges were larger when a significant land use change occurred in 2014 figs 6 and 7 present the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the average relative changes in r 1dmax and r 7dmin for the luss 2002 and 2014 for the whole basin and the subbaisn 4 respectively the cdfs are plotted to reflect the uncertainty in land use impacts arising from model structure at the whole basin for the luss 2002 and 2014 the r 1dmax increases for all years using swat while the changes in r 1max are bidirectional e g negative and positive relative changes co exist using hspf the changes in r 7dmin are also bidirectional for hspf and swat for the lus 2014 the larger differences in the likelihood of decreased r 7dmin between swat and hspf were found it indicates that the model choice could affect the direction change e g to negative or positive direction in r 1dmax and r 7dmin in terms of sub basin 4 for the lus 2014 both models simulated increases in r 1dmax and decreases in r 7dmin however there are larger differences in cdfs between hspf and swat than that for the whole basin in table 5 for the lus 2014 the average values of relative changes of hspf and swat were 34 74 and 50 86 for r 7dmin and 109 31 and 20 92 for r 1dmax for sub basin 4 respectively swat produced larger hydrological changes in r 7dmin due to land use change while hspf showed more sensitivity to change in r 1dmax the results suggest that when the land use change rate is beyond a certain level both models simulate the same trend in r 1dmax and r 7dmin for the sub basin 4 however the difference of the simulated relative change between the two models could be significant 5 discussion 5 1 effects of parameter uncertainty on the land use change impact assessment both models indicated increases in annual and monthly discharges due to urbanization with the trends consistent with previous studies e g choi et al 2003 tang et al 2005 hurkmans et al 2009 kim et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 niraula et al 2015 li et al 2018a the uncertainty due to model parameters did not alter the trend of annual and monthly discharge changes due to land use change however a considerable variation in the magnitude of hydrological response for the different luss was observed similar conclusions have been reported by breuer et al 2006 who found a significant output uncertainty in the absolute change of annual and seasonal discharge between luss due to the uncertainty in plant parameterization although not entirely related to model parameter uncertainty niraula et al 2015 found that the relative changes in annual streamflow produced with single outlet calibrated and spatially distributed calibrated models were significantly different and the differences in the calibration approach for model simulation were reflected in the different parameter sets in addition we found that the uncertainty derived from the behavioral model parameters for each model for the luss 2002 and 2014 exceeds 100 of estimated average relative change of annual monthly flow this indicates that the impact of land use change could be potentially hidden by the simulation uncertainty derived from model parameters at the 95 confidence level the parameter uncertainty in extreme runoffs is different compared to that in monthly and annual runoffs the parameter uncertainty not only results in considerable magnitude variations of relative change but also alters the trend of the hydrological response this indicates a considerable insufficiency in the use of hydrological models calibrated against daily streamflow in the evaluation of changes in extreme runoffs due to land use change larger uncertainty bounds and inconsistent trends in relative change of extreme flows may be due to the inability of models to accurately predict flows table 6 and fig 8 show that both models yield systematic underestimation of extreme flows and highly biased predictions for r 7dmin although both models have been calibrated to match the daily average streamflow well the weakness in predicting extreme flows has been reported for swat borah et al 2007 gebremariam et al 2014 lian et al 2007 pfannerstill et al 2014 srinivasan et al 2005 zhang et al 2014b and hspf ackerman et al 2005 lian et al 2007 gebremariam et al 2014 the highly biased prediction of the models in r 7dmin is caused partly by the calibration method the objective function nse adopted in this study tends to emphasize flood features zhang et al 2015 lin et al 2017 found that the nse value was not sensitive to the simulation results of r 7dmin furthermore the possible reason for such a large bias in r 7dmin is the deficiency of the model structure for example both models simulate one active groundwater storage and they adopt linear storage approach to calculate baseflow which cannot fully reproduce nonlinearities of groundwater processes guse et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2014 an improved swat performance during the dry season was reported when a multi storage groundwater module was incorporated into the swat model pfannerstill et al 2014 5 2 effects of models structure on the assessment of land use change impact although many hydrological models have been applied in land use change impacts studies the uncertainty stemming from model structure is always ignored the evident differences in hydrological response predictions to land use change between hspf and swat were observed this indicates that the selection of a hydrological model plays a significant role in land use change impact analysis this is similar to the studies by morán tejeda et al 2015 and sharifi et al 2017 in this study hspf produced larger changes in monthly or annual runoffs compared to swat the differences in hydrological responses may be due to the different equations for hydrological processes i e direct runoff et in swat and hspf for swat a modified soil conservation service curve number scs cn method is used to calculate the direct runoff generation once the land use altered the cn changes accordingly which leads to a variation for runoff in hspf an infiltration excess model is employed which divides precipitation inputs into infiltrating and non infiltrating fractions according to three conceptual parameters a surface storage capacity value uzsn an interflow inflow index intfw and an infiltration capacity index infilt once the land use altered the uzsn infilt and intfw change accordingly which result in differences for runoff the actual et which is a key factor influencing the water yield also varies with land use change the two models estimate the actual et by different methods swat estimates the actual et as sum of the actual et from soil and plant water evaporation these et components are represented mainly by two parameters the maximum canopy storage canmx and the soil evaporation compensation coefficient esco guse et al 2014 however these two parameters do not change with different luss du et al 2013 summarized that no study has adopted varied parameter values except the cn for the new lus when applying the swat model to simulate the hydrological response to land use change the parameters associated with the et process are assumed to be identical hspf simulates the actual et based on the potential et demand and amount of water available in the soil and on the land surface for et since there is no plant growth component in hspf the effect of vegetation type density root growth and stage of development along with the moisture characteristics of the soil layer are lumped into the lower zone et parameter lzetp which controls actual et from the lower zone storage singh et al 2005 moreover the lzetp values varied with the land use types in this paper and were the case in other studies e g im et al 2003 xu et al 2007 ribarova et al 2008 ames et al 2014 baloch et al 2015 taking the best parameter set based on the maximum nse value under the lus 2014 as an example the actual et estimated by hspf decreased by 5 15 and by 1 12 for swat hspf showed a larger relative change than swat for the actual et in terms of the changes for r 1dmax and r 7dmin we found that the model choice could impact the direction change however when land use changes are significant to a certain degree e g the lus 2014 in sub basin 4 both models simulated increased r 1dmax and decreased r 7dmin but with different significances for r 1dmax hspf simulated more significant change than swat while swat simulated more significant change than hspf for r 7dmin there appear to be two possible reasons for the magnitude of r 1dmax is smaller in swat than that in hspf one is the use of cn2 in swat versus infiltration in hspf and the other is hourly time step of precipitation data in hspf versus daily time step of precipitation data in swat the cn2 methods and daily time step cannot allow swat to consider the rainfall intensity and duration well but only total rainfall volume butcher et al 2014 comparison of watershed response to land use change using hspf and swat suggests that one should be caution when attempts to estimate the relative change using models with different underlying concept and formulations it is difficult to identify which model provides a more accurate estimate of hydrological change although swat is said to be a physically based model while hspf is a conceptual model when look at the main processes involved in water yield it is revealed that most of hydrological processes of swat are computed through empirical equations swat is less than ideal for assessing runoff response to land use change for a variety of reasons including simplified simulation of direct runoff using cn2 and simplified simulation of groundwater in addition a fixed parameterization strategy is adopted in this study and most cases when applying swat to simulate the hydrological response to land use change du et al 2013 wang et al 2017 yin et al 2017 it cannot simulate the influence of land use changes on et and channel flow and so on on the other hand hspf uses an infiltration excess mechanism to simulate overland flow which may be not suitable for a certain environment for example in the study area the runoff tends to be generated by a mixture of infiltration excess flow and saturation excess process depending on the season and places in the catchment additionally the semi distributed conceptual nature of hspf limits its use for predicting spatial distribution of soil moisture content as well as other physically measurable parameters at specific location within the watershed johnson et al 2003 hspf aggregates soil moisture content which is generally related to a specific pervious land unit across the entire watershed whereas the predictions of moisture content distribution are geographically specific by swat therefore it is hard to evaluate which model provides more accurate estimation of land use change impacts further analysis of model simulation against more observations e g soil moisture content is needed to determine an optimum model it should be evaluated in land use change impacts analysis and the estimation of structural uncertainty could be explored by combining their predictions in a systematic manner 5 3 effects of other uncertainty sources on the assessment of land use change impact apart from model parameters and structure the input data for example land use data precipitation also cause uncertainties in land use change impact assessments in this study different sources of land use data with almost equally the same resolution were used to investigate the land use change impacts numerous publications acknowledged the uncertainty contribution in hydrological models due to land use data endreny et al 2003 alfieri et al 2007 miller et al 2010 sharifi and kalin 2010 pai and saraswat 2013 yen et al 2015 bahareh et al 2017 some of these have analyzed the effect of land use categorical errors in hydrological model output finke et al 1999 miller et al 2010 pai and saraswat 2013 some of these evaluated the model prediction error due to different sources of land use data endreny et al 2003 sharifi and kalin 2010 yen et al 2015 endreny et al 2003 found that peak flows were sensitive to the source of land use data which could cause a range of uncertainty from 35 underestimation to 20 overestimation for hspf however the spatial resolutions of three alternative land cover maps adopted in endreny et al 2003 were different sharifi and kalin 2010 reported that the results of using different land use data sets coming from different sources based on no calibrated swat model have a close r 2 in flow but biased in the volume of flow they emphasize that land use maps do generate uncertainty in model predictions which could be reduced by calibration yen et al 2015 found that flow prediction was fairly unaffected by the source of land use data and model parameters may be transferable by using different sources of land use data on the same watershed in swat similar to the result of yen et al 2015 bahareh et al 2017 found that runoff seems to be less sensitive to different land use sources in swat but land use data have impacts on different components of water balance such as soil water and et therefore based on the previous and our studies we conclude that the discharge prediction seems to be less sensitive to different land use sources but the components of water balance may be sensitive to land use sources on the other hand it is widely acknowledged that the uncertainty in precipitation data has a critical effect on the accuracy of hydrological model predictions li and xu 2014 cristiano et al 2018 swat adopted daily inputs while hspf requires hourly weather inputs and hourly hspf results were aggregated to a daily time step prior to the comparison the difference of input meteorological data at multiple time steps represents the discrepancy of model structures therefore the uncertainty of model structure contains the uncertainty related with different temporal resolution of weather inputs in hspf and swat furthermore for usage of hspf daily precipitation data were disaggregated into hourly data on the reference station that has hourly precipitation data using the data disaggregation tool in wdmutil of hspf the errors in hourly weather data due to disaggregation in hspf could cause uncertainty the impact of rainfall errors on predicted flow has been highlighted by many studies e g xu et al 2006 moulin et al 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 engeland et al 2016 and zeng et al 2018 cocca and doherty 2003 found that a 5 random error in precipitation generated a large range in predictions and thus significant predictive uncertainty in hspf strauch et al 2012 indicate that parameter uncertainty varied significantly depending upon the method used for precipitation data set generation in swat it was not our intention in this work to evaluate the influence of precipitation errors but this will be carried out in future research to better understand the uncertainties in land use change impacts related to models 6 conclusions this study investigated the uncertainties in hydrological modeling associated with parameters and structure in assessing the hydrologic response to land use change the study was conducted over different time scales using the hspf and swat models at the whole basin and the sub basin scales in the xitiaoxi basin of eastern china hspf and swat performed well to simulate daily and seasonal streamflows however both models showed inadequacies for the extreme flows it is difficult to arbitrarily judge a model that provides a consistently better result than the other simply based on performance metrics the parameter uncertainty in simulated streamflow changes that are induced by land use change varies over time scales the simulated r 1dmax and r 7dmin changes often show different directions this result suggests a considerable limitation on the usage of hydrological models for the variations of extreme runoffs due to land use change even if with a high nse at daily time step the impacts of land use change could be potentially hidden by the simulation uncertainty results from model parameters apart from the model parameters the model structure represents an additional source of uncertainty in hydrological response to land use change the model selection could impact the change direction of extreme runoff when minor or moderate changes of hydrological responses were observed this study demonstrates that the uncertainty in hydrological modeling that stems from model parameters and structure has a significant influence and should be considered in land use change impact assessment especially for decision maker for future land use impact analysis a multi model ensemble approach bastola et al 2011 could be adopted to improve the reliability of model predictions and the decision making process by better assessing the hydrological modeling uncertainty declaration of interest none acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of

6528,the choice of data periods for calibrating and evaluating conceptual hydrological models often seems ad hoc with no objective guidance on choosing calibration periods that produce the most reliable predictions we therefore propose to systematically investigate the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance we demonstrate our analysis on the deggendorf kollbach catchment in bavaria germany for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records after classifying these data into three hydrological conditions wet dry and mixed and combining them into periods of varied data length 2 4 8 15 20 and 25 years we repeatedly calibrate a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a monte carlo setting then we analyze predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods of distinct hydrological condition and time series length we call this the comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst our results suggest that hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact than time series length and that calibrating on dry conditions might be a robust choice when aiming at predicting arbitrary future conditions wet dry or mixed furthermore we found that posterior parameter estimates converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios indicating that compensation of model structural errors by parameter fitting is independent of the chosen calibration condition however calibrating on time series 8 years or longer led to overconfident predictions that failed to reliably envelope future data while these findings are specific to our case study we recommend using the cdsst to stress test conceptual hydrological models to identify robust model parameters and or deficiencies in the model structure in general we expect our proposed approach to be a valuable basis for model error diagnosis in any type of dynamic environmental system model because it answers the following three questions 1 what is the importance of physical processes not explicitly covered by the model 2 how much overconfidence is present in the model and 3 what are case specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups keywords model uncertainty quantification conceptual rainfall runoff model brute force monte carlo numerical modeling hbv model bayesian updating time series analysis model stress test model calibration model validation model structural error hydrological condition analysis 1 introduction hydrologists have been investigating calibration bárdossy and singh 2008 monsalve 2009 kavetski and fenicia 2011 sorooshian et al 1983 and uncertainty assessment strategies li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 yen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for lumped conceptual rainfall runoff crr models in order to optimally inform modeling decisions specifically the effects of data length on crr model calibration and validation have been studied by numerous hydrologists whose findings and suggestions do not converge to a common data length to be used for calibration purposes for instance yapo et al 1996 found that approximately eight years of data are required to obtain calibrations relatively insensitive to the period selected and that reduction of the parameter uncertainty is greatest when wettest data periods on record are used li et al 2010 also found that eight years of data are sufficient to obtain steady estimates of model performance and parameters for a crr model and that longer calibration data series do not necessarily result in better model performance anctil et al 2004 showed that artificial neural network models continue to improve with datasets longer than nine years in contrast to a four parameter crr model based on validation against the same 7 year test set perrin et al 2007 found that having a dataset of 350 days that include both dry and wet conditions is sufficient to obtain robust estimates of crr model parameters boughton 2007 concluded that a dataset longer than six years would not further improve crr model performance and that modeling results were more dependent on the specific data set used for calibration than the specific model used razavi and tolson 2013 stated that model calibration to short data periods leads to a range of performances from poor to very good depending on the representativeness of the short data period which is typically unknown a priori a consistent finding is that crr models represent humid and semi humid catchments better than arid catchments regardless of the calibration data length li et al 2010 altogether these studies lead to mixed findings making it difficult to propose general guidelines for choosing an adequate data length given the data exists for crr model calibration calibration data choices may be made with respect to data length and data type e g specifically considering wet or dry records for any such choice it is important to recognize its implications for model error compensation we briefly discuss the aspects of data length data type and error compensation in the following sections and define the corresponding major research questions addressed by our proposed framework with regard to data set length literature suggests that a certain number of years might be best for calibration e g sorooshian et al 1983 anctil et al 2004 xia et al 2004 perrin et al 2007 less attention has been paid to the choice of data type i e the choice of wet dry or average conditions for calibration some studies found that the most informative hydrological data might correspond to years with greater than average precipitation e g yapo et al 1996 gan et al 1997 numerous hydrologists e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 vaze et al 2010 seibert et al 2003 fowler et al 2016 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 have evaluated the performance of various crr models and their response to parameter transferability under changing hydrological conditions most of these studies used a flavor of the differential split sample test dsst originally proposed by klemeš 1986 the dsst is a standard method to examine parameter dependency on climate variability and associated outcomes on hydrological model efficiency with this technique calibration and validation periods are selected based on a climatic classification then calibrations on wet and dry periods are validated considering either the same or opposite hydrological conditions during validation one common finding is that parameter estimates obtained in wet calibration periods perform poorly in dry validation periods on the contrary wu and johnston 2007 tested the soil and water assessment tool swat model using datasets with diverse climate behavior they showed that parameter ensembles calibrated on drought periods performed better in validation than parameters sets calibrated on average wet periods apparently the parameters that govern evapotranspiration processes are more identifiable in dry periods where evapotranspiration is a more prevailing process seiller et al 2012 tested the performance of 20 lumped crr models under four different climate conditions using five non continuous hydrological years their results showed that the transferability of crr model parameters between contrasted climatic conditions is generally low nevertheless the tested models showed better predictive reliability the data falls into the predicted intervals with appropriate probability for the respective opposite validation conditions when calibrating on dry periods than when calibrating on wet periods ruelland et al 2015 found that wet calibration evaluated in dry validation periods did not generate larger errors than when using a dry calibration period collectively there is a lack of consensus and clear guidance regarding optimal calibration and model evaluation strategies for specific modeling purposes with the exception of a few studies vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 and troin et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on model calibration with less emphasis on validation this leads us to a number of intriguing research questions for example since conceptual hydrological models apparently perform best in predicting wet conditions does that mean we should calibrate and validate on wet conditions how much data under what hydrological conditions is necessary to calibrate a crr model so that it can make reliable predictions regardless of future hydrological conditions note that if the goal is to calibrate a model for predicting a specific scenario e g floods we follow the general intuition that it should be calibrated on similar past scenarios if available however the focus of our study is to calibrate a model that provides robust predictions under arbitrary hydrological conditions such all purpose calibrated models can be useful e g when quantifying the water balance of a catchment or for a general improvement of system understanding our own motivation among others is to investigate how fit a given model is because this fosters insights about its specific shortcomings and model errors for such all purpose investigations we find that there is no clear recommendation on how to perform calibration and validation under these premises we will investigate these questions systematically by looking at the simultaneous impact of varying data set length and varying hydrological condition on model performance in calibration and validation but as an important aspect of this analysis we have to address the role of model errors because any calibration data choice has implications for the treatment of model errors model errors model structural deficits are known to exist since crr models rely on simple process representations often such model structural deficiencies that are revealed only during certain hydrological conditions wagener et al 2003 in calibration these deficiencies are partially compensated by parameter fitting so that parameter values are expected to vary with hydrological conditions and calibration strategies additionally abebe et al 2010 found that parameter estimates change in time not just due to model structural errors but also because of unsteady catchment scale processes e g under climatic variability hence we aim to answer the following additional questions how stable are parameter estimates under different classes of hydrological conditions and from the perspective of error compensation does it hurt or help to increase the data set length used in calibration methodologically we propose an upgrade to the dsst which we call the comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst it serves to analyze the impact of both data length choices and hydrological condition choices on the predictive reliability and robustness of a model with robust we mean that best estimates and predicted uncertainty intervals perform in validation as expected from their performance in calibration even under climatic variability between calibration and validation in the cdsst we perform crr model calibration through bayesian updating to account for uncertainty in model parameters and output in this probabilistic setting we propose to analyze posterior parameter distributions and predictive performance accuracy and precision as a function of dataset length and hydrological condition in calibration and validation as a way to stress test crr models accuracy means small residuals between the data and the model with best fit parameter values while precision means a low predictive variance our procedure can be understood as a bayesian version of cross validation but instead of a common leave one out or leave one block out analysis referred to as jackknife method efron and gong 1983 we systematically select data sets of different length and different hydrological condition with this we obtain more controlled differential and interpretable answers than the answers that standard statistical methods would offer we demonstrate our cdsst on the deggendorf kollbach dk catchment in bavaria germany which is a well monitored catchment with 55 years of continuous hydrological and meteorological data we use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 to produce discharge predictions as a function of precipitation evapotranspiration air temperature land cover and soil properties we chose to use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 because it is one of the most frequently used crr models with successful applications in different environments ranging from northern european to south american catchments bárdossy and singh 2008 abebe et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 specifically seiller et al 2012 showed that hbv is a good model choice for a close by catchment in southern bavaria germany furthermore results from dakhlaoui et al 2017 have shown through a multi model comparison that hbv produces similar results to other crr models e g gr4j and ihacres the available discharge data are classified into three hydrological conditions and combined into periods of varied data length then we repeatedly calibrate the model to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a brute force monte carlo framework we evaluate the resulting predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods again classified according to hydrological condition and data length our systematic analysis allows us to determine the sensitivity of model reliability to data choices in calibration under varying modeling purposes reflected by the choice of data length and validation period while some of our findings may depend on our specific choice of study domain and model we are convinced that the idea of systematically stress testing via our suggested cdsst is useful for arbitrary catchments and hydrological models and in fact for dynamic environmental system models in general in order to produce clear recommendations with broader applicability i e different crr models and or different catchments further research would be required in short the main contributions of our study are 1 proposing a systematic investigation of competing calibration strategies for a crr model classified according to hydrological condition and data length 2 a sensitivity analysis of model performance both predictive accuracy and precision based on varied calibration strategies and validation scenarios and 3 a sensitivity analysis of posterior parameter statistics based on alternative calibration strategies these investigations allow us to draw conclusions about optimal calibration strategies for robust prediction of arbitrary future conditions finally we provide 4 a discussion of how such a stress test builds a solid basis for diagnosing model structural errors in dynamic environmental system models the article is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the deggendorf kollbach catchment section 3 presents the crr model the criteria used to select the calibration and validation data and the suggested cdsst section 4 discusses the impacts of data choice on parameter and predictive uncertainty and section 5 draws conclusions about the benefit of the proposed cdsst in environmental modeling 2 study area as part of the european union s water framework directive wfd watersheds in bavaria state are currently being monitored through 600 stations by the environmental agency of bavaria bayerisches landesamt für umwelt blu 2016 from the many monitored catchments in bavaria we selected the deggendorf kollbach catchment for this study because of its 55 years of continuous hydrological and meteorological data bayerisches landesamt für umwelt blu 2016 the catchment is located in the municipality of deggendorf in east bavaria germany fig 1 its area of 36 6 km2 is dominated by mixed forest natural vegetation mosaic and evergreen needle leaf forest the elevation ranges from 324 to 915 m above sea level masl cgiar csi 2016 the long term relative humidity is 82 with minimum monthly values of 13 and maximum monthly values of 99 the long term mean annual evapotranspiration amounts to 734 mm and the annual precipitation to 1147 mm the long term mean monthly temperatures vary from 2 3 c to 17 6 c during winter and summer months respectively topsoil permeability is described as being low to extremely low bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe 2016 with values equal to or less than 10 5 m s the catchment produces high daily mean discharges in march due to spring snowmelt 1 2 m3 s and low discharges in august 0 4 m3 s the long term average discharge is 0 7 m3 s 3 methodology 3 1 model setup for the reasons provided in the introduction we use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 as the crr model for our study it can be classified as a semi distributed crr model which uses sub basins as primary hydrological units here we implemented a lumped version of the model assuming the following 1 the land cover has been primarily dominated during the entire period of observation by mixed forest 62 natural vegetation 25 and evergreen forest 11 lp daac 2016 2 the near surface geology of the catchment is composed of high and low permeability material ranging from weathered coarse loamy sand to loamy soils with high clay content bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe 2016 3 the catchment does not present abrupt changes in topography or geomorphology 4 there are no anthropogenic controls on the river discharges i e dams and 5 errors in precipitation records from the rain gauges are negligible see below hence we are not concerned with estimating the impact of input errors on hbv model outputs here see studies such as kavetski et al 2006 götzinger and bárdossy 2007 or renard et al 2010a b for approaches to treat input errors the hbv model consists of three main subroutines for 1 snow accumulation and melt 2 soil moisture accounting and 3 response and river routing bergström 1992 the model has twelve parameters that are subject to calibration table 1 with plausible ranges for each parameter value chosen according to literature values bergström 1992 bárdossy and singh 2008 abebe et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 the precipitation mean daily values data are spatially weighted between one gauging station within the catchment and three neighbouring stations i e id930 id1730 id1731 and id3271 in fig 1 we based our assumption of acceptably low precipitation errors on the strategically good position of the gauging stations especially of id1730 potential evapotranspiration monthly mean standard values and air temperature daily mean values data were obtained from a single climatic station nearest the catchment the model is run on daily time steps and is calibrated and validated on different data sets which are described in the next section 3 2 selection of data sets for calibration and validation the key idea of our cdsst is to split the sample of available time series data into many distinctively different periods for calibration and validation with many different lengths and then perform a manifold cross validation we use two climatic indices i e aridity and runoff ratio and three hydrological runoff signatures i e annual runoff seasonal runoff and daily hydrograph similarity blöschl 2013 to define a hydrological year as humid average or deficit a hydrological year i e 01 apr to 31 mar differs from a regular calendar year i e 01 jan to 31 dec in that it is set to coincide with the largest runoff values this is typically when snowmelt takes place which occurs right before discharge values start to decrease the categories for each index help to identify distinct hydrological periods within the whole dataset we define a wet period to consist of only humid years a dry period comprises only deficit years and a mixed period combines humid average and deficit years the aridity index i1 eq 1 reflects the competition between energy and water within the catchment a catchment with a high aridity index value denotes a water limited environment high evapotranspiration dynamics while a low score of the aridity index represents an energy limited catchment in which the climatic conditions are mainly dominated by precipitation the runoff ratio i2 eq 2 reflects how the annual water balance is affected by the storage capacity of the soil the evapotranspiration rates within the catchment and the frequency and duration of high intensity precipitation events in eqs 1 and 2 map denotes mean annual precipitation pet denotes annual potential evapotranspiration and mar denotes mean annual runoff where discharge rates are normalized by the catchment area 1 i 1 p e t m a p 2 i 2 m a r m a p hydrological years were classified by the formulation in table 2 where conditions 1 and 2 should be met for each year μ i represents the average index value of ii and σi the standard deviation over the year per period in case one of the indices suggests average conditions and the other one suggests unusual conditions i e i1 humid and i2 average the year is classified as humid or deficit based on the non average index the hydrological signatures annual runoff seasonal runoff and daily hydrograph are used as complementary tools to confirm the period definition table 3 lists the indices values for an exemplary selection of three distinct years with diverse hydrological conditions two years of model spin up 1961 1962 were allowed to reach dynamic cyclical equilibrium the remaining 53 years of data were split into calibration 1963 1994 and validation 1995 2015 periods both calibration and validation data sets were divided into various lengths 2 4 8 15 and 25 20 years respectively and then categorized into one of three hydrological conditions wet dry or mixed table 4 lists our resulting data scenarios since several wet dry or mixed periods of shorter length i e 2 or 4 years exist we are able to perform model calibration and validation on three data sets each for the longer periods i e 8 and 15 years in calibration 8 years in validation only one period each was available according to our classification finally the longest data set s 25 years in calibration 15 and 20 years in validation consist of mixed conditions only since no wet or dry period could be constructed of that length this fact could only be avoided by using a non differential analysis e g the gsst method used by coron et al 2012 but such kind of approaches would not allow to carry on the type of analysis that we intend in total 25 different datasets were used for calibration and 23 datasets were used for validation table 4 periods of one of the three classifications wet dry mixed were generated by a composite of several humid deficit or average years respectively the chosen years are not necessarily consecutive but a period could contain discontinuous years as shown in fig 2 the selection of possibly discontinuous periods only applies to data selection for calibration and validation respectively the model itself was always run for the full continuous 55 years including spin up the discontinuity in calibration and validation periods could possibly influence wet years by preceding dry years and vice versa but we minimize this adverse effect by cutting hydrological years at snowmelt in march 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis via bayesian updating in the following all twelve hbv parameters are denoted as a parameter vector θ to reflect our prior state of knowledge in the bayesian context we define all parameters to be uniformly distributed random variables with bounds from abebe et al 2010 shown in table 1 a priori all parameters are assumed to be independent the prior state of knowledge p θ can be updated by multiplying it with the likelihood p y o θ and normalizing by the probability of the data p y o to a posterior state of knowledge p θ y o via bayes theorem 3 p θ y o p y o θ p θ p y o in eq 3 p denotes a probability distribution function pdf p denotes a conditional pdf and y o represents observed data here records of discharge the likelihood function p y o θ evaluates how well the predicted data y f θ match the observed data y o the denominator in eq 3 called bayesian model evidence e g schöniger et al 2014 acts as a normalizing constant for the posterior pdf p θ y o and can be neglected by simply evaluating the proportionality p θ y o p y o θ p θ in order to account for heteroscedasticity of the residuals y y o we apply a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 kuczera 1983 to both the observed and predicted discharges with a fixed lambda value of 0 45 this lambda value was obtained in a preprocessing analysis and was found to be a robust choice for variance stabilization of the residuals the box cox transformation ensures that the fit to high and low flows are prioritized equally after transformation we assume that residuals are independent and gaussian distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 4 0 in transformed space this value proved to be a suitable representation of lumped model structural and measurement uncertainty we are aware of studies that address temporal persistence of model errors e g schoups and vrugt 2010 morawietz et al 2011 evin et al 2014 but pursue here the simpler practice of ignoring the possibly complicated time correlation of transformed residuals del giudice et al 2018 has shown that ignoring time correlation of transformed residuals can be problematic when calibrating to periods of less than a month and because our minimum period 2 year dataset has several orders of magnitude higher than the one used by del giudice et al 2018 therefore there should not be any time correlated problem with residuals further evidence for the reasonable absence of residual correlation is provided in the appendix to comprehensively sample from the posterior pdf we chose to implement a brute force monte carlo bfmc approach hammersley 1960 with likelihood reweighting because the computational expense of an individual model run was relatively low bfmc has the advantage that it provides a single prior ensemble that can be used for likelihood weighting in all calibration periods mcmc methods would require a new mcmc run for each calibration exercise we draw random realizations from uniform prior pdfs with interval bounds listed in table 1 after running the hbv model 2 5 million times we keep those realizations in the prior ensemble that produced physically realistic predictions i e that produced discharge values greater than zero our final ensemble contains 840 000 realizations this step can be viewed as conditioning the model to observed physical realism then likelihoods p y o θ were determined for each remaining realization and for each calibration data scenario as defined in section 3 2 the posterior mean and other statistics of the posterior distribution such as the 90 credible interval are determined by reweighting the prior ensemble of realizations with their respective likelihood weighted bootstrap smith and gelfand 1992 depending on the chosen calibration data scenario note that we obtain posterior statistics for the whole time series of 53 years not just for the respective calibration data period this allows us to assess the performance of the calibrated model in various validation periods as defined in section 3 2 by evaluating effective sample sizes liu 2008 we confirmed that for all calibration data scenarios the number of prior realizations that significantly contribute to the posterior distribution is large enough to produce reliable posterior statistics 3 4 model evaluation we choose three statistical measures for model evaluation in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse dawson et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 reflects the accuracy of the maximum likelihood prediction mle y eq 4 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i o y i 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 where y i o represents observed discharge values at time step i 1 n and y o denotes the mean observed discharge over the whole time series note that the maximum likelihood predictions y i i e the predictions per time step made based on the parameter realization that achieves the highest likelihood in the ensemble for a given calibration data set is in our case equivalent to the maximum a posteriori estimate often referred to as map not to be confused with our usage of map as mean annual precipitation in section 3 2 because we use uniform parameter priors it is also equivalent to the best fit parameter set in the context of least squares calibration because we assume a gaussian likelihood after transformation of discharge values an efficiency of nse 0 indicates that the mle is a more accurate predictor than the mean of the observed data here we apply the nse to transformed predictions and observations for the same reasons as explained in section 3 3 we aim to weight both high and low flows equally instead of overemphasizing peak flows when using untransformed values the mean coefficient of variation mcv reflects the spread or the lack of precision in the posterior ensemble eq 5 5 mcv 1 n i 1 n σ y i y i where σ y i denotes the standard deviation of the posterior predictions at time step i respectively the standard deviation is normalized by the mle y which makes the high and low flows more comparable making the box cox transformation unnecessary when calculating mcv finally we evaluate how well observed discharge data are captured by the posterior ensemble of simulated discharges by determining the predictive coverage pc e g hoeting et al 1999 as the fraction of observed validation data points that fall within the 90 credible interval with 90 then being the ideal value to illustrate the statistical properties of the posterior ensemble that we use for model evaluation fig 3 a c shows the hydrograph of a 2 year dry validation v2y d1 a 2 year mixed validation v2y m2 and a 2 year wet v2y w1 validation period respectively fig 3c reveals that high stream flows were more recurrent between oct 98 and apr 99 than one and two years before fig 3a and b high flows that took place in mixed and wet hydrological periods were difficult to forecast regardless of the hydrological condition used for calibration e g from dec 1999 to apr 2000 in fig 3c predictive uncertainty is visualized as the shaded 90 credible interval lines in red yellow and blue represent the mle y for dry mixed and wet conditions respectively observed discharges y o are shown in black the results of our performance criteria for these distinct examples are shown in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of data choices on model accuracy in calibration we obtained parameter ensembles through repeated likelihood weighting of the bfmc method section 3 3 on 25 calibration datasets table 4 the different calibration data sets were differentiated based on time series length and hydrological condition see section 3 2 then we determined the nse values of the mle prediction for each calibration data scenario i e not yet in the validation periods results are shown in fig 4 sorted by increasing data length and color coded according to the type of condition used in calibration dry wet or mixed the highest nse values in calibration for a given data length are mostly achieved when calibrating on mixed periods compared to mixed conditions it seems harder to find parameter sets that perform equally well for longer calibration periods of wet or dry conditions for strongly mixed periods that consist of wet and dry sections e g c4ym3 cf fig 2 calibration quality as measured by the nse is generally not worse than for either dry or wet periods of the same data length there is quite some variability within each type of scenario wet dry or mixed with a fixed data length we attribute this to the fact that some individual events due to abrupt changes in climatic conditions covered in distinct periods are significantly harder to model than others analyzing the performance of the best fit parameter set under varied calibration conditions reveals the general capability of the model structure to adapt to these different conditions for other modeling setups and catchments this analysis might reveal whether the model is primarily suited to reproduce either high or low flows depending on the final purpose of the model further model development could then be guided by these findings 4 2 effects of data choices on model accuracy in validation next we used the sets of parameter ensembles obtained in calibration section 4 1 to assess the model s predictive accuracy with respect to the validation data sets table 4 measured as nse fig 5 shows the nse values in validation as a function of data length and hydrological condition in calibration and the respective condition in validation wet dry or mixed as highlighted by coron et al 2012 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 comparing nse values normalized by different variances from different hydrological conditions may be affected by the differences in normalization for that reason we mainly compare nse values of the same type of validation period in the following i e lines with the same color predictive performance in validation measured in nse units tends to increase with increasing calibration data length ranging from a 0 01 increase for dry conditions to a 0 08 increase for wet conditions this behavior can be expected from classical statements on cross validation where longer data sets in calibration reduce the effect of data noise and over fitting more importantly the hydrological condition used for calibration seems to have a strong impact on predictive performance in validation when calibrating on wet or mixed periods the performance in predicting future dry periods is lower by 0 05 to 0 15 nse units compared to predicting wet or mixed conditions see lower position of red lines in the right two blocks of fig 5 note that calibrating on wet and predicting wet conditions as well as calibrating on mixed and predicting mixed conditions is not significantly more successful than calibrating on one and predicting the other indeed the model setup independent from its calibration strategy seems to be most adequate most generalizable for wet conditions since their nse values are always highest in validation but not calibration cf section 4 1 and fig 4 overall calibrating on dry conditions is a robust choice when aiming to predict arbitrary future validation conditions see lower scatter of lines in the left block of fig 5 this finding of course requires an explanation coron et al 2012 discussed that the parameters controlling internal flows have a greater influence on discharge calibration than the parameters that govern et at least in wet and mixed calibration periods where simulated discharge is dominated by precipitation therefore it is difficult to constrain et parameters under wet and mixed hydrological conditions additionally it has been demonstrated that uncertainty related to evapotranspiration because of its complexity and difficulty in estimation degrades hydrological model performance wu and xu 2006 together this explains why a model calibrated to wet and mixed hydrological conditions performs poor in validation with dry hydrological conditions on the other hand when the model is calibrated to dry hydrological conditions the participation between precipitation and et parameters is more balanced thus calibrating a crr model to dry conditions can lead to more robust forecasts i e good performance in wet mixed and dry hydrological conditions regardless of our specific catchment and hbv model the findings from inspecting different validation periods will show for which calibration conditions and for which predicted conditions the model generalizes best as seen from our case the capability to adapt best to certain conditions in calibration is not necessarily decisive for most reliable predictions in validation thus contrasting the model behavior in calibration and validation has the potential to reveal the model s tradeoff between flexibility ability to adapt and stability ability to generalize friedman et al 2001 höge et al 2018 under specified conditions when looking at the calibration and validation scenarios in detail fig 6 it is clear that the most variability in validation performance occurs when testing predictions for mixed conditions fig 6c depending on the specific events contained in the mixed period the model might score a lucky punch i e v2ym1 uppermost dotted line or predict rather poorly i e v4ym3 bottommost dashed line the greatest variability in this respect is seen when calibrating on dry conditions both the best and the worst performance for mixed validation periods result from such a calibration strategy again calibrating on wet or mixed conditions does not make a lot of difference the variability in predicting wet conditions fig 6b is rather low independent of the chosen calibration conditions similar to our observations during calibration section 4 1 some distinct calibration periods seem to pose a challenge to the model e g period c2yd3 which leads to a poor performance in most validation scenarios we theorize that the cause of such poor model performance is due to limitations of the model to represent catchment behavior when input data contains strong seasonal fluctuations i e potential evapotranspiration or precipitation values however further analysis would be required to find the definitive reason for the degradation of model validation performance under these specific circumstances 4 3 effects of data choices on parameter uncertainty now we analyze the posterior parameter distribution resulting from our 25 calibration exercises table 4 and sub section 4 1 for the two major incident factors of uncertainty impact of data length and prevalent hydrological condition to do so we determine the ratio between posterior and prior variance i e the fraction of variance that remains after bayesian updating fig 7 shows the fraction of prior variance as a function of data length for all twelve model parameters averaged over all hydrological conditions results indicate that even with the shortest calibration data length of two years all parameters show a significant reduction in parameter uncertainty this is partly because wide prior parameter bounds were chosen to include a large range of possible parameter combinations by analyzing the fraction of prior variance as a function of data length fig 7 we can classify the parameters according to their sensitivity in calibration k2 k3 and β turn out to be highly sensitive while cmelt tt k1 kd fc and pwp are less semi sensitive all sensitive parameters exhibit a monotonously decreasing posterior variance with increasing calibration data set size conversely the insensitive parameters i e cetp maxbas uzl exhibit the least initial reduction in parameter uncertainty when calibrated with two years of data and can even show a slight increase in variance when calibrated with long datasets i e 15 or 25 years while an increase of parameter variance with more calibration data may sound surprising theory only supports that information entropy must decrease with more data which does not translate to variance for non linear bayesian updates as the one featured here a more detailed analysis of the behavior of highly sensitive semi sensitive and insensitive parameters under various calibration scenarios can be done based on statistics of their posterior distribution we therefore show box plots in fig 8 with boxes representing 50 credible intervals and whiskers representing the 5th and 95th percentiles fig 8a shows the most sensitive parameter in our case study the recession coefficient k3 fig 8b shows a semi sensitive parameter the percolation to groundwater kd and 8c shows an insensitive parameter the upper reservoir threshold uzl results indicate that with increasing calibration data set length the plausible value range of sensitive parameters becomes increasingly constrained and converges to a similar range under all calibration conditions i e wet dry mixed the upper reservoir threshold uzl shows the largest of an overall very low sensitivity and hence variance reduction when exposed to wet calibration data this explains the apparent increase in variance between data set sizes of 15 years averaged over lower variance under wet conditions and similar higher variance under dry or mixed conditions and of 25 years a single mixed period the parameter seems insensitive to some parameter compensation effects are visible for the recession coefficient k3 the credible interval achieved after calibration on 15 years of dry conditions suggests slightly lower values than the credible interval obtained after calibration on 15 years of wet conditions credible intervals do however overlap significantly indicating that this model is not over fitted to a specific hydrological condition and that structural errors are not pronounced enough to be heavily compensated through a combination of different parameter ranges identifying such behavior confirms the robustness of the model under varying hydrological conditions conversely a model where different hydrological conditions would lead to different optimal parameter ranges would indicate the presence of model structural errors that significantly affect the simulated discharge data during wet or dry periods and the need for revising the conceptual model 4 4 effects of data choices on predictive uncertainty and reliability model parameter uncertainty is propagated through the hydrological model to predictive uncertainty therefore the decrease in parameter uncertainty with increasing data set length section 4 3 also leads to a decrease in the variability of predictions our analysis of predictive uncertainty via mcv only quantifies the predictive uncertainty from uncertain parameter estimates after calibration this analysis could be extended to include model errors e g an additive noise model inferred from residuals however we prefer a parameter focused analysis because it still reveals model error e g if validation data falls outside predictive intervals the parameter related uncertainty of hbv predictions after calibration measured as mcv section 3 4 are shown in fig 9 since the parameter uncertainty estimates based on different calibration conditions wet dry mixed are not significantly different as observed from fig 8 we present here average mcv values over the three types of hydrological conditions of a certain calibration data length no matter which hydrological conditions are being predicted their associated prediction variance reduces by a similar fraction with increasing calibration data length the variability when predicting dry conditions is always largest which might be an effect of the normalization by the small mle prediction values in the definition of mcv the fact that predictive variance is reduced almost always with increasing calibration data size is well known and a property of bayesian updating since bayesian updating of probabilities works under the assumption that a true parameter set is to be identified it will converge to the single best parameter set with increasing data set size the rate of convergence depends on the amount of non redundant information in the data set and on the model structure thus analyzing the dependence of predictive variance on calibration data set size is not primarily about whether or not variance decreases but about the rate and endpoint of decrease if the decrease is too strong this can lead to an overconfident over reduction of predictive intervals which fails to accurately predict future data in fact at the limit of infinite information and without an explicit error model prediction variance will reduce to zero hence while calibrating with a longer time series may reduce the bias e g as measured by nse see section 4 2 in predictions it may come at the cost of over reducing the variance this can lead to overconfident model predictions fig 9 right site the underlying overconfidence in model parameters is typically caused by a misrepresentation of model structural error if e g correlations in residuals due to model structural errors are not accounted for assuming independent errors the bayesian updating step is too harsh because it penalizes each individual deviation at each data point as if it were independent of the deviation at the previous time step hence comparing the rate of variance reduction for different descriptions of model error can help in identifying appropriate error modeling strategies in the context of bayesian updating possible approaches range between refining the likelihood formulation to account for correlations e g schoups and vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 and avoiding the formulation of a likelihood function altogether by including all process representations that can cause residuals into the model formulation nearing et al 2016 such approaches could be e g mixed models consisting of the hydrological model and a statistical model describing the model s structural errors e g abebe and price 2003 del giudice et al 2013 mixed models allow the physically or conceptually motivated parameters to be identified with increasing confidence during bayesian updating while maintaining the necessary variance in predictions through a variance term in the error model the key difference between likelihood centered methods and mixed models is that the latter automatically add the identified model error as predictive error intervals while the former merely dampen the bayesian update in our case the heteroscedasticity in residuals is accounted for by transformation of observed and predicted discharges in the likelihood function but the potentially complex correlated nature of model structural error is not represented in our likelihood function we therefore investigate whether the observed reduction in variance is too strong to allow for reliable predictions by analyzing the predictive coverage of the 90 bayesian credible interval fig 10 ideally predictive coverage should be exactly 90 if it is higher the predictive distribution is unnecessarily wide if it is lower the predictive distribution is too narrow or it shows a significant bias there is a clear decreasing trend of predictive coverage with increasing calibration data length for all three validation period classes because the model parameter uncertainty is driven out by increasing the calibration data length the resulting steadily reduced parameter uncertainty decreases the prediction uncertainty as discussed above then as predictive coverage decreases the potential bias of the model becomes more clearly visible prediction intervals tend to be too wide when predicting dry conditions fig 10a and too narrow when predicting wet conditions fig 10b presumably due to remaining effects of heteroscedasticity in residuals a more direct representation of heteroscedasticity in errors than the variance stabilizing box cox transformation chosen here could potentially fix this evin et al 2014 when predicting dry conditions all calibration strategies yield a satisfying predictive coverage but with a different degree of variability within distinct calibration periods for example there is very little variability in predictive coverage when calibrating and validating on dry periods the opposite is true when predicting wet or mixed conditions calibrating on wet or mixed years yields a smaller variability and on average a slightly better predictive coverage than when calibrating on dry periods an exercise like the one shown here in fig 10 is helpful in illuminating the ability of a model to admit its predictive errors through its bayesian predictive distribution this can guide the choice of an explicit error model such as the mixed model strategy discussed above one could also be tempted to choose the calibration data length from the point of optimal predictive coverage but this would merely mean that model errors are kept invisible by weak calibration whether this can be a meaningful strategy remains an open question 5 summary and conclusions the choice of data periods for calibration and validation of hydrological models is often ad hoc with no objective guidance in choosing periods for most reliable calibration and predictions therefore this study focuses on the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance we have proposed a stress test in form of a comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst to reveal the impact of data choices on model quality considering the potential inefficiency of using either too long or too short and too little or too diverse records to calibrate a crr model the cdsst helps evaluate the robustness or lack thereof of parameter distributions based on a combination of data time series length and hydrological conditions we have chosen to demonstrate such an analysis on the deggendorf kollbach dk catchment in bavaria germany for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records after classifying these data into three differential conditions wet dry and mixed and combining them into periods of varied data length 2 4 8 15 20 and 25 years we have repeatedly calibrated and validated a crr model to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a monte carlo setting data choices in calibration and validation have proven to be relevant for model performance since results vary under the variation of hydrological conditions and time series length our results suggest that for this catchment hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact on model accuracy than the time series length as expected predicting dry conditions proved to be the hardest task and is fulfilled best when calibrating on dry periods of arbitrary length hence our findings suggest that calibrating to wet periods does not necessarily lead to the best validation forecast performance instead calibrating on longer periods of dry conditions leads in our case to satisfactory model performance even when predicting wet or mixed conditions this confirms similar findings achieved by coron et al 2012 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 if well defined dry periods are not clearly detectable e g because the climatic records do not show strong and clear abrupt climatic changes we recommend using sufficiently long time series and then applying a classification based on climatic indices that highlight behavioral changes e g variability intensity duration and or frequency with respect to normal conditions in variables such as precipitation evapo transpi ration and temperature limitations in the number of calibration and validation periods used could potentially be overcome by combining our cdsst with the generalized split sample test gsst by coron et al 2012 which is a method that systematically tests all available calibration and validation periods with a sliding time window i e non differential by design nevertheless it is important to highlight that the classification of hydrological conditions becomes relevant when the modeler wants to interpret the robustness of the model and parameters under climate variability proceeding to calibrate the model with datasets with same data length size but using different combinations of hydrological will reveal biases such as discharge overestimation or underestimation our presented approach of a sensitivity analysis based on classified hydrological conditions could be a starting point for future studies involving other types of catchments model setups and calibration strategies here we were concerned with the frequent case of obvious heteroscedasticity in residuals but a less clear temporal correlation of residuals we adopted the approach to treat heteroscedasticity via transformation and then assumed independency of residuals for a lack of deeper understanding of the potential type of correlation building on this premise we performed the proposed stress test to learn about the model s characteristics skills and deficits in adapting to and predicting of various hydrological conditions the outcome of the proposed analysis is both a more solid understanding of model behavior and a starting point to establish more elaborate residual models it may also help to interpret the right false impression of the capacity of the crr to match the observed values fowler et al 2016 our proposed routine investigates the following individual model traits 1 the agility of the model can the model be calibrated to different hydrological conditions 2 the robustness of the model does the model perform well in validation under different hydrological conditions than the ones used for calibration 3 the severity of condition specific model structural errors do the inferred parameter values change a lot when calibrating to different hydrological conditions in our test case we did not find strong parameter compensation effects e g thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 that could arise due to model structural errors that act differently under different hydrological conditions instead parameter values converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios which confirmed that our model has not been over tuned to specific hydrological regimes and is not missing a dominant process of course model structural errors that act on other time scales or are related to processes that are not represented through the investigated data types cannot be detected through this type of analysis however we saw the typical effect that calibrating on long time series led to overconfident predictions that partially fail to envelope future data this effect is due to an overly fast convergence to optimal parameter estimates in the presence of untreated model structural errors which is in line with findings from thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 xu and valocchi 2015 thus our case study provides a clear example of the classic bias variance trade off when parameter distributions want to be estimated with low uncertainty and high confidence the modeler may need a long data series to reduce forecast variance however the model due to its imperfections will start to reveal errors as a bias as it converges to a more deterministic forecast for such reasons retaining some uncertainty in the parameters by limiting the calibration length is one way to keep the model s predictive variance alive this will avoid over confident erroneous forecasts and increases the likelihood that the truth may fall within the forecast interval however such a strategy can lead to model performances that range from poor to very good depending on the representativeness of the short period razavi and tolson 2013 as these circumstances may vary from catchment to catchment our recommendation is to perform a similar stress test e g our cdsst for any catchment in case of doubt finally our presented analysis could help to identify the optimal data set length to avoid over compensation of model errors however from a theoretical perspective one should rather aim to tackle the model structural error problem the inherent property of bayesian inference to converge to the true parameter value will become more meaningful when correctly specifying the model structure i e when admitting the type and amount of model structural error future research will reveal the impact of plausible error models on the sensitivity of modeling results to data choices in calibration and validation beyond crr modeling we believe that the presented systematic analysis is well suited to stress test any type of dynamic environmental system model in its respective modeling context investigating model performance and parameter identifiability in various distinct calibration and validation periods has the potential to reveal model structural deficits and may be highly valuable in many modeling applications such a stress test could answer three crucial questions 1 what is the importance of effects not covered by the model 2 how much overconfidence is present in the model and 3 what are case specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups we expect that answering these three questions will be valuable for directed model improvement and for constructing

6528,the choice of data periods for calibrating and evaluating conceptual hydrological models often seems ad hoc with no objective guidance on choosing calibration periods that produce the most reliable predictions we therefore propose to systematically investigate the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance we demonstrate our analysis on the deggendorf kollbach catchment in bavaria germany for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records after classifying these data into three hydrological conditions wet dry and mixed and combining them into periods of varied data length 2 4 8 15 20 and 25 years we repeatedly calibrate a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a monte carlo setting then we analyze predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods of distinct hydrological condition and time series length we call this the comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst our results suggest that hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact than time series length and that calibrating on dry conditions might be a robust choice when aiming at predicting arbitrary future conditions wet dry or mixed furthermore we found that posterior parameter estimates converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios indicating that compensation of model structural errors by parameter fitting is independent of the chosen calibration condition however calibrating on time series 8 years or longer led to overconfident predictions that failed to reliably envelope future data while these findings are specific to our case study we recommend using the cdsst to stress test conceptual hydrological models to identify robust model parameters and or deficiencies in the model structure in general we expect our proposed approach to be a valuable basis for model error diagnosis in any type of dynamic environmental system model because it answers the following three questions 1 what is the importance of physical processes not explicitly covered by the model 2 how much overconfidence is present in the model and 3 what are case specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups keywords model uncertainty quantification conceptual rainfall runoff model brute force monte carlo numerical modeling hbv model bayesian updating time series analysis model stress test model calibration model validation model structural error hydrological condition analysis 1 introduction hydrologists have been investigating calibration bárdossy and singh 2008 monsalve 2009 kavetski and fenicia 2011 sorooshian et al 1983 and uncertainty assessment strategies li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 yen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for lumped conceptual rainfall runoff crr models in order to optimally inform modeling decisions specifically the effects of data length on crr model calibration and validation have been studied by numerous hydrologists whose findings and suggestions do not converge to a common data length to be used for calibration purposes for instance yapo et al 1996 found that approximately eight years of data are required to obtain calibrations relatively insensitive to the period selected and that reduction of the parameter uncertainty is greatest when wettest data periods on record are used li et al 2010 also found that eight years of data are sufficient to obtain steady estimates of model performance and parameters for a crr model and that longer calibration data series do not necessarily result in better model performance anctil et al 2004 showed that artificial neural network models continue to improve with datasets longer than nine years in contrast to a four parameter crr model based on validation against the same 7 year test set perrin et al 2007 found that having a dataset of 350 days that include both dry and wet conditions is sufficient to obtain robust estimates of crr model parameters boughton 2007 concluded that a dataset longer than six years would not further improve crr model performance and that modeling results were more dependent on the specific data set used for calibration than the specific model used razavi and tolson 2013 stated that model calibration to short data periods leads to a range of performances from poor to very good depending on the representativeness of the short data period which is typically unknown a priori a consistent finding is that crr models represent humid and semi humid catchments better than arid catchments regardless of the calibration data length li et al 2010 altogether these studies lead to mixed findings making it difficult to propose general guidelines for choosing an adequate data length given the data exists for crr model calibration calibration data choices may be made with respect to data length and data type e g specifically considering wet or dry records for any such choice it is important to recognize its implications for model error compensation we briefly discuss the aspects of data length data type and error compensation in the following sections and define the corresponding major research questions addressed by our proposed framework with regard to data set length literature suggests that a certain number of years might be best for calibration e g sorooshian et al 1983 anctil et al 2004 xia et al 2004 perrin et al 2007 less attention has been paid to the choice of data type i e the choice of wet dry or average conditions for calibration some studies found that the most informative hydrological data might correspond to years with greater than average precipitation e g yapo et al 1996 gan et al 1997 numerous hydrologists e g refsgaard and knudsen 1996 hartmann and bárdossy 2005 vaze et al 2010 seibert et al 2003 fowler et al 2016 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 have evaluated the performance of various crr models and their response to parameter transferability under changing hydrological conditions most of these studies used a flavor of the differential split sample test dsst originally proposed by klemeš 1986 the dsst is a standard method to examine parameter dependency on climate variability and associated outcomes on hydrological model efficiency with this technique calibration and validation periods are selected based on a climatic classification then calibrations on wet and dry periods are validated considering either the same or opposite hydrological conditions during validation one common finding is that parameter estimates obtained in wet calibration periods perform poorly in dry validation periods on the contrary wu and johnston 2007 tested the soil and water assessment tool swat model using datasets with diverse climate behavior they showed that parameter ensembles calibrated on drought periods performed better in validation than parameters sets calibrated on average wet periods apparently the parameters that govern evapotranspiration processes are more identifiable in dry periods where evapotranspiration is a more prevailing process seiller et al 2012 tested the performance of 20 lumped crr models under four different climate conditions using five non continuous hydrological years their results showed that the transferability of crr model parameters between contrasted climatic conditions is generally low nevertheless the tested models showed better predictive reliability the data falls into the predicted intervals with appropriate probability for the respective opposite validation conditions when calibrating on dry periods than when calibrating on wet periods ruelland et al 2015 found that wet calibration evaluated in dry validation periods did not generate larger errors than when using a dry calibration period collectively there is a lack of consensus and clear guidance regarding optimal calibration and model evaluation strategies for specific modeling purposes with the exception of a few studies vaze et al 2010 seiller et al 2012 and troin et al 2017 previous studies mainly focused on model calibration with less emphasis on validation this leads us to a number of intriguing research questions for example since conceptual hydrological models apparently perform best in predicting wet conditions does that mean we should calibrate and validate on wet conditions how much data under what hydrological conditions is necessary to calibrate a crr model so that it can make reliable predictions regardless of future hydrological conditions note that if the goal is to calibrate a model for predicting a specific scenario e g floods we follow the general intuition that it should be calibrated on similar past scenarios if available however the focus of our study is to calibrate a model that provides robust predictions under arbitrary hydrological conditions such all purpose calibrated models can be useful e g when quantifying the water balance of a catchment or for a general improvement of system understanding our own motivation among others is to investigate how fit a given model is because this fosters insights about its specific shortcomings and model errors for such all purpose investigations we find that there is no clear recommendation on how to perform calibration and validation under these premises we will investigate these questions systematically by looking at the simultaneous impact of varying data set length and varying hydrological condition on model performance in calibration and validation but as an important aspect of this analysis we have to address the role of model errors because any calibration data choice has implications for the treatment of model errors model errors model structural deficits are known to exist since crr models rely on simple process representations often such model structural deficiencies that are revealed only during certain hydrological conditions wagener et al 2003 in calibration these deficiencies are partially compensated by parameter fitting so that parameter values are expected to vary with hydrological conditions and calibration strategies additionally abebe et al 2010 found that parameter estimates change in time not just due to model structural errors but also because of unsteady catchment scale processes e g under climatic variability hence we aim to answer the following additional questions how stable are parameter estimates under different classes of hydrological conditions and from the perspective of error compensation does it hurt or help to increase the data set length used in calibration methodologically we propose an upgrade to the dsst which we call the comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst it serves to analyze the impact of both data length choices and hydrological condition choices on the predictive reliability and robustness of a model with robust we mean that best estimates and predicted uncertainty intervals perform in validation as expected from their performance in calibration even under climatic variability between calibration and validation in the cdsst we perform crr model calibration through bayesian updating to account for uncertainty in model parameters and output in this probabilistic setting we propose to analyze posterior parameter distributions and predictive performance accuracy and precision as a function of dataset length and hydrological condition in calibration and validation as a way to stress test crr models accuracy means small residuals between the data and the model with best fit parameter values while precision means a low predictive variance our procedure can be understood as a bayesian version of cross validation but instead of a common leave one out or leave one block out analysis referred to as jackknife method efron and gong 1983 we systematically select data sets of different length and different hydrological condition with this we obtain more controlled differential and interpretable answers than the answers that standard statistical methods would offer we demonstrate our cdsst on the deggendorf kollbach dk catchment in bavaria germany which is a well monitored catchment with 55 years of continuous hydrological and meteorological data we use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 to produce discharge predictions as a function of precipitation evapotranspiration air temperature land cover and soil properties we chose to use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 because it is one of the most frequently used crr models with successful applications in different environments ranging from northern european to south american catchments bárdossy and singh 2008 abebe et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 specifically seiller et al 2012 showed that hbv is a good model choice for a close by catchment in southern bavaria germany furthermore results from dakhlaoui et al 2017 have shown through a multi model comparison that hbv produces similar results to other crr models e g gr4j and ihacres the available discharge data are classified into three hydrological conditions and combined into periods of varied data length then we repeatedly calibrate the model to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a brute force monte carlo framework we evaluate the resulting predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods again classified according to hydrological condition and data length our systematic analysis allows us to determine the sensitivity of model reliability to data choices in calibration under varying modeling purposes reflected by the choice of data length and validation period while some of our findings may depend on our specific choice of study domain and model we are convinced that the idea of systematically stress testing via our suggested cdsst is useful for arbitrary catchments and hydrological models and in fact for dynamic environmental system models in general in order to produce clear recommendations with broader applicability i e different crr models and or different catchments further research would be required in short the main contributions of our study are 1 proposing a systematic investigation of competing calibration strategies for a crr model classified according to hydrological condition and data length 2 a sensitivity analysis of model performance both predictive accuracy and precision based on varied calibration strategies and validation scenarios and 3 a sensitivity analysis of posterior parameter statistics based on alternative calibration strategies these investigations allow us to draw conclusions about optimal calibration strategies for robust prediction of arbitrary future conditions finally we provide 4 a discussion of how such a stress test builds a solid basis for diagnosing model structural errors in dynamic environmental system models the article is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the deggendorf kollbach catchment section 3 presents the crr model the criteria used to select the calibration and validation data and the suggested cdsst section 4 discusses the impacts of data choice on parameter and predictive uncertainty and section 5 draws conclusions about the benefit of the proposed cdsst in environmental modeling 2 study area as part of the european union s water framework directive wfd watersheds in bavaria state are currently being monitored through 600 stations by the environmental agency of bavaria bayerisches landesamt für umwelt blu 2016 from the many monitored catchments in bavaria we selected the deggendorf kollbach catchment for this study because of its 55 years of continuous hydrological and meteorological data bayerisches landesamt für umwelt blu 2016 the catchment is located in the municipality of deggendorf in east bavaria germany fig 1 its area of 36 6 km2 is dominated by mixed forest natural vegetation mosaic and evergreen needle leaf forest the elevation ranges from 324 to 915 m above sea level masl cgiar csi 2016 the long term relative humidity is 82 with minimum monthly values of 13 and maximum monthly values of 99 the long term mean annual evapotranspiration amounts to 734 mm and the annual precipitation to 1147 mm the long term mean monthly temperatures vary from 2 3 c to 17 6 c during winter and summer months respectively topsoil permeability is described as being low to extremely low bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe 2016 with values equal to or less than 10 5 m s the catchment produces high daily mean discharges in march due to spring snowmelt 1 2 m3 s and low discharges in august 0 4 m3 s the long term average discharge is 0 7 m3 s 3 methodology 3 1 model setup for the reasons provided in the introduction we use the hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning bergström 1992 as the crr model for our study it can be classified as a semi distributed crr model which uses sub basins as primary hydrological units here we implemented a lumped version of the model assuming the following 1 the land cover has been primarily dominated during the entire period of observation by mixed forest 62 natural vegetation 25 and evergreen forest 11 lp daac 2016 2 the near surface geology of the catchment is composed of high and low permeability material ranging from weathered coarse loamy sand to loamy soils with high clay content bundesanstalt für geowissenschaften und rohstoffe 2016 3 the catchment does not present abrupt changes in topography or geomorphology 4 there are no anthropogenic controls on the river discharges i e dams and 5 errors in precipitation records from the rain gauges are negligible see below hence we are not concerned with estimating the impact of input errors on hbv model outputs here see studies such as kavetski et al 2006 götzinger and bárdossy 2007 or renard et al 2010a b for approaches to treat input errors the hbv model consists of three main subroutines for 1 snow accumulation and melt 2 soil moisture accounting and 3 response and river routing bergström 1992 the model has twelve parameters that are subject to calibration table 1 with plausible ranges for each parameter value chosen according to literature values bergström 1992 bárdossy and singh 2008 abebe et al 2010 dakhlaoui et al 2012 the precipitation mean daily values data are spatially weighted between one gauging station within the catchment and three neighbouring stations i e id930 id1730 id1731 and id3271 in fig 1 we based our assumption of acceptably low precipitation errors on the strategically good position of the gauging stations especially of id1730 potential evapotranspiration monthly mean standard values and air temperature daily mean values data were obtained from a single climatic station nearest the catchment the model is run on daily time steps and is calibrated and validated on different data sets which are described in the next section 3 2 selection of data sets for calibration and validation the key idea of our cdsst is to split the sample of available time series data into many distinctively different periods for calibration and validation with many different lengths and then perform a manifold cross validation we use two climatic indices i e aridity and runoff ratio and three hydrological runoff signatures i e annual runoff seasonal runoff and daily hydrograph similarity blöschl 2013 to define a hydrological year as humid average or deficit a hydrological year i e 01 apr to 31 mar differs from a regular calendar year i e 01 jan to 31 dec in that it is set to coincide with the largest runoff values this is typically when snowmelt takes place which occurs right before discharge values start to decrease the categories for each index help to identify distinct hydrological periods within the whole dataset we define a wet period to consist of only humid years a dry period comprises only deficit years and a mixed period combines humid average and deficit years the aridity index i1 eq 1 reflects the competition between energy and water within the catchment a catchment with a high aridity index value denotes a water limited environment high evapotranspiration dynamics while a low score of the aridity index represents an energy limited catchment in which the climatic conditions are mainly dominated by precipitation the runoff ratio i2 eq 2 reflects how the annual water balance is affected by the storage capacity of the soil the evapotranspiration rates within the catchment and the frequency and duration of high intensity precipitation events in eqs 1 and 2 map denotes mean annual precipitation pet denotes annual potential evapotranspiration and mar denotes mean annual runoff where discharge rates are normalized by the catchment area 1 i 1 p e t m a p 2 i 2 m a r m a p hydrological years were classified by the formulation in table 2 where conditions 1 and 2 should be met for each year μ i represents the average index value of ii and σi the standard deviation over the year per period in case one of the indices suggests average conditions and the other one suggests unusual conditions i e i1 humid and i2 average the year is classified as humid or deficit based on the non average index the hydrological signatures annual runoff seasonal runoff and daily hydrograph are used as complementary tools to confirm the period definition table 3 lists the indices values for an exemplary selection of three distinct years with diverse hydrological conditions two years of model spin up 1961 1962 were allowed to reach dynamic cyclical equilibrium the remaining 53 years of data were split into calibration 1963 1994 and validation 1995 2015 periods both calibration and validation data sets were divided into various lengths 2 4 8 15 and 25 20 years respectively and then categorized into one of three hydrological conditions wet dry or mixed table 4 lists our resulting data scenarios since several wet dry or mixed periods of shorter length i e 2 or 4 years exist we are able to perform model calibration and validation on three data sets each for the longer periods i e 8 and 15 years in calibration 8 years in validation only one period each was available according to our classification finally the longest data set s 25 years in calibration 15 and 20 years in validation consist of mixed conditions only since no wet or dry period could be constructed of that length this fact could only be avoided by using a non differential analysis e g the gsst method used by coron et al 2012 but such kind of approaches would not allow to carry on the type of analysis that we intend in total 25 different datasets were used for calibration and 23 datasets were used for validation table 4 periods of one of the three classifications wet dry mixed were generated by a composite of several humid deficit or average years respectively the chosen years are not necessarily consecutive but a period could contain discontinuous years as shown in fig 2 the selection of possibly discontinuous periods only applies to data selection for calibration and validation respectively the model itself was always run for the full continuous 55 years including spin up the discontinuity in calibration and validation periods could possibly influence wet years by preceding dry years and vice versa but we minimize this adverse effect by cutting hydrological years at snowmelt in march 3 3 calibration and uncertainty analysis via bayesian updating in the following all twelve hbv parameters are denoted as a parameter vector θ to reflect our prior state of knowledge in the bayesian context we define all parameters to be uniformly distributed random variables with bounds from abebe et al 2010 shown in table 1 a priori all parameters are assumed to be independent the prior state of knowledge p θ can be updated by multiplying it with the likelihood p y o θ and normalizing by the probability of the data p y o to a posterior state of knowledge p θ y o via bayes theorem 3 p θ y o p y o θ p θ p y o in eq 3 p denotes a probability distribution function pdf p denotes a conditional pdf and y o represents observed data here records of discharge the likelihood function p y o θ evaluates how well the predicted data y f θ match the observed data y o the denominator in eq 3 called bayesian model evidence e g schöniger et al 2014 acts as a normalizing constant for the posterior pdf p θ y o and can be neglected by simply evaluating the proportionality p θ y o p y o θ p θ in order to account for heteroscedasticity of the residuals y y o we apply a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 kuczera 1983 to both the observed and predicted discharges with a fixed lambda value of 0 45 this lambda value was obtained in a preprocessing analysis and was found to be a robust choice for variance stabilization of the residuals the box cox transformation ensures that the fit to high and low flows are prioritized equally after transformation we assume that residuals are independent and gaussian distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 4 0 in transformed space this value proved to be a suitable representation of lumped model structural and measurement uncertainty we are aware of studies that address temporal persistence of model errors e g schoups and vrugt 2010 morawietz et al 2011 evin et al 2014 but pursue here the simpler practice of ignoring the possibly complicated time correlation of transformed residuals del giudice et al 2018 has shown that ignoring time correlation of transformed residuals can be problematic when calibrating to periods of less than a month and because our minimum period 2 year dataset has several orders of magnitude higher than the one used by del giudice et al 2018 therefore there should not be any time correlated problem with residuals further evidence for the reasonable absence of residual correlation is provided in the appendix to comprehensively sample from the posterior pdf we chose to implement a brute force monte carlo bfmc approach hammersley 1960 with likelihood reweighting because the computational expense of an individual model run was relatively low bfmc has the advantage that it provides a single prior ensemble that can be used for likelihood weighting in all calibration periods mcmc methods would require a new mcmc run for each calibration exercise we draw random realizations from uniform prior pdfs with interval bounds listed in table 1 after running the hbv model 2 5 million times we keep those realizations in the prior ensemble that produced physically realistic predictions i e that produced discharge values greater than zero our final ensemble contains 840 000 realizations this step can be viewed as conditioning the model to observed physical realism then likelihoods p y o θ were determined for each remaining realization and for each calibration data scenario as defined in section 3 2 the posterior mean and other statistics of the posterior distribution such as the 90 credible interval are determined by reweighting the prior ensemble of realizations with their respective likelihood weighted bootstrap smith and gelfand 1992 depending on the chosen calibration data scenario note that we obtain posterior statistics for the whole time series of 53 years not just for the respective calibration data period this allows us to assess the performance of the calibrated model in various validation periods as defined in section 3 2 by evaluating effective sample sizes liu 2008 we confirmed that for all calibration data scenarios the number of prior realizations that significantly contribute to the posterior distribution is large enough to produce reliable posterior statistics 3 4 model evaluation we choose three statistical measures for model evaluation in this study the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse dawson et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 reflects the accuracy of the maximum likelihood prediction mle y eq 4 4 nse 1 i 1 n y i o y i 2 i 1 n y i o y o 2 where y i o represents observed discharge values at time step i 1 n and y o denotes the mean observed discharge over the whole time series note that the maximum likelihood predictions y i i e the predictions per time step made based on the parameter realization that achieves the highest likelihood in the ensemble for a given calibration data set is in our case equivalent to the maximum a posteriori estimate often referred to as map not to be confused with our usage of map as mean annual precipitation in section 3 2 because we use uniform parameter priors it is also equivalent to the best fit parameter set in the context of least squares calibration because we assume a gaussian likelihood after transformation of discharge values an efficiency of nse 0 indicates that the mle is a more accurate predictor than the mean of the observed data here we apply the nse to transformed predictions and observations for the same reasons as explained in section 3 3 we aim to weight both high and low flows equally instead of overemphasizing peak flows when using untransformed values the mean coefficient of variation mcv reflects the spread or the lack of precision in the posterior ensemble eq 5 5 mcv 1 n i 1 n σ y i y i where σ y i denotes the standard deviation of the posterior predictions at time step i respectively the standard deviation is normalized by the mle y which makes the high and low flows more comparable making the box cox transformation unnecessary when calculating mcv finally we evaluate how well observed discharge data are captured by the posterior ensemble of simulated discharges by determining the predictive coverage pc e g hoeting et al 1999 as the fraction of observed validation data points that fall within the 90 credible interval with 90 then being the ideal value to illustrate the statistical properties of the posterior ensemble that we use for model evaluation fig 3 a c shows the hydrograph of a 2 year dry validation v2y d1 a 2 year mixed validation v2y m2 and a 2 year wet v2y w1 validation period respectively fig 3c reveals that high stream flows were more recurrent between oct 98 and apr 99 than one and two years before fig 3a and b high flows that took place in mixed and wet hydrological periods were difficult to forecast regardless of the hydrological condition used for calibration e g from dec 1999 to apr 2000 in fig 3c predictive uncertainty is visualized as the shaded 90 credible interval lines in red yellow and blue represent the mle y for dry mixed and wet conditions respectively observed discharges y o are shown in black the results of our performance criteria for these distinct examples are shown in table 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of data choices on model accuracy in calibration we obtained parameter ensembles through repeated likelihood weighting of the bfmc method section 3 3 on 25 calibration datasets table 4 the different calibration data sets were differentiated based on time series length and hydrological condition see section 3 2 then we determined the nse values of the mle prediction for each calibration data scenario i e not yet in the validation periods results are shown in fig 4 sorted by increasing data length and color coded according to the type of condition used in calibration dry wet or mixed the highest nse values in calibration for a given data length are mostly achieved when calibrating on mixed periods compared to mixed conditions it seems harder to find parameter sets that perform equally well for longer calibration periods of wet or dry conditions for strongly mixed periods that consist of wet and dry sections e g c4ym3 cf fig 2 calibration quality as measured by the nse is generally not worse than for either dry or wet periods of the same data length there is quite some variability within each type of scenario wet dry or mixed with a fixed data length we attribute this to the fact that some individual events due to abrupt changes in climatic conditions covered in distinct periods are significantly harder to model than others analyzing the performance of the best fit parameter set under varied calibration conditions reveals the general capability of the model structure to adapt to these different conditions for other modeling setups and catchments this analysis might reveal whether the model is primarily suited to reproduce either high or low flows depending on the final purpose of the model further model development could then be guided by these findings 4 2 effects of data choices on model accuracy in validation next we used the sets of parameter ensembles obtained in calibration section 4 1 to assess the model s predictive accuracy with respect to the validation data sets table 4 measured as nse fig 5 shows the nse values in validation as a function of data length and hydrological condition in calibration and the respective condition in validation wet dry or mixed as highlighted by coron et al 2012 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 comparing nse values normalized by different variances from different hydrological conditions may be affected by the differences in normalization for that reason we mainly compare nse values of the same type of validation period in the following i e lines with the same color predictive performance in validation measured in nse units tends to increase with increasing calibration data length ranging from a 0 01 increase for dry conditions to a 0 08 increase for wet conditions this behavior can be expected from classical statements on cross validation where longer data sets in calibration reduce the effect of data noise and over fitting more importantly the hydrological condition used for calibration seems to have a strong impact on predictive performance in validation when calibrating on wet or mixed periods the performance in predicting future dry periods is lower by 0 05 to 0 15 nse units compared to predicting wet or mixed conditions see lower position of red lines in the right two blocks of fig 5 note that calibrating on wet and predicting wet conditions as well as calibrating on mixed and predicting mixed conditions is not significantly more successful than calibrating on one and predicting the other indeed the model setup independent from its calibration strategy seems to be most adequate most generalizable for wet conditions since their nse values are always highest in validation but not calibration cf section 4 1 and fig 4 overall calibrating on dry conditions is a robust choice when aiming to predict arbitrary future validation conditions see lower scatter of lines in the left block of fig 5 this finding of course requires an explanation coron et al 2012 discussed that the parameters controlling internal flows have a greater influence on discharge calibration than the parameters that govern et at least in wet and mixed calibration periods where simulated discharge is dominated by precipitation therefore it is difficult to constrain et parameters under wet and mixed hydrological conditions additionally it has been demonstrated that uncertainty related to evapotranspiration because of its complexity and difficulty in estimation degrades hydrological model performance wu and xu 2006 together this explains why a model calibrated to wet and mixed hydrological conditions performs poor in validation with dry hydrological conditions on the other hand when the model is calibrated to dry hydrological conditions the participation between precipitation and et parameters is more balanced thus calibrating a crr model to dry conditions can lead to more robust forecasts i e good performance in wet mixed and dry hydrological conditions regardless of our specific catchment and hbv model the findings from inspecting different validation periods will show for which calibration conditions and for which predicted conditions the model generalizes best as seen from our case the capability to adapt best to certain conditions in calibration is not necessarily decisive for most reliable predictions in validation thus contrasting the model behavior in calibration and validation has the potential to reveal the model s tradeoff between flexibility ability to adapt and stability ability to generalize friedman et al 2001 höge et al 2018 under specified conditions when looking at the calibration and validation scenarios in detail fig 6 it is clear that the most variability in validation performance occurs when testing predictions for mixed conditions fig 6c depending on the specific events contained in the mixed period the model might score a lucky punch i e v2ym1 uppermost dotted line or predict rather poorly i e v4ym3 bottommost dashed line the greatest variability in this respect is seen when calibrating on dry conditions both the best and the worst performance for mixed validation periods result from such a calibration strategy again calibrating on wet or mixed conditions does not make a lot of difference the variability in predicting wet conditions fig 6b is rather low independent of the chosen calibration conditions similar to our observations during calibration section 4 1 some distinct calibration periods seem to pose a challenge to the model e g period c2yd3 which leads to a poor performance in most validation scenarios we theorize that the cause of such poor model performance is due to limitations of the model to represent catchment behavior when input data contains strong seasonal fluctuations i e potential evapotranspiration or precipitation values however further analysis would be required to find the definitive reason for the degradation of model validation performance under these specific circumstances 4 3 effects of data choices on parameter uncertainty now we analyze the posterior parameter distribution resulting from our 25 calibration exercises table 4 and sub section 4 1 for the two major incident factors of uncertainty impact of data length and prevalent hydrological condition to do so we determine the ratio between posterior and prior variance i e the fraction of variance that remains after bayesian updating fig 7 shows the fraction of prior variance as a function of data length for all twelve model parameters averaged over all hydrological conditions results indicate that even with the shortest calibration data length of two years all parameters show a significant reduction in parameter uncertainty this is partly because wide prior parameter bounds were chosen to include a large range of possible parameter combinations by analyzing the fraction of prior variance as a function of data length fig 7 we can classify the parameters according to their sensitivity in calibration k2 k3 and β turn out to be highly sensitive while cmelt tt k1 kd fc and pwp are less semi sensitive all sensitive parameters exhibit a monotonously decreasing posterior variance with increasing calibration data set size conversely the insensitive parameters i e cetp maxbas uzl exhibit the least initial reduction in parameter uncertainty when calibrated with two years of data and can even show a slight increase in variance when calibrated with long datasets i e 15 or 25 years while an increase of parameter variance with more calibration data may sound surprising theory only supports that information entropy must decrease with more data which does not translate to variance for non linear bayesian updates as the one featured here a more detailed analysis of the behavior of highly sensitive semi sensitive and insensitive parameters under various calibration scenarios can be done based on statistics of their posterior distribution we therefore show box plots in fig 8 with boxes representing 50 credible intervals and whiskers representing the 5th and 95th percentiles fig 8a shows the most sensitive parameter in our case study the recession coefficient k3 fig 8b shows a semi sensitive parameter the percolation to groundwater kd and 8c shows an insensitive parameter the upper reservoir threshold uzl results indicate that with increasing calibration data set length the plausible value range of sensitive parameters becomes increasingly constrained and converges to a similar range under all calibration conditions i e wet dry mixed the upper reservoir threshold uzl shows the largest of an overall very low sensitivity and hence variance reduction when exposed to wet calibration data this explains the apparent increase in variance between data set sizes of 15 years averaged over lower variance under wet conditions and similar higher variance under dry or mixed conditions and of 25 years a single mixed period the parameter seems insensitive to some parameter compensation effects are visible for the recession coefficient k3 the credible interval achieved after calibration on 15 years of dry conditions suggests slightly lower values than the credible interval obtained after calibration on 15 years of wet conditions credible intervals do however overlap significantly indicating that this model is not over fitted to a specific hydrological condition and that structural errors are not pronounced enough to be heavily compensated through a combination of different parameter ranges identifying such behavior confirms the robustness of the model under varying hydrological conditions conversely a model where different hydrological conditions would lead to different optimal parameter ranges would indicate the presence of model structural errors that significantly affect the simulated discharge data during wet or dry periods and the need for revising the conceptual model 4 4 effects of data choices on predictive uncertainty and reliability model parameter uncertainty is propagated through the hydrological model to predictive uncertainty therefore the decrease in parameter uncertainty with increasing data set length section 4 3 also leads to a decrease in the variability of predictions our analysis of predictive uncertainty via mcv only quantifies the predictive uncertainty from uncertain parameter estimates after calibration this analysis could be extended to include model errors e g an additive noise model inferred from residuals however we prefer a parameter focused analysis because it still reveals model error e g if validation data falls outside predictive intervals the parameter related uncertainty of hbv predictions after calibration measured as mcv section 3 4 are shown in fig 9 since the parameter uncertainty estimates based on different calibration conditions wet dry mixed are not significantly different as observed from fig 8 we present here average mcv values over the three types of hydrological conditions of a certain calibration data length no matter which hydrological conditions are being predicted their associated prediction variance reduces by a similar fraction with increasing calibration data length the variability when predicting dry conditions is always largest which might be an effect of the normalization by the small mle prediction values in the definition of mcv the fact that predictive variance is reduced almost always with increasing calibration data size is well known and a property of bayesian updating since bayesian updating of probabilities works under the assumption that a true parameter set is to be identified it will converge to the single best parameter set with increasing data set size the rate of convergence depends on the amount of non redundant information in the data set and on the model structure thus analyzing the dependence of predictive variance on calibration data set size is not primarily about whether or not variance decreases but about the rate and endpoint of decrease if the decrease is too strong this can lead to an overconfident over reduction of predictive intervals which fails to accurately predict future data in fact at the limit of infinite information and without an explicit error model prediction variance will reduce to zero hence while calibrating with a longer time series may reduce the bias e g as measured by nse see section 4 2 in predictions it may come at the cost of over reducing the variance this can lead to overconfident model predictions fig 9 right site the underlying overconfidence in model parameters is typically caused by a misrepresentation of model structural error if e g correlations in residuals due to model structural errors are not accounted for assuming independent errors the bayesian updating step is too harsh because it penalizes each individual deviation at each data point as if it were independent of the deviation at the previous time step hence comparing the rate of variance reduction for different descriptions of model error can help in identifying appropriate error modeling strategies in the context of bayesian updating possible approaches range between refining the likelihood formulation to account for correlations e g schoups and vrugt 2010 evin et al 2014 and avoiding the formulation of a likelihood function altogether by including all process representations that can cause residuals into the model formulation nearing et al 2016 such approaches could be e g mixed models consisting of the hydrological model and a statistical model describing the model s structural errors e g abebe and price 2003 del giudice et al 2013 mixed models allow the physically or conceptually motivated parameters to be identified with increasing confidence during bayesian updating while maintaining the necessary variance in predictions through a variance term in the error model the key difference between likelihood centered methods and mixed models is that the latter automatically add the identified model error as predictive error intervals while the former merely dampen the bayesian update in our case the heteroscedasticity in residuals is accounted for by transformation of observed and predicted discharges in the likelihood function but the potentially complex correlated nature of model structural error is not represented in our likelihood function we therefore investigate whether the observed reduction in variance is too strong to allow for reliable predictions by analyzing the predictive coverage of the 90 bayesian credible interval fig 10 ideally predictive coverage should be exactly 90 if it is higher the predictive distribution is unnecessarily wide if it is lower the predictive distribution is too narrow or it shows a significant bias there is a clear decreasing trend of predictive coverage with increasing calibration data length for all three validation period classes because the model parameter uncertainty is driven out by increasing the calibration data length the resulting steadily reduced parameter uncertainty decreases the prediction uncertainty as discussed above then as predictive coverage decreases the potential bias of the model becomes more clearly visible prediction intervals tend to be too wide when predicting dry conditions fig 10a and too narrow when predicting wet conditions fig 10b presumably due to remaining effects of heteroscedasticity in residuals a more direct representation of heteroscedasticity in errors than the variance stabilizing box cox transformation chosen here could potentially fix this evin et al 2014 when predicting dry conditions all calibration strategies yield a satisfying predictive coverage but with a different degree of variability within distinct calibration periods for example there is very little variability in predictive coverage when calibrating and validating on dry periods the opposite is true when predicting wet or mixed conditions calibrating on wet or mixed years yields a smaller variability and on average a slightly better predictive coverage than when calibrating on dry periods an exercise like the one shown here in fig 10 is helpful in illuminating the ability of a model to admit its predictive errors through its bayesian predictive distribution this can guide the choice of an explicit error model such as the mixed model strategy discussed above one could also be tempted to choose the calibration data length from the point of optimal predictive coverage but this would merely mean that model errors are kept invisible by weak calibration whether this can be a meaningful strategy remains an open question 5 summary and conclusions the choice of data periods for calibration and validation of hydrological models is often ad hoc with no objective guidance in choosing periods for most reliable calibration and predictions therefore this study focuses on the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance we have proposed a stress test in form of a comprehensive differential split sample test cdsst to reveal the impact of data choices on model quality considering the potential inefficiency of using either too long or too short and too little or too diverse records to calibrate a crr model the cdsst helps evaluate the robustness or lack thereof of parameter distributions based on a combination of data time series length and hydrological conditions we have chosen to demonstrate such an analysis on the deggendorf kollbach dk catchment in bavaria germany for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records after classifying these data into three differential conditions wet dry and mixed and combining them into periods of varied data length 2 4 8 15 20 and 25 years we have repeatedly calibrated and validated a crr model to these distinct data sets via bayesian updating in a monte carlo setting data choices in calibration and validation have proven to be relevant for model performance since results vary under the variation of hydrological conditions and time series length our results suggest that for this catchment hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact on model accuracy than the time series length as expected predicting dry conditions proved to be the hardest task and is fulfilled best when calibrating on dry periods of arbitrary length hence our findings suggest that calibrating to wet periods does not necessarily lead to the best validation forecast performance instead calibrating on longer periods of dry conditions leads in our case to satisfactory model performance even when predicting wet or mixed conditions this confirms similar findings achieved by coron et al 2012 and dakhlaoui et al 2017 if well defined dry periods are not clearly detectable e g because the climatic records do not show strong and clear abrupt climatic changes we recommend using sufficiently long time series and then applying a classification based on climatic indices that highlight behavioral changes e g variability intensity duration and or frequency with respect to normal conditions in variables such as precipitation evapo transpi ration and temperature limitations in the number of calibration and validation periods used could potentially be overcome by combining our cdsst with the generalized split sample test gsst by coron et al 2012 which is a method that systematically tests all available calibration and validation periods with a sliding time window i e non differential by design nevertheless it is important to highlight that the classification of hydrological conditions becomes relevant when the modeler wants to interpret the robustness of the model and parameters under climate variability proceeding to calibrate the model with datasets with same data length size but using different combinations of hydrological will reveal biases such as discharge overestimation or underestimation our presented approach of a sensitivity analysis based on classified hydrological conditions could be a starting point for future studies involving other types of catchments model setups and calibration strategies here we were concerned with the frequent case of obvious heteroscedasticity in residuals but a less clear temporal correlation of residuals we adopted the approach to treat heteroscedasticity via transformation and then assumed independency of residuals for a lack of deeper understanding of the potential type of correlation building on this premise we performed the proposed stress test to learn about the model s characteristics skills and deficits in adapting to and predicting of various hydrological conditions the outcome of the proposed analysis is both a more solid understanding of model behavior and a starting point to establish more elaborate residual models it may also help to interpret the right false impression of the capacity of the crr to match the observed values fowler et al 2016 our proposed routine investigates the following individual model traits 1 the agility of the model can the model be calibrated to different hydrological conditions 2 the robustness of the model does the model perform well in validation under different hydrological conditions than the ones used for calibration 3 the severity of condition specific model structural errors do the inferred parameter values change a lot when calibrating to different hydrological conditions in our test case we did not find strong parameter compensation effects e g thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 that could arise due to model structural errors that act differently under different hydrological conditions instead parameter values converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios which confirmed that our model has not been over tuned to specific hydrological regimes and is not missing a dominant process of course model structural errors that act on other time scales or are related to processes that are not represented through the investigated data types cannot be detected through this type of analysis however we saw the typical effect that calibrating on long time series led to overconfident predictions that partially fail to envelope future data this effect is due to an overly fast convergence to optimal parameter estimates in the presence of untreated model structural errors which is in line with findings from thyer et al 2009 schoups and vrugt 2010 xu and valocchi 2015 thus our case study provides a clear example of the classic bias variance trade off when parameter distributions want to be estimated with low uncertainty and high confidence the modeler may need a long data series to reduce forecast variance however the model due to its imperfections will start to reveal errors as a bias as it converges to a more deterministic forecast for such reasons retaining some uncertainty in the parameters by limiting the calibration length is one way to keep the model s predictive variance alive this will avoid over confident erroneous forecasts and increases the likelihood that the truth may fall within the forecast interval however such a strategy can lead to model performances that range from poor to very good depending on the representativeness of the short period razavi and tolson 2013 as these circumstances may vary from catchment to catchment our recommendation is to perform a similar stress test e g our cdsst for any catchment in case of doubt finally our presented analysis could help to identify the optimal data set length to avoid over compensation of model errors however from a theoretical perspective one should rather aim to tackle the model structural error problem the inherent property of bayesian inference to converge to the true parameter value will become more meaningful when correctly specifying the model structure i e when admitting the type and amount of model structural error future research will reveal the impact of plausible error models on the sensitivity of modeling results to data choices in calibration and validation beyond crr modeling we believe that the presented systematic analysis is well suited to stress test any type of dynamic environmental system model in its respective modeling context investigating model performance and parameter identifiability in various distinct calibration and validation periods has the potential to reveal model structural deficits and may be highly valuable in many modeling applications such a stress test could answer three crucial questions 1 what is the importance of effects not covered by the model 2 how much overconfidence is present in the model and 3 what are case specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups we expect that answering these three questions will be valuable for directed model improvement and for constructing

manuscript was handled by peter k kitanidis editor in chief with the assistance of martin thullner associate editor groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed to give the best possible overview of the quality status and trend of aquifers from a limited number of measurement stations ideally the stations of the network should i allow the detection of significant changes in water quality either improvements due to successful mitigation measures or deteriorations caused for instance by land use change or other increasing pressure and ii approximate closely the true unknown mean concentration of the considered aquifer if these two features are met the monitoring network is representative of the entire aquifer in this article we present a method with which to assess and improve the representativeness of a regional groundwater monitoring network the method is designed specifically to optimize the selection of monitoring stations from a larger choice of fixed locations such as springs or existing observation wells using one contaminant for the optimisation procedure firstly the empirical distribution of selected solutes contaminants and age tracers is calculated from a large dataset consisting of as many sampling points as possible and compared to the distributions obtained solely from the stations of the existing or planned monitoring network if differences are large the network is modified by adding new stations or replacing some of them using one contaminant for the optimisation lastly the distribution of the optimised network is compared to the total distribution for other contaminants and one groundwater age tracer the use of the method is illustrated for the main aquifer of the country of luxembourg where it is shown that the representativeness of the current monitoring network can be improved by replacing two stations in the case study the optimisation was based on desethyl atrazine a ubiquitous pesticide transformation compound which was assumed to be an indicator of diffuse agricultural pollution although the largest improvement was obviously obtained for the optimised compound improvement was also observed for other contaminants including nitrate probably showing that at the regional scale the pattern of diffuse pollution of widely used agrochemicals is similar between compounds the temporal evolution of the major contaminants could also be reproduced by the optimised network even though the range of tritium values used as age tracer was narrower for the modified network than for the original network thus indicating some bias towards faster reaction times 1 introduction in the last decades the need to monitor the impacts of human activities on groundwater quality has gradually become recognised by environmental agencies and regulators consequently various national and regional groundwater quality monitoring networks have been set up to i give an overview of the spatial extent and the temporal evolution of point source and diffuse pollution and ii provide background data used to set up and implement programs of measure aiming at reducing pollution impact on society and the environment cis 2007 jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 morgenstern and daughney 2012 according to daughney et al 2012 the aims of a regional or national ground water monitoring network can be to 1 give an overview of water quality at the appropriate scale catchment aquifer or administrative boundaries at regional or national scale 2 recognise trends as early as possible 3 relate observed pollution patterns to land use to determine the probable sources 4 guide and accompany the design and implementation of programs of measures by providing appropriate data the european water framework directive wfd for instance prescribes the classification of management units called groundwater bodies into good and bad status using representative stations in the first phase of the management plan ending in 2009 stations had to be identified so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of groundwater chemical status and to provide representative monitoring data ec 2006 among the steps planned for the second phase ending in 2015 was an analysis of the representativeness of the initial monitoring network potentially leading to its revision many modern groundwater monitoring networks such as those of the wfd historically originate from older networks which were developed in different technical and political contexts and for different purposes belonged to national regional or local programmes and were not necessarily originally designed to monitor water quality for a list of papers describing national monitoring programmes see jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 merging older networks has often resulted in the need to streamline rationalize and modify their composition while maintaining some degree of continuity in order in particular to continue extending time series reaching back years to decades consequently methods with which to assess the suitability of such networks to monitor water quality i e their representativeness can be useful to water managers the literature on the design the optimisation and the revision of ground water monitoring networks has grown significantly over the last thirty years daughney et al 2012 gangopadhyay et al 2001 loaiciga 1989 loaiciga et al 1992 mogheir et al 2006 nowak et al 2012 as summarized in daughney et al 2012 the different methods span a continuum going from purely data based bender et al 2001 to purely process based blending different statistical and mathematical approaches with hydraulic hydrologic and gis based modelling loaiciga et al 1992 mathematical tools used include geostatistical techniques loaiciga 1989 principal components and cluster analysis daughney et al 2012 gangopadhyay et al 2001 entropy mogheir et al 2006 or bayesian nowak et al 2012 optimization methods and the use of groundwater flow models wöhling et al 2016 at the level of the european union a number of guidance documents for the so called common implementation strategy cis have been published on the topic of chemical status assessment and trend monitoring for groundwater bodies cis 2007 2009 grath et al 2001 the aim of the different methods is to find an optimal sampling program under consideration of resources constraints loaiciga 1989 thus reducing redundant information to a minimum mogheir et al 2006 the number of sampling sites their location and sampling frequency can all be the object of the optimisation procedure most studies however focus on the choice of optimal position to install observation wells whereas the design of a monitoring network for a priori given locations such as natural groundwater outlets springs diffuse seepage faces or headwater streams has received much less attention bender et al 2001 additionally most investigations rely on classical parameters such as electric conductivity or major ion chemistry to assess the representativeness of monitoring networks only few articles integrate directly the information content carried by micropollutants such as pesticides and their degradation products jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 lastly the importance of groundwater reaction times for the analysis of groundwater pollutant concentration although highly relevant for early warning and trend assessment has rarely been explicitly integrated in the design of monitoring networks broers and van der grift 2004 morgenstern and daughney 2012 the aim of the study presented in this article was to develop a methodology addressing these three points specifically fixed sampling locations use of available micropollutant information and integration of groundwater reaction time during the design or the evaluation of a groundwater monitoring network the method was developed for the following particular case the sampling points are to be chosen from given and already existing groundwater outlets springs or existing wells the hydrogeological setting must be simple single geological unit with clear upper and lower boundaries and negligible surface water infiltration the sampling frequency is supposed to be adequate only the spatial configuration and the number of the sampling sites is optimized 2 method 2 1 formulation of the optimisation problem the method is based on the law of large numbers which states that for a random process the arithmetic average of a series of independent realisations will converge asymptotically towards the true mean applied to the design of a representative monitoring network each sampling location can be considered to be one independent realisation and consequently as the number of locations increases the average of a pollutant of interest will tend towards the true central value mean or median of that pollutant for the aquifer until that value is reached when the aquifer has been hypothetically sampled everywhere spatial variables can be considered independent if the distance between sites is larger than the correlation length this length can be estimated for instance by using geostatistical methods as the distance where the semivariance reaches a plateau kitanidis 1997 not only the central value but the entire distribution quartiles standard deviation will stabilise and converge asymptotically towards its true empirical shape thus we define maximum representativeness of a given monitoring network as the closest possible approximation of that ideal distribution conditional on a given number of stations the method follows a two stage approach similar to that presented in daughney et al 2012 firstly a large sampling campaign yields an estimate of the empirical distribution of one or more target parameters which is the benchmark distribution secondly a subset closely approximating this benchmark is selected for the monitoring network we note that if the number of stations of the monitoring network is small as is the case here with eleven sites the sample size may be too limited for many statistical tests such as testing for normality or significant differences between groups helsel and hirsch 1991 while it is extremely important to keep potential sample size problems in mind this does not need to concern us here as we only calculate percentiles for the optimisation procedure without further statistical analysis formally the problem is a combination without repetition selecting k stations from e possible locations numbered 1 to e the number of possible combinations the cardinality is 1 p k e e k m with e number of potential sampling sites k number of stations of the operational monitoring network the combination vectors are written 2 p k e a i a 1 a 2 a k 1 a 1 a 2 a k e 1 i m each sampling point is characterised by a concentration for each contaminant of interest the vector of concentration c for a given contaminant is 3 c c 1 c 2 c e subset

calculate the objective function i e the median was preferred over the mean as measure of the central tendency while data spread and asymmetry estimates were based on the percentiles instead of using parametric quantities such as the standard deviation and the coefficient of skewness for the optimisation we calculate the sum of absolute differences between computed and observed percentiles and

called censored values by an arbitrary number half the limit of quantification for instance is liable to introduce a systematic and artificial bias helsel 2012 specific techniques have been developed to estimate summary statistics and percentiles of datasets containing censored values and are summarised in helsel 2012 for the optimisation we computed the percentage of values below the limit of quantification l q which was added to the objective function eq 5 while the percentiles of the boxplots used for visualisation were computed using the regression on order statistics ros method from the r package nada lee 2010 2 2 groundwater reaction time the purpose of monitoring networks is not only to assess the chemical status of the groundwater body at a given time but also to follow trends in that status over time and relate them to land use or land management changes since a delayed response of groundwater bodies by weeks months or even years can be expected given the typical groundwater flow rates an efficient monitoring network should allow a timely recognition of any improvement or deterioration in water quality implying stations should be placed close to the pollution sources but must also capture the rate of change of such improvement or deterioration at the scale of the groundwater body i e stations should also cover the range of groundwater transit times from the pollutant sources to the outlet with some stations close to the sources and others closer to the outlet solute mean reaction times are typically estimated from the measurement of environmental tracer such as tritium using lumped parameter models farlin et al 2013 maloszewski et al 2002 maloszewski and zuber 1982 in the case of springs groundwater converges from the entire recharge area to the outlet hence since flow paths of different lengths and consequently different transit time contribute to total discharge at any given time tracer concentration measured in spring water the output will be a mixture of solute recharged at different points in time and space the input this can be formalised as follows maloszewski and zuber 1982 6 c out t t c in τ g t τ e x p λ t τ d τ where cout tracer concentration in spring water cin tracer concentration in recharge water g transit time distribution λ decay constant for radioactive tracers τ entrance time of the tracer t exit time of the tracer t τ transit time the mean transit time of tracer through the system is often used as a measure for its reactivity and is calculated from the transit time distribution g 7 t t 0 τ g d τ where tt mean transit time t different functions can be used for g each having one or more free parameter that must be estimated using the measured tracer input and output amin and campana 1996 etcheverry 2001 maloszewski and zuber 1982 the unambiguous parameterisation of g is only possible in the special case of a radioisotope with a constant cin and a single fitting parameter for an exponential distribution of transit time for instance maloszewski and zuber 1982 obtained the following relationship 8 c out t c in 1 λ t t an additional fitting parameter is the ratio of summer to winter contribution to the annual tritium input since not all rainfall tritium necessarily reaches the groundwater as demonstrated by grabczak et al 1984 this ratio can be estimated using stable isotope measurements if they are available in the opposite case the ratio is an additional free parameter hence even in simple situations multiple solutions could be obtained for g in the case of a time variable tracer input and more than one free parameter ambiguity i e the number of equally good model fits obtained for different combinations of the fitting parameters can be reduced by using repeated tracer measurements over time stewart et al 2010 2012 the dating of modern groundwater using tritium is a case in point because the thermonuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s have released over a short period of time large quantities of tritium in the atmosphere thus labelling rainwater recharge water and groundwater the tail of this so called tritium peak is still measurable in many aquifers of the northern hemisphere stewart et al 2012 where tritium activities continuously decline over time for a given sampling location as bomb tritium decays and is flushed out corrected for radioactive decay the rate of decrease of tritium depends on the mean transit time of the aquifer the longer the mean transit time and the higher the measured tritium activity at a given date all else equal thus if only one tritium measurement is available a relative ranking of mean transit times can be obtained using this inverse relationship between tritium activity and mean transit time orban et al 2010 in that case however it is important to bear in mind that such a simple ranking is only a rough approximation because it only strictly applies for transit time distribution functions described by a single parameter and for a given ratio of summer to winter contribution to the tritium input note that solutes undergoing sorption processes in the subsurface will additionally be retarded compared to tritium and will thus display longer mean transit times 2 3 case study as natural groundwater emergences springs have two advantages over monitoring wells they are i easy to sample and ii integrate the response to contamination from their entire recharge area and are thus particularly useful to monitor near surface and free draining aquifers bender et al 2001 the optimisation method was applied to one groundwater body of the country of luxembourg two datasets were available the most exhaustive dataset 1 covers 204 springs and wells sampled in 2007 a smaller dataset dataset 2 consists of 54 springs and wells sampled twice in 2012 all of which had already been sampled in 2007 since the study focused on the long term contamination of groundwater by agrochemicals sampling was performed under base flow conditions so that rainfall events would influence as little as possible either discharge or solute concentrations sampling was split over two campaigns one in late spring and the other in fall to be able to check for variability both in discharge and solute concentration both in 2007 and 2012 the first tour took place from late spring to early summer whereas the second tour started in the late summer and lasted until the beginning of december each spring was sampled twice during each tour in 2007 i e four times in total over the year but only once in 2012 for logistical reasons the second dataset albeit smaller in size included tritium and metolachlor esa mesa measurements which had both not been measured in 2007 metolachlor esa is a transformation product of s metolachlor a corn herbicide increasingly used in luxembourg after atrazine was banned in 2005 as it is both mobile and persistent it can contaminate groundwater in concentrations exceeding drinking water limits farlin et al 2018 both datasets covered all the stations of the water framework directive wfd monitoring network for the groundwater body 11 stations in total and are spread out over the entire unconfined part of the aquifer in that regard it is important to note that the stations of the original wfd groundwater monitoring network were chosen from a limited number of sites already sampled at the time of its design in 2005 hence the initial selection was made based on subjective criteria rather than on consideration as to the actual representativeness of the overall network and tended to favour sites with either long measurement records or those thought to present above average agricultural contamination the study was conducted during the revision of the first wfd management plan for luxembourg 2009 2015 in order to assess the representativeness of the existing monitoring network additionally the ability of the monitoring network to capture changes in groundwater quality could be assessed by comparing the distributions of the 2007 and 2012 sampling campaigns the aquifer is a fractured calcareous sandstone known as the luxembourg sandstone it is the main aquifer of the country covering about a third of its drinking water demand in its unconfined part covering an area of approximately 600 km2 the formations outcrops as a series of cuestas where numerous contact springs mark the transition to the underlying marly aquiclude most springs are used as drinking water supply by the neighbouring communities and also provide natural sampling locations as discussed by farlin and maloszewski 2013 the aquifer can be considered as an equivalent porous medium at the scale of spring recharge areas with negligible fast flow contribution to total discharge farlin et al 2018 using available time series starting in 2008 the same authors have estimated tritium mean transit time of 9 to 17 years farlin et al 2017 a large part of the surface area of the aquifer being occupied by cropland the springs and wells are frequently polluted with pesticides or fertilisers used in intensive farming urban areas occupy less than 10 of the total surface area in most spring recharge areas apart from nitrate the two compounds detected most often in the springs and wells sampled in 2007 dataset 1 were desethyl atrazine dea a degradation product of atrazine detection in 58 of the sampled springs and wells atrazine detection in 53 of the sampled springs and wells measured solute concentrations were relatively stable between sampling campaign in a given year for instance the mean standard deviation for dea across all sites was 14 in 2007 and 9 in 2012 thus mean annual concentrations for all solutes were calculated for each sampling site using the average from all measurements 3 for 2012 and 4 for 2007 the pre and post emergence herbicide atrazine has been widely used in corn fields in luxembourg for decades until a nationwide ban in 2005 due to the transit time of the compounds through the soil and the unsaturated zone the concentration of both parent compound and its transformation product dea still had not begun to decrease in a series of springs draining the aquifer and sampled either weekly or monthly between 2008 and 2009 3 to 4 years after the use of atrazine was forbidden farlin et al 2013 consequently the atrazine and dea concentrations measured in 2007 probably come close to the maximum values reached at each site before the onset of the decrease following the 2005 ban corn is the major crop grown in luxembourg occupying on average 20 of the total agricultural surface for the period 2000 2013 with a gradual increase of 25 from 10799 ha in 2000 to 13498 ha in 2013 ser 2013 since usual rotations include two to three crops the area on which corn is grown at least once every three years could reach 50 and more of the total agricultural surface which probably explains the ubiquitous presence of both atrazine and dea in groundwater consequently dea was selected as indicator for steady state agricultural pollution because it was the most frequently measured micropollutant and its parent compound atrazine had been applied widely for decades in the country s corn fields nitrate was also considered as indicator of steady state agricultural pollution but dea was preferred for the optimisation since the application pattern of atrazine based herbicides was supposed to be more homogeneous in space and its leaching less dynamic than in the case of nitrogen fertilisers mesa was additionally selected as indicator of emerging pollution metolachlor esa concentrations exceeding the drinking water standard of 100 ng l had begun to be reported before the beginning of the second sampling campaign of 2012 this gave the opportunity to see whether this emerging pollution was correctly captured by the existing monitoring network mesa might have been present in groundwater in 2007 already but was not measured at the time for lack of an appropriate analytical method 3 results 3 1 pesticide contamination the empirical variograms for dea and nitrate were calculated using the r package gstat pebesma 2004 the correlation length was respectively 2 km for dea and 1 1 km for nitrate the value of the semivariance at the smallest distance was already a third and half of its plateau value respectively for dea and nitrate thus showing a large unexplained spatial variability between sites about 40 sampled springs lie at a distance smaller than 2 km from each other but given that i there are clear differences in contaminant concentration also within these groups ii they represent only 20 of the samples for the larger dataset and iii between a third and half of the calculated variance cannot be explained by the spatial distribution of the sites we retained the hypothesis of independence and did not try to correct for the observed spatial correlation fig 2 shows from left to right the empirical distribution of dataset 1 the subset from dataset 1 containing only the stations present in dataset 2 the subset from dataset 1 containing only the wfd stations dataset 2 the subset from dataset 2 containing only the wfd stations the bulk of the dea contamination is overestimated by the actual monitoring network for both sampling campaigns the quartiles and the median are shifted by 10 15 ng l for dataset 1 and by 5 ng l for dataset 2 the extremes on the other hand are underestimated by 10 20 ng l it is also important to note that when only the subset of 54 springs sampled both in 2007 and 2012 are used to subset dataset 1 the dea distribution is similarly shifted to higher values although being much closer to the benchmark distribution entire dataset 1 or 2 than the subset consisting only of the wfd stations about 5 ng l this shows that the number of sites covered by dataset 2 has not reached a sufficient size for the dea distribution to have converged assuming this is the case for the 204 sites of dataset 1 the same general overestimation holds for mesa fig 3 quartiles and median are higher for the wfd network while maximum concentrations are underestimated in the wfd a groundwater body is considered in bad chemical status if at least a third of the stations of the monitoring network show contaminant concentration higher than 75 of their respective water quality threshold i e 37 5 mg l for nitrate and 75 ng l for pesticides and relevant transformation products ec 2006 according to that classification system mesa causes the groundwater body to be declared bad if only the wfd stations are used for the assessment while using the complete dataset leads to the opposite conclusion finally for nitrate the interquartile range and the median are overestimated by 10 mg l for dataset 1 while extremes are slightly underestimated by 5 mg l fig 4 in the case of dataset 2 the median is overestimated for the wfd stations while the interquartile range is narrower than for the entire dataset to conclude the wfd network overestimates both quartiles and median values for the three selected contaminants and underestimates extreme values in the case of mesa the magnitude of the overestimation is sufficient to lead to an erroneous classification of the groundwater body s chemical status as bad which shows that the optimisation of the network has practical implications 3 2 optimisation results after this exploratory phase the wfd network was optimised using the distribution of dea concentration as target three modifications were examined adding either one or two stations option 1 and option 2 or replacing two stations from the network option 3 a more complete reorganisation of the wfd network was not possible in that particular case both for logistical and financial reasons for each of these three options the sum of absolute differences between the percentiles of the entire dataset s distribution and those of the subset was calculated for all possible station combinations drawing only from the 54 sites sampled both in 2007 and 2012 and using the mean concentrations for each site calculated from dataset 1 once an optimal selection was obtained the nitrate distribution was computed for these stations using dataset 1 while tritium and mesa distributions were calculated from dataset 2 the same two sites were selected in option 2 and 3 see fig 1 one disadvantage of the optimised network is that the western part of the aquifer would not be covered by a station anymore option 3 which consisted in replacing two stations of the network wfd 2 yielded the closest fit to the target distribution for dea fig 5 the interquartile range in particular could be matched nearly perfectly whereas the median was still overestimated for dea 23 ng l instead of 12 ng l and compared to a wfd original estimate of 30 ng l and the maximum concentration slightly underestimated the optimum station selection for dea also led to an interquartile range of the nitrate distribution closer to the distribution of dataset 1 with a median for the modified wfd network still higher than the one calculated from the entire dataset similarly the overestimation of the mesa concentrations both for the interquartile range and for the median could be reduced this in particular lead to a reclassification of the groundwater body as good concerning mesa see remark in the pesticide contamination section finally the tritium distribution proved relatively insensitive to changes in the station combination of all three best solutions for option 1 2 and 3 the median of the wfd 2 was the closest to the target median while the interquartile range was virtually the same for all alternatives the range of extreme values however was narrowest for option 3 5 1 7 9 tritium units tu instead of 4 2 8 2 tu the difference in the lowest values is slightly larger than the standard deviation of tritium measurement ranging between 0 15 and 0 7 tu and hence probably significant the magnitude of this bias cannot be estimated robustly with the available data but to give an idea using the exponential model for the transit time distribution function with a low summer recharge contribution yields a mean transit time of 5 and 13 years for tritium activities of 4 2 and 5 1 tu respectively thus given the approximate inverse relationship between tritium activity in groundwater and mean residence time this bias towards higher tritium values in the optimised wfd network means that the less reactive sites are given less weight compared to the complete dataset of 54 stations it must be kept in mind however that the 54 sites of dataset 2 are still biased towards higher dea concentrations compared to dataset 1 see fig 2 and that a similar bias might also affect the tritium distribution 3 3 temporal evolution the availability of a second sampling campaign in 2012 five years after the initial large scale campaign of 2007 allowed to i study changes in the dea distribution over time for the 54 stations sampled in both years and ii assess how the optimised network fared at capturing trends if any fig 6 using the stations of dataset 2 only it appears that the entire distribution has unsurprisingly shifted to lower values between 2007 and 2012 the 90th percentile by 45 ng l the upper quartile by 10 ng l and the median and lower quartile by 3 ng l the overall direction and magnitude of change is reproduced by the optimised monitoring network decrease of the 90th percentile by 50 ng l of the upper quartile by 5 ng l of the median by 10 ng l and an unchanged lower quartile concentration 4 discussion the design of groundwater monitoring networks ensuring maximum representativeness is an important issue both for assessments of water quality status and water quality trend how to assess representativeness however varies widely stigter et al 2011 for instance suggest representativeness can be assessed using the estimation error of kriging interpolation while at the european level representativeness is evaluated from the distance between stations using a so called representativeness index grath et al 2001 this index normalized to a hundred percent and calculated from the mean distance between monitoring stations and the surface area of the subsurface catchment decreases as the mean distance between stations increases for a given number of stations and a constant surface area a minimum of 80 is suggested to ensure good representativeness besides problems with the arbitrary nature of that cutoff value or with the dependency of the numerical value of the index on the shape of the monitoring region dabrowska et al 2016 this type of a priori methodology does not take into account the available information on water quality within the groundwater body a different a posteriori approach is proposed here based on the prerequisite of the availability of a dataset covering a number of measurements locations larger than the final number of monitoring stations thus the method requires performing one large sampling campaign this campaign then yields an instantaneous distribution of contaminant concentrations for the aquifer of interest although the initial sampling effort is large it must be consented to only once before reducing the regular sampling to the stations of the monitoring network we wish to point out that this type of instantaneous sampling does not imply that the obtained pattern of contaminants changes continuously rendering the entire procedure rapidly obsolete on the contrary we have seen that the modified network optimised using the 2007 sampling campaign could also reproduce the trend in dea and nitrate concentrations observed between 2007 and 2012 although possibly incidental this good performance could very well be due to the robustness of the method aquifers typically display significant inertia due to the large volumes of groundwater in storage and the long transit times of both water and solutes compared to human induced changes in the recharge areas external changes in the input regime will modify the contaminant pattern of any measurement network but unless changes are dramatic and rapid the rate of change will be in the order of years to decades furthermore provided event water is negligible in total spring discharge i e only groundwater is sampled and given the contaminant was leached from the soil for a sufficiently long period of time the integrative nature of spring water means that measured contaminant concentrations is a weighted average of applications over the entire recharge area reaching back years to decades this is why the optimization was based on desethyl atrazine because its concentration had reached a peak by the time of sampling due to repeated atrazine applications over the previous decades farlin et al 2013 the transit time of the different monitoring stations was not quantified because a single tritium measurement does not allow a unique parameterisation of the transit time distribution function instead we used a simple ranking of measured tritium concentrations under the assumption that the higher the tritium value the longer the mean transit time this assumption is only strictly valid for a uniform recharge dynamic and if the transit time distribution can be characterised by a single parameter this hypothesis is in our view preferable to a badly constrained mean transit time estimation obtained from eq 6 the interquartile range of the tritium distribution was not very sensitive to changes in the combinations of monitoring stations the minimum tritium activities were overestimated by 0 9 tu 5 1 instead of 4 2 tu by the modified network which means that the average rate of change of the monitoring network will probably be biased high compared to the overall rate of change of concentrations in the groundwater i e the rate of decrease or increase estimated from the stations of the network will be faster than in reality the magnitude of the bias cannot be quantified because the free parameters of the inverse parameter estimation using eq 6 cannot be constrained simultaneously using a single tritium measurement additional isotope measurements in the coming years will allow addressing this limitation as the analysis of the temporal evolution of dea showed however the optimised network still seems to be able to capture trends and rates of change correctly at least for the five years interval between both sampling campaigns the temporal bias might however become manifest over a longer time span a decade or more as the median dea concentration calculated from the stations of the monitoring network increasingly deviate from the groundwater concentration calculated from the larger dataset however robust the method may be significant changes in land use such as the rapid urbanisation of a predominantly rural area will potentially affect the representativeness of groundwater monitoring network designed under a given land use distribution thus performing one large sampling at intervals of maybe a decade although to our knowledge not recommended by regulators or commonly implemented by water agencies would be useful to monitor the effect of land use changes on the effectiveness of the existing monitoring network and possibly to modify the network accordingly additional benefits of such periodic large scale sampling campaigns would be to assess trends from a larger dataset while providing water agencies with an updated overview of contaminant concentration than the one obtained from the limited number of stations of regular monitoring networks the purpose of the equations we propose here is to formalize the intuitive idea that increasing the number of sampling sites assumed to be independent because the distance between sites is larger than the correlation length must lead to a closer representation of the pollutant pressure in a given groundwater body the method can be used to update a monitoring network if new emerging contaminants become of interest or new sites accessible for sampling it also provides a clear roadmap to water managers concerning the integration of prior information in the evaluation and optimisation process although the initial sampling effort is substantial the dataset gained provides an invaluable empirical basis for the design or the testing of a parsimonious monitoring network which once implemented should give a reliable overview of the groundwater quality status to summarise we suggest the following guidelines when evaluating an existing monitoring network or when creating a new one perform one large sampling campaign over a short period of time if possible repeated once over two different seasons of the same year to check for repeatability and potential seasonal effects at the most reactive groundwater outlets select one contaminant as tracer for steady state agricultural pollution using criteria such as long application history and frequent use in major crops and perform the optimisation described above compare the distribution of the entire dataset and the subset consisting of the selected stations for other contaminants and possibly for a groundwater age tracer as well if the estimated distributions are also close for these additional solutes adopt the network otherwise select another contaminant and redo the optimisation additionally to the regular sampling of the monitoring network usually four times a year for groundwater sampling sites one large scale sampling every decade or after significant land use changes have occurred or if a new contaminant becomes of interest will provide an updated overview of the chemical status of the aquifer and give the opportunity to re evaluate the monitoring network s performance conflict of interest none acknowledgements this study was funded by the luxembourgish water

manuscript was handled by peter k kitanidis editor in chief with the assistance of martin thullner associate editor groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed to give the best possible overview of the quality status and trend of aquifers from a limited number of measurement stations ideally the stations of the network should i allow the detection of significant changes in water quality either improvements due to successful mitigation measures or deteriorations caused for instance by land use change or other increasing pressure and ii approximate closely the true unknown mean concentration of the considered aquifer if these two features are met the monitoring network is representative of the entire aquifer in this article we present a method with which to assess and improve the representativeness of a regional groundwater monitoring network the method is designed specifically to optimize the selection of monitoring stations from a larger choice of fixed locations such as springs or existing observation wells using one contaminant for the optimisation procedure firstly the empirical distribution of selected solutes contaminants and age tracers is calculated from a large dataset consisting of as many sampling points as possible and compared to the distributions obtained solely from the stations of the existing or planned monitoring network if differences are large the network is modified by adding new stations or replacing some of them using one contaminant for the optimisation lastly the distribution of the optimised network is compared to the total distribution for other contaminants and one groundwater age tracer the use of the method is illustrated for the main aquifer of the country of luxembourg where it is shown that the representativeness of the current monitoring network can be improved by replacing two stations in the case study the optimisation was based on desethyl atrazine a ubiquitous pesticide transformation compound which was assumed to be an indicator of diffuse agricultural pollution although the largest improvement was obviously obtained for the optimised compound improvement was also observed for other contaminants including nitrate probably showing that at the regional scale the pattern of diffuse pollution of widely used agrochemicals is similar between compounds the temporal evolution of the major contaminants could also be reproduced by the optimised network even though the range of tritium values used as age tracer was narrower for the modified network than for the original network thus indicating some bias towards faster reaction times 1 introduction in the last decades the need to monitor the impacts of human activities on groundwater quality has gradually become recognised by environmental agencies and regulators consequently various national and regional groundwater quality monitoring networks have been set up to i give an overview of the spatial extent and the temporal evolution of point source and diffuse pollution and ii provide background data used to set up and implement programs of measure aiming at reducing pollution impact on society and the environment cis 2007 jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 morgenstern and daughney 2012 according to daughney et al 2012 the aims of a regional or national ground water monitoring network can be to 1 give an overview of water quality at the appropriate scale catchment aquifer or administrative boundaries at regional or national scale 2 recognise trends as early as possible 3 relate observed pollution patterns to land use to determine the probable sources 4 guide and accompany the design and implementation of programs of measures by providing appropriate data the european water framework directive wfd for instance prescribes the classification of management units called groundwater bodies into good and bad status using representative stations in the first phase of the management plan ending in 2009 stations had to be identified so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of groundwater chemical status and to provide representative monitoring data ec 2006 among the steps planned for the second phase ending in 2015 was an analysis of the representativeness of the initial monitoring network potentially leading to its revision many modern groundwater monitoring networks such as those of the wfd historically originate from older networks which were developed in different technical and political contexts and for different purposes belonged to national regional or local programmes and were not necessarily originally designed to monitor water quality for a list of papers describing national monitoring programmes see jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 merging older networks has often resulted in the need to streamline rationalize and modify their composition while maintaining some degree of continuity in order in particular to continue extending time series reaching back years to decades consequently methods with which to assess the suitability of such networks to monitor water quality i e their representativeness can be useful to water managers the literature on the design the optimisation and the revision of ground water monitoring networks has grown significantly over the last thirty years daughney et al 2012 gangopadhyay et al 2001 loaiciga 1989 loaiciga et al 1992 mogheir et al 2006 nowak et al 2012 as summarized in daughney et al 2012 the different methods span a continuum going from purely data based bender et al 2001 to purely process based blending

constraints loaiciga 1989 thus reducing redundant information to a minimum mogheir et al 2006 the number of sampling sites their location and sampling frequency can all be the object of the optimisation procedure most studies however focus on the choice of optimal position to install observation wells whereas the design of a monitoring network for a priori given locations such as natural groundwater outlets springs diffuse seepage faces or headwater streams has received much less attention bender et al 2001 additionally most investigations rely on classical parameters such as electric conductivity or major ion chemistry to assess the representativeness of monitoring networks only few articles integrate directly the information content carried by micropollutants such as pesticides and their degradation products jorgensen and stockmarr 2008 lastly the importance of groundwater reaction times for the analysis of groundwater pollutant concentration although highly relevant for early warning and trend assessment has rarely been explicitly integrated in the design of monitoring networks broers and van der grift 2004 morgenstern and daughney 2012 the aim of the study presented in this article was to develop a methodology addressing these three points specifically fixed sampling locations use of available micropollutant information and integration of groundwater reaction time during the design or the evaluation of a groundwater monitoring network the method was developed for the following particular case the sampling points are to be chosen from given and already existing groundwater outlets springs or existing wells the hydrogeological setting must be simple single geological unit with clear upper and lower boundaries and negligible surface water infiltration the sampling frequency is supposed to be adequate only the spatial configuration and the number of the sampling sites is optimized 2 method 2 1 formulation of the optimisation problem the method is based on the law of large numbers which states that for a random process the arithmetic average of a series of independent realisations will converge asymptotically towards the true mean applied to the design of a representative monitoring network each sampling location can be considered to be one independent realisation and consequently as the number of locations increases the average of a pollutant of interest will tend towards the true central value mean or median of that pollutant for the aquifer until that value is reached when the aquifer has been hypothetically sampled everywhere spatial variables can be considered independent if the distance between sites is larger than the correlation length this length can be estimated for instance by using geostatistical methods as the distance where the semivariance reaches a plateau kitanidis 1997 not only the central value but the entire distribution quartiles standard deviation will stabilise and converge asymptotically towards its true empirical shape thus we define maximum representativeness of a given monitoring network as the closest possible approximation of that ideal distribution conditional on a given number of stations the method follows a two stage approach similar to that presented in daughney et al 2012 firstly a large sampling campaign yields an estimate of the empirical distribution of one or more target parameters which is the benchmark distribution secondly a subset closely approximating this benchmark is selected for the monitoring network we note that if the number of stations of the monitoring network is small as is the case here with eleven sites the sample size may be too limited for many statistical tests such as testing for normality or significant differences between groups helsel and hirsch 1991 while it is extremely important to keep potential sample size problems in mind this does not need to concern us here as we only calculate percentiles for the optimisation procedure without further statistical analysis formally the problem is a combination without repetition selecting k stations from e possible locations numbered 1 to e the number of possible combinations the cardinality is 1 p k e e k m with e number of potential sampling sites k number of stations of the operational monitoring network the combination vectors are written 2 p k e a i a 1 a

called censored values by an arbitrary number half the limit of quantification for instance is liable to introduce a systematic and artificial bias helsel 2012 specific techniques have been developed to estimate summary statistics and percentiles of datasets containing censored values and are summarised in helsel 2012 for the optimisation we computed the percentage of values below the limit of quantification l q which was added to the objective function eq 5 while the percentiles of the boxplots used for visualisation were computed using the regression on order statistics ros method from the r package nada lee 2010 2 2 groundwater reaction time the purpose of monitoring networks is not only to assess the chemical status of the groundwater body at a given time but also to follow trends in that status over time and relate them to land use or land management changes since a delayed response of groundwater bodies by weeks months or even years can be expected given the typical groundwater flow rates an efficient monitoring network should allow a timely recognition of any improvement or deterioration in water quality implying stations should be placed close to the pollution sources but must also capture the rate of change of such improvement or deterioration at the scale of the groundwater body i e stations should also cover the range of groundwater transit times from the pollutant sources to the outlet with some stations close to the sources and others closer to the outlet solute mean reaction times are typically estimated from the measurement of environmental tracer such as tritium using lumped parameter models farlin et al 2013 maloszewski et al 2002 maloszewski and zuber 1982 in the case of springs groundwater converges from the entire recharge area to the outlet hence since flow paths of different lengths and consequently different transit time contribute to total discharge at any given time tracer concentration measured in spring water the output will be a mixture of solute recharged at different points in time and space the input this can be formalised as follows maloszewski and zuber 1982 6 c out t t c in τ g t τ e x p λ t τ d τ where cout tracer concentration in spring water cin tracer concentration in recharge water g transit time distribution λ decay constant for radioactive tracers τ entrance time of the tracer t exit time of the tracer t τ transit time the mean transit time of tracer through the system is often used as a measure for its reactivity and is calculated from the transit time distribution g 7 t t 0 τ g d τ where tt mean transit time t different functions can be used for g each having one or more free parameter that must be estimated using the measured tracer input and output amin and campana 1996 etcheverry 2001 maloszewski and zuber 1982 the unambiguous parameterisation of g is only possible in the special case of a radioisotope with a constant cin and a single fitting parameter for an exponential distribution of transit time for instance maloszewski and zuber 1982 obtained the following relationship 8 c out t c in 1 λ t t an additional fitting parameter is the ratio of summer to winter contribution to the annual tritium input since not all rainfall tritium necessarily reaches the groundwater as demonstrated by grabczak et al 1984 this ratio can be estimated using stable isotope measurements if they are available in the opposite case the ratio is an additional free parameter hence even in simple situations multiple solutions could be obtained for g in the case of a time variable tracer input and more than one free parameter ambiguity i e the number of equally good model fits obtained for different combinations of the fitting parameters can be reduced by using repeated tracer measurements over time stewart et al 2010 2012 the dating of modern groundwater using tritium is a case in point because the thermonuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s have released over a short period of time large quantities of tritium in the atmosphere thus labelling rainwater recharge water and groundwater the tail of this so called tritium peak is still measurable in many aquifers of the northern hemisphere stewart et al 2012 where tritium activities continuously decline over time for a given sampling location as bomb tritium decays and is flushed out corrected for radioactive decay the rate of decrease of tritium depends on the mean transit time of the aquifer the longer the mean transit time and the higher the measured tritium activity at a given date all else equal thus if only one tritium measurement is available a relative ranking of mean transit times can be obtained using this inverse relationship between tritium activity and mean transit time orban et al 2010 in that case however it is important to bear in mind that such a simple ranking is only a rough approximation because it only strictly applies for transit time distribution functions described by a single parameter and for a given ratio of summer to winter contribution to the tritium input note that solutes undergoing sorption processes in the subsurface will additionally be retarded compared to tritium and will thus display longer mean transit times 2 3 case study as natural groundwater emergences springs have two advantages over monitoring wells they are i easy to sample and ii integrate the response to contamination from their entire recharge area and are thus particularly useful to monitor near surface and free draining aquifers bender et al 2001 the optimisation method was applied to one groundwater body of the country of luxembourg two datasets were available the most exhaustive dataset 1 covers 204 springs and wells sampled in 2007 a smaller dataset dataset 2 consists of 54 springs and wells sampled twice in 2012 all of which had already been sampled in 2007 since the study focused on the long term contamination of groundwater by agrochemicals sampling was performed under base flow conditions so that rainfall events would influence as little as possible either discharge or solute concentrations sampling was split over two campaigns one in late spring and the other in fall to be able to check for variability both in discharge and solute concentration both in 2007 and 2012 the first tour took place from late spring to early summer whereas the second tour started in the late summer and lasted until the beginning of december each spring was sampled twice during each tour in 2007 i e four times in total over the year but only once in 2012 for logistical reasons the second dataset albeit smaller in size included tritium and metolachlor esa mesa measurements which had both not been measured in 2007 metolachlor esa is a transformation product of s metolachlor a corn herbicide increasingly used in luxembourg after atrazine was banned in 2005 as it is both mobile and persistent it can contaminate groundwater in concentrations exceeding drinking water limits farlin et al 2018 both datasets covered all the stations of the water framework directive wfd monitoring network for the groundwater body 11 stations in total and are spread out over the entire unconfined part of the aquifer in that regard it is important to note that the stations of the original wfd groundwater monitoring network were chosen from a limited number of sites already sampled at the time of its design in 2005 hence the initial selection was made based on subjective criteria rather than on consideration as to the actual representativeness of the overall network and tended to favour sites with either long measurement records or those thought to present above average agricultural contamination the study was conducted during the revision of the first wfd management plan for luxembourg 2009 2015 in order to assess the representativeness of the existing monitoring network additionally the ability of the monitoring network to capture changes in groundwater quality could be assessed by comparing the distributions of the 2007 and 2012 sampling campaigns the aquifer is a fractured calcareous sandstone known as the luxembourg sandstone it is the main aquifer of the country covering about a third of its drinking water demand in its unconfined part covering an area of approximately 600 km2 the formations outcrops as a series of cuestas where numerous contact springs mark the transition to the underlying marly aquiclude most springs are used as drinking water supply by the neighbouring communities and also provide natural sampling locations as discussed by farlin and maloszewski 2013 the aquifer can be considered as an equivalent porous medium at the scale of spring recharge areas with negligible fast flow contribution to total discharge farlin et al 2018 using available time series starting in 2008 the same authors have estimated tritium mean transit time of 9 to 17 years farlin et al 2017 a large part of the surface area of the aquifer being occupied by cropland the springs and wells are frequently polluted with pesticides or fertilisers used in intensive farming urban areas occupy less than 10 of the total surface area in most spring recharge areas apart from nitrate the two compounds detected most often in the springs and wells sampled in 2007 dataset 1 were desethyl atrazine dea a degradation product of atrazine detection in 58 of the sampled springs and wells atrazine detection in 53 of the sampled springs and wells measured solute concentrations were relatively stable between sampling campaign in a given year for instance the mean standard deviation for dea across all sites was 14 in 2007 and 9 in 2012 thus mean annual concentrations for all solutes were calculated for each sampling site using the average from all measurements 3 for 2012 and 4 for 2007 the pre and post emergence herbicide atrazine has been widely used in corn fields in luxembourg for decades until a nationwide ban in 2005 due to the transit time of the compounds through the soil and the unsaturated zone the concentration of both parent compound and its transformation product dea still had not begun to decrease in a series of springs draining the aquifer and sampled either weekly or monthly between 2008 and 2009 3 to 4 years after the use of atrazine was forbidden farlin et al 2013 consequently the atrazine and dea concentrations measured in 2007 probably come close to the maximum values reached at each site before the onset of the decrease following the 2005 ban corn is the major crop grown in luxembourg occupying on average 20 of the total agricultural surface for the period 2000 2013 with a gradual increase of 25 from 10799 ha in 2000 to 13498 ha in 2013 ser 2013 since usual rotations include two to three crops the area on which corn is grown at least once every three years could reach 50 and more of the total agricultural surface which probably explains the ubiquitous presence of both atrazine and dea in groundwater consequently dea was selected as indicator for steady state agricultural pollution because it was the most frequently measured micropollutant and its parent compound atrazine had been applied widely for decades in the country s corn fields nitrate was also considered as indicator of steady state agricultural pollution but dea was preferred for the optimisation since the application pattern of atrazine based herbicides was supposed to be more homogeneous in space and its leaching less dynamic than in the case of nitrogen fertilisers mesa was additionally selected as indicator of emerging pollution metolachlor esa concentrations exceeding the drinking water standard of 100 ng l had begun to be reported before the beginning of the second sampling campaign of 2012 this gave the opportunity to see whether this emerging pollution was correctly captured by the existing monitoring network mesa might have been present in groundwater in 2007 already but was not measured at the time for lack of an appropriate analytical method 3 results 3 1 pesticide contamination the empirical variograms for dea and nitrate were calculated using the r package gstat pebesma 2004 the correlation length was respectively 2 km for dea and 1 1 km for nitrate the value of the semivariance at the smallest distance was already a third and half of its plateau value respectively for dea and nitrate thus showing a large unexplained spatial variability between sites about 40 sampled springs lie at a distance smaller than 2 km from each other but given that i there are clear differences in contaminant concentration also within these groups ii they represent only 20 of the samples for the larger dataset and iii between a third and half of the calculated variance cannot be explained by the spatial distribution of the sites we retained the hypothesis of independence and did not try to correct for the observed spatial correlation fig 2 shows from left to right the empirical distribution of dataset 1 the subset from dataset 1 containing only the stations present in dataset 2 the subset from dataset 1 containing only the wfd stations dataset 2 the subset from dataset 2 containing only the wfd stations the bulk of the dea contamination is overestimated by the actual monitoring network for both sampling campaigns the quartiles and the median are shifted by 10 15 ng l for dataset 1 and by 5 ng l for dataset 2 the extremes on the other hand are underestimated by 10 20 ng l it is also important to note that when only the subset of 54 springs sampled both in 2007 and 2012 are used to subset dataset 1 the dea distribution is similarly shifted to higher values although being much closer to the benchmark distribution entire dataset 1 or 2 than the subset consisting only of the wfd stations about 5 ng l this shows that the number of sites covered by dataset 2 has not reached a sufficient size for the dea distribution to have converged assuming this is the case for the 204 sites of dataset 1 the same general overestimation holds for mesa fig 3 quartiles and median are higher for the wfd network while maximum concentrations are underestimated in the wfd a groundwater body is considered in bad chemical status if at least a third of the stations of the monitoring network show contaminant concentration higher than 75 of their respective water quality threshold i e 37 5 mg l for nitrate and 75 ng l for pesticides and relevant transformation products ec 2006 according to that classification system mesa causes the groundwater body to be declared bad if only the wfd stations are used for the assessment while using the complete dataset leads to the opposite conclusion finally for nitrate the interquartile range and the median are overestimated by 10 mg l for dataset 1 while extremes are slightly underestimated by 5 mg l fig 4 in the case of dataset 2 the median is overestimated for the wfd stations while the interquartile range is narrower than for the entire dataset to conclude the wfd network overestimates both quartiles and median values for the three selected contaminants and underestimates extreme values in the case of mesa the magnitude of the overestimation is sufficient to lead to an erroneous classification of the groundwater body s chemical status as bad which shows that the optimisation of the network has practical implications 3 2 optimisation results after this exploratory phase the wfd network was optimised using the distribution of dea concentration as target three modifications were examined adding either one or two stations option 1 and option 2 or replacing two stations from the network option 3 a more complete reorganisation of the wfd network was not possible in that particular case both for logistical and financial reasons for each of these three options the sum of absolute differences between the percentiles of the entire dataset s distribution and those of the subset was calculated for all possible station combinations drawing only from the 54 sites sampled both in 2007 and 2012 and using the mean concentrations for each site calculated from dataset 1 once an optimal selection was obtained the nitrate distribution was computed for these stations using dataset 1 while tritium and mesa distributions were calculated from dataset 2 the same two sites were selected in option 2 and 3 see fig 1 one disadvantage of the optimised network is that the western part of the aquifer would not be covered by a station anymore option 3 which consisted in replacing two stations of the network wfd 2 yielded the closest fit to the target distribution for dea fig 5 the interquartile range in particular could be matched nearly perfectly whereas the median was still overestimated for dea 23 ng l instead of 12 ng l and compared to a wfd original estimate of 30 ng l and the maximum concentration slightly underestimated the optimum station selection for dea also led to an interquartile range of the nitrate distribution closer to the distribution of dataset 1 with a median for the modified wfd network still higher than the one calculated from the entire dataset similarly the overestimation of the mesa concentrations both for the interquartile range and for the median could be reduced this in particular lead to a reclassification of the groundwater body as good concerning mesa see remark in the pesticide contamination section finally the tritium distribution proved relatively insensitive to changes in the station combination of all three best solutions for option 1 2 and 3 the median of the wfd 2 was the closest to the target median while the interquartile range was virtually the same for all alternatives the range of extreme values however was narrowest for option 3 5 1 7 9 tritium units tu instead of 4 2 8 2 tu the difference in the lowest values is slightly larger than the standard deviation of tritium measurement ranging between 0 15 and 0 7 tu and hence probably significant the magnitude of this bias cannot be estimated robustly with the available data but to give an idea using the exponential model for the transit time distribution function with a low summer recharge contribution yields a mean transit time of 5 and 13 years for tritium activities of 4 2 and 5 1 tu respectively thus given the approximate inverse relationship between tritium activity in groundwater and mean residence time this bias towards higher tritium values in the optimised wfd network means that the less reactive sites are given less weight compared to the complete dataset of 54 stations it must be kept in mind however that the 54 sites of dataset 2 are still biased towards higher dea concentrations compared to dataset 1 see fig 2 and that a similar bias might also affect the tritium distribution 3 3 temporal evolution the availability of a second sampling campaign in 2012 five years after the initial large scale campaign of 2007 allowed to i study changes in the dea distribution over time for the 54 stations sampled in both years and ii assess how the optimised network fared at capturing trends if any fig 6 using the stations of dataset 2 only it appears that the entire distribution has unsurprisingly shifted to lower values between 2007 and 2012 the 90th percentile by 45 ng l the upper quartile by 10 ng l and the median and lower quartile by 3 ng l the overall direction and magnitude of change is reproduced by the optimised monitoring network decrease of the 90th percentile by 50 ng l of the upper quartile by 5 ng l of the median by 10 ng l and an unchanged lower quartile concentration 4 discussion the design of groundwater monitoring networks ensuring maximum representativeness is an important issue both for assessments of water quality status and water quality trend how to assess representativeness however varies widely stigter et al 2011 for instance suggest representativeness can be assessed using the estimation error of kriging interpolation while at the european level representativeness is evaluated from the distance between stations using a so called representativeness index grath et al 2001 this index normalized to a hundred percent and calculated from the mean distance between monitoring stations and the surface area of the subsurface catchment decreases as the mean distance between stations increases for a given number of stations and a constant surface area a minimum of 80 is suggested to ensure good representativeness besides problems with the arbitrary nature of that cutoff value or with the dependency of the numerical value of the index on the shape of the monitoring region dabrowska et al 2016 this type of a priori methodology does not take into account the available information on water quality within the groundwater body a different a posteriori approach is proposed here based on the prerequisite of the availability of a dataset covering a number of measurements locations larger than the final number of monitoring stations thus the method requires performing one large sampling campaign this campaign then yields an instantaneous distribution of contaminant concentrations for the aquifer of interest although the initial sampling effort is large it must be consented to only once before reducing the regular sampling to the stations of the monitoring network we wish to point out that this type of instantaneous sampling does not imply that the obtained pattern of contaminants changes continuously rendering the entire procedure rapidly obsolete on the contrary we have seen that the modified network optimised using the 2007 sampling campaign could also reproduce the trend in dea and nitrate concentrations observed between 2007 and 2012 although possibly incidental this good performance could very well be due to the robustness of the method aquifers typically display significant inertia due to the large volumes of groundwater in storage and the long transit times of both water and solutes compared to human induced changes in the recharge areas external changes in the input regime will modify the contaminant pattern of any measurement network but unless changes are dramatic and rapid the rate of change will be in the order of years to decades furthermore provided event water is negligible in total spring discharge i e only groundwater is sampled and given the contaminant was leached from the soil for a sufficiently long period of time the integrative nature of spring water means that measured contaminant concentrations is a weighted average of applications over the entire recharge area reaching back years to decades this is why the optimization was based on desethyl atrazine because its concentration had reached a peak by the time of sampling due to repeated atrazine applications over the previous decades farlin et al 2013 the transit time of the different monitoring stations was not quantified because a single tritium measurement does not allow a unique parameterisation of the transit time distribution function instead we used a simple ranking of measured tritium concentrations under the assumption that the higher the tritium value the longer the mean transit time this assumption is only strictly valid for a uniform recharge dynamic and if the transit time distribution can be characterised by a single parameter this hypothesis is in our view preferable to a badly constrained mean transit time estimation obtained from eq 6 the interquartile range of the tritium distribution was not very sensitive to changes in the combinations of monitoring stations the minimum tritium activities were overestimated by 0 9 tu 5 1 instead of 4 2 tu by the modified network which means that the average rate of change of the monitoring network will probably be biased high compared to the overall rate of change of concentrations in the groundwater i e the rate of decrease or increase estimated from the stations of the network will be faster than in reality the magnitude of the bias cannot be quantified because the free parameters of the inverse parameter estimation using eq 6 cannot be constrained simultaneously using a single tritium measurement additional isotope measurements in the coming years will allow addressing this limitation as the analysis of the temporal evolution of dea showed however the optimised network still seems to be able to capture trends and rates of change correctly at least for the five years interval between both sampling campaigns the temporal bias might however become manifest over a longer time span a decade or more as the median dea concentration calculated from the stations of the monitoring network increasingly deviate from the groundwater concentration calculated from the larger dataset however robust the method may be significant changes in land use such as the rapid urbanisation of a predominantly rural area will potentially affect the representativeness of groundwater monitoring network designed under a given land use distribution thus performing one large sampling at intervals of maybe a decade although to our knowledge not recommended by regulators or commonly implemented by water agencies would be useful to monitor the effect of land use changes on the effectiveness of the existing monitoring network and possibly to modify the network accordingly additional benefits of such periodic large scale sampling campaigns would be to assess trends from a larger dataset while providing water agencies with an updated overview of contaminant concentration than the one obtained from the limited number of stations of regular monitoring networks the purpose of the equations we propose here is to formalize the intuitive idea that increasing the number of sampling sites assumed to be independent because the distance between sites is larger than the correlation length must lead to a closer representation of the pollutant pressure in a given groundwater body the method can be used to update a monitoring network if new emerging contaminants become of interest or new sites accessible for sampling it also provides a clear roadmap to water managers concerning the integration of prior information in the evaluation and optimisation process although the initial sampling effort is substantial the dataset gained provides an invaluable empirical basis for the design or the testing of a parsimonious monitoring network which once implemented should give a reliable overview of the groundwater quality status to summarise we suggest the following guidelines when evaluating an existing monitoring network or when creating a new one perform one large sampling campaign over a short period of time if possible repeated once over two different seasons of the same year to check for repeatability and potential seasonal effects at the most reactive groundwater outlets select one contaminant as tracer for steady state agricultural pollution using criteria such as long application history and frequent use in major crops and perform the optimisation described above compare the distribution of the entire dataset and the subset consisting of the selected stations for other contaminants and possibly for a groundwater age tracer as well if the estimated distributions are also close for these additional solutes adopt the network otherwise select another contaminant and redo the optimisation additionally to the regular sampling of the monitoring network usually four times a year for groundwater sampling sites one large scale sampling every decade or after significant land use changes have occurred or if a new contaminant becomes of interest will provide an updated overview of the chemical status of the aquifer and give the opportunity to re evaluate the monitoring network s performance conflict of interest none acknowledgements this study was funded by the luxembourgish water
