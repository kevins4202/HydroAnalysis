205,freshwater aquifers in low elevation coastal zones are known to be threatened by saltwater intrusion swi as these areas host a significant share of the world s population an excellent understanding of this phenomenon is required to effectively manage the availability of freshwater swi is a dynamic process therefore saline groundwater distributions can change quickly over time particularly in stressed areas with anthropogenic drivers to model these changes regional 3d variable density groundwater 3d vdg flow and coupled salt transport models are often used to estimate the current and future distributions of saline groundwater unfortunately parameterising 3d vdg models is a challenging task with many uncertainties generally uncertainty is reduced through the addition of observational data such as airborne electromagnetic aem surveys or ground based information that offer information about parameters such as salinity and hydraulic head recent research has shown the ability of aem surveys to provide accurate 3d groundwater salinity models across regional scales as well as highlighting the potential for good survey repeatability to this end we investigated the novel approach of using repeat aem surveys flown over the same area at different points in time and 3d vdg models to jointly improve the parameterisation of 3d vdg models while simultaneously providing a detailed 3d map of groundwater salinity distributions using detailed 3d synthetic models the results of this study quantitatively highlight the usefulness of this approach while offering practical information on implementation and further research 1 introduction 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport models referred to in the following as 3d vdg models are proven and commonly used tools to simulate current and future distributions of saline groundwater e g faneca s anchez et al 2012 meyer et al 2019 van engelen et al 2019 the usefulness of 3d vdg models is particularly clear in highly populated low elevation coastal zones where saltwater intrusion swi into freshwater groundwater systems poses a significant risk to the availability of fresh water for agricultural industrial and household uses gomaa et al 2021 oude essink et al 2010 simmons et al 2010 werner et al 2013 as a result 3d vdg models are extensively used to inform groundwater policies in these areas the parameterization of 3d vdg models i e finding values for ground water flow e g hydraulic conductivity storage coefficients and salt transport e g porosity dispersivities parameters is a daunting task particularly as these parameters can be very heterogeneous in space typically the parameterization process starts with a hypothesis about parameter heterogeneity this is followed by creating a spatial regionalization e g zonation geostatistical simulation which reduces the number of free unknown parameters next following an initial guess the free parameters are estimated through model calibration calibration is often approached as an inverse problem where model parameters are iteratively adjusted until the model response fits to observations of models states or outputs for an overview of calibration approaches we refer to zhou et al 2014 and doherty 2010 for an example of an application to 3d vdg models refer to carrera et al 2010 typically 3d vdg models are calibrated using in situ head and salinity observations which are often sparse adjusted 3d vdg parameters include for example hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity and recharge however 3d vdg parameterization is prone to uncertainty first the large spatial heterogeneity of underground lithology creates errors during the spatial regionalization step second calibration being an inverse problem usually suffers from non uniqueness as a result of parameter correlation carrera et al 2005 which arises from the sparseness of the in situ observation used naturally one way to reduce uncertainty is the addition of more observational data that relate to observing 3d vdg states head salinity or outputs e g stream discharge and concentration data sources are often ground based such as wells that monitor salinity and hydraulic head or indirect geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography that measure electrical conductivity ec beaujean et al 2014 which is converted to groundwater salinity estimates using petrophysical relationships for regional 3d vdg modelling often extending across 100 s of kms e g cobaner et al 2012 gossel et al 2010 mabrouk et al 2019 michael et al 2009 nocchi and salleolini 2013 oude essink et al 2010 van engelen et al 2019 1d or 2d ground measurements are considered expensive offering localized and disconnected information king et al 2020 airborne electromagnetics aem offer an indirect but fast and economical data source to overcome these shortcomings the aem method is sensitive to both lithology and groundwater where primarily clay content and groundwater salinity offer electrical conductivity ec contrasts revil and glover 1998 as a result the use of aem to resolve state variables such as groundwater salinity and parameters has proliferated in recent years aem methods have been used successfully to map structure such as clay content or lithological units auken et al 2008 foged et al 2014 gunnink et al 2012 høyer et al 2015 and such could be used to help parameterize 3d vdg models with additional lithological information in more saline environments however mapping structure which can relate to parameters such as hydraulic conductivity is more challenging because signals are dominated by the strong ec contrasts found at fresh saline interfaces king et al 2020 naturally this makes it highly suitable for mapping salinity instead where in these environments the method has seen continued success for decades delsman et al 2018 faneca s anchez et al 2012 fitterman and deszcz pan 2001 jørgensen et al 2012 rahman et al 2021 vandevelde et al 2018 conceptually calibrating a 3d vdg model with state variables obtained from geophysical data can be approached using sequential or coupled hydrogeophysical inversion herckenrath et al 2013 hinnell et al 2010 for an overview and history of hydrogeophysical methods see binley et al 2015 in sequential methods a deterministic geophysical inversion is traditionally run first and then translated into groundwater salinity using petrophysical relationships allowing model calibration e g faneca s anchez et al 2012 coupled hydrogeophysical inversion involves the transformation of 3d vdg state variables into a physical property which can then be forward modelled and compared to geophysical observations e g bauer gottwein et al 2010 gonzález quirós and comte 2021 steklova and haber 2015 as a result coupled models do not rely on a geophysical inversion the 3d vdg model can then be run iteratively until a misfit against geophysical observations are appropriately small in the following we present a method that exploits the ability of aem to map groundwater salinity to improve the parameterization of 3d vdg model properties while at the same time providing improved 3d vdg predictions of groundwater salinity we use the idea that the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater changes over time and the resulting movement of ec contrasts between fresh and saline groundwater can be resolved by aem if measured repeatedly at the same location furthermore previous research suggests that if repeated flightline paths are spatially consistent and that inverted data are compared rather than the electromagnetic response itself then the aem method offers good repeatability huang and cogbill 2006 thus using a similar idea to traditional inverse calibration where a model is run from the past to match observations at the present we explore the possibility of using two separate aem surveys flown at the same location at two different periods in time similar to time lapse inversion that has been used extensively in reservoir engineering johnston 2013 and hydrology e g karaoulis et al 2011 we investigate the idea that the observed changes in salinity distributions can infer model 3d vdg parameters if a 3d vdg model with initial groundwater salinity distributions obtained from the first survey say at t0 it should be able to predict the groundwater salinity distribution at the time of the second aem survey say t1 given that groundwater in the netherlands is generally a mixture of seawater and freshwater chloride is the dominant conservative anion therefore for consistency we will refer to a distribution of groundwater salinity as the chloride distribution to test the idea and to see if such inverse estimation would be feasible in theory we created a highly detailed synthetic reality 3d lithology and chloride distribution over time between t0 and t1 based on real aem data delsman et al 2018 a detailed lithological model stafleu et al 2011 and 3d vdg modelling with the computer code seawat langevin et al 2007 verkaik et al 2021 and a given set of real parameters we then used a geophysical modelling approach king et al 2020 to simulate an aem survey at the start and end of the 3d vdg model run we subsequently tested an optimization strategy that iteratively runs the 3d vdg model with unknown parameters between t0 and t1 while comparing this modelled chloride distribution with the aem survey at t1 and adjust the unknown 3d vdg model hydrogeological parameters to minimize the difference using this approach it was tested if the original real parameters could be re estimated correctly in the following we provide a summary of our approach in section 3 1 section 3 2 describes how the synthetic model was created including the study area it was based on followed by the 3d vdg model set up and parameterization in 3 3 and the optimization method in 3 4 section 4 outlines the results of the optimization which are followed a discussion and finally concluding remarks in 5 and 6 respectively 2 methods 2 1 general approach our approach to estimate hydrogeological parameters is based on performing two sequentially processed aem surveys one at time t0 and one at time t1 that are sufficiently spaced apart to detect real changes in the chloride distribution of a groundwater body this means that the approach is limited to groundwater systems where due to external forcing extraction fresh groundwater injecting fresh water sea level rise the chloride distribution changes relatively rapidly the estimated chloride distribution obtained from the survey at time t0 is used as initial condition by a 3d vdg model that is subsequently used to simulate the chloride distribution at time t1 this simulation is first done with an initial estimate of the unknown hydrogeological parameters we then perform a simulated aem survey on the 3d vdg model simulated chloride distribution to obtain an aem chloride distribution at the same lower spatial footprint as the actual aem survey at t1 see fig 2 the differences between the actual and simulated aem chloride distributions are then used to drive an optimization framework as outlined in fig 1 here the unknown hydrogeological parameters are adjusted the 3d vdg model and aem simulation and parameter estimation steps are repeated iteratively while minimizing the differences between the actual and simulated aem at t1 in effect we are applying a coupled optimization driven time lapse hydrogeophysical inversion the result of this approach are optimized estimates of the unknown hydrogeological parameters and an optimized estimate of the chloride distribution at the resolution of the 3d vdg model generally higher than that of an aem survey which is also consistent with physical laws at the moment to our knowledge regional scale time lapse aem surveys are non existent but to be expected in the near future thus to demonstrate the methodology we used a so called twin experiment where we use a realistic synthetic reality and simulated aem surveys the complete setup of the twin experiment is shown in fig 1a the synthetic reality which consists of a realistic chloride distribution at t0 and t1 simulated with the 3d vdg model using the real hydrogeological parameters and two simulated aem surveys in blue b the model simulation also using the 3d vdg model and 3d vdg model based aem survey used in the optimization light blue and c the optimization algorithm orange we note that the simulated aem surveys include realistic observation noise and degrading of resolution conform the aem footprints king et al 2020 using the same 3d vdg model for reality and model simulation means that we ignore model structural errors in the following we describe in more detail a the synthetic case including the simulated aem in section 2 2 b the model simulation and initial hydrogeological parameter estimates in section 2 3 c optimization routine in section 2 4 2 2 creating a synthetic case the synthetic case was generated from 3d estimates from an existing aem survey from the province of zeeland in the netherlands delsman et al 2018 within this region data was extracted from an area called zeeuws vlaanderen or zeelandic flanders in english in southern zeeland this east west orientated strip 60 15 km is bordered to the north by the scheldt river estuary and to the south by the belgian border at the centre of zeeuws vlaanderen around the town of terneuzen a subset area was selected covering 7 7 km for further processing the model area and aem flightlines are highlighted in fig 2 the groundwater system characteristics of the area are summarized by the presence of shallow freshwater lenses typically about 10 20 m thick delsman et al 2018 caused by holocene sea level transgressions and subsequent land reclamation berendsen 2005 delsman et al 2014 the hydrogeological system is hosted within lithologies comprising neogene and quaternary sediments stafleu et al 2011 including younger fine sands clays and peats with deeper northward dipping sand and silts vos 2015 within the study area the dipping hydrogeological base extends to 50 70 m below the surface and denotes an impermeable aquitard to create a synthetic reality we use the existing detailed 3d chloride distribution that was obtained from the aem survey performed over the province of zeeland delsman et al 2018 this chloride distribution was taken as the real chloride distribution at t0 for this area a very detailed 3d lithological characterization is available stafleu et al 2011 based on 1500 borelogs in the study area see fig 3 in our synthetic example we assume the lithology to be fully known and focus on estimating the chloride distribution and hydrogeological parameters only 2 2 1 translation of chloride to electrical conductivity the chloride distribution and lithological information were further processed into bulk electrical conductivity ecb to allow for the simulation of an aem survey and subsequent inversion first a known empirical relationship from the study area was used to transform the data into the electrical conductivity of the groundwater ecw and corrected from a reference groundwater temperature of 25 c to 11 c as outlined in p g b de louw et al 2011 as the ecb is a product of both lithology and pore water salinity a petrophysical transformation is required to split the information between the two the simplest approach is using apparent formation factors ff which are the ratio of saturated sediment ecb to that of the pore water itself ecw archie 1942 the electrical properties of clays minerals such as surface conductivity complicate this relationship revil et al 2017 as a result a more accurate transformation in areas with clay present requires the addition of surface conductivity such as waxman and smits 2003 in this study we decided to use the simpler apparent ffs ecb ecw values are shown in table 1 the values for apparent ffs were taken from over 500 samples in an area only 20 km away from the area that was used to create our synthetic model and therefore offered good representative values the 3d distribution of lithological units to derive the ff distribution is the one taken from geotop stafleu et al 2011 fig 3 and corresponding ff values from nearby field measurements as shown in table 1 p g b de louw et al 2011 2 2 2 obtaining the chloride distribution at t1 using a 3d vdg model to set up a 3d vdg model that produces a realistic change in chloride distributions at t1 we constructed a model that comprises a combination of typical anthropogenic and natural drivers that result in chloride movements while at the same time ensuring that the model changes enough to produce sufficient signal natural drivers are natural recharge and autonomous freshening and salinization that occurs as a result of past inundation or sea level change vos 2015 we also introduced anthropogenic drivers extensive groundwater extraction that results in the so called upconing or shallowing of brackish to saline groundwater and areas with enhanced recharge of fresh surface water through aquifer storage and recovery asr dillon 2005 which would likely result in a rapid increase of fresh groundwater volumes pauw et al 2015 zuurbier et al 2015 with this in mind a 3d vdg model was discretized into 25 25 m horizontal cells across a 8 8 km area and comprised a 0 5 m vertical resolution at shallow depths increasing in thickness logarithmically with depth to a maximum thickness of 10 m resulting 3 5 million active cells over 54 layers a hydrogeological base was assigned at between 50 and 70 m depth and was derived from the geotop model and regis vernes et al 2010 the hydrogeological parameters of the model were similarly taken from the 3d lithology distribution of geotop assigning the parameter values from table 2 here lithology classes coarse medium fine loamy and silty sand were assumed as aquifer material and the finer and organic classes as aquitard material well locations were selected based on three conditions in all model cells that are 1 at 8 m depth below surface 2 within aquifer lithologies and 3 within freshwater areas 0 5 g l chloride to understand how an aem survey might respond to groundwater chloride movements across a broad range of time scales the model was run for 60 years longer than was thought necessary for this study finally at every consecutive 6 month time step we modelled the geophysical response of the aem system in this study we conclude that after 15 years there was likely sufficient signal available for the aem system based on a known noise threshold of 5 see the results section 2 2 3 simulating an aem survey as highlighted in fig 1 to recover a 3d chloride distribution that has the same resolution and physical characteristics of an actual survey at t0 and t1 an aem survey needed to be simulated the process is similar to king et al 2020 and is summarized in the following existing measurement locations and flightlines typically with a spacing between 30 and 60 m were taken from the survey that produced the real 3d chloride distribution section 2 2 1 ecb values which are obtained using the method explained in section 2 2 1 were then sampled at these points every 50 m to facilitate fast inversion times while still honouring the 50 m horizontal resolution of the 3d model vertical sampling was done at 0 5 m intervals the horizontal resolution or footprint of the system is approximated as a 100 200 m diameter circles directly beneath the towed instrument reid et al 2006 yin et al 2014 therefore at each measurement location the nearest two model cells were averaged to imitate a 100 m footprint data were forward modelled using aarhusinv auken et al 2005 coil source and receiver spacing and orientations were selected based on the values used by fugro s resolve hem system during the original survey delsman et al 2018 finally to approximate the noise levels present during fem acquisition farquharson et al 2003 green and lane 2013 5 white noise was added to the forward modelled data to recover a distribution of electrical properties from an aem survey a geophysical inversion is typically undertaken for this study a deterministic geophysical inversion e g auken et al 2015 farquharson et al 2003 viezzoli et al 2009 vignoli et al 2015 referred to in the following as an inversion using aarhusinv auken et al 2015 was implemented this inversion approach uses a pseudo 2d laterally constrained approach where neighbouring observations are constrained in the regularization process helping to produce laterally coherent results the method has been successfully used in many hydrogeophysical studies e g auken et al 2008 chongo et al 2015 delsman et al 2018 kirkegaard et al 2011 and is particularly useful in areas with laterally continuous ec contrasts such as our study area the inversion starting model consisted of 20 fixed layers with the first set to 0 5 m thick increasing logarithmically till 50 m below this the final layer is assumed to extend infinitely given the highly saline environment the model was assigned a starting ecb value of 1 s m the lateral and vertical constraint parameters were set to 1 3 and 3 respectively following recommended and commonly used values auken et al 2005 this minimum structure style inversion changes ecb only and has been found to accurately reproduce smoothly varying chloride distributions king et al 2018 the depth of investigation doi varies according to the ec of the subsurface in this case by shallow saline areas and therefore could range from 5 to 60 m in saline or fresh groundwater areas respectively the inversion output has an estimation of doi for each 1d model location the method to calculate this procedure is described in vest christiansen and auken 2012 all inversions converged to a misfit of less than 5 thereby effectively explaining the forward modelled observations finally as a 3d initial groundwater chloride distribution is required for the 3d vdg model and the inversion method only produces 1d vertical profiles along flightlines a 3d interpolation step was required this was approached using a simple method that exploits the layered nature of the inverted data to efficiently produce 3d ecb models from the inversion results each one of the 20 inversion layers for all flightlines were interpolated separately using 2d kriging with automatic variogram modelling the resulting 2d layers were then compiled to produce a 3d model the method is described in king et al 2018 and has been shown to accurately produce 3d volumes of ecb in similar settings as a final step the doi estimates were interpolated using the same 2d kriging technique where ecb values below the doi were filled to the model base using the last encountered ecb value at that depth finally the resulting ecb volume was transformed back into chloride using the reverse of the approach described in section 2 2a resulting in simulated aem surveyed chloride distributions at t0 and t1 2 3 3d vdg model simulation and initial parameter estimates the 3d vdg model simulation was run iteratively for a 15 year period using the exact same discretization and general parameterization as the model described in section 2 2 2 except for the unknown parameters following extensive experimentation we conclude that the method was to be used to predict the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer and aquitard and porosity the reasoning behind this choice was two fold 1 it was found that the 3d vdg model was most sensitive to these parameters and 2 we had to restrict the number of parameters to avoid excessive computation times and identification issues the ratio of horizontal to vertical conductivity kh kv was kept constant and thus in effect the optimization was used to resolve three parameters as this study is unique and therefore a proof of concept it was felt that while more parameters could be possible it was important to keep the approach simple given that especially higher kh and kv values result in longer seawat runtimes initial estimates were chosen to be too low on purpose to facilitate faster iteration times early on to test the sensitivity of the optimization to incorrect initial estimates the starting values were chosen to be ten times greater than the actual values effective porosity was simply assigned by a random guess to test the general robustness of the method values used are highlighted in table 3 2 4 the optimization we used a suitable non gradient global optimizer that works well in the high dimensional problems typically found in the field of groundwater modelling for this the nelder mead downhill simplex method was selected for its robustness and proven ability to optimize model parameters and find global minima nelder and mead 1965 its ability to handle noise is also desirable given the inherent noisiness related to the acquisition of aem data the optimization was implemented using the scipy optimize package available in python that uses an improvement to the original method by adjusting the simplex parameters relative to the dimensionality of the problem gao and han 2012 the objective function returns the root mean squared error rmse between t1 survey and t1 predicted given by 1 r m s e i 1 n y p r e d i y r e f i 2 n where pred at t1 denote simulated aem surveyed chloride values based on the 3d vdg model predictions with unknown parameters and ref at t1 the simulated aem surveyed chloride values based on the synthetic reality 3d vdg model with known parameters this was minimized until a convergence criterion was met in this case given by the rmse between iterations this value was set to 0 1 g l chloride and was chosen to be unrealistically low which effectively allowed the optimization to run indefinitely to allow a user based decision on whether it has converged sufficiently in practice the convergence criteria could however be set to reflect the levels of noise from the aem system if known 3 results 3 1 aem sensitivity to estimated chloride distributions the 3d vdg model was first run for 60 years to understand the length of time needed for chloride changes to be detected by the aem system at each time step and indeed the sensitivity of the aem method to the transient effects in general to understand this quantitatively each time step of the resulting 3d vdg model was geophysically forward modelled using the method outlined in section 2 where successive time steps were compared quantitatively to the first model as relative mean absolute error the 5 red horizontal line in fig 4 represents an approximation of aem noise levels thereby providing a rough indication of required groundwater chloride movements before there is enough signal for a second survey to measure meaningful differences from fig 4 it follows that prior to 5 years a repeat survey would likely fall within the estimated noise range indicating that a repeat survey in this instance would fail to effectively map differences after 15 years or 30 time steps the slope gradient decreases after an initial sharp increase to 7 5 difference therefore in the following the time period between zero and 15 years was used to simulate the two surveys and ultimately guide the optimization in a real setting localized ground measurements over time and geophysical forward modelling could be used to estimate if there is likely to be enough signal for a repeat aem to be useful 3 2 estimated parameters the optimization ran for 250 iterations for 15 3d vdg simulated years per iteration taking on average five hours per iteration and 2 months to complete on a standard desktop pc with four processing cores the 3d vdg model simulation was by far the most computationally intensive step with the geophysical forward modelling inversion 3d interpolation and petrophysical transforms step only taking around half an hour in total per iteration the optimization results at each iteration are highlighted in fig 5 as the kh kv ratio was kept constant only the kh values are shown for the aquifers and aquitards here it is apparent that there were two local minima 1 between iterations 20 50 and 2 between 100 170 both of which were successfully avoided by the algorithm predictably changes in rmse correlated well to changes in model parameters and showed that the steps between each iteration were appropriately sized and generally sensitive to the objective function this is despite the fact that smaller changes in chloride distributions were not resolved as a result of the aem simulation the effect of which is highlighted in fig 6 quantitative results based on the final iteration table 4 suggest that each of the parameters were either successfully predicted or were improved considerably over the course of the optimization 3 3 estimated chloride distributions qualitative results of chloride distributions at t1 are presented in fig 6 showing the synthetic reality on row 1 a and 1 b for the aem salinity and 3d vdg models respectively followed by the results of the optimization with the results of the first iteration on row 2 the last iteration on row 3 and the difference between the last iteration and the synthetic reality in row 4 comparing the chloride distributions between the aem and the 3d vdg models in general columns a and b respectively it is clear that the aem simulation successfully mapped the locations of larger features such as upconing of saline groundwater and freshwater lenses smaller features 200 m across were not successfully resolved given the footprint of the aem system and the loss of resolution during the 3d interpolation of ecb values in these areas the features have been smoothed out effectively creating a vertically thicker brackish zone instead it was also observed that the optimization successfully managed to recreate the synthetic realities chloride distribution by the final iteration the difference between the aem synthetic reality fig 6 1a and the aem final iteration fig 6 3a is larger than the differences between that of the 3d vdg models this is likely due to the 5 noise added in the geophysical modelling step and appears to cause uncertainty regarding the location of the fresh saline interface despite this error the 3d vdg model was able to dynamically downscale the smoothed features observed in the aem surveys fig 7 shows a 3d image of the final estimated aem chloride distribution and the differences between the initial and final iteration thereof the observed differences in salinity clearly show the zones where the chloride distribution was updated by the calibration process 4 discussion given the exploratory nature of this study several necessary simplifications were made as a result of these simplifications in the following we will first discuss sources of uncertainty and their potential effects on our results followed by a discussion of the optimization method finally we mention thoughts on practicalities followed by potential for further research in this twin experiment we assumed that the synthetic model correctly describes reality this assumption applies to the physics of the simulated aem survey itself as well as the magnitude of groundwater transport over time based on the 3d vdg model in the case of the aem survey we assumed that the chloride distributions were mapped with similar physical limitations to an actual survey a major cause of this uncertainty is that we used a 1d geophysical forward and inverse modelling tool for a 3d problem auken et al 2005 effectively removing 3d effects on the signal although there are 3d aem geophysical modelling tools available e g cox et al 2012 it was found that using these tools would lead to considerably longer iteration times on an already computationally expensive task instead we added 5 gaussian noise which is considered an upper estimate of noise siemon 2012 as well as simulating a 100 m footprint at measurement location reid et al 2006 yin et al 2014 these steps effectively tested the robustness of repeat aem surveys while maintaining reasonable optimization run times for the 3d vdg model simulation we sought a careful balance between a realistic model while ensuring that there was sufficient signal for the optimization to work with based on a combination of using real subsurface data and known parameters which were taken from an applied study mulder et al 2020 as well as the groundwater modelling experience of the authors we feel that the model describes reality to an acceptable level for meaningful conclusions an additional source of uncertainty is that we assume knowledge of parameter values and locations of the other hydrogeological parameters such as the interaction between groundwater and drainage via the so called drain resistance and the locations of aquitards and aquifers we suggest that a simple way to examine the effect of keeping unknown parameter values constant would be to add noise to those that are not part of the optimization where permitted deviations could be based on known uncertainty levels the same could be said for the spatial distribution of clay and sand units allowing the locations thereof to change based on given noise thresholds the results of implementing this could then be used to determine quantitively the effect of these assumptions ideally all uncertainties should have been included in the optimization as a fully heterogeneous 3d model in this study however we chose to keep our method simple owing in part to the already high computational burden discussed below as well the fact that this is presented as a proof of concept thus further complexity is considered subject for further study besides correctly describing reality uncertainty exists in both the type of geophysical inversion used as well as the petrophysical transformation i e to transform from ecb to salinity and vice versa recent research highlights this where it was found that the petrophysical transformation introduced the most uncertainty and that overall incorrect handling of these two features can result in the mapping of an overly thick brackish zone gonzález quirós and comte 2020 the deterministic method used here suffers from non uniqueness where an infinite number of models can explain the data in these cases regularization constrains the inversion typically resulting in smooth models arsenin 1979 constable 1987 one way to explore this effect is stochastic inversion where a prior model is used instead of regularization e g minsley 2011 minsley et al 2020 in this study we used a single inversion method as a necessity given the computational burden of stochastic inversion furthermore in this synthetic study we assume that the lithology is known and that we estimate the properties of only the high and low permeability sediments in real applications the efficacy of the aem system for mapping similar shallow fresh saline groundwater distributions using the same geophysical inversion method was quantitatively validated recently in delsman et al 2018 as a result we feel that on balance our approach was valid for this study with the petrophysical model we settled on the simpler apparent ff without using surface conductivities for a number of reasons first these values were derived from an actual local field study and thus offered a good realistic approximation for the study area second lithologies such as peat and clay that could introduce error were only present as 1 4 and 6 2 of the total model volume respectively as a result we felt that additional uncertainty introduced when finding appropriate values for surface conductivity negated the use of local representative data it is however recommended that this step is taken with care in other use cases given the propensity for incorrectly used petrophysical models to introduce non physical error into hydrogeophysical models gonzález quirós and comte 2020 the ecb gradient is strongly controlled by fresh saline groundwater contrasts an effect also observed clearly in local ecb ground measurements as such despite potential error introduced in the petrophysical transformation and inversion the relative magnitude of signal changes over time were considered sufficient to drive the optimization and were a good enough approximation for our purposes overall as the time lapse approach presented here is new we recommend that future research focusses on a global uncertainty analysis having a better quantitative grasp on what this means for practical mapping outcomes would be a useful step and potentially highlight methods to reduce uncertainty for example the use of in situ salinity data for the purposes of this study however we feel that the potential use of repeated airborne surveys was effectively proven given the highly realistic nature of our 3 d synthetic model the downhill simplex optimization method used here gao and han 2012 nelder and mead 1965 was selected for its simplicity and ability to handle highly dimensional problems despite the successes of using the method in this study in a practical rather than exploratory setting we suggest that other methods are considered this is recommended for two reasons 1 the optimization was impractically slow to find a solution and 2 the addition of other parameters would increase the likelihood of the downhill simplex arriving at a local minimum especially given its sensitivity to the choice of initial guesses wang and shoup 2011 as the 3d vdg model computation step cost 5 h per iteration one could simply run this step externally on large computational clusters using imod seawat which utilizes distributed memory parallelization for faster computation times verkaik et al 2021 in a practical setting however we suggest fully parallelizing the optimization itself using methods such as evolutionary algorithms brauer et al 2002 mühlenbein et al 1991 and parallel bayesian optimization e g gonzález et al 2015 kandasamy et al 2017 where function evaluations can be done in parallel rather than sequentially the latter approach has been successfully used in hydrocarbon reservoir modelling e g abdollahzadeh et al 2011 where similar to the optimization used in this study inverse problems are solved that require multiple flow simulations which are more computationally expensive compared to our problem we consider the implementation of this an important avenue for future research given the possibility to parameterize fully heterogeneous models finally while the results of this research highlight the usefulness of two aem surveys in time we find it necessary to discuss these results against 3d hydrogeological inverse models that utilize different data configurations for example a single aem survey or even multiple sources of in situ head and salinity data unlike this study in these cases there isn t a complete picture of a groundwater state at two time intervals in 3d as a result an inverse modelling routine relies on a conceptualized version of the past based on prior knowledge followed by a history matching routine until the chloride distribution is matched with acceptable accuracy to available data this has the disadvantage that owing to the large inertia of fresh salt groundwater systems simulations have to start far back in the past sometimes hundreds to thousands of years back meyer et al 2019 delsman et al 2014 apart from being highly computationally expensive in practice requiring massively parallel computing it also requires knowledge of boundary conditions from the distance past adding considerable uncertainty and requiring extensive research nevertheless we believe that a quantitative comparison between history matching to a single aem survey and optimizing between two in a similar experiment would be useful as future research 5 conclusions using a twin experiment involving two highly detailed synthetic realities and simulated airborne electromagnetic aem surveys it was successfully demonstrated that it is possible to jointly estimate groundwater salinity and hydrogeological parameters in a real application this could be achieved using a combination of two aem surveys flown across the same area over two periods in time and a variable density groundwater flow and salt transport 3d vdg model by coupling aem and 3d vdg models using geophysical forward modelling methods it was shown that two aem surveys are sensitive to changing groundwater chloride distributions over time despite a significant loss of resolution as a result of the survey process itself in doing so it was also demonstrated that the time needed for chloride movements to be sensitive to aem can be attained quantitatively given the knowledge of sensitivities it followed that an optimization method could be used to recover hydrogeological properties using 3d vdg with this in mind a simple optimization process was implemented to resolve hydrogeological parameters of interest while at the same time producing a physically consistent estimate of the chloride distribution at higher spatial resolution then the aem surveys credit

205,freshwater aquifers in low elevation coastal zones are known to be threatened by saltwater intrusion swi as these areas host a significant share of the world s population an excellent understanding of this phenomenon is required to effectively manage the availability of freshwater swi is a dynamic process therefore saline groundwater distributions can change quickly over time particularly in stressed areas with anthropogenic drivers to model these changes regional 3d variable density groundwater 3d vdg flow and coupled salt transport models are often used to estimate the current and future distributions of saline groundwater unfortunately parameterising 3d vdg models is a challenging task with many uncertainties generally uncertainty is reduced through the addition of observational data such as airborne electromagnetic aem surveys or ground based information that offer information about parameters such as salinity and hydraulic head recent research has shown the ability of aem surveys to provide accurate 3d groundwater salinity models across regional scales as well as highlighting the potential for good survey repeatability to this end we investigated the novel approach of using repeat aem surveys flown over the same area at different points in time and 3d vdg models to jointly improve the parameterisation of 3d vdg models while simultaneously providing a detailed 3d map of groundwater salinity distributions using detailed 3d synthetic models the results of this study quantitatively highlight the usefulness of this approach while offering practical information on implementation and further research 1 introduction 3d variable density groundwater flow and coupled salt transport models referred to in the following as 3d vdg models are proven and commonly used tools to simulate current and future distributions of saline groundwater e g faneca s anchez et al 2012 meyer et al 2019 van engelen et al 2019 the usefulness of 3d vdg models is particularly clear in highly populated low elevation coastal zones where saltwater intrusion swi into freshwater groundwater systems poses a significant risk to the availability of fresh water for agricultural industrial and household uses gomaa et al 2021 oude essink et al 2010 simmons et al 2010 werner et al 2013 as a result 3d vdg models are extensively used to inform groundwater policies in these areas the parameterization of 3d vdg models i e finding values for ground water flow e g hydraulic conductivity storage coefficients and salt transport e g porosity dispersivities parameters is a daunting task particularly as these parameters can be very heterogeneous in space typically the parameterization process starts with a hypothesis about parameter heterogeneity this is followed by creating a spatial regionalization e g zonation geostatistical simulation which reduces the number of free unknown parameters next following an initial guess the free parameters are estimated through model calibration calibration is often approached as an inverse problem where model parameters are iteratively adjusted until the model response fits to observations of models states or outputs for an overview of calibration approaches we refer to zhou et al 2014 and doherty 2010 for an example of an application to 3d vdg models refer to carrera et al 2010 typically 3d vdg models are calibrated using in situ head and salinity observations which are often sparse adjusted 3d vdg parameters include for example hydraulic conductivity porosity dispersivity and recharge however 3d vdg parameterization is prone to uncertainty first the large spatial heterogeneity of underground lithology creates errors during the spatial regionalization step second calibration being an inverse problem usually suffers from non uniqueness as a result of parameter correlation carrera et al 2005 which arises from the sparseness of the in situ observation used naturally one way to reduce uncertainty is the addition of more observational data that relate to observing 3d vdg states head salinity or outputs e g stream discharge and concentration data sources are often ground based such as wells that monitor salinity and hydraulic head or indirect geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography that measure electrical conductivity ec beaujean et al 2014 which is converted to groundwater salinity estimates using petrophysical relationships for regional 3d vdg modelling often extending across 100 s of kms e g cobaner et al 2012 gossel et al 2010 mabrouk et al 2019 michael et al 2009 nocchi and salleolini 2013 oude essink et al 2010 van engelen et al 2019 1d or 2d ground measurements are considered expensive offering localized and disconnected information king et al 2020 airborne electromagnetics aem offer an indirect but fast and economical data source to overcome these shortcomings the aem method is sensitive to both lithology and groundwater where primarily clay content and groundwater salinity offer electrical conductivity ec contrasts revil and glover 1998 as a result the use of aem to resolve state variables such as groundwater salinity and parameters has proliferated in recent years aem methods have been used successfully to map structure such as clay content or lithological units auken et al 2008 foged et al 2014 gunnink et al 2012 høyer et al 2015 and such could be used to help parameterize 3d vdg models with additional lithological information in more saline environments however mapping structure which can relate to parameters such as hydraulic conductivity is more challenging because signals are dominated by the strong ec contrasts found at fresh saline interfaces king et al 2020 naturally this makes it highly suitable for mapping salinity instead where in these environments the method has seen continued success for decades delsman et al 2018 faneca s anchez et al 2012 fitterman and deszcz pan 2001 jørgensen et al 2012 rahman et al 2021 vandevelde et al 2018 conceptually calibrating a 3d vdg model with state variables obtained from geophysical data can be approached using sequential or coupled hydrogeophysical inversion herckenrath et al 2013 hinnell et al 2010 for an overview and history of hydrogeophysical methods see binley et al 2015 in sequential methods a deterministic geophysical inversion is traditionally run first and then translated into groundwater salinity using petrophysical relationships allowing model calibration e g faneca s anchez et al 2012 coupled hydrogeophysical inversion involves the transformation of 3d vdg state variables into a physical property which can then be forward modelled and compared to geophysical observations e g bauer gottwein et al 2010 gonzález quirós and comte 2021 steklova and haber 2015 as a result coupled models do not rely on a geophysical inversion the 3d vdg model can then be run iteratively until a misfit against geophysical observations are appropriately small in the following we present a method that exploits the ability of aem to map groundwater salinity to improve the parameterization of 3d vdg model properties while at the same time providing improved 3d vdg predictions of groundwater salinity we use the idea that the distribution of saline and fresh groundwater changes over time and the resulting movement of ec contrasts between fresh and saline groundwater can be resolved by aem if measured repeatedly at the same location furthermore previous research suggests that if repeated flightline paths are spatially consistent and that inverted data are compared rather than the electromagnetic response itself then the aem method offers good repeatability huang and cogbill 2006 thus using a similar idea to traditional inverse calibration where a model is run from the past to match observations at the present we explore the possibility of using two separate aem surveys flown at the same location at two different periods in time similar to time lapse inversion that has been used extensively in reservoir engineering johnston 2013 and hydrology e g karaoulis et al 2011 we investigate the idea that the observed changes in salinity distributions can infer model 3d vdg parameters if a 3d vdg model with initial groundwater salinity distributions obtained from the first survey say at t0 it should be able to predict the groundwater salinity distribution at the time of the second aem survey say t1 given that groundwater in the netherlands is generally a mixture of seawater and freshwater chloride is the dominant conservative anion therefore for consistency we will refer to a distribution of groundwater salinity as the chloride distribution to test the idea and to see if such inverse estimation would be feasible in theory we created a highly detailed synthetic reality 3d lithology and chloride distribution over time between t0 and t1 based on real aem data delsman et al 2018 a detailed lithological model stafleu et al 2011 and 3d vdg modelling with the computer code seawat langevin et al 2007 verkaik et al 2021 and a given set of real parameters we then used a geophysical modelling approach king et al 2020 to simulate an aem survey at the start and end of the 3d vdg model run we subsequently tested an optimization strategy that iteratively runs the 3d vdg model with unknown parameters between t0 and t1 while comparing this modelled chloride distribution with the aem survey at t1 and adjust the unknown 3d vdg model hydrogeological parameters to minimize the difference using this approach it was tested if the original real parameters could be re estimated correctly in the following we provide a summary of our approach in section 3 1 section 3 2 describes how the synthetic model was created including the study area it was based on followed by the 3d vdg model set up and parameterization in 3 3 and the optimization method in 3 4 section 4 outlines the results of the optimization which are followed a discussion and finally concluding remarks in 5 and 6 respectively 2 methods 2 1 general approach our approach to estimate hydrogeological parameters is based on performing two sequentially processed aem surveys one at time t0 and one at time t1 that are sufficiently spaced apart to detect real changes in the chloride distribution of a groundwater body this means that the approach is limited to groundwater systems where due to external forcing extraction fresh groundwater injecting fresh water sea level rise the chloride distribution changes relatively rapidly the estimated chloride distribution obtained from the survey at time t0 is used as initial condition by a 3d vdg model that is subsequently used to simulate the chloride distribution at time t1 this simulation is first done with an initial estimate of the unknown hydrogeological parameters we then perform a simulated aem survey on the 3d vdg model simulated chloride distribution to obtain an aem chloride distribution at the same lower spatial footprint as the actual aem survey at t1 see fig 2 the differences between the actual and simulated aem chloride distributions are then used to drive an optimization framework as outlined in fig 1 here the unknown hydrogeological parameters are adjusted the 3d vdg model and aem simulation and parameter estimation steps are repeated iteratively while minimizing the differences between the actual and simulated aem at t1 in effect we are applying a coupled optimization driven time lapse hydrogeophysical inversion the result of this approach are optimized estimates of the unknown hydrogeological parameters and an optimized estimate of the chloride distribution at the resolution of the 3d vdg model generally higher than that of an aem survey which is also consistent with physical laws at the moment to our knowledge regional scale time lapse aem surveys are non existent but to be expected in the near future thus to demonstrate the methodology we used a so called twin experiment where we use a realistic synthetic reality and simulated aem surveys the complete setup of the twin experiment is shown in fig 1a the synthetic reality which consists of a realistic chloride distribution at t0 and t1 simulated with the 3d vdg model using the real hydrogeological parameters and two simulated aem surveys in blue b the model simulation also using the 3d vdg model and 3d vdg model based aem survey used in the optimization light blue and c the optimization algorithm orange we note that the simulated aem surveys include realistic observation noise and degrading of resolution conform the aem footprints king et al 2020 using the same 3d vdg model for reality and model simulation means that we ignore model structural errors in the following we describe in more detail a the synthetic case including the simulated aem in section 2 2 b the model simulation and initial hydrogeological parameter estimates in section 2 3 c optimization routine in section 2 4 2 2 creating a synthetic case the synthetic case was generated from 3d estimates from an existing aem survey from the province of zeeland in the netherlands delsman et al 2018 within this region data was extracted from an area called zeeuws vlaanderen or zeelandic flanders in english in southern zeeland this east west orientated strip 60 15 km is bordered to the north by the scheldt river estuary and to the south by the belgian border at the centre of zeeuws vlaanderen around the town of terneuzen a subset area was selected covering 7 7 km for further processing the model area and aem flightlines are highlighted in fig 2 the groundwater system characteristics of the area are summarized by the presence of shallow freshwater lenses typically about 10 20 m thick delsman et al 2018 caused by holocene sea level transgressions and subsequent land reclamation berendsen 2005 delsman et al 2014 the hydrogeological system is hosted within lithologies comprising neogene and quaternary sediments stafleu et al 2011 including younger fine sands clays and peats with deeper northward dipping sand and silts vos 2015 within the study area the dipping hydrogeological base extends to 50 70 m below the surface and denotes an impermeable aquitard to create a synthetic reality we use the existing detailed 3d chloride distribution that was obtained from the aem survey performed over the province of zeeland delsman et al 2018 this chloride distribution was taken as the real chloride distribution at t0 for this area a very detailed 3d lithological characterization is available stafleu et al 2011 based on 1500 borelogs in the study area see fig 3 in our synthetic example we assume the lithology to be fully known and focus on estimating the chloride distribution and hydrogeological parameters only 2 2 1 translation of chloride to electrical conductivity the chloride distribution and lithological information were further processed into bulk electrical conductivity ecb to allow for the simulation of an aem survey and subsequent inversion first a known empirical relationship from the study area was used to transform the data into the electrical conductivity of the groundwater ecw and corrected from a reference groundwater temperature of 25 c to 11 c as outlined in p g b de louw et al 2011 as the ecb is a product of both lithology and pore water salinity a petrophysical transformation is required to split the information between the two the simplest approach is using apparent formation factors ff which are the ratio of saturated sediment ecb to that of the pore water itself ecw archie 1942 the electrical properties of clays minerals such as surface conductivity complicate this relationship revil et al 2017 as a result a more accurate transformation in areas with clay present requires the addition of surface conductivity such as waxman and smits 2003 in this study we decided to use the simpler apparent ffs ecb ecw values are shown in table 1 the values for apparent ffs were taken from over 500 samples in an area only 20 km away from the area that was used to create our synthetic model and therefore offered good representative values the 3d distribution of lithological units to derive the ff distribution is the one taken from geotop stafleu et al 2011 fig 3 and corresponding ff values from nearby field measurements as shown in table 1 p g b de louw et al 2011 2 2 2 obtaining the chloride distribution at t1 using a 3d vdg model to set up a 3d vdg model that produces a realistic change in chloride distributions at t1 we constructed a model that comprises a combination of typical anthropogenic and natural drivers that result in chloride movements while at the same time ensuring that the model changes enough to produce sufficient signal natural drivers are natural recharge and autonomous freshening and salinization that occurs as a result of past inundation or sea level change vos 2015 we also introduced anthropogenic drivers extensive groundwater extraction that results in the so called upconing or shallowing of brackish to saline groundwater and areas with enhanced recharge of fresh surface water through aquifer storage and recovery asr dillon 2005 which would likely result in a rapid increase of fresh groundwater volumes pauw et al 2015 zuurbier et al 2015 with this in mind a 3d vdg model was discretized into 25 25 m horizontal cells across a 8 8 km area and comprised a 0 5 m vertical resolution at shallow depths increasing in thickness logarithmically with depth to a maximum thickness of 10 m resulting 3 5 million active cells over 54 layers a hydrogeological base was assigned at between 50 and 70 m depth and was derived from the geotop model and regis vernes et al 2010 the hydrogeological parameters of the model were similarly taken from the 3d lithology distribution of geotop assigning the parameter values from table 2 here lithology classes coarse medium fine loamy and silty sand were assumed as aquifer material and the finer and organic classes as aquitard material well locations were selected based on three conditions in all model cells that are 1 at 8 m depth below surface 2 within aquifer lithologies and 3 within freshwater areas 0 5 g l chloride to understand how an aem survey might respond to groundwater chloride movements across a broad range of time scales the model was run for 60 years longer than was thought necessary for this study finally at every consecutive 6 month time step we modelled the geophysical response of the aem system in this study we conclude that after 15 years there was likely sufficient signal available for the aem system based on a known noise threshold of 5 see the results section 2 2 3 simulating an aem survey as highlighted in fig 1 to recover a 3d chloride distribution that has the same resolution and physical characteristics of an actual survey at t0 and t1 an aem survey needed to be simulated the process is similar to king et al 2020 and is summarized in the following existing measurement locations and flightlines typically with a spacing between 30 and 60 m were taken from the survey that produced the real 3d chloride distribution section 2 2 1 ecb values which are obtained using the method explained in section 2 2 1 were then sampled at these points every 50 m to facilitate fast inversion times while still honouring the 50 m horizontal resolution of the 3d model vertical sampling was done at 0 5 m intervals the horizontal resolution or footprint of the system is approximated as a 100 200 m diameter circles directly beneath the towed instrument reid et al 2006 yin et al 2014 therefore at each measurement location the nearest two model cells were averaged to imitate a 100 m footprint data were forward modelled using aarhusinv auken et al 2005 coil source and receiver spacing and orientations were selected based on the values used by fugro s resolve hem system during the original survey delsman et al 2018 finally to approximate the noise levels present during fem acquisition farquharson et al 2003 green and lane 2013 5 white noise was added to the forward modelled data to recover a distribution of electrical properties from an aem survey a geophysical inversion is typically undertaken for this study a deterministic geophysical inversion e g auken et al 2015 farquharson et al 2003 viezzoli et al 2009 vignoli et al 2015 referred to in the following as an inversion using aarhusinv auken et al 2015 was implemented this inversion approach uses a pseudo 2d laterally constrained approach where neighbouring observations are constrained in the regularization process helping to produce laterally coherent results the method has been successfully used in many hydrogeophysical studies e g auken et al 2008 chongo et al 2015 delsman et al 2018 kirkegaard et al 2011 and is particularly useful in areas with laterally continuous ec contrasts such as our study area the inversion starting model consisted of 20 fixed layers with the first set to 0 5 m thick increasing logarithmically till 50 m below this the final layer is assumed to extend infinitely given the highly saline environment the model was assigned a starting ecb value of 1 s m the lateral and vertical constraint parameters were set to 1 3 and 3 respectively following recommended and commonly used values auken et al 2005 this minimum structure style inversion changes ecb only and has been found to accurately reproduce smoothly varying chloride distributions king et al 2018 the depth of investigation doi varies according to the ec of the subsurface in this case by shallow saline areas and therefore could range from 5 to 60 m in saline or fresh groundwater areas respectively the inversion output has an estimation of doi for each 1d model location the method to calculate this procedure is described in vest christiansen and auken 2012 all inversions converged to a misfit of less than 5 thereby effectively explaining the forward modelled observations finally as a 3d initial groundwater chloride distribution is required for the 3d vdg model and the inversion method only produces 1d vertical profiles along flightlines a 3d interpolation step was required this was approached using a simple method that exploits the layered nature of the inverted data to efficiently produce 3d ecb models from the inversion results each one of the 20 inversion layers for all flightlines were interpolated separately using 2d kriging with automatic variogram modelling the resulting 2d layers were then compiled to produce a 3d model the method is described in king et al 2018 and has been shown to accurately produce 3d volumes of ecb in similar settings as a final step the doi estimates were interpolated using the same 2d kriging technique where ecb values below the doi were filled to the model base using the last encountered ecb value at that depth finally the resulting ecb volume was transformed back into chloride using the reverse of the approach described in section 2 2a resulting in simulated aem surveyed chloride distributions at t0 and t1 2 3 3d vdg model simulation and initial parameter estimates the 3d vdg model simulation was run iteratively for a 15 year period using the exact same discretization and general parameterization as the model described in section 2 2 2 except for the unknown parameters following extensive experimentation we conclude that the method was to be used to predict the hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer and aquitard and porosity the reasoning behind this choice was two fold 1 it was found that the 3d vdg model was most sensitive to these parameters and 2 we had to restrict the number of parameters to avoid excessive computation times and identification issues the ratio of horizontal to vertical conductivity kh kv was kept constant and thus in effect the optimization was used to resolve three parameters as this study is unique and therefore a proof of concept it was felt that while more parameters could be possible it was important to keep the approach simple given that especially higher kh and kv values result in longer seawat runtimes initial estimates were chosen to be too low on purpose to facilitate faster iteration times early on to test the sensitivity of the optimization to incorrect initial estimates the starting values were chosen to be ten times greater than the actual values effective porosity was simply assigned by a random guess to test the general robustness of the method values used are highlighted in table 3 2 4 the optimization we used a suitable non gradient global optimizer that works well in the high dimensional problems typically found in the field of groundwater modelling for this the nelder mead downhill simplex method was selected for its robustness and proven ability to optimize model parameters and find global minima nelder and mead 1965 its ability to handle noise is also desirable given the inherent noisiness related to the acquisition of aem data the optimization was implemented using the scipy optimize package available in python that uses an improvement to the original method by adjusting the simplex parameters relative to the dimensionality of the problem gao and han 2012 the objective function returns the root mean squared error rmse between t1 survey and t1 predicted given by 1 r m s e i 1 n y p r e d i y r e f i 2 n where pred at t1 denote simulated aem surveyed chloride values based on the 3d vdg model predictions with unknown parameters and ref at t1 the simulated aem surveyed chloride values based on the synthetic reality 3d vdg model with known parameters this was minimized until a convergence criterion was met in this case given by the rmse between iterations this value was set to 0 1 g l chloride and was chosen to be unrealistically low which effectively allowed the optimization to run indefinitely to allow a user based decision on whether it has converged sufficiently in practice the convergence criteria could however be set to reflect the levels of noise from the aem system if known 3 results 3 1 aem sensitivity to estimated chloride distributions the 3d vdg model was first run for 60 years to understand the length of time needed for chloride changes to be detected by the aem system at each time step and indeed the sensitivity of the aem method to the transient effects in general to understand this quantitatively each time step of the resulting 3d vdg model was geophysically forward modelled using the method outlined in section 2 where successive time steps were compared quantitatively to the first model as relative mean absolute error the 5 red horizontal line in fig 4 represents an approximation of aem noise levels thereby providing a rough indication of required groundwater chloride movements before there is enough signal for a second survey to measure meaningful differences from fig 4 it follows that prior to 5 years a repeat survey would likely fall within the estimated noise range indicating that a repeat survey in this instance would fail to effectively map differences after 15 years or 30 time steps the slope gradient decreases after an initial sharp increase to 7 5 difference therefore in the following the time period between zero and 15 years was used to simulate the two surveys and ultimately guide the optimization in a real setting localized ground measurements over time and geophysical forward modelling could be used to estimate if there is likely to be enough signal for a repeat aem to be useful 3 2 estimated parameters the optimization ran for 250 iterations for 15 3d vdg simulated years per iteration taking on average five hours per iteration and 2 months to complete on a standard desktop pc with four processing cores the 3d vdg model simulation was by far the most computationally intensive step with the geophysical forward modelling inversion 3d interpolation and petrophysical transforms step only taking around half an hour in total per iteration the optimization results at each iteration are highlighted in fig 5 as the kh kv ratio was kept constant only the kh values are shown for the aquifers and aquitards here it is apparent that there were two local minima 1 between iterations 20 50 and 2 between 100 170 both of which were successfully avoided by the algorithm predictably changes in rmse correlated well to changes in model parameters and showed that the steps between each iteration were appropriately sized and generally sensitive to the objective function this is despite the fact that smaller changes in chloride distributions were not resolved as a result of the aem simulation the effect of which is highlighted in fig 6 quantitative results based on the final iteration table 4 suggest that each of the parameters were either successfully predicted or were improved considerably over the course of the optimization 3 3 estimated chloride distributions qualitative results of chloride distributions at t1 are presented in fig 6 showing the synthetic reality on row 1 a and 1 b for the aem salinity and 3d vdg models respectively followed by the results of the optimization with the results of the first iteration on row 2 the last iteration on row 3 and the difference between the last iteration and the synthetic reality in row 4 comparing the chloride distributions between the aem and the 3d vdg models in general columns a and b respectively it is clear that the aem simulation successfully mapped the locations of larger features such as upconing of saline groundwater and freshwater lenses smaller features 200 m across were not successfully resolved given the footprint of the aem system and the loss of resolution during the 3d interpolation of ecb values in these areas the features have been smoothed out effectively creating a vertically thicker brackish zone instead it was also observed that the optimization successfully managed to recreate the synthetic realities chloride distribution by the final iteration the difference between the aem synthetic reality fig 6 1a and the aem final iteration fig 6 3a is larger than the differences between that of the 3d vdg models this is likely due to the 5 noise added in the geophysical modelling step and appears to cause uncertainty regarding the location of the fresh saline interface despite this error the 3d vdg model was able to dynamically downscale the smoothed features observed in the aem surveys fig 7 shows a 3d image of the final estimated aem chloride distribution and the differences between the initial and final iteration thereof the observed differences in salinity clearly show the zones where the chloride distribution was updated by the calibration process 4 discussion given the exploratory nature of this study several necessary simplifications were made as a result of these simplifications in the following we will first discuss sources of uncertainty and their potential effects on our results followed by a discussion of the optimization method finally we mention thoughts on practicalities followed by potential for further research in this twin experiment we assumed that the synthetic model correctly describes reality this assumption applies to the physics of the simulated aem survey itself as well as the magnitude of groundwater transport over time based on the 3d vdg model in the case of the aem survey we assumed that the chloride distributions were mapped with similar physical limitations to an actual survey a major cause of this uncertainty is that we used a 1d geophysical forward and inverse modelling tool for a 3d problem auken et al 2005 effectively removing 3d effects on the signal although there are 3d aem geophysical modelling tools available e g cox et al 2012 it was found that using these tools would lead to considerably longer iteration times on an already computationally expensive task instead we added 5 gaussian noise which is considered an upper estimate of noise siemon 2012 as well as simulating a 100 m footprint at measurement location reid et al 2006 yin et al 2014 these steps effectively tested the robustness of repeat aem surveys while maintaining reasonable optimization run times for the 3d vdg model simulation we sought a careful balance between a realistic model while ensuring that there was sufficient signal for the optimization to work with based on a combination of using real subsurface data and known parameters which were taken from an applied study mulder et al 2020 as well as the groundwater modelling experience of the authors we feel that the model describes reality to an acceptable level for meaningful conclusions an additional source of uncertainty is that we assume knowledge of parameter values and locations of the other hydrogeological parameters such as the interaction between groundwater and drainage via the so called drain resistance and the locations of aquitards and aquifers we suggest that a simple way to examine the effect of keeping unknown parameter values constant would be to add noise to those that are not part of the optimization where permitted deviations could be based on known uncertainty levels the same could be said for the spatial distribution of clay and sand units allowing the locations thereof to change based on given noise thresholds the results of implementing this could then be used to determine quantitively the effect of these assumptions ideally all uncertainties should have been included in the optimization as a fully heterogeneous 3d model in this study however we chose to keep our method simple owing in part to the already high computational burden discussed below as well the fact that this is presented as a proof of concept thus further complexity is considered subject for further study besides correctly describing reality uncertainty exists in both the type of geophysical inversion used as well as the petrophysical transformation i e to transform from ecb to salinity and vice versa recent research highlights this where it was found that the petrophysical transformation introduced the most uncertainty and that overall incorrect handling of these two features can result in the mapping of an overly thick brackish zone gonzález quirós and comte 2020 the deterministic method used here suffers from non uniqueness where an infinite number of models can explain the data in these cases regularization constrains the inversion typically resulting in smooth models arsenin 1979 constable 1987 one way to explore this effect is stochastic inversion where a prior model is used instead of regularization e g minsley 2011 minsley et al 2020 in this study we used a single inversion method as a necessity given the computational burden of stochastic inversion furthermore in this synthetic study we assume that the lithology is known and that we estimate the properties of only the high and low permeability sediments in real applications the efficacy of the aem system for mapping similar shallow fresh saline groundwater distributions using the same geophysical inversion method was quantitatively validated recently in delsman et al 2018 as a result we feel that on balance our approach was valid for this study with the petrophysical model we settled on the simpler apparent ff without using surface conductivities for a number of reasons first these values were derived from an actual local field study and thus offered a good realistic approximation for the study area second lithologies such as peat and clay that could introduce error were only present as 1 4 and 6 2 of the total model volume respectively as a result we felt that additional uncertainty introduced when finding appropriate values for surface conductivity negated the use of local representative data it is however recommended that this step is taken with care in other use cases given the propensity for incorrectly used petrophysical models to introduce non physical error into hydrogeophysical models gonzález quirós and comte 2020 the ecb gradient is strongly controlled by fresh saline groundwater contrasts an effect also observed clearly in local ecb ground measurements as such despite potential error introduced in the petrophysical transformation and inversion the relative magnitude of signal changes over time were considered sufficient to drive the optimization and were a good enough approximation for our purposes overall as the time lapse approach presented here is new we recommend that future research focusses on a global uncertainty analysis having a better quantitative grasp on what this means for practical mapping outcomes would be a useful step and potentially highlight methods to reduce uncertainty for example the use of in situ salinity data for the purposes of this study however we feel that the potential use of repeated airborne surveys was effectively proven given the highly realistic nature of our 3 d synthetic model the downhill simplex optimization method used here gao and han 2012 nelder and mead 1965 was selected for its simplicity and ability to handle highly dimensional problems despite the successes of using the method in this study in a practical rather than exploratory setting we suggest that other methods are considered this is recommended for two reasons 1 the optimization was impractically slow to find a solution and 2 the addition of other parameters would increase the likelihood of the downhill simplex arriving at a local minimum especially given its sensitivity to the choice of initial guesses wang and shoup 2011 as the 3d vdg model computation step cost 5 h per iteration one could simply run this step externally on large computational clusters using imod seawat which utilizes distributed memory parallelization for faster computation times verkaik et al 2021 in a practical setting however we suggest fully parallelizing the optimization itself using methods such as evolutionary algorithms brauer et al 2002 mühlenbein et al 1991 and parallel bayesian optimization e g gonzález et al 2015 kandasamy et al 2017 where function evaluations can be done in parallel rather than sequentially the latter approach has been successfully used in hydrocarbon reservoir modelling e g abdollahzadeh et al 2011 where similar to the optimization used in this study inverse problems are solved that require multiple flow simulations which are more computationally expensive compared to our problem we consider the implementation of this an important avenue for future research given the possibility to parameterize fully heterogeneous models finally while the results of this research highlight the usefulness of two aem surveys in time we find it necessary to discuss these results against 3d hydrogeological inverse models that utilize different data configurations for example a single aem survey or even multiple sources of in situ head and salinity data unlike this study in these cases there isn t a complete picture of a groundwater state at two time intervals in 3d as a result an inverse modelling routine relies on a conceptualized version of the past based on prior knowledge followed by a history matching routine until the chloride distribution is matched with acceptable accuracy to available data this has the disadvantage that owing to the large inertia of fresh salt groundwater systems simulations have to start far back in the past sometimes hundreds to thousands of years back meyer et al 2019 delsman et al 2014 apart from being highly computationally expensive in practice requiring massively parallel computing it also requires knowledge of boundary conditions from the distance past adding considerable uncertainty and requiring extensive research nevertheless we believe that a quantitative comparison between history matching to a single aem survey and optimizing between two in a similar experiment would be useful as future research 5 conclusions using a twin experiment involving two highly detailed synthetic realities and simulated airborne electromagnetic aem surveys it was successfully demonstrated that it is possible to jointly estimate groundwater salinity and hydrogeological parameters in a real application this could be achieved using a combination of two aem surveys flown across the same area over two periods in time and a variable density groundwater flow and salt transport 3d vdg model by coupling aem and 3d vdg models using geophysical forward modelling methods it was shown that two aem surveys are sensitive to changing groundwater chloride distributions over time despite a significant loss of resolution as a result of the survey process itself in doing so it was also demonstrated that the time needed for chloride movements to be sensitive to aem can be attained quantitatively given the knowledge of sensitivities it followed that an optimization method could be used to recover hydrogeological properties using 3d vdg with this in mind a simple optimization process was implemented to resolve hydrogeological parameters of interest while at the same time producing a physically consistent estimate of the chloride distribution at higher spatial resolution then the aem surveys credit

206,the horizontal reactive media treatment hrx well is a novel technology for in situ treatment of contaminated groundwater the most significant technical performance risk associated with field scale implementation of the hrx well is the potential for water to bypass the well untreated therefore the groundwater capture simulation plays a very important role in the design of the hrx well we build a model based on a cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim for simulating groundwater flow captured by the hrx well in both 3d test pit pilot scale and field scale this method is compared with the finite element method and measured values capture width and groundwater velocity obtained by cs rpim are consistent with the measured values we further develop matlab software modules to analyze the effects of the hydraulic conductivities dimension of well and other parameters on the groundwater capture zone velocity and residence time in the reactive media the results show that increase of well diameter has a significant effect on enlargement of the capture zone and the extension of media treatment time when well diameter increases by 100 horizontal and vertical capture width increase by 57 and 50 respectively and media treatment time can be extended by 68 keywords horizontal reactive media well cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method groundwater flow galerkin weak form 1 introduction in groundwater remediation the conventional approach to clean up groundwater involves the use of vertical wells to penetrate the contaminated areas in the subsurface however with advances in horizontal well drilling there has been an increase in use of horizontal wells in groundwater remediation due to certain advantages zhan and zlotnik 2002 chen et al 2003 horizontal wells screens can range from tens of feet to hundreds of feet long compared to vertical wells that consist of much smaller foot sections of screen most groundwater contaminant plumes are long and wide in nature zhan 1999 thus the well screen of horizontal wells creates a larger contact area between the impacted groundwater and the well resulting in expedited cleanup thus it will require multiple vertical wells to achieve the same linear footage of well screen in contact with impacted groundwater as a few horizontal wells zhan and zlotnik 2002 kompani zare et al 2005 this benefit of horizontal wells potentially reduces the cost associated with installing operating and maintaining multiple vertical wells studies using passive wells have indicated that various parameters such as the type of reactive media within the well and its hydraulic conductivity well geometry diameter well length well spacing and the number of wells influence their hydraulic performance and effectiveness in treating contaminants bortone et al 2013 hudak 2017 hudak and hosseini et al also addressed the effect of the aquifer heterogeneity and complexity on groundwater flow path contaminant distribution containment and removal hudak 2017 hosseini et al 2018 the hrx well is a novel in situ groundwater remediation technology that involves the emplacement of a large diameter horizontally drilled well filled with a reactive media within a contaminant plume divine et al 2018a b 2020 the well is installed in the direction of groundwater flow and due to the contrast in the well to aquifer permeability hydraulic conductivity flow is focused in the well divine et al 2013 2018a 2020 causing an extensive area of impacted groundwater to passively flow into the screened well via the upgradient section of the well contaminants present in the groundwater are treated or removed by the reactive media the treated groundwater leaves the well via the screen along the down gradient sections of the well the hrx well requires no above ground treatment or ongoing operation and maintenance but it rapidly reduces contaminant mass flux in the subsurface although horizontal wells offer practical advantages over vertical wells there have been concerns on the cost associated with drilling and installing horizontal wells therefore hydraulic performance simulation of the well is crucial however little literature divine et al 2018a b to date exists addressing the hydraulic performance of groundwater captured by the passive horizontal well in divine et al 2018a the effects of the well diameter and aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture width are roughly estimated by using simple algebraic formulas derived from darcy s law whitaker 1986 in this paper a cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim based on tetrahedral background mesh is applied to simulate groundwater flow captured by the hrx well with the actual structure the smoothed radial point interpolation method s rpim is a weakened weak form method based on radial basis functions rbfs liu and zhang 2013 it is a combination of finite element method fem and meshless method s rpim not only retains the stability of fem but also overcomes some of the shortcomings of fem compared to fem the weakened weak form allows s rpim to have the same freedom as the pure meshless methods in choosing support points without worrying about the compatibility issues which we do in the standard weak formulation this feature also makes s rpim more robust and more accurate than fem based on the same triangular 2d or tetrahedral 3d mesh cui et al 2010a zhang and liu 2011 hamrani et al 2017 in s rpim the moment matrix based on some proper rbfs is nonsingular however in fem moment matrix based on polynomial for creating shape function may be singular and simulation process can fail compared to the strong form pure meshless methods s rpim is more stable less sensitive to shape parameters of rbfs and has a more rigorous theoretical basis for stability and convergence liu and zhang 2009 liu 2010a b yue et al 2016 according to the types of the smooth domain the s rpim can be divided into the node based smoothed radial point interpolation method ns rpim liu et al 2006 the edge based smoothed radial point interpolation method es rpim liu and zhang 2008 he et al 2014 and the cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim cui et al 2010b among them the cs rpim has been used in the static and free vibration analysis of solids cui et al 2010a b fracture problems liu et al 2011 three dimensional solid mechanics problems liu et al 2013 cui et al 2015 acoustic problems yao et al 2012 and heat transfer analysis cui et al 2014 in addition its effectiveness and efficiency in application of coupled problems in porous media have also been verified tootoonchi et al 2016 khoshghalb et al 2020 the simulation of this project has some challenges in building the model on one hand the structure of the real well is complex and on the other hand the hydraulic conductivity of different materials varies since tetrahedral mesh can be generated automatically and cs rpim is not sensitive to the quality of background mesh using the proposed model the structure and dimension of the hrx well can be freely changed furthermore the cell based local smoothing domains make it an ideal way for handling groundwater flow simulation in the environment with varying hydraulic conductivities because we only need to ensure that the hydraulic conductivity in one cell is the same in addition on this basis we also propose a support nodes selection scheme to deal with the complex hydraulic conductivity domain to validate the capture width of the hrx well the controlled field pilot scale study pss was conducted at a field site at clarkson university potsdam new york in a hydraulically isolated test pit this method is compared with the measured values and the fem results in the test pit we also develop software modules based on matlab for simulating hydraulic capture visualizing groundwater flow streamlines contour plots capture zone and calculating flow velocities resident time in media they can be used by engineers for designing the hrx well we further use the software modules to analyze effects of hydraulic conductivities of media and aquifer dimension of every portion of the well and other factors on the groundwater capture zone groundwater flow velocity and treatment time of the field scale hrx well these simulations and analyses have significant reference value for hrx well design 2 cs rpim model for hrx well hydraulic capture simulation the objective of this work is to simulate hydraulic capture of the hrx well the numerical model of the whole problem will be built in this section 2 1 problem description the groundwater flow equation without source term is wang and anderson 1995 igboekwe et al 2011 2 1 s s h t q x ω x x y z ω is the whole aquifer with well in it h is the hydraulic head that we need to evaluate s s is the specific storage and q is the flux vector defined as 2 2 q q x q y q z t where q x q y and q z are flux along x y and z coordinate axes is the gradient operator defined as 2 3 x y z t using darcy s law darcy 1856 whitaker 1986 the above equation can be rewritten as 2 4 s s h t k h x ω where k is the hydraulic conductivity matrix defined as 2 5 k k x 0 0 0 k y 0 0 0 k z where k x k y and k z are the values of hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes here we simulate the steady state form of the groundwater flow treated by the hrx well so the governing equation becomes 2 6 k h 0 x ω where ω denotes the aquifer in which the hrx well is installed we use fig 1 to illustrate boundary conditions the left and right faces are both dirichlet boundary conditions as 2 7 h x h l x ω 1 2 8 h x h r x ω 2 where h l h r so the groundwater flows from left to right along the positive direction of y axis the other four boundary faces of the aquifer are all zero flux neumann s boundary conditions 2 9 h x n 0 x ω 3 entire well is a curved cylinder with an uniform diameter fig 1 shows segments of the whole well to be more clear different colors are used to indicate different parts the sealed well casing is in gray color screen is in blue reactive media is in yellow and hollow part of the well is in green the hrx well casing is no flux neumann s boundary as shown in eq 2 9 the screen portion on each side is a combination of a slanted cylinder and a horizontal cylinder connected by an elbow the inlet screen portion is followed by horizontal sealed well and the horizontal well is attached by the outlet screen the sealed horizontal well is filled with reactive media at both ends the horizontal well is designed to have cartridges filled with the reactive media emplaced in the center of the well to aid in replacement or manipulation of the reactive media hence there will be an empty section of the well that does not contain these cartridges groundwater flow can be captured by inlet screen and reactive horizontal well because the in well hydraulic conductivity is higher than aquifer hydraulic conductivity groundwater flows into the well through the screen of the up gradient portion of the well and is treated in situ as it flows through the hrx well the treated ground water then exits the well through the screen along the down gradient section 2 2 generalized smoothed galerkin weak form we simulate the hydraulic capture of the hrx well using the cs rpim liu and zhang 2009 zhang and liu 2011 cui et al 2014 liu and zhang 2013 to solve the problem 2 6 2 9 first apply the galerkin weak form to governing eq 2 6 we have 2 10 ω δ h t k h 0 where δ h is the hydraulic head variation perform gauss divergence theorem ciarlet 2002 ern and guermond 2013 to eq 2 10 and apply boundary condition 2 9 eq 2 10 can be written as 2 11 ω δ h t k h d ω 0 so far the whole process is the standard galerkin weak procedure ciarlet 2002 ern and guermond 2013 weakened weak w2 forms are relatively new formulation liu 2010a b in addition to the construction of governing equation weak form the generalized smoothed galerkin weak form is applied to weaken consistency of the approximated function again using cs rpim the hydraulic head gradient h is smoothed based on the cell based smoothing domain the cell based smoothing domains ω i s i 1 2 n s are exactly the tetrahedral background cells which means each tetrahedral cell is a smoothing domain note that n s smoothing domains are nonoverlapping and seamless such that ω i 1 n s ω i s and ω i s ω j s 0 i j using the generalized galerkin gradient smoothing technique liu 2008 the smoothed hydraulic head gradient over the i th smoothing domain ω i s is given by 2 12 ɛ i ω i s h 1 v i s d ω where v i s is volume of ω i s the hydraulic head h in ω i s with n s support nodes is approximated by 2 13 h φ h i where φ is the shape function vector the details of the construction of the shape function will be elaborated later h i is the vector of numerical solutions at all the n s support nodes of the i th smoothing domain 2 14 h i h i x 1 h i x n s combining eqs 2 12 and 2 13 and applying gauss divergence theorem we have liu and zhang 2013 2 15 ɛ i ω i s φ h i 1 v i s d ω 1 v i s γ i s l n i φ h i d γ 1 v i s k 1 n i f γ i k s l n i k φ d γ h i b i h i where γ i k s is the k th face of the i th smoothing domain l n i k is the matrix of outwards normal components on γ i k s 2 16 l n i k n x i k n y i k n z i k n i f is the number of faces of the smoothing domain ω i s so n i f 4 for the tetrahedral cell in fact gaussian quadrature cowper 1973 is used to do integral on the face as follows liu and zhang 2013 2 17 γ i k s l n i k φ d γ j 1 n g w j l n i k φ x j g where n g is the number of gaussian points on the face x j g is the j th gaussian point and w j is the weight of gaussian point x j g replacing h in eq 2 11 with smoothed head gradient in 2 15 we can get the global smoothed conductance matrix by assembling local matrices as 2 18 g i 1 n s ω i s b i t k i b i d ω i 1 n s v i s b i t k i b i where k i is the hydraulic conductivity matrix in the smoothing domain ω i s then the system of the problem becomes 2 19 g h 0 after applying dirichlet boundary conditions 2 7 2 8 we can get hydraulic heads on all the nodes by solving the system once the hydraulic head at each point is obtained the groundwater flow velocity at any point can also be calculated using the following formula mazor and nativ 1992 2 20 v d k d i d p where i d is the hydraulic gradient in d direction between two points 2 21 i d δ h δ d d x y z δ d is distance in d direction between two points and δ h is the difference of their hydraulic heads k d is the hydraulic conductivity along d direction p is the effective porosity then the average residence time t m of groundwater flow within the media can be approximated by 2 22 2 22 t m l m v m y where l m is the length of the whole media v m y is the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media 2 3 construction of rpim shape functions we use multiquadric mq φ r r 2 c 2 with linear polynomial as basis to build the shape function φ x where r is the euclidean distance between two points c is the shape parameter for an interested point x the hydraulic head at this point can be approximated by interpolating n s support nodes x j j 1 2 n s of x as follows liu and gu 2005 liu and zhang 2013 2 23 h x φ 1 φ n s 1 x y z a b φ a p b where φ φ 1 φ n s φ j x x j 2 c 2 p 1 x y z a a 1 a n s t and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 t to get the coefficients we enforce the hydraulic head function to be satisfied at each support node x j j 1 n s in above equation to get 2 24 r n s p n s a b h n s where 2 25 r n s φ 11 φ 1 n s φ n s 1 φ n s n s 2 26 p n s 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x n s y n s z n s and h n s is the vector of hydraulic head function values at x s support nodes to guarantee a unique approximation the following extra requirements should be satisfied 2 27 p n s t a 0 from eqs 2 24 and 2 27 we have 2 28 r n s p n s p n s t 0 a b h n s 0 then we can get the coefficients by solving above equations here we use an efficient way proposed in liu and zhang 2013 to calculate the coefficients as 2 29 a s a h n s b s b h n s where 2 30 s b p n s t r n s 1 p n s 1 p n s t r n s 1 2 31 s a r n s 1 r n s 1 p n s s b therefore the approximated head function can be written as 2 32 h x r t s a p t s b h n s and the rpim shape function is 2 33 φ x r t s a p t s b 2 4 support nodes selection scheme tetrahedral meshes are generated by tetgen fig 2 shows the cross section of the aquifer and the well sliced parallel to the well different materials are distinguished by different colors since different materials have different hydraulic conductivity values hydraulic conductivities of aquifer red screen blue reactive media yellow and empty well green are different however the hydraulic conductivity in one tetrahedron cell is constant support nodes selection scheme can be different according to different basis functions and problems to be solved cui et al 2010b zhang and liu 2011 liu and zhang 2013 in this problem domain composed of different materials to guarantee the support nodes of a quadrature gauss point are in or on the same material domain we have different support nodes selection schemes for different types of faces the gauss points are on if two cells adjacent to the face are in the same material domain we call this face the interior face if the gauss point x g is on the interior face as shown in fig 3 the support nodes are the vertices of its two neighboring cells if the gauss point x g is on the interface between two different materials shown in fig 4 or on the boundary of the whole domain shown in fig 5 the support nodes are the three vertices of the home face in this case the shape functions are linear and 2 17 becomes 2 34 γ i k s l n i k φ d γ l n i k a i k 1 3 1 3 1 3 where a i k is the area of the k th interface or boundary face of the i th smoothing domain 3 test pit pilot scale experiments in this section we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the cs rpim results with the measurement results and fem numerical results 3 1 hrx well in the test pit the controlled field pilot scale study of the hrx well was conducted at a field site at clarkson university in a hydraulically isolated test pit the pictures of hrx well and dimension of the well are shown in fig 6 the pit is a representation of a relatively homogeneous sand aquifer and was excavated to dimensions of 20 ft long by 6 ft wide by 6 ft deep onwards the test pit will be described as the aquifer the aquifer was isolated from the surrounding media by a pond liner the horizontal well is fixed in the center of the pit with a depth of 3 ft below ground surface the diameter of the well is 2 3 ft the length of the horizontal part of the well is 8 ft and two reactive media cartridges inside both ends of the horizontal well case are each 3 feet long the length of empty section between two reactive media cartridges is 2 ft the angle of entry at the up gradient and down gradient portions of the well are both 135 as shown in fig 6 to monitor the pressure water head in the aquifer an array of 40 piezometers were installed at different heights across and along the aquifer in this test pit since the aquifer sand media and screen are all isotropic hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer reactive media screen and empty part of the well satisfy k x k y k z the hydraulic heads on ω 1 and ω 2 are h l 6 ft and h r 4 5 ft respectively the hydraulic conductivities and porosities of the aquifer and each portion of the well are listed in table 1 3 2 comparison of capture width we use cs rpim to simulate the groundwater flow captured by this well in the test pit and compare the results with measured values and fem numerical results the shape parameter c in the mq radial basis function φ r r 2 c 2 is the nearest distance of two mesh nodes fig 7 shows a contour plot and stream lines of groundwater flow on the cross section z 3 ft by cs rpim simulation based on 30981 nodes the colorbar on the right of the figure represents the hydraulic head values of the contour plot capture zone is enclosed by red stream lines the horizontal well consists of media sections in yellow and hollow section in green based on measured hydraulic head values and interpolation between measured points the maximum capture width of the well was estimated as about 3 3 ft from the cs rpim simulation results the capture width shown in fig 7 is 3 3 ft which is consistent with the measured capture width by darcy s law the average capture width is represented as whitaker 1986 divine et al 2018a b 3 1 w a v e q a v e k a b a i a k m π r h 2 k a b a where k a and k m are the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer sand and reactive media i a is the average hydraulic gradient of aquifer b a is the aquifer thickness r h is the radius of the well q a v e is the volumetric flow rate through the well and is given by 3 2 q a v e k m π r h 2 i h in which i h is the average hydraulic gradient of the well eq 3 1 is obtained by assuming i a i h h l h r l a where l a is the length of aquifer based on the values in table 1 and the size of aquifer and well the calculated average capture width calculated by eq 3 1 is 5 25 ft taking the capture width measured from test pit as the reference this calculated capture width is far less accurate than the simulation capture width this is due to several reasons the structure of the well is complicated and hydraulic conductivities are different in different portions of the well the average hydraulic gradient of well in fact is not equal to that of the aquifer according to fig 7 therefore the capture width cannot be simply estimated by eq 3 1 which also reflects the significance of the numerical simulation 3 3 comparison of hydraulic head the root mean square error ε r m s and relative error ε r are used to compare numerical results with measured results quantitatively ε r m s 1 n h x h x 2 ε r h x h x 2 h x 2 where h x is a vector of the measured heads h is a vector of numerical heads obtained by cs rpim or fem n is the total number of interpolation points through fem and cs rpim simulation based on n 7361 mesh nodes we get hydraulic heads with different test pit hydraulic gradients and compare with the measured values the different test pit hydraulic gradients i a 0 017 0 033 0 042 0 05 0 075 are achieved by setting different right hand side dirichlet boundary condition h r 5 67 5 33 5 17 5 4 5 ft from fig 8 we can see the hydraulic head relative errors of both numerical methods are almost the same in addition relative errors of cs rpim are slightly lower than fem when hydraulic gradient i a 0 033 0 042 0 05 the incorporation of domains beyond the depths where measurements and mapping are possible or available may have played a role in the differences between the measured and numerical model results factors other than the boundary conditions such as measurement errors aquifer characterization and operating parameters may have influenced the uniformity of results obtained from the test pit measurements and numerical simulations transient stress such as infiltration pumping and change in weather cycles which were not simulated in the models may also contribute to the differences in obtained results furthermore we take the results obtained by fem based on 631076 nodes as the reference hydraulic heads to evaluate effectiveness of cs rpim for solving this problem as shown in fig 9 cs rpim is more accurate than fem based on the same mesh both methods converge with the refinement of the mesh the convergence rate of fem is 1 34 whereas the convergence rate of cs rpim is 2 84 table 2 shows errors of cs rpim and fem of this example all in all cs rpim have higher accuracy and convergence rate than fem for solving this problem based on the same tetrahedron mesh cs rpim takes more cpu time than fem this is because many calculations including shape function jacobian matrix and gaussian quadrature integration are avoided in the program of linear fem to improve the accuracy of fem hexahedron mesh need to be used however on one hand high quality hexahedron mesh cannot be automatically generated on the other hand for hexahedron based fem the computation of shape function jacobian matrix and integration is expensive furthermore from table 2 we can see even though cs rpim takes more cpu time than fem using same number of nodes fem actually requires more time than cs rpim to achieve competitive accuracy with cs rpim for example fem takes 757 s to get a 5 49 e 4 error while cs rpim takes 81 s to reach the 4 45 e 4 error 3 4 comparison of velocity we also compare groundwater flow velocities in the test pit with different hydraulic gradients from fig 10 we can see the numerical flow velocity in media increases as the hydraulic gradient increases which matches the measured velocity in media cs rpim simulation results are closer to the measured values than fem based on the same mesh in addition according to the on site experimental results measured capture width does not change with varying hydraulic gradient from fig 11 we can see the capture width also does not change as the hydraulic gradient of aquifer changes 4 software modules development we develop three software modules based on matlab tetgen input file generating module cs rpim simulation module output module the whole process can be expressed in chart 12 as shown in fig 1 the whole well is divided into five parts inlet screen inlet reactive media empty part which is between reactive media parts outlet reactive media and outlet screen engineers can input values of parameters width length and depth of the aquifer x and y coordinates of the well center depth of the well well diameter length of each well segment drilling degree of the well hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities of aquifer media screen and empty part and dirichlet boundary conditions we develop a matlab module to write the tetgen poly input file based on input parameters we first locate some coarse grid points on boudaries and interfaces then define faces according to these points and assign the face marker to each face finally we assign the attribute to each region divided by faces after writing all these information the input poly file stores attributes of nodes and different regions markers of faces and boundaries and other information for tetgen generating quality tetrahedral meshes this matlab module is available at https github com wenlimath2 hrx well generating tetgen input file git after obtaining the tetgen input poly file we use the tetgen command line with a set of switches followed by poly input file to read the information and description stored in the poly file control the behavior of tetgen generate tetrahedral meshes and specify the output files the switches we usually use are as follows si 2015 p switch generates tetrahedral meshes using delaunay tetrahedralization q switch improves mesh quality a assigns attributes to tetrahedra in different regions a applies a maximum tetrahedron volume constraint the switches e and f output all edges to edge file and all faces to face file in addition the default output files of tetgen also include element ele file and node node file these files will be used as the input files of cs rpim simulation module the tetgen output files we used in test pit simulation are also available at the above github pape in the cs rpim module based on the above tetgen output files we first establish the connectivities between nodes edges faces and elements next cs rpim described in section 2 is used to get hydraulic heads of all the mesh points in the output module flow velocities and resident time in media are calculated by eqs 2 20 and 2 22 the groundwater flow streamlines contour plots and capture zone can be visualized by pictures 5 field scale numerical investigation the effectiveness of cs rpim is verified through the analysis of the test pit numerical experiment to help engineers design the hrx well for groundwater remediation we do field scale numerical investigation to reveal the effects of well dimension hydraulic conductivities average hydraulic gradient and anisotropy of aquifer on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in media for the field scale problem we do not have a test pit with a fixed length of aquifer to determine the length of aquifer ω we first test the effect of aquifer length on capture zone the length of the test pit is increased to 60 ft and the average hydraulic gradient is 0 075 fig 13 shows the capture zone in 60 ft test pit compare to fig 7 which shows the capture zone in the 20 ft inches length and 0 075 average hydraulic gradient test pit the capture width in this longer test pit does not change in addition the effect of width and depth of the test pit on the capture zone is also analyzed as shown in fig 14 the capture width of the hrx well in wider and deeper test pit does not have obvious change either therefore length and width of aquifer have little effect on the capture width the values of all the parameters in table 3 can be changed in our program to generate tetgen input file for constructing tetrahedron meshes table 3 shows parameters values for field scale aquifer and hrx well because of the bedding structure of natural aquifer the vertical aquifer hydraulic conductivity is much smaller than the horizontal conductivity here k z 0 1 k x in the following cases we will change the value of one of the parameters in table 3 and analyze the their effects on results case 1 effect of well diameter on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we first change the diameter of the well from 1 ft to 2 ft the simulation results are shown in fig 15 the upper two figures in fig 15 are groundwater stream slices contour plots and the capture zone of the 1 ft diameter reference well on cross section z 30 ft and x 50 ft the capture width significantly increases from 33 8 ft to 53 3 ft on cross section z 30 and increases from 46 ft to 68 8 ft on cross section x 50 ft in this case by 2 20 v m y 0 32 ft h in the 1 ft diameter well and v m y 0 19 ft h in the 2 ft diameter well since l m 50 ft by 2 22 t m 155 81 h in the 1 ft diameter well and t m 261 92 h in the 2 ft diameter well therefore we conclude that the capture width increases as the well diameter increases meanwhile groundwater velocity in the media decreases and the groundwater flow can stay longer in the media to get treated case 2 effect of reactive media length on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we shorten the length of reactive media from 25 ft to 10 ft on each side from fig 16 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 41 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 51 2 ft however since the average velocity v m y of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 41 ft h and the length of media is shortened the average residence time t m of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 48 48 h case 3 effect of screen length on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the length of horizontal screen from 10 ft to 20 ft on each side from fig 17 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 44 9 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 50 ft on the other hand the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media slightly increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 35 ft h therefore the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 143 39 h case 4 effect of length of empty part of the well on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we shorten the length of empty part between media from 50 ft to 25 ft from fig 18 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft decreases from 33 8 ft to 30 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft decreases from 46 ft to 40 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 28 ft h so the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 177 87 h case 5 effect of media hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we increase the hydraulic conductivity of media from 7 5 ft h to 15 ft h from fig 19 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 45 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 51 3 ft however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 46 ft h therefore the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 109 46 h case 6 effect of aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in the media we reduce the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer from 1 46 1 0 2 ft h to 7 1 0 3 ft h the vertical hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is reduced from k z 1 46 1 0 3 ft h to k z 7 1 0 4 ft h accordingly from fig 20 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 43 5 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 57 9 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 24 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 205 68 h case 7 effect of the anisotropy ratio of aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the ratio of aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity to horizontal hydraulic conductivity k z k x from 0 1 to 0 01 from fig 21 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft is slightly widened from 33 8 ft to 35 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft significantly increases from 46 ft to 58 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 28 ft h so the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 181 23 h case 8 effect of hydraulic gradient on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the hydraulic heads on the right boundary from 85 ft to 87 5 ft so that the hydraulic gradient decreases from 0 01 to 0 005 just like the conclusion obtained in the test pit simulation the capture zone does not change as hydraulic gradient changes however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 16 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 311 72 h case 9 effect of length of aquifer on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the length of aquifer from 500 ft to 1000 ft whereas the average hydraulic gradient of aquifer does not change by assigning h l 92 5 ft and h r 82 5 ft in this situation the capture zone does not change just as the test pit simulation results however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y slightly decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 316 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media is slightly extended from 155 81 h to 158 43 h to be clearer we define a relative change ratio r e in 5 1 to summarize the above numerical investigation results 5 1 r e δ η η δ γ γ where η could be one of these numerical results capture width on z 30 ft or on x 50 ft v m y t m one of these parameters well diameter media length screen length empty part length media hydraulic conductivity k m horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer k a anisotropy ratio of aquifer hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient aquifer length is represented by γ for example if η is t m and γ is k m then r e δ t m t m δ k m k m means that when hydraulic conductivity of media k m increases by 100 t m increases r e is positive or decreases r e is negative by r e table 4 shows relative change ratios of all the numerical results to every parameter in summary the operations that can result in an expansion of the capture zone include increases in well diameter screen length empty section length media hydraulic conductivity and reductions in media length and aquifer hydraulic conductivity among them only increasing the well diameter and reducing the aquifer hydraulic conductivity can prolong the media treatment time 6 conclusion and future work in this paper we investigated the horizontal reactive media treatment hrx well numerically and experimentally the goal is to understand the main factors that effect the capture zones of the hrx well in the field scale through this study we utilize a mathematical model ground water flow equation without source term at the steady state form to simulate the groundwater flow captured by the hrx well based on numerical technique the cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim both the partial differential equation model and the numerical method are not new but the use of both for simulating the hrx well capture zone has significant contribution to our understanding of main factors that affect the performance of the well we construct a controlled field pilot scale study pss which is conducted at a field site at clarkson university potsdam new york in a hydraulically isolated test pit data were collected and compared with our numerical simulations the groundwater velocity and capture width obtained by the cs rpim method are consistent with the experiments results in the test pit the cs rpim results also is consistent with those from the finite element method fem software developed in this paper is available freely on github the main motivation of this paper is to evaluate the impact of well dimensions and other parameters on the groundwater capture zone flow velocity and residence time in the reactive media the comparison between numerical methods and between numerical simulation and field data showed that based on the field scale numerical investigation and relative change ratios in table 4 the most effective way to expand the capture zone and extend the groundwater treatment time is to increase the diameter of the well when well diameter increases by 100 horizontal capture width can be increased by 57 and vertical capture width can be increased by 50 in addition media treatment time can also be extended by 68 although reducing the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer can achieve a comparable effect the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is an uncontrollable factor moreover through lengthening the reactive media by 100 the groundwater treatment time can by extended by 115 but the capture width is reduced by 35 horizontally and 19 vertically these relative change ratios can be further used to optimize hrx well design according to material installation and drilling costs users of the hrx well can modify the shape of the well and properties of the reactive media in the well to simulate and modify their installation design in order to further investigate the efficiency of the hrx well in groundwater contaminant remediation we will simulate contaminant transport based on groundwater velocity we have already obtained in addition current software is not robust enough for user without mathematical and numerical simulation background we aim to develop a more robust simulation package that can be used for engineers or users of the hrx

206,the horizontal reactive media treatment hrx well is a novel technology for in situ treatment of contaminated groundwater the most significant technical performance risk associated with field scale implementation of the hrx well is the potential for water to bypass the well untreated therefore the groundwater capture simulation plays a very important role in the design of the hrx well we build a model based on a cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim for simulating groundwater flow captured by the hrx well in both 3d test pit pilot scale and field scale this method is compared with the finite element method and measured values capture width and groundwater velocity obtained by cs rpim are consistent with the measured values we further develop matlab software modules to analyze the effects of the hydraulic conductivities dimension of well and other parameters on the groundwater capture zone velocity and residence time in the reactive media the results show that increase of well diameter has a significant effect on enlargement of the capture zone and the extension of media treatment time when well diameter increases by 100 horizontal and vertical capture width increase by 57 and 50 respectively and media treatment time can be extended by 68 keywords horizontal reactive media well cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method groundwater flow galerkin weak form 1 introduction in groundwater remediation the conventional approach to clean up groundwater involves the use of vertical wells to penetrate the contaminated areas in the subsurface however with advances in horizontal well drilling there has been an increase in use of horizontal wells in groundwater remediation due to certain advantages zhan and zlotnik 2002 chen et al 2003 horizontal wells screens can range from tens of feet to hundreds of feet long compared to vertical wells that consist of much smaller foot sections of screen most groundwater contaminant plumes are long and wide in nature zhan 1999 thus the well screen of horizontal wells creates a larger contact area between the impacted groundwater and the well resulting in expedited cleanup thus it will require multiple vertical wells to achieve the same linear footage of well screen in contact with impacted groundwater as a few horizontal wells zhan and zlotnik 2002 kompani zare et al 2005 this benefit of horizontal wells potentially reduces the cost associated with installing operating and maintaining multiple vertical wells studies using passive wells have indicated that various parameters such as the type of reactive media within the well and its hydraulic conductivity well geometry diameter well length well spacing and the number of wells influence their hydraulic performance and effectiveness in treating contaminants bortone et al 2013 hudak 2017 hudak and hosseini et al also addressed the effect of the aquifer heterogeneity and complexity on groundwater flow path contaminant distribution containment and removal hudak 2017 hosseini et al 2018 the hrx well is a novel in situ groundwater remediation technology that involves the emplacement of a large diameter horizontally drilled well filled with a reactive media within a contaminant plume divine et al 2018a b 2020 the well is installed in the direction of groundwater flow and due to the contrast in the well to aquifer permeability hydraulic conductivity flow is focused in the well divine et al 2013 2018a 2020 causing an extensive area of impacted groundwater to passively flow into the screened well via the upgradient section of the well contaminants present in the groundwater are treated or removed by the reactive media the treated groundwater leaves the well via the screen along the down gradient sections of the well the hrx well requires no above ground treatment or ongoing operation and maintenance but it rapidly reduces contaminant mass flux in the subsurface although horizontal wells offer practical advantages over vertical wells there have been concerns on the cost associated with drilling and installing horizontal wells therefore hydraulic performance simulation of the well is crucial however little literature divine et al 2018a b to date exists addressing the hydraulic performance of groundwater captured by the passive horizontal well in divine et al 2018a the effects of the well diameter and aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture width are roughly estimated by using simple algebraic formulas derived from darcy s law whitaker 1986 in this paper a cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim based on tetrahedral background mesh is applied to simulate groundwater flow captured by the hrx well with the actual structure the smoothed radial point interpolation method s rpim is a weakened weak form method based on radial basis functions rbfs liu and zhang 2013 it is a combination of finite element method fem and meshless method s rpim not only retains the stability of fem but also overcomes some of the shortcomings of fem compared to fem the weakened weak form allows s rpim to have the same freedom as the pure meshless methods in choosing support points without worrying about the compatibility issues which we do in the standard weak formulation this feature also makes s rpim more robust and more accurate than fem based on the same triangular 2d or tetrahedral 3d mesh cui et al 2010a zhang and liu 2011 hamrani et al 2017 in s rpim the moment matrix based on some proper rbfs is nonsingular however in fem moment matrix based on polynomial for creating shape function may be singular and simulation process can fail compared to the strong form pure meshless methods s rpim is more stable less sensitive to shape parameters of rbfs and has a more rigorous theoretical basis for stability and convergence liu and zhang 2009 liu 2010a b yue et al 2016 according to the types of the smooth domain the s rpim can be divided into the node based smoothed radial point interpolation method ns rpim liu et al 2006 the edge based smoothed radial point interpolation method es rpim liu and zhang 2008 he et al 2014 and the cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim cui et al 2010b among them the cs rpim has been used in the static and free vibration analysis of solids cui et al 2010a b fracture problems liu et al 2011 three dimensional solid mechanics problems liu et al 2013 cui et al 2015 acoustic problems yao et al 2012 and heat transfer analysis cui et al 2014 in addition its effectiveness and efficiency in application of coupled problems in porous media have also been verified tootoonchi et al 2016 khoshghalb et al 2020 the simulation of this project has some challenges in building the model on one hand the structure of the real well is complex and on the other hand the hydraulic conductivity of different materials varies since tetrahedral mesh can be generated automatically and cs rpim is not sensitive to the quality of background mesh using the proposed model the structure and dimension of the hrx well can be freely changed furthermore the cell based local smoothing domains make it an ideal way for handling groundwater flow simulation in the environment with varying hydraulic conductivities because we only need to ensure that the hydraulic conductivity in one cell is the same in addition on this basis we also propose a support nodes selection scheme to deal with the complex hydraulic conductivity domain to validate the capture width of the hrx well the controlled field pilot scale study pss was conducted at a field site at clarkson university potsdam new york in a hydraulically isolated test pit this method is compared with the measured values and the fem results in the test pit we also develop software modules based on matlab for simulating hydraulic capture visualizing groundwater flow streamlines contour plots capture zone and calculating flow velocities resident time in media they can be used by engineers for designing the hrx well we further use the software modules to analyze effects of hydraulic conductivities of media and aquifer dimension of every portion of the well and other factors on the groundwater capture zone groundwater flow velocity and treatment time of the field scale hrx well these simulations and analyses have significant reference value for hrx well design 2 cs rpim model for hrx well hydraulic capture simulation the objective of this work is to simulate hydraulic capture of the hrx well the numerical model of the whole problem will be built in this section 2 1 problem description the groundwater flow equation without source term is wang and anderson 1995 igboekwe et al 2011 2 1 s s h t q x ω x x y z ω is the whole aquifer with well in it h is the hydraulic head that we need to evaluate s s is the specific storage and q is the flux vector defined as 2 2 q q x q y q z t where q x q y and q z are flux along x y and z coordinate axes is the gradient operator defined as 2 3 x y z t using darcy s law darcy 1856 whitaker 1986 the above equation can be rewritten as 2 4 s s h t k h x ω where k is the hydraulic conductivity matrix defined as 2 5 k k x 0 0 0 k y 0 0 0 k z where k x k y and k z are the values of hydraulic conductivity along x y and z axes here we simulate the steady state form of the groundwater flow treated by the hrx well so the governing equation becomes 2 6 k h 0 x ω where ω denotes the aquifer in which the hrx well is installed we use fig 1 to illustrate boundary conditions the left and right faces are both dirichlet boundary conditions as 2 7 h x h l x ω 1 2 8 h x h r x ω 2 where h l h r so the groundwater flows from left to right along the positive direction of y axis the other four boundary faces of the aquifer are all zero flux neumann s boundary conditions 2 9 h x n 0 x ω 3 entire well is a curved cylinder with an uniform diameter fig 1 shows segments of the whole well to be more clear different colors are used to indicate different parts the sealed well casing is in gray color screen is in blue reactive media is in yellow and hollow part of the well is in green the hrx well casing is no flux neumann s boundary as shown in eq 2 9 the screen portion on each side is a combination of a slanted cylinder and a horizontal cylinder connected by an elbow the inlet screen portion is followed by horizontal sealed well and the horizontal well is attached by the outlet screen the sealed horizontal well is filled with reactive media at both ends the horizontal well is designed to have cartridges filled with the reactive media emplaced in the center of the well to aid in replacement or manipulation of the reactive media hence there will be an empty section of the well that does not contain these cartridges groundwater flow can be captured by inlet screen and reactive horizontal well because the in well hydraulic conductivity is higher than aquifer hydraulic conductivity groundwater flows into the well through the screen of the up gradient portion of the well and is treated in situ as it flows through the hrx well the treated ground water then exits the well through the screen along the down gradient section 2 2 generalized smoothed galerkin weak form we simulate the hydraulic capture of the hrx well using the cs rpim liu and zhang 2009 zhang and liu 2011 cui et al 2014 liu and zhang 2013 to solve the problem 2 6 2 9 first apply the galerkin weak form to governing eq 2 6 we have 2 10 ω δ h t k h 0 where δ h is the hydraulic head variation perform gauss divergence theorem ciarlet 2002 ern and guermond 2013 to eq 2 10 and apply boundary condition 2 9 eq 2 10 can be written as 2 11 ω δ h t k h d ω 0 so far the whole process is the standard galerkin weak procedure ciarlet 2002 ern and guermond 2013 weakened weak w2 forms are relatively new formulation liu 2010a b in addition to the construction of governing equation weak form the generalized smoothed galerkin weak form is applied to weaken consistency of the approximated function again using cs rpim the hydraulic head gradient h is smoothed based on the cell based smoothing domain the cell based smoothing domains ω i s i 1 2 n s are exactly the tetrahedral background cells which means each tetrahedral cell is a smoothing domain note that n s smoothing domains are nonoverlapping and seamless such that ω i 1 n s ω i s and ω i s ω j s 0 i j using the generalized galerkin gradient smoothing technique liu 2008 the smoothed hydraulic head gradient over the i th smoothing domain ω i s is given by 2 12 ɛ i ω i s h 1 v i s d ω where v i s is volume of ω i s the hydraulic head h in ω i s with n s support nodes is approximated by 2 13 h φ h i where φ is the shape function vector the details of the construction of the shape function will be elaborated later h i is the vector of numerical solutions at all the n s support nodes of the i th smoothing domain 2 14 h i h i x 1 h i x n s combining eqs 2 12 and 2 13 and applying gauss divergence theorem we have liu and zhang 2013 2 15 ɛ i ω i s φ h i 1 v i s d ω 1 v i s γ i s l n i φ h i d γ 1 v i s k 1 n i f γ i k s l n i k φ d γ h i b i h i where γ i k s is the k th face of the i th smoothing domain l n i k is the matrix of outwards normal components on γ i k s 2 16 l n i k n x i k n y i k n z i k n i f is the number of faces of the smoothing domain ω i s so n i f 4 for the tetrahedral cell in fact gaussian quadrature cowper 1973 is used to do integral on the face as follows liu and zhang 2013 2 17 γ i k s l n i k φ d γ j 1 n g w j l n i k φ x j g where n g is the number of gaussian points on the face x j g is the j th gaussian point and w j is the weight of gaussian point x j g replacing h in eq 2 11 with smoothed head gradient in 2 15 we can get the global smoothed conductance matrix by assembling local matrices as 2 18 g i 1 n s ω i s b i t k i b i d ω i 1 n s v i s b i t k i b i where k i is the hydraulic conductivity matrix in the smoothing domain ω i s then the system of the problem becomes 2 19 g h 0 after applying dirichlet boundary conditions 2 7 2 8 we can get hydraulic heads on all the nodes by solving the system once the hydraulic head at each point is obtained the groundwater flow velocity at any point can also be calculated using the following formula mazor and nativ 1992 2 20 v d k d i d p where i d is the hydraulic gradient in d direction between two points 2 21 i d δ h δ d d x y z δ d is distance in d direction between two points and δ h is the difference of their hydraulic heads k d is the hydraulic conductivity along d direction p is the effective porosity then the average residence time t m of groundwater flow within the media can be approximated by 2 22 2 22 t m l m v m y where l m is the length of the whole media v m y is the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media 2 3 construction of rpim shape functions we use multiquadric mq φ r r 2 c 2 with linear polynomial as basis to build the shape function φ x where r is the euclidean distance between two points c is the shape parameter for an interested point x the hydraulic head at this point can be approximated by interpolating n s support nodes x j j 1 2 n s of x as follows liu and gu 2005 liu and zhang 2013 2 23 h x φ 1 φ n s 1 x y z a b φ a p b where φ φ 1 φ n s φ j x x j 2 c 2 p 1 x y z a a 1 a n s t and b b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 t to get the coefficients we enforce the hydraulic head function to be satisfied at each support node x j j 1 n s in above equation to get 2 24 r n s p n s a b h n s where 2 25 r n s φ 11 φ 1 n s φ n s 1 φ n s n s 2 26 p n s 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x n s y n s z n s and h n s is the vector of hydraulic head function values at x s support nodes to guarantee a unique approximation the following extra requirements should be satisfied 2 27 p n s t a 0 from eqs 2 24 and 2 27 we have 2 28 r n s p n s p n s t 0 a b h n s 0 then we can get the coefficients by solving above equations here we use an efficient way proposed in liu and zhang 2013 to calculate the coefficients as 2 29 a s a h n s b s b h n s where 2 30 s b p n s t r n s 1 p n s 1 p n s t r n s 1 2 31 s a r n s 1 r n s 1 p n s s b therefore the approximated head function can be written as 2 32 h x r t s a p t s b h n s and the rpim shape function is 2 33 φ x r t s a p t s b 2 4 support nodes selection scheme tetrahedral meshes are generated by tetgen fig 2 shows the cross section of the aquifer and the well sliced parallel to the well different materials are distinguished by different colors since different materials have different hydraulic conductivity values hydraulic conductivities of aquifer red screen blue reactive media yellow and empty well green are different however the hydraulic conductivity in one tetrahedron cell is constant support nodes selection scheme can be different according to different basis functions and problems to be solved cui et al 2010b zhang and liu 2011 liu and zhang 2013 in this problem domain composed of different materials to guarantee the support nodes of a quadrature gauss point are in or on the same material domain we have different support nodes selection schemes for different types of faces the gauss points are on if two cells adjacent to the face are in the same material domain we call this face the interior face if the gauss point x g is on the interior face as shown in fig 3 the support nodes are the vertices of its two neighboring cells if the gauss point x g is on the interface between two different materials shown in fig 4 or on the boundary of the whole domain shown in fig 5 the support nodes are the three vertices of the home face in this case the shape functions are linear and 2 17 becomes 2 34 γ i k s l n i k φ d γ l n i k a i k 1 3 1 3 1 3 where a i k is the area of the k th interface or boundary face of the i th smoothing domain 3 test pit pilot scale experiments in this section we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the cs rpim results with the measurement results and fem numerical results 3 1 hrx well in the test pit the controlled field pilot scale study of the hrx well was conducted at a field site at clarkson university in a hydraulically isolated test pit the pictures of hrx well and dimension of the well are shown in fig 6 the pit is a representation of a relatively homogeneous sand aquifer and was excavated to dimensions of 20 ft long by 6 ft wide by 6 ft deep onwards the test pit will be described as the aquifer the aquifer was isolated from the surrounding media by a pond liner the horizontal well is fixed in the center of the pit with a depth of 3 ft below ground surface the diameter of the well is 2 3 ft the length of the horizontal part of the well is 8 ft and two reactive media cartridges inside both ends of the horizontal well case are each 3 feet long the length of empty section between two reactive media cartridges is 2 ft the angle of entry at the up gradient and down gradient portions of the well are both 135 as shown in fig 6 to monitor the pressure water head in the aquifer an array of 40 piezometers were installed at different heights across and along the aquifer in this test pit since the aquifer sand media and screen are all isotropic hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer reactive media screen and empty part of the well satisfy k x k y k z the hydraulic heads on ω 1 and ω 2 are h l 6 ft and h r 4 5 ft respectively the hydraulic conductivities and porosities of the aquifer and each portion of the well are listed in table 1 3 2 comparison of capture width we use cs rpim to simulate the groundwater flow captured by this well in the test pit and compare the results with measured values and fem numerical results the shape parameter c in the mq radial basis function φ r r 2 c 2 is the nearest distance of two mesh nodes fig 7 shows a contour plot and stream lines of groundwater flow on the cross section z 3 ft by cs rpim simulation based on 30981 nodes the colorbar on the right of the figure represents the hydraulic head values of the contour plot capture zone is enclosed by red stream lines the horizontal well consists of media sections in yellow and hollow section in green based on measured hydraulic head values and interpolation between measured points the maximum capture width of the well was estimated as about 3 3 ft from the cs rpim simulation results the capture width shown in fig 7 is 3 3 ft which is consistent with the measured capture width by darcy s law the average capture width is represented as whitaker 1986 divine et al 2018a b 3 1 w a v e q a v e k a b a i a k m π r h 2 k a b a where k a and k m are the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer sand and reactive media i a is the average hydraulic gradient of aquifer b a is the aquifer thickness r h is the radius of the well q a v e is the volumetric flow rate through the well and is given by 3 2 q a v e k m π r h 2 i h in which i h is the average hydraulic gradient of the well eq 3 1 is obtained by assuming i a i h h l h r l a where l a is the length of aquifer based on the values in table 1 and the size of aquifer and well the calculated average capture width calculated by eq 3 1 is 5 25 ft taking the capture width measured from test pit as the reference this calculated capture width is far less accurate than the simulation capture width this is due to several reasons the structure of the well is complicated and hydraulic conductivities are different in different portions of the well the average hydraulic gradient of well in fact is not equal to that of the aquifer according to fig 7 therefore the capture width cannot be simply estimated by eq 3 1 which also reflects the significance of the numerical simulation 3 3 comparison of hydraulic head the root mean square error ε r m s and relative error ε r are used to compare numerical results with measured results quantitatively ε r m s 1 n h x h x 2 ε r h x h x 2 h x 2 where h x is a vector of the measured heads h is a vector of numerical heads obtained by cs rpim or fem n is the total number of interpolation points through fem and cs rpim simulation based on n 7361 mesh nodes we get hydraulic heads with different test pit hydraulic gradients and compare with the measured values the different test pit hydraulic gradients i a 0 017 0 033 0 042 0 05 0 075 are achieved by setting different right hand side dirichlet boundary condition h r 5 67 5 33 5 17 5 4 5 ft from fig 8 we can see the hydraulic head relative errors of both numerical methods are almost the same in addition relative errors of cs rpim are slightly lower than fem when hydraulic gradient i a 0 033 0 042 0 05 the incorporation of domains beyond the depths where measurements and mapping are possible or available may have played a role in the differences between the measured and numerical model results factors other than the boundary conditions such as measurement errors aquifer characterization and operating parameters may have influenced the uniformity of results obtained from the test pit measurements and numerical simulations transient stress such as infiltration pumping and change in weather cycles which were not simulated in the models may also contribute to the differences in obtained results furthermore we take the results obtained by fem based on 631076 nodes as the reference hydraulic heads to evaluate effectiveness of cs rpim for solving this problem as shown in fig 9 cs rpim is more accurate than fem based on the same mesh both methods converge with the refinement of the mesh the convergence rate of fem is 1 34 whereas the convergence rate of cs rpim is 2 84 table 2 shows errors of cs rpim and fem of this example all in all cs rpim have higher accuracy and convergence rate than fem for solving this problem based on the same tetrahedron mesh cs rpim takes more cpu time than fem this is because many calculations including shape function jacobian matrix and gaussian quadrature integration are avoided in the program of linear fem to improve the accuracy of fem hexahedron mesh need to be used however on one hand high quality hexahedron mesh cannot be automatically generated on the other hand for hexahedron based fem the computation of shape function jacobian matrix and integration is expensive furthermore from table 2 we can see even though cs rpim takes more cpu time than fem using same number of nodes fem actually requires more time than cs rpim to achieve competitive accuracy with cs rpim for example fem takes 757 s to get a 5 49 e 4 error while cs rpim takes 81 s to reach the 4 45 e 4 error 3 4 comparison of velocity we also compare groundwater flow velocities in the test pit with different hydraulic gradients from fig 10 we can see the numerical flow velocity in media increases as the hydraulic gradient increases which matches the measured velocity in media cs rpim simulation results are closer to the measured values than fem based on the same mesh in addition according to the on site experimental results measured capture width does not change with varying hydraulic gradient from fig 11 we can see the capture width also does not change as the hydraulic gradient of aquifer changes 4 software modules development we develop three software modules based on matlab tetgen input file generating module cs rpim simulation module output module the whole process can be expressed in chart 12 as shown in fig 1 the whole well is divided into five parts inlet screen inlet reactive media empty part which is between reactive media parts outlet reactive media and outlet screen engineers can input values of parameters width length and depth of the aquifer x and y coordinates of the well center depth of the well well diameter length of each well segment drilling degree of the well hydraulic conductivities and effective porosities of aquifer media screen and empty part and dirichlet boundary conditions we develop a matlab module to write the tetgen poly input file based on input parameters we first locate some coarse grid points on boudaries and interfaces then define faces according to these points and assign the face marker to each face finally we assign the attribute to each region divided by faces after writing all these information the input poly file stores attributes of nodes and different regions markers of faces and boundaries and other information for tetgen generating quality tetrahedral meshes this matlab module is available at https github com wenlimath2 hrx well generating tetgen input file git after obtaining the tetgen input poly file we use the tetgen command line with a set of switches followed by poly input file to read the information and description stored in the poly file control the behavior of tetgen generate tetrahedral meshes and specify the output files the switches we usually use are as follows si 2015 p switch generates tetrahedral meshes using delaunay tetrahedralization q switch improves mesh quality a assigns attributes to tetrahedra in different regions a applies a maximum tetrahedron volume constraint the switches e and f output all edges to edge file and all faces to face file in addition the default output files of tetgen also include element ele file and node node file these files will be used as the input files of cs rpim simulation module the tetgen output files we used in test pit simulation are also available at the above github pape in the cs rpim module based on the above tetgen output files we first establish the connectivities between nodes edges faces and elements next cs rpim described in section 2 is used to get hydraulic heads of all the mesh points in the output module flow velocities and resident time in media are calculated by eqs 2 20 and 2 22 the groundwater flow streamlines contour plots and capture zone can be visualized by pictures 5 field scale numerical investigation the effectiveness of cs rpim is verified through the analysis of the test pit numerical experiment to help engineers design the hrx well for groundwater remediation we do field scale numerical investigation to reveal the effects of well dimension hydraulic conductivities average hydraulic gradient and anisotropy of aquifer on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in media for the field scale problem we do not have a test pit with a fixed length of aquifer to determine the length of aquifer ω we first test the effect of aquifer length on capture zone the length of the test pit is increased to 60 ft and the average hydraulic gradient is 0 075 fig 13 shows the capture zone in 60 ft test pit compare to fig 7 which shows the capture zone in the 20 ft inches length and 0 075 average hydraulic gradient test pit the capture width in this longer test pit does not change in addition the effect of width and depth of the test pit on the capture zone is also analyzed as shown in fig 14 the capture width of the hrx well in wider and deeper test pit does not have obvious change either therefore length and width of aquifer have little effect on the capture width the values of all the parameters in table 3 can be changed in our program to generate tetgen input file for constructing tetrahedron meshes table 3 shows parameters values for field scale aquifer and hrx well because of the bedding structure of natural aquifer the vertical aquifer hydraulic conductivity is much smaller than the horizontal conductivity here k z 0 1 k x in the following cases we will change the value of one of the parameters in table 3 and analyze the their effects on results case 1 effect of well diameter on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we first change the diameter of the well from 1 ft to 2 ft the simulation results are shown in fig 15 the upper two figures in fig 15 are groundwater stream slices contour plots and the capture zone of the 1 ft diameter reference well on cross section z 30 ft and x 50 ft the capture width significantly increases from 33 8 ft to 53 3 ft on cross section z 30 and increases from 46 ft to 68 8 ft on cross section x 50 ft in this case by 2 20 v m y 0 32 ft h in the 1 ft diameter well and v m y 0 19 ft h in the 2 ft diameter well since l m 50 ft by 2 22 t m 155 81 h in the 1 ft diameter well and t m 261 92 h in the 2 ft diameter well therefore we conclude that the capture width increases as the well diameter increases meanwhile groundwater velocity in the media decreases and the groundwater flow can stay longer in the media to get treated case 2 effect of reactive media length on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we shorten the length of reactive media from 25 ft to 10 ft on each side from fig 16 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 41 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 51 2 ft however since the average velocity v m y of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 41 ft h and the length of media is shortened the average residence time t m of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 48 48 h case 3 effect of screen length on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the length of horizontal screen from 10 ft to 20 ft on each side from fig 17 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 44 9 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 50 ft on the other hand the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media slightly increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 35 ft h therefore the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 143 39 h case 4 effect of length of empty part of the well on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we shorten the length of empty part between media from 50 ft to 25 ft from fig 18 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft decreases from 33 8 ft to 30 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft decreases from 46 ft to 40 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 28 ft h so the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 177 87 h case 5 effect of media hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we increase the hydraulic conductivity of media from 7 5 ft h to 15 ft h from fig 19 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 45 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 51 3 ft however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media increases from 0 32 ft h to 0 46 ft h therefore the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media decreases from 155 81 h to 109 46 h case 6 effect of aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in the media we reduce the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer from 1 46 1 0 2 ft h to 7 1 0 3 ft h the vertical hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is reduced from k z 1 46 1 0 3 ft h to k z 7 1 0 4 ft h accordingly from fig 20 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft increases from 33 8 ft to 43 5 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft increases from 46 ft to 57 9 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 24 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 205 68 h case 7 effect of the anisotropy ratio of aquifer hydraulic conductivity on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the ratio of aquifer vertical hydraulic conductivity to horizontal hydraulic conductivity k z k x from 0 1 to 0 01 from fig 21 we can see the capture width of stream slice on cross section z 30 ft is slightly widened from 33 8 ft to 35 ft and capture width on cross section x 50 ft significantly increases from 46 ft to 58 ft the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 28 ft h so the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 181 23 h case 8 effect of hydraulic gradient on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the hydraulic heads on the right boundary from 85 ft to 87 5 ft so that the hydraulic gradient decreases from 0 01 to 0 005 just like the conclusion obtained in the test pit simulation the capture zone does not change as hydraulic gradient changes however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 16 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media increases from 155 81 h to 311 72 h case 9 effect of length of aquifer on capture zone velocity and residence time of groundwater flow in reactive media we change the length of aquifer from 500 ft to 1000 ft whereas the average hydraulic gradient of aquifer does not change by assigning h l 92 5 ft and h r 82 5 ft in this situation the capture zone does not change just as the test pit simulation results however the average velocity of groundwater flow along the well in the reactive media v m y slightly decreases from 0 32 ft h to 0 316 ft h the average residence time of groundwater within the whole media is slightly extended from 155 81 h to 158 43 h to be clearer we define a relative change ratio r e in 5 1 to summarize the above numerical investigation results 5 1 r e δ η η δ γ γ where η could be one of these numerical results capture width on z 30 ft or on x 50 ft v m y t m one of these parameters well diameter media length screen length empty part length media hydraulic conductivity k m horizontal hydraulic conductivity of aquifer k a anisotropy ratio of aquifer hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient aquifer length is represented by γ for example if η is t m and γ is k m then r e δ t m t m δ k m k m means that when hydraulic conductivity of media k m increases by 100 t m increases r e is positive or decreases r e is negative by r e table 4 shows relative change ratios of all the numerical results to every parameter in summary the operations that can result in an expansion of the capture zone include increases in well diameter screen length empty section length media hydraulic conductivity and reductions in media length and aquifer hydraulic conductivity among them only increasing the well diameter and reducing the aquifer hydraulic conductivity can prolong the media treatment time 6 conclusion and future work in this paper we investigated the horizontal reactive media treatment hrx well numerically and experimentally the goal is to understand the main factors that effect the capture zones of the hrx well in the field scale through this study we utilize a mathematical model ground water flow equation without source term at the steady state form to simulate the groundwater flow captured by the hrx well based on numerical technique the cell based smoothed radial point interpolation method cs rpim both the partial differential equation model and the numerical method are not new but the use of both for simulating the hrx well capture zone has significant contribution to our understanding of main factors that affect the performance of the well we construct a controlled field pilot scale study pss which is conducted at a field site at clarkson university potsdam new york in a hydraulically isolated test pit data were collected and compared with our numerical simulations the groundwater velocity and capture width obtained by the cs rpim method are consistent with the experiments results in the test pit the cs rpim results also is consistent with those from the finite element method fem software developed in this paper is available freely on github the main motivation of this paper is to evaluate the impact of well dimensions and other parameters on the groundwater capture zone flow velocity and residence time in the reactive media the comparison between numerical methods and between numerical simulation and field data showed that based on the field scale numerical investigation and relative change ratios in table 4 the most effective way to expand the capture zone and extend the groundwater treatment time is to increase the diameter of the well when well diameter increases by 100 horizontal capture width can be increased by 57 and vertical capture width can be increased by 50 in addition media treatment time can also be extended by 68 although reducing the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer can achieve a comparable effect the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is an uncontrollable factor moreover through lengthening the reactive media by 100 the groundwater treatment time can by extended by 115 but the capture width is reduced by 35 horizontally and 19 vertically these relative change ratios can be further used to optimize hrx well design according to material installation and drilling costs users of the hrx well can modify the shape of the well and properties of the reactive media in the well to simulate and modify their installation design in order to further investigate the efficiency of the hrx well in groundwater contaminant remediation we will simulate contaminant transport based on groundwater velocity we have already obtained in addition current software is not robust enough for user without mathematical and numerical simulation background we aim to develop a more robust simulation package that can be used for engineers or users of the hrx

207,we present a new set of analytical solutions for analysing pumping tests in a well near a vertical fault zone dyke or vein we consider a fault zone with finite width storativity and hydraulic conductivity which can be anisotropic and without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three aquifer domains pumped aquifer fault zone and opposite side aquifer this configuration not described before also considers flow transience within the fault zone drawdown solutions were developed for the three aquifer domains based on an unconventional application of the well image theory their comparison with numerical modelling results was very satisfactory drawdown behaviour at the pumping well is discussed for contrasted properties between the three aquifer domains original analytical solutions for transient flow along both sides of the fault zone and net transient flow from the fault itself are proposed and discussed with particular attention to flow reversal from the pumped compartment to the fault zone which occurs where the fault zone is the most transmissive finally we extend the solutions to the case of a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near the same vertical geological discontinuity keywords pumping test anisotropic fault pumping near a fault compartmented aquifer analytical solution list of symbols a distance

introduction in hydrogeology the oil and gas industry and geothermal activities well testing is an essential tool for assessing the hydrodynamic properties of a reservoir the evaluation of these properties as well as their variability in space is essential for improving resource management e g raghavan 2004 dewandel et al 2012 in addition detailed groundwater flow conditions particularly in fractured systems are required for pressure and transfer modelling for instance in the case of a nuclear waste deposit geothermal exploitation or contaminant transport therefore the design of an adequate conceptual model based on well test data prior to quantification of the hydrogeologic parameters has been a topic of interest for decades bourdet et al 1983 1989 ehlig economides 1988 renard et al 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 ferroud et al 2019 etc a common case encountered in the field is a well located near a fault fig 1a that may act as a barrier or a conduit or a combination of both to flow e g maslia and prowell 1990 haneberg 1995 bense et al 2003 in sedimentary rock but not only faults may be permeable or act as low or non permeable structures because the throw along the fault plane may be such that a permeable layer on one side of the fault is completely or partially juxtaposed against an impermeable layer on the other side or because of low hydraulic conductivity materials in the core of the fault zone the reverse is also possible where the rock s hydraulic conductivity is enhanced because of unaltered fracturing along the fault zone caine et al 1996 other geological features such as dykes veins or karst conduits may locally enhance the hydraulic conductivity and drain the surrounding aquifer or act as a barrier or low permeability discontinuity to flow dewandel et al 2011 perrin et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 maréchal et al 2014 xu et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 depending upon the properties of the fault or of the geological discontinuity fluid flow may occur along the structure and across the structure s planes several analytical studies have described transient pressure behaviour in the pumping well and flow processes such work often refers to a pumping well near a fault of infinite length with finite conductivity abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 escobar et al 2013 yaxley 1987 derived an analytical solution from bixel s et al 1963 work for a well located near a partially communicating vertical fault this model dedicated to low permeable barrier does not account for flow along the fault plane abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 presented a solution for a well located near a finite conductivity vertical fault with fracture skin for simulating damage zones on the sides of the fault plane their solution allowed varying aquifer properties on both sides of the fault considered flow along and across the fault plane but assumed a small fault width and neglected fault storativity and thus flow transience in the fault zone the net flux in out of the fault being nil this model was dedicated to fault zones with higher hydraulic conductivity than those of the surrounding aquifers later rahman et al 2003 proposed a semi analytical solution similar to abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 s work to account for transient flow in the fracture plane but also assumed a greater hydraulic conductivity in the fault other solutions exist in the literature such as that developed by boussila et al 2003 for a well near a linear leaky boundary in laterally infinite composite systems or the one proposed by althawad 2016 for a pumping well intersecting and pumping a finite conductivity fracture of infinite length near a finite conductivity fracture of infinite length vertical faults or other vertical geological discontinuities can also be conceptualized as vertically compartmented aquifers butler and liu 1991 and dewandel et al 2014 proposed solutions for investigating the influence of a pumping well located in a linear strip aquifer representing the geological discontinuity bounded laterally by aquifers of differing properties however no analytical solution was provided for a pumping well located in one of the two external compartments and thus near the geological discontinuity anderson 2006 using the method of images presented an analytical solution for a pumping well near such a discontinuity his solution allows considering the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity of the central compartment the one representing a vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity however this solution was established for steady state flow only rafini and larocque 2009 used numerical models for assessing the flow behaviour induced by a pumping test near a fault zone embedded in a low permeable matrix with various fault inclinations but they did not consider the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone we propose new analytical solutions for drawdown induced by a pumping well near an infinite sub vertical and anisotropic fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity we consider a fault zone of finite width storativity and hydraulic conductivity that can be anisotropic fig 1 a without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three aquifer domains pumped aquifer fault zone and opposite side aquifer which was not considered in earlier works our solutions are based upon an unconventional application of the well image theory solutions are first developed for an isotropic fault and then extended to the anisotropic case they are given for the three aquifer domains and are compared to numerical modelling the hydrodynamic signatures of drawdown and flow behaviour at the pumping well are discussed analytical solutions for transient flow along both sides of the central compartment the fault zone are given in terms of spatial and transient evolution with particular attention to reversed flow i e flow from the pumped compartment entering the fault zone which can occur under specific conditions these new solutions allow discussing the transient behaviour of such flow which has not been studied in the past finally we show that the solutions can be extended to other cases such as a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near an infinite vertical fault zone fig 1b the proposed solutions should be useful for examining and modelling drawdown created by a pumping well or a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture near a vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity such as dykes veins buried channels embedded in other materials or even karst conduits 2 theoretical method and mathematical model 2 1 conceptual model the problem of interest consists in evaluating drawdown as a function of coordinates x y and time caused by a pumping well near an infinite vertical fault or geological discontinuity with finite thickness finite storativity and anisotropic hydraulic conductivity fig 1a following anderson s 2006 nomenclature the system is divided in three domains d1 d and d2 with l1 representing the boundary between d1 and d and l2 the one between d and d2 domain d the infinite vertical fault separates two semi infinite half spaces the pumping well is located in d1 it is at the origin of a cartesian coordinate system x 0 y 0 and is at a distance a from l1 the y axis is parallel to the two boundaries l1 and l2 the well fully penetrates the aquifer and produces at a constant flowrate q the overall domain d1 d d2 assumes a confined condition each domain is characterized by its own transmissivity and storativity d has anisotropic hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal plane while the two other domains are isotropic domain thicknesses can be different not shown on fig 1a damage zones along the fault zones d are not considered 2 2 method of images the method of images is a classic technique for tackling boundary value problems such as those encountered in heat conduction electrostatics and particularly in groundwater flow to solve the problem of no flow constant boundaries or leaky boundaries ferris et al 1962 kruseman et al 1990 bruggeman 1999 anderson 2000 2006 solutions with this method have the advantage of providing convenient forms compared to solutions from differential equations that may require numerical inversion of a laplace transform the proposed solutions are based upon an unconventional application of the well image theory this method originally proposed by fenske 1984 for the case of a boundary separating two aquifers with dissimilar diffusivities and later extended by dewandel et al 2014 to a well located in an infinite linear strip aquifer limited on both sides by aquifers of differing properties has been further developed for the case presented here though good and useful approximations the proposed solutions are not shown to be exact solutions to the appropriate partial differential equations bixel et al 1963 butler and liu 1991 appendix a hereafter we do believe however that although it is not the method used here drawdown solutions can also be obtained by numerical inversion of a laplace transform in a general manner and using the well image theory for the case presented here one can consider the drawdown in domain d1 to consist of two components direct drawdown caused by the pumping well and reflected drawdowns caused by the reflection of image well drawdowns from the two boundaries onto d1 total drawdown can be represented by a sum of drawdowns caused by the pumping well and that caused by image wells located across the boundaries each image well is strengthened to consider the contrast in properties between the three domains fig 2 a shows the solution for drawdown in d1 where each dot corresponds to an image well with its distance from the pumping well and its strength this technique is widely used for solving the particular cases of no flow and constant head boundary conditions e g ferris et al 1962 kruseman et al 1990 in these cases image strength is 1 or 1 more information on the well image theory can be found in anderson 2000 2006 or in bruggeman 1999 the drawdown in domains d and d2 is the transmitted drawdown across the boundaries its solutions depend upon the properties of the domain of interest and are analogues of the solution in d1 consequently drawdown can also be represented as the sum of drawdowns caused by the producing well and one or two infinite well image series depending upon the domain lying outside the domain of interest whereby each pumping and image well was strengthened to cover the aquifer properties of each domain figs 2b and 2c along the boundaries conditions vary from boundary l1 between d1 and d to boundary l2 between d and d2 and the following criteria must be satisfied 1 drawdown must be equal on both sides of the boundaries then s 1 a y t s a y t along boundary l1 and s 2 a h y t s a h y t along boundary l2 1 unit discharge orthogonal to the boundaries must be equal on both sides as well then t 1 s 1 a y t x t s a y t x along boundary l1 and t 2 s 2 a h y t x t s a h y t x along boundary l2 where s1 x y t s x y t and s2 x y t are the drawdowns in each domain d1 d and d2 t1 t and t2 are the transmissivity values of each domain a is the distance from the pumping well to boundary l1 and h is the width of domain d 2 3 general solutions for drawdown here we first considered the case where domain d is isotropic a second section deals with the anisotropy of this domain all three domains are characterized by dissimilar diffusivity values t1 s1 t s t2 s2 using the well image theory described above the general solutions for drawdown valid for each domain are expressed as series fig 2 for domain 1 d1 drawdown is expressed by that of the producing well that of one image well at the opposite of l1 at x 2a and that of one infinite image well series lying outside d1 for domain d drawdown is expressed by two infinite image well series lying outside d and for d2 by one infinite image well series lying outside d2 the general form of solutions for drawdown are as follows for an observation well in domain d1 1 s 1 x y t q 4 π t 1 w s 1 4 t 1 t x 2 y 2 α 0 w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a x 2 y 2 n 2 4 6 α i w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a n h x 2 y 2 for domain d 2 s x y t q 4 π t n 2 4 6 β i w s 4 t t 2 a n h x 2 y 2 n 0 2 4 β i w s 4 t t 2 n h x 2 y 2 and for domain d2 3 s 2 x y t q 4 π t 2 n 0 2 4 δ i w s 2 4 t 2 t 2 n h x 2 y 2 where w u is the well function or exponential integral function also noted ei u s1 and t1 m2 s are the storage coefficient and transmissivity of the aquifer in d1 respectively s and t m2 s are those of the strip aquifer in d and s2 and t2 m2 s those of aquifer d2 a m is the distance from the pumping well to l1 and q is the pumping rate m3s 1 α0 αn βi βi and δi are the image well strengths now we must evaluate the strength coefficients of each image well 2 4 drawdown solutions for the three domains 2 4 1 isotropic case we consider the first series of images according to l1 and l2 fig 3 a the pumping well is first imaged according to l1 the result of applying the two boundary conditions at boundary l1 s 1 a y t s a y t and t 1 s 1 a y t x t s a y t x is that the two strength coefficients α0 and β0 depend upon the contrast of diffusivity between domains d1 and d the distance to the boundary a and time t appendix b gives the detail of their solutions this case refers to the influence of a partial hydrologic barrier that separates two domains with contrasted diffusivities where the drawdown solutions for both domains d1 and d correspond to the ones proposed by fenske 1984 then considering the case of two parallel boundaries l1 and l2 and thus that of a well pumping near an infinite strip aquifer the pumping well must be imaged about the second boundary l2 2nd image which allows evaluating strength coefficients β0 and δ0 fig 3a while applying the new boundary conditions s 2 a h y t s a h y t and t 2 s 2 a h y t x t s a h y t x these strengths depend upon previous ones β0 for β0 but also on the diffusivity contrast between domains d and d2 on the width of domain d h and on time t appendix b gives the detail of their solutions then as this last image well does not respect the conditions at boundary l1 it must be imaged about l1 3rd image which allows evaluating strength coefficients α1 and β1 according to boundary conditions in l1 fig 3b as the 3rd image does not respect the condition along l2 it has to be imaged about l2 4th image and strength coefficients β1 and δ1 should be evaluated according to boundary conditions in l2 fig 3b and so on therefore each iteration results in a new image well with a strength evaluated according to boundary conditions at l1 and l2 as the strength of the nth image well depends upon the product of all previous image strengths the strengths of each image well series can be expressed as a combination of arithmetic and geometrical series the drawdown for an observation well located in d1 is 4 s 1 x y t q 4 π t 1 w s 1 4 t 1 t x 2 y 2 t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a x 2 y

integral and e u is the exponential function as a result the strength coefficients depend upon geometrical series that are a function of each domain diffusivity time the distance a from the pumping well to the first boundary l1 and the width h of the strip aquifer width of d in each infinite series the strength coefficient of each image well decreases with distance from both boundaries and each series converges absolutely to solve eqs 4 to 6 we used an algorithm based on an iterative process where the number of images is determined when the absolute value of a certain metric given by the nth computation of the nth becomes negligible e g 10 6 this criterion ensures high computation accuracy note that for the case of time constant strength coefficients equal diffusivity ratio between the compartments the solutions are the same as those of the appropriate partial differential equation solutions of this particular case are given in appendix c for the three aquifer domains and as expected strength coefficients are identical to the ones given in anderson 2006 for a solution in steady state condition 2 4 2 anisotropic case analytical solutions for the three domains can be obtained for the case where the geologic discontinuity d has an anisotropic transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity these solutions are based on the isotropic solutions eqs 4 to 6 and standard transformed coordinate techniques e g hantush 1966 ramey 1975 neuman et al 1984 it is assumed that the main axes of transmissivity in d are orientated along the x and y directions thus ty and tx are parallel and orthogonal to both boundaries respectively and t t x t y as the pumping well fully penetrates the aquifer in d1 flow lines are parallel to the bottom of the aquifer consequently the anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity in the vertical plane is not considered according to bear and dagan 1965 and anderson 2006 the transformed coordinates in d1 remain unchanged however in d2 x coordinate must be shifted to the right along the x axis to account for the transformed width of d i e h t y t x therefore 7 in d 1 x x and y y 8 and in d 2 x x h t y t x 1 and y y in d the transformed coordinates are more complex because of rotational flow in d they are x x t y t x and y y where x is a function of the real coordinate system that assumes at boundary l1 i e between d1 and d x x x a and at the second boundary l2 i e between d and d2 x x x a h t y t x these re scaling relationships show that d must also be shifted to the right along the x axis to account for the transformed width h t y t x according to dewandel et al 2014 x can be estimated empirically it is found that x x a t x t y 1 which gives for a x a h 9 x t y t x x a a the evaluated relationship still depends on the anisotropy ratio in d and is linear which agrees with baer and dagan 1965 drawdown solutions in the transform domains are not re written as they use isotropic solutions eqs 4 5 6 where h is replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y in eq 5 for an observation well in d x is replaced by x and in eq 6 for a well in d2 x is replaced by x according to the previous re scaling rules eqs 9 and 10 the y coordinates remain unchanged as well as the x coordinates in eq 4 for a well in domain d1 re scaling of all three domains also satisfies long pumping stages when drawdown solutions are characterized by straight lines on semi log plots whose slope values depend on the average transmissivity of domains d1 and d2 these solutions are compared with numerical modelling particularly the one in d in section 4 comparisons between the developed solutions and numerical simulations 3 drawdown and flow behaviour at the pumping well 3 1 isotropic case as many type curves exist for describing flow behaviour near such a discontinuity domain d some examples are given below to discuss the main flow behaviour characteristics fig 4 shows the result of eq 4 at a pumping well of radius rw x w y w 2 r w using dimensionless time tdl t 1 t s 1 a 2 and dimensionless drawdown s d r w a t d l 2 π t 1 q s p w r w t for the case where t1 s1 0 1 t2 s2 0 5 t1 t2 20 0 h 5 m fig 4a presents the case where t t1 varies from 10 2 to 103 with s s1 20 0 and fig 4b the case where s s1 varies from 10 3 to 103 with t t1 100 0 diffusivity in d thus varies between 10 2 and 103 the dimensionless forms of the solutions eqs 4 to 6 are provided as supporting information a convenient starting point for the analysis of eq 4 is the log log diagnostic plot developed by bourdet et al 1983 in this plot both drawdown sd and its derivative sd are shown with respect to the natural logarithm of time sd ln tdl amongst others this log log plot is commonly used for identifying flow regimes during a pumping test ehlig economides 1988 bourdet et al 1989 spane and wurstner 1993 renard et al 2009 ferroud et al 2019 for all presented derivative curves in this work derivatives were computed numerically according to bourdet s et al 1989 algorithm during the early stages of pumping when the cone of depression has not yet reached boundary l1 tdl 0 2 on figs 4a and b eq 4 is identical to the solution of an infinite homogeneous aquifer theis 1935 for a large enough tdl the condition for which theis equation reduces to cooper jacob s 1946 equation a straight line on a semi logarithmic plot with a slope ½ characterizes dimensionless drawdown its logarithmic derivative is constant value of ½ reflecting the first infinite radial flow to the well fig 4 therefore for short times the logarithmic derivative of drawdown will converge to s ln t q 4πt 1 once the cone of depression begins to reach boundary l1 tdl 0 2 transmissivity and storage coefficient ratios between the pumped d1 and the strip d aquifers change the character of the drawdown curves at that time the drawdown propagates along boundary l1 and within the strip aquifer for high t t1 or s s1 ratios the derivative slope tends to 1 showing that the fault zone acts as a steady state source i e constant head boundary abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 the higher the t t1 or s s1 ratios the more the 1 slope is established and the longer it lasts note that this trend generally characterizes a fault zone with infinite hydraulic conductivity near a pumping well abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 escobar et al 2013 however fig 4b also shows that a similar trend can be obtained for high s s1 ratios and not necessarily high t t1 ratios as in the previously cited literature then at medium stages tdl 10 0 when the fault begins to drain the whole aquifer system derivatives follow a near ¼ slope which describes a bi linear flow regime within d as mentioned in previously cited work however when s s1 ratios are high 100 0 on fig 4b the derivative s slope tends to ½ describing a linear flow regime within d it is also interesting to note that for intermediate t t1 ratios with t t1 or s s1 ratios drawdown behaves similarly to naturally fractured media like dual porosity aquifers abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 or dual permeability media such as multilayer aquifers when t t1 and s s1 ratios decrease figs 4a and b derivative curves rise up and durations of the 1 derivative slope period and subsequent ¼ or ½ slope decrease linear flow regimes showing that d is less able to drain the whole aquifer system in the proposed examples the derivative may form a hump at the end of the linear flow period within d tdl 30 on fig 4a or 6 000 on fig 4b on fig 4a it is the consequence of a decrease in the t t1 ratio 1 and on fig 4b it is the result of a lower diffusivity contrast between domains d and d2 the smaller the contrast the greater the hump which may cause boundary l1 fig 4a and l2 fig 4b to appear temporarily as a no flow boundary see blue curves on fig 4a at late pumping stages tdl 105 on figs 4a and 4b drawdown has diffused through the whole domain d and propagates significantly in the third domain d2 this period is characterized by a second radial flow regime illustrating the overall response of the aquifer system during very late stages of pumping i e t or tdl all strength coefficients γi and τi in eq 4 but also in eqs 5 and 6 tend to 1 therefore and after rearranging eq 4 the logarithmic derivative of the dimensionless drawdown for late pumping stages leads to 10 lim t d l s d t d l 2 t 1 t 1 t 1 2 t t 1 t t t 2 t 2 t n 0 1 2 t t 2 t 2 t n t t 1 t 1 t n as t t 2 t 2 t and t t 1 t 1 t ratios are between 1 and 1 the series can be regarded as a taylor series that tends for n to t 1 t t 2 t 2 t t 1 t 2 therefore the last equation simplifies to lim t d l s d t d l 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 showing that the logarithmic derivative of the dimensionless drawdown depends only on the transmissivities of the pumped aquifer d1 and of domain d2 thus the logarithmic derivative of drawdown s ln t will converge to a constant value inversely proportional to the average transmissivities of d1 and d2 s l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 this shows that for late stage pumping the drawdown slope does not depend on the transmissivity of the strip aquifer d representing a fault another geological discontinuity or another compartment but on those of the pumped compartment and of the compartment on the other side of the geological discontinuity this behaviour agrees with previous work abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 escobar et al 2013 3 2 anisotropic case as discussed above the solution with an anisotropic central compartment d is similar to that for the isotropic case eq 4 h being replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y therefore drawdown and derivative curves are characterized by a similar behaviour fig 5 during the early stage pumping tdl 0 2 sd ln tdl 1 2 or s ln t q 4πt 1 or the first infinite acting radial flow when boundary l1 has not been reached by the pumping and for late stage pumping sd ln tdl always tends to 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 or s l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 which characterizes the overall response of the aquifer system however compared to the isotropic case tx ty curves t t1 100 0 on fig 4a or s s1 20 0 on fig 4b the ty tx ratio increase induces a decrease of the derivative slope up to 1 for the highest ratios ty tx 100 0 because of the increasing transmissivity contrast ty t1 in a direction perpendicular to the central compartment x axis this shows that the anisotropy increase of transmissivity in d increases the capacity of the central compartment to drain the entire system and thus its capacity to supply water to the pumped d1 compartment consequently at medium stage bi linear flow ¼ derivatives slope or linear flow ½ derivatives slope regimes are shifted in time the higher the ty tx ratio the greater the offset conversely a decrease in the anisotropy ratio ty tx 1 0 fig 5 induces a lower transmissivity contrast between d1 and d ty t1 this reduces both the exchange between domains and the capacity of d to drain the whole system for the lowest contrast ty tx 10 2 d may act as a semi permeable boundary even though the overall transmissivity value of d is still significantly higher than that of d1 t t1 100 0 fig 5 4 comparison between developed solutions and numerical simulations we compared the performance of solutions with transmissivity anisotropy in d with numerical modelling to check their accuracy but also to evaluate eq 9 required for the drawdown solutions in d the numerical modelling was developed with the marthe 7 4 brgm computer code thiéry 2010 2015 2018 marthe allows 2d or 3d modelling of flow and mass transfers in aquifer systems including climatic and human influences groundwater flow is computed by a 3 d finite volume approach to solve the hydrodynamic equation based on darcy s law and mass conservation the grid geometry used in the numerical model is a 40 40 km square grid with a constant head boundary condition at each side in the x y plane cell size varies from 1 1 m at the origin pumping well up to 500 500 m near the limits of the model vertically the pumped aquifer is a 100 m thick layer subdivided into 25 4 m thick layers the aquifer is capped by an impermeable layer no flow condition creating a confined condition for the pumped layer several diffusivity ratios between the three domains and widths of the strip aquifer were prescribed to test the isotropic and the anisotropic solutions at various observation well locations i e in the pumped compartment d1 the strip aquifer d and in the right side compartment d2 fig 6 shows the results of two of these models for testing the anisotropic solutions in the model the pumping well fully penetrates the aquifer and is located at the centre of the grid x 0 y 0 and at 12 m a 12 m from a 8 m wide strip aquifer h 8 m in both cases transmissivity in the pumped compartment d1 t1 is 10 2 m2 s hydraulic conductivity k1 10 4 m s the storage coefficient s1 is 2 0 10 2 specific storage ss1 2 10 4 m 1 and the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the right hand side compartment d2 t2 is 5 10 3 m2 s k2 5 10 5 m s and s2 is 10 3 ss2 10 5 m 1 respectively only the properties of the strip aquifer d differ although the t y t x anisotropy ratio is the same at 10 0 in model 1 t is 10 1 m2 s k 10 3 m s and s is 10 1 ss 10 3 m 1 and in model 2 t is 3 10 3 m2 s k 3 10 5 m s and s is 2 10 2 ss 2 10 4 m 1 thus in model 1 the strip aquifer is the most transmissive and capacitive of the whole domain while it is the least transmissive and the least capacitive in model 2 for the simulations a constant pumping rate of q 1 11 10 2 m3 s 40 m3 h was set up for up to 700 days about 106 min in this context the model s boundaries were not reached and the aquifer remained saturated figs 6a and b compare the results of numerical modelling with analytically computed drawdown values as shown on the figures drawdown values and derivatives computed with the proposed solutions eqs 4 to 6 with the proposed re scaling rules of eqs 7 to 9 for observation wells in the pumped aquifer d1 curves a to d on figures for the ones in the strip aquifer d curves e and f and for the ones in the right side aquifer d2 curves g and h perfectly match the values from numerical modelling the root mean square error rmse was calculated for each numerical analytical comparison of drawdown values see inserted tables on figs 6a and 6b rmse values range between 1 4 10 3 and 1 7 10 2 m showing that the proposed analytical solutions agree with the numerical modelling a good indication of their accuracy 5 flow along and through boundaries l1 and l2 as mentioned in earlier studies flow through and across a fracture plane or geological discontinuity domain d is complex and may be locally reversed fig 7 particularly where the fault transmissivity is higher than that of other compartments abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 the aim of this section is to propose analytical solutions of such flows and to highlight their spatial and transient evolutions under different diffusivity contrasts t1 s1 t s t2 s2 the dimensionless forms of the following solutions are provided as supporting information 5 1 analytical solutions for flows through l1 and l2 analytical solutions for flow through both boundaries can be derived from eqs 4 to 6 for an isotropic central compartment d and with re scaling rules presented in section 2 4 2 for the anisotropic case eqs 7 to 9 the solutions for flow are normalized with respect to the pumping flowrate q thus representing the fraction of q that flows through l1 and l2 δ q l 1 q δ q l 2 q along boundary l1 x a between d1 and d according to eq 4 and for the anisotropic case the solution is 11 δ q l 1 y t q t 1 q s 1 a y t x t γ 0 π t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 a a 2 y 2 e

for flow along boundary l2 x a h between d and d2 according to eq 6 and for the anisotropic case the solution is 12 δ q l 2 y t q t 2 q s 2 a h y t x t γ 0 τ 0 π t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 n 2 4 6 2 t 2 γ n 1 τ n

and τ are determined from eqs 4 to 6 h is replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y note that eq 11 and eq 12 can also be obtained from eq 5 domain d at the corresponding boundaries 5 2 flux profile along l1 and l2 eqs 11 and 12 are complex functions whose behaviour was explored through numerical experiments figs 8 a and b show the flow profile along both boundaries i e along the y axis with y 0 both solutions being symmetrical about the x axis after 21 days of pumping t 3 104 min and q 1 m3 h for this experiment the pumping well is located at 10 0 m from a 5 m wide strip aquifer a 10 0 m and h 5 0 m in all cases the hydraulic properties in d1 are identical t1 10 3 m2 s s1 5 10 3 for curves a to f the properties of d2 are identical to those of d1 t1 t2 s1 s2 d is isotropic but its properties differ t varies from 2 10 4 to 2 10 2 m2 s and s from 10 3 to 6 10 1 making compartment d both the most or the least transmissive or the most and the least diffusive aquifer curve g is similar to c but d2 is the least transmissive and storativity is the least t2 10 4 m2 s s2 10 3 curve h differs from g only because d is anisotropic in transmissivity ty tx 50 0 analysis of these curves shows that as mentioned in earlier studies abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 the flow through boundary l1 is mainly from the compartment d to d1 locally however it can also be reversed from d1 to d when the central compartment d becomes the most transmissive aquifer fig 8a curves a b c g and h this flow reversal indicates that at a certain distance along the y axis or from the pumping well and after a certain duration of pumping the hydraulic gradient at the boundary between d1 and d is reversed this implies that streamlines are reversed because drawdown within the central compartment propagates faster than in the surrounding compartments such behaviour stems from the higher transmissivity in d but not necessarily because of a higher diffusivity curves a b for curve e d is the most diffusive but reversed flow is absent curve a presents the equal diffusivity ratio case in which flow reversal occurs regarding the storativity s the higher the value the greater the reversed flow curves a b c when compartment d2 on the right side is the least transmissive curves g and h the flow in d and therefore the reversed flow d1 to d increase and an increase in transmissivity anisotropy of d ty tx enhances the flow reversal curve h when d2 is the least transmissive reversed flow may occur even if t t1 but with t t2 not shown on the figure the increase in anisotropy of d ty tx will still increase such flow logically when d is the least transmissive no reversed flow will occur curves d e f as well as when t2 becomes the most transmissive aquifer not shown on the figure other tests concerned the distance between the pumping well and l1 a and the width of the central compartment h they showed that regarding distance a the greater the distance the greater the influence of pumping on the pumped compartment d1 and therefore the less on d and d2 therefore logically flows along the two discontinuities are reduced as a increases an increase in the width of the central compartment h induces an increase in the lateral transmissivity of the central compartment perpendicular to the x axis which facilitates the propagation of drawdown in this direction to the detriment of the y axis consequently drawdown within the aquifer of the central strip aquifer propagates less rapidly reducing the reversal hydraulic gradient between d1 and d and therefore the reversed flow flow along boundary l2 between d and d2 is less complex as it is always positive from d2 to d fig 8b it increases when d is the least transmissive compartment curves d e f and decreases when d is the most transmissive or anisotropic with ty tx compartment curves a b c h or when d2 is the least transmissive curves g and h logically when d2 is the most transmissive compartment flow increases not shown on the figure 5 3 time variation of flux along l1 and l2 figs 9 a and b show the evolution of flow profiles through both boundaries for case h on fig 8 the anisotropic case t y t x 50 0 at time of pumping t 1 7 30 200 500 3 103 3 104 and 108 min up until 30 min the flow at boundary l1 is only from compartment d to d1 as the hydraulic gradient between d1 and d is always positive during this period particularly from about 2 min when drawdown begins to reach l1 to 30 min drawdown does not propagate more rapidly in d1 than in d from t 30 min the flow reversal starts as the drawdown begins to propagate faster in d the location of the point of reversed flow into from d increases slightly with time at t 200 min the reversal point is at about 48 0 m and then converges to about 58 m y 58 0 m at t 108 min along l2 the flow from d2 to d increases with time particularly for the smallest values of y 0 y 150 200 m t 1 7 and 30 min then it flattens for longer time values but total flow increases significantly in fact after 200 min linear to bi linear flow regimes start to occur in d fig 10 c which means that d begins to drain the two surrounding aquifers d2 and d1 the precise assessment of flow along l1 eq 11 figs 7a and 8a is a challenging task it requires separation of the two flow components the one from d to d1 positive flow and the one from d1 to d negative or reversed flow this implies separating the positive and negative values of the calculation of eq 11 the flow at each time t can be calculated by integrating eq 11 along the y axis at the appropriate interval for flow from d to d1 the solution is 13 δ q l 1 t q 2 0 y f δ q l 1 q d y and the one from d1 to d flow reversal is 14 δ q l 1 t q 2 y f δ q l 1 q d y where δ q l 1 q is given by eq 11 and yf is the location of the point of reversed flow into from compartment d onto the y axis however no formal solution of the roots of eq 11 was found and they were evaluated numerically using the newton raphson method for flow along l2 entering compartment d from d2 eq 12 has to be integrated along l2 y which gives 15 δ q l 2 t q 2 0 δ q l 2 q d y where δ q l 2 q is given by eq 12 note that all integrals in eqs 13 to 15 are multiplied by two to account for symmetrical properties of equations about the x axis net flow from domain d is obtained by subtracting eq 13 from both eqs 14 and 15 fig 10a shows the variations of the various flow components over time for the anisotropic example given in fig 9 t y tx 50 0 and for the case where the compartment d is isotropic t y tx 1 0 all other parameters remaining unchanged fig 10b presents the net flow from the strip aquifer d net flow eq 13 eq 14 eq 15 fig 10c shows the corresponding drawdowns and their derivatives at the pumping well flow entering d1 from d or the one entering d from d1 flow reversal increases sharply once drawdown begins to propagate significantly in d 1 or negative slope on derivatives then once the bi linear to linear flow regime is established in d t 100 min fig 10c and drawdown propagates in the right side compartment d2 the flow along l1 increases and then slows down almost stabilizing over long times when the whole system responds to pumping second radial flow regime the contribution of the strip aquifer to compartment d1 varies over time net flow fig 10b according to the various flow components it first increases rapidly due to the contribution of d to d1 positive flow and then once the feature begins to drain the system it decreases as reversed flow and flow from d2 increase logically an increase of the anisotropy ratio in d increases the net contribution of d 6 extension of the proposed theory to a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near an infinite fault we propose drawdown solutions for the case of a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length 2l making an angle α with the x axis fig 1b fig 11 near an infinite vertical discontinuity they are based on the drawdown solutions for the three compartments developed above for the isotropic and anisotropic cases the pumping well is located at the centre of the fracture at a distance a from l1 the fracture fully penetrates the aquifer and should not cross domain d i e lcosα a assuming that the pumping rate q is uniformly distributed along the fracture i e the rate of pumping per unit length of the fracture is q x y q 2 l according to dewandel et al 2018 drawdown solutions can be obtained by integrating the above solutions along the fracture axis solutions for the three domains then take the following general form 16 s f r a c x y t l l s x y t d ϑ where s x y t corresponds to eqs 4 5 or 6 for the isotropic case which combined with eqs 7 8 or 9 gives the solutions for the anisotropic case or t y t x 1 note that for the particular case where the distance of the pumped fracture to l1 is infinite a i e there is only one aquifer system d1 eq 16 corresponds exactly to a known analytical solution gringarten et al 1974 their eq 20 for drawdown in a well pumping a vertical fracture with uniform flux distribution that fully penetrates the aquifer dewandel et al 2018 the integral in eq 16 can be evaluated numerically with the gauss legendre quadrature as done here or evaluated using a discretized form of eq 16 by dividing the fracture into small elements and placing the appropriate line source solution at the centre of each segment dewandel et al 2018 their eq 7 6 1 drawdown and flow behaviours at the pumping well fig 11 presents the result of eq 16 for a pumping well of radius rw intercepting a fracture parallel to domain d i e parallel to the y axis α 90 dimensionless time according to fracture length tdf t 1 t s 1 l 2 and dimensionless drawdown s d f a l t d f 2 π t 1 q s p w f r w t are used for presenting the case where t1 s1 0 1 t s t2 s2 0 5 t y t x 10 0 t t1 100 0 t1 t2 20 0 h 5 m and a l ratios varying from 1 to 10 this setting describes the behaviour of a fracture with increasing distance from boundary l1 at the start of pumping the flow is linear half unit slope of derivative curves and corresponds to flow from aquifer d1 to the fracture intersected by the pumping well for intermediate pumping stages the derivative curves may describe the first infinite acting radial flow when both the boundary l1 has not yet been reached by pumping and the fracture is far enough from l1 a l 4 for this case sdf ln tdf 1 2 or sfrac ln t q 4πt 1 then once the cone of depression begins to reach boundary l1 the derivative slope decreases and may tend to 1 when the half fracture size is close to the distance between the centre of the fracture and l1 a l 3 this shows that d acts temporarily as a steady state source at times tdf 10 0 derivatives follow a near ¼ slope describing the earlier mentioned bi linear flow regime within domain d as for the case of pumping in a well without fracture the derivative slope may also tend to ½ when s s1 ratios are high linear flow regime within d for late pumping stages tdf 2 105 in fig 11 the drawdown has diffused through the whole domain d and propagates significantly into the right side aquifer domain d2 indicating that d drains the whole aquifer system a second radial flow regime is encountered and characterizes the overall response of the aquifer system the derivative always tending to 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 or s f r a c l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 as in previous solutions see section 3 above 6 2 flow along and through boundaries l1 and l2 as done previously for pumping in a well without fracture flow along and across both boundaries l1 and l2 can also be computed using the same procedure as described before section 5 figs 12 and 13 show examples of flow profiles along l1 and l2 at t 3 104 min and time variations of fluxes along l1 and l2 respectively for pumping in a 20 m long fracture 2l 20 m either parallel α 90 perpendicular α 0 or making a 45 angle with compartment d α 45 in all cases the aquifer properties in all three compartments are identical to case h in fig 8 t1 10 3 m2 s

in a fracture flow profiles along both boundaries l1 and l2 have a similar shape compared to the case of pumping in a well and are logically symmetric to the y axis when the fracture is symmetric to the y axis α 0 and 90 fig 12 compared to pumping in a well flow along boundary l1 fig 12a is higher near the x axis x 0 when the fracture is perpendicular to d α 0 and is logically less important when it is parallel to it α 90 when the fracture makes a secant angle with d α 45 maximum flow shifts to the side where the fracture is closer to boundary l1 here to the right reversed flow from d1 to d is similar in all cases including the pumping well case as the reversal point is far from the fracture at about 50 m concerning flow along boundary l2 fig 12b the same remarks apply except that for the fracture cases flux distribution is characterized by a sharp distribution almost centred along the x axis near x 0 and is locally higher than that for the well case this shows that pumping in a fracture concentrates flow in a larger area and then solicits more compartment d2 near the fracture when pumping a fracture time variations of flow show similar behaviour to that of the pumping well case fig 13a in particular flow reversal is almost identical for all cases the main difference compared to the pumping well case occurs when the fracture makes a secant angle with d α 0 and 45 forcing d but also d2 to react more rapidly even at early stages during the linear flow caused by pumping in the fracture fig 13c however for late pumping stages the flow from d to d1 is less in the cases considering a fracture when compared to the pumping well case this difference stems from the larger pumped area that facilitates the reaction of d1 near the pumped fracture consequently the net flow from compartment d to d1 fig 13b is less important when pumping is done through a fracture 7 conclusion new analytical solutions for drawdown are proposed for a pumping well and for a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length near an infinite vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity vein dyke strip aquifer with finite width finite storativity and finite and possibly anisotropic hydraulic conductivity consequently the solutions proposed can relate to a relatively large set of hydrogeological situations however the dip of the structure must be close to vertical and long enough with regard to the pumping duration to be considered as infinite for a good use of the solutions see fig 1 the solutions are based on an unconventional application of well image theory without limitation on the diffusivity contrast between the aquifer compartments and considering flow transience within the fault solutions were developed for the drawdown in three aquifer compartments the pumped compartment the one within the fault zone and the compartment on the other side of the fault the solutions are good approximations of the corresponding partial differential equations and comparison with numerical simulations showed high accuracy drawdown and flow regimes in the pumping well were analysed in various configurations and overall are similar to previous studies especially when the fault zone is strongly permeable and anisotropic in the last case and once the cone of depression reaches the fault the slope of the logarithmic derivative of drawdown in the pumping well tends to 1 showing that the fault temporarily acts as a steady state source later when the fault begins to drain the whole aquifer system the derivative follows typical ¼ or ½ slopes depending upon the contrast in aquifer properties that describe bi linear to linear flow regimes within the fault zone for the late stages of pumping the derivative forms a second radial flow regime that depends upon the average transmissivities of the two external aquifer compartments but not on the fault zone the first radial flow is established at an early stage before the cone of depression reaches the fault zone this application of image well theory fits the need for other well functions which should be derivable on x to get mathematical expressions of strength coefficients therefore drawdown solutions were developed for a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near the same infinite vertical fault zone in terms of flow regimes behaviour was similar to the pumping well case except for early pumping stages when a first linear flow regime defines the response of the pumped vertical fracture we also believe that other solutions can be derived for a partially penetrating well or a partially penetrating fracture pumped by a well located near a 3 d anisotropic fault using the hantush and hantush leaky well functions hantush 1964 1966 dewandel et al 2014 a 3 d geometry of the pumped fracture could be considered as well an interesting point of the proposed solutions is the possibility to derive transient flow solutions along both sides of the fault zone and thus net transient flow from the fault itself depending on the contrast in aquifer parameters between the three compartments flow reversal between the fault and the pumped aquifer occurs as found in previous work when the fault zone is the most permeable we show that net flow from the fault into the pumped aquifer increases rapidly during the early pumping stage due to contribution of the fault zone and then once the fault begins to drain the system it decreases as reversed flow and flow from the opposite side aquifer increase logically an increasing anisotropy of the fault zone increases the net contribution of the fault when the pumping takes place through a vertical fracture near a fault zone net flow is less important because the fracture increases the reaction of the pumped compartment compared to the fault zone and the opposite side compartment furthermore all results show that the net flow contribution is characterized by strong time variation that stabilizes by long pumping stages this may influence the quality of the pumped water especially when the water quality of the fault zone is different from that where the well is located future work should focus on such flow computations in an experimental site using geochemical data for assessing the origin of water or fluid when pumping a well or one that intersects and pumps a fracture near a vertical geological discontinuity credit authorship contribution statement benoît dewandel conceptualization methodology writing original draft

207,we present a new set of analytical solutions for analysing pumping tests in a well near a vertical fault zone dyke or vein we consider a fault zone with finite width storativity and hydraulic conductivity which can be anisotropic and without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three aquifer domains pumped aquifer fault zone and opposite side aquifer this configuration not described before also considers flow transience within the fault zone drawdown solutions were developed for the three aquifer domains based on an unconventional application of the well image theory their comparison with numerical modelling results was very satisfactory drawdown behaviour at the pumping well is discussed for contrasted properties between the three aquifer domains original analytical solutions for transient flow along both sides of the fault zone and net transient flow from the fault itself are proposed and discussed with particular attention to flow reversal from the pumped compartment to the fault zone which occurs where the fault zone is the most transmissive finally we extend the solutions to the case of a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near the same vertical geological discontinuity keywords pumping test anisotropic fault pumping near a fault compartmented aquifer analytical solution list of symbols a distance

introduction in hydrogeology the oil and gas industry and geothermal activities well testing is an essential tool for assessing the hydrodynamic properties of a reservoir the evaluation of these properties as well as their variability in space is essential for improving resource management e g raghavan 2004 dewandel et al 2012 in addition detailed groundwater flow conditions particularly in fractured systems are required for pressure and transfer modelling for instance in the case of a nuclear waste deposit geothermal exploitation or contaminant transport therefore the design of an adequate conceptual model based on well test data prior to quantification of the hydrogeologic parameters has been a topic of interest for decades bourdet et al 1983 1989 ehlig economides 1988 renard et al 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 ferroud et al 2019 etc a common case encountered in the field is a well located near a fault fig 1a that may act as a barrier or a conduit or a combination of both to flow e g maslia and prowell 1990 haneberg 1995 bense et al 2003 in sedimentary rock but not only faults may be permeable or act as low or non permeable structures because the throw along the fault plane may be such that a permeable layer on one side of the fault is completely or partially juxtaposed against an impermeable layer on the other side or because of low hydraulic conductivity materials in the core of the fault zone the reverse is also possible where the rock s hydraulic conductivity is enhanced because of unaltered fracturing along the fault zone caine et al 1996 other geological features such as dykes veins or karst conduits may locally enhance the hydraulic conductivity and drain the surrounding aquifer or act as a barrier or low permeability discontinuity to flow dewandel et al 2011 perrin et al 2011 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 maréchal et al 2014 xu et al 2018 xiong et al 2017 depending upon the properties of the fault or of the geological discontinuity fluid flow may occur along the structure and across the structure s planes several analytical studies have described transient pressure behaviour in the pumping well and flow processes such work often refers to a pumping well near a fault of infinite length with finite conductivity abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 escobar et al 2013 yaxley 1987 derived an analytical solution from bixel s et al 1963 work for a well located near a partially communicating vertical fault this model dedicated to low permeable barrier does not account for flow along the fault plane abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 presented a solution for a well located near a finite conductivity vertical fault with fracture skin for simulating damage zones on the sides of the fault plane their solution allowed varying aquifer properties on both sides of the fault considered flow along and across the fault plane but assumed a small fault width and neglected fault storativity and thus flow transience in the fault zone the net flux in out of the fault being nil this model was dedicated to fault zones with higher hydraulic conductivity than those of the surrounding aquifers later rahman et al 2003 proposed a semi analytical solution similar to abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 s work to account for transient flow in the fracture plane but also assumed a greater hydraulic conductivity in the fault other solutions exist in the literature such as that developed by boussila et al 2003 for a well near a linear leaky boundary in laterally infinite composite systems or the one proposed by althawad 2016 for a pumping well intersecting and pumping a finite conductivity fracture of infinite length near a finite conductivity fracture of infinite length vertical faults or other vertical geological discontinuities can also be conceptualized as vertically compartmented aquifers butler and liu 1991 and dewandel et al 2014 proposed solutions for investigating the influence of a pumping well located in a linear strip aquifer representing the geological discontinuity bounded laterally by aquifers of differing properties however no analytical solution was provided for a pumping well located in one of the two external compartments and thus near the geological discontinuity anderson 2006 using the method of images presented an analytical solution for a pumping well near such a discontinuity his solution allows considering the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity of the central compartment the one representing a vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity however this solution was established for steady state flow only rafini and larocque 2009 used numerical models for assessing the flow behaviour induced by a pumping test near a fault zone embedded in a low permeable matrix with various fault inclinations but they did not consider the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone we propose new analytical solutions for drawdown induced by a pumping well near an infinite sub vertical and anisotropic fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity we consider a fault zone of finite width storativity and hydraulic conductivity that can be anisotropic fig 1 a without limitation of the diffusivity contrast between the three aquifer domains pumped aquifer fault zone and opposite side aquifer which was not considered in earlier works our solutions are based upon an unconventional application of the well image theory solutions are first developed for an isotropic fault and then extended to the anisotropic case they are given for the three aquifer domains and are compared to numerical modelling the hydrodynamic signatures of drawdown and flow behaviour at the pumping well are discussed analytical solutions for transient flow along both sides of the central compartment the fault zone are given in terms of spatial and transient evolution with particular attention to reversed flow i e flow from the pumped compartment entering the fault zone which can occur under specific conditions these new solutions allow discussing the transient behaviour of such flow which has not been studied in the past finally we show that the solutions can be extended to other cases such as a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near an infinite vertical fault zone fig 1b the proposed solutions should be useful for examining and modelling drawdown created by a pumping well or a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture near a vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity such as dykes veins buried channels embedded in other materials or even karst conduits 2 theoretical method and mathematical model 2 1 conceptual model the problem of interest consists in evaluating drawdown as a function of coordinates x y and time caused by a pumping well near an infinite vertical fault or geological discontinuity with finite thickness finite storativity and anisotropic hydraulic conductivity fig 1a following anderson s 2006 nomenclature the system is divided in three domains d1 d and d2 with l1 representing the boundary between d1 and d and l2 the one between d and d2 domain d the infinite vertical fault separates two semi infinite half spaces the pumping well is located in d1 it is at the origin of a cartesian coordinate system x 0 y 0 and is at a distance a from l1 the y axis is parallel to the two boundaries l1 and l2 the well fully penetrates the aquifer and produces at a constant flowrate q the overall domain d1 d d2 assumes a confined condition each domain is characterized by its own transmissivity and storativity d has anisotropic hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal plane while the two other domains are isotropic domain thicknesses can be different not shown on fig 1a damage zones along the fault zones d are not considered 2 2 method of images the method of images is a classic technique for tackling boundary value problems such as those encountered in heat conduction electrostatics and particularly in groundwater flow to solve the problem of no flow constant boundaries or leaky boundaries ferris et al 1962 kruseman et al 1990 bruggeman 1999 anderson 2000 2006 solutions with this method have the advantage of providing convenient forms compared to solutions from differential equations that may require numerical inversion of a laplace transform the proposed solutions are based upon an unconventional application of the well image theory this method originally proposed by fenske 1984 for the case of a boundary separating two aquifers with dissimilar diffusivities and later extended by dewandel et al 2014 to a well located in an infinite linear strip aquifer limited on both sides by aquifers of differing properties has been further developed for the case presented here though good and useful approximations the proposed solutions are not shown to be exact solutions to the appropriate partial differential equations bixel et al 1963 butler and liu 1991 appendix a hereafter we do believe however that although it is not the method used here drawdown solutions can also be obtained by numerical inversion of a laplace transform in a general manner and using the well image theory for the case presented here one can consider the drawdown in domain d1 to consist of two components direct drawdown caused by the pumping well and reflected drawdowns caused by the reflection of image well drawdowns from the two boundaries onto d1 total drawdown can be represented by a sum of drawdowns caused by the pumping well and that caused by image wells located across the boundaries each image well is strengthened to consider the contrast in properties between the three domains fig 2 a shows the solution for drawdown in d1 where each dot corresponds to an image well with its distance from the pumping well and its strength this technique is widely used for solving the particular cases of no flow and constant head boundary conditions e g ferris et al 1962 kruseman et al 1990 in these cases image strength is 1 or 1 more information on the well image theory can be found in anderson 2000 2006 or in bruggeman 1999 the drawdown in domains d and d2 is the transmitted drawdown across the boundaries its solutions depend upon the properties of the domain of interest and are analogues of the solution in d1 consequently drawdown can also be represented as the sum of drawdowns caused by the producing well and one or two infinite well image series depending upon the domain lying outside the domain of interest whereby each pumping and image well was strengthened to cover the aquifer properties of each domain figs 2b and 2c along the boundaries conditions vary from boundary l1 between d1 and d to boundary l2 between d and d2 and the following criteria must be satisfied 1 drawdown must be equal on both sides of the boundaries then s 1 a y t s a y t along boundary l1 and s 2 a h y t s a h y t along boundary l2 1 unit discharge orthogonal to the boundaries must be equal on both sides as well then t 1 s 1 a y t x t s a y t x along boundary l1 and t 2 s 2 a h y t x t s a h y t x along boundary l2 where s1 x y t s x y t and s2 x y t are the drawdowns in each domain d1 d and d2 t1 t and t2 are the transmissivity values of each domain a is the distance from the pumping well to boundary l1 and h is the width of domain d 2 3 general solutions for drawdown here we first considered the case where domain d is isotropic a second section deals with the anisotropy of this domain all three domains are characterized by dissimilar diffusivity values t1 s1 t s t2 s2 using the well image theory described above the general solutions for drawdown valid for each domain are expressed as series fig 2 for domain 1 d1 drawdown is expressed by that of the producing well that of one image well at the opposite of l1 at x 2a and that of one infinite image well series lying outside d1 for domain d drawdown is expressed by two infinite image well series lying outside d and for d2 by one infinite image well series lying outside d2 the general form of solutions for drawdown are as follows for an observation well in domain d1 1 s 1 x y t q 4 π t 1 w s 1 4 t 1 t x 2 y 2 α 0 w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a x 2 y 2 n 2 4 6 α i w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a n h x 2 y 2 for domain d 2 s x y t q 4 π t n 2 4 6 β i w s

function also noted ei u s1 and t1 m2 s are the storage coefficient and transmissivity of the aquifer in d1 respectively s and t m2 s are those of the strip aquifer in d and s2 and t2 m2 s those of aquifer d2 a m is the distance from the pumping well to l1 and q is the pumping rate m3s 1 α0 αn βi βi and δi are the image well strengths now we must evaluate the strength coefficients of each image well 2 4 drawdown solutions for the three domains 2 4 1 isotropic case we consider the first series of images according to l1 and l2 fig 3 a the pumping well is first imaged according to l1 the result of applying the two boundary conditions at boundary l1 s 1 a y t s a y t and t 1 s 1 a y t x t s a y t x is that the two strength coefficients α0 and β0 depend upon the contrast of diffusivity between domains d1 and d the distance to the boundary a and time t appendix b gives the detail of their solutions this case refers to the influence of a partial hydrologic barrier that separates two domains with contrasted diffusivities where the drawdown solutions for both domains d1 and d correspond to the ones proposed by fenske 1984 then considering the case of two parallel boundaries l1 and l2 and thus that of a well pumping near an infinite strip aquifer the pumping well must be imaged about the second boundary l2 2nd image which allows evaluating strength coefficients β0 and δ0 fig 3a while applying the new boundary conditions s 2 a h y t s a h y t and t 2 s 2 a h y t x t s a h y t x these strengths depend upon previous ones β0 for β0 but also on the diffusivity contrast between domains d and d2 on the width of domain d h and on time t appendix b gives the detail of their solutions then as this last image well does not respect the conditions at boundary l1 it must be imaged about l1 3rd image which allows evaluating strength coefficients α1 and β1 according to boundary conditions in l1 fig 3b as the 3rd image does not respect the condition along l2 it has to be imaged about l2 4th image and strength coefficients β1 and δ1 should be evaluated according to boundary conditions in l2 fig 3b and so on therefore each iteration results in a new image well with a strength evaluated according to boundary conditions at l1 and l2 as the strength of the nth image well depends upon the product of all previous image strengths the strengths of each image well series can be expressed as a combination of arithmetic and geometrical series the drawdown for an observation well located in d1 is 4 s 1 x y t q 4 π t 1 w s 1 4 t 1 t x 2 y 2 t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 w s 1 4 t 1 t 2 a x 2 y

integral and e u is the exponential function as a result the strength coefficients depend upon geometrical series that are a function of each domain diffusivity time the distance a from the pumping well to the first boundary l1 and the width h of the strip aquifer width of d in each infinite series the strength coefficient of each image well decreases with distance from both boundaries and each series converges absolutely to solve eqs 4 to 6 we used an algorithm based on an iterative process where the number of images is determined when the absolute value of a certain metric given by the nth computation of the nth becomes negligible e g 10 6 this criterion ensures high computation accuracy note that for the case of time constant strength coefficients equal diffusivity ratio between the compartments the solutions are the same as those of the appropriate partial differential equation solutions of this particular case are given in appendix c for the three aquifer domains and as expected strength coefficients are identical to the ones given in anderson 2006 for a solution in steady state condition 2 4 2 anisotropic case analytical solutions for the three domains can be obtained for the case where the geologic discontinuity d has an anisotropic transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity these solutions are based on the isotropic solutions eqs 4 to 6 and standard transformed coordinate techniques e g hantush 1966 ramey 1975 neuman et al 1984 it is assumed that the main axes of transmissivity in d are orientated along the x and y directions thus ty and tx are parallel and orthogonal to both boundaries respectively and t t x t y as the pumping well fully penetrates the aquifer in d1 flow lines are parallel to the bottom of the aquifer consequently the anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity in the vertical plane is not considered according to bear and dagan 1965 and anderson 2006 the transformed coordinates in d1 remain unchanged however in d2 x coordinate must be shifted to the right along the x axis to account for the transformed width of d i e h t y t x therefore 7 in d 1 x x and y y 8 and in d 2 x x h t y t x 1 and y y in d the transformed coordinates are more complex because of rotational flow in d they are x x t y t x and y y where x is a function of the real coordinate system that assumes at boundary l1 i e between d1 and d x x x a and at the second boundary l2 i e between d and d2 x x x a h t y t x these re scaling relationships show that d must also be shifted to the right along the x axis to account for the transformed width h t y t x according to dewandel et al 2014 x can be estimated empirically it is found that x x a t x t y 1 which gives for a x a h 9 x t y t x x a a the evaluated relationship still depends on the anisotropy ratio in d and is linear which agrees with baer and dagan 1965 drawdown solutions in the transform domains are not re written as they use isotropic solutions eqs 4 5 6 where h is replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y in eq 5 for an observation well in d x is replaced by x and in eq 6 for a well in d2 x is replaced by x according to the previous re scaling rules eqs 9 and 10 the y coordinates remain unchanged as well as the x coordinates in eq 4 for a well in domain d1 re scaling of all three domains also satisfies long pumping stages when drawdown solutions are characterized by straight lines on semi log plots whose slope values depend on the average transmissivity of domains d1 and d2 these solutions are compared with numerical modelling particularly the one in d in section 4 comparisons between the developed solutions and numerical simulations 3 drawdown and flow behaviour at the pumping well 3 1 isotropic case as many type curves exist for describing flow behaviour near such a discontinuity domain d some examples are given below to discuss the main flow behaviour characteristics fig 4 shows the result of eq 4 at a pumping well of radius rw x w y w 2 r w using dimensionless time tdl t 1 t s 1 a 2 and dimensionless drawdown s d r w a t d l 2 π t 1 q s p w r w t for the case where t1 s1 0 1 t2 s2 0 5 t1 t2 20 0 h 5 m fig 4a presents the case where t t1 varies from 10 2 to 103 with s s1 20 0 and fig 4b the case where s s1 varies from 10 3 to 103 with t t1 100 0 diffusivity in d thus varies between 10 2 and 103 the dimensionless forms of the solutions eqs 4 to 6 are provided as supporting information a convenient starting point for the analysis of eq 4 is the log log diagnostic plot developed by bourdet et al 1983 in this plot both drawdown sd and its derivative sd are shown with respect to the natural logarithm of time sd ln tdl amongst others this log log plot is commonly used for identifying flow regimes during a pumping test ehlig economides 1988 bourdet et al 1989 spane and wurstner 1993 renard et al 2009 ferroud et al 2019 for all presented derivative curves in this work derivatives were computed numerically according to bourdet s et al 1989 algorithm during the early stages of pumping when the cone of depression has not yet reached boundary l1 tdl 0 2 on figs 4a and b eq 4 is identical to the solution of an infinite homogeneous aquifer theis 1935 for a large enough tdl the condition for which theis equation reduces to cooper jacob s 1946 equation a straight line on a semi logarithmic plot with a slope ½ characterizes dimensionless drawdown its logarithmic derivative is constant value of ½ reflecting the first infinite radial flow to the well fig 4 therefore for short times the logarithmic derivative of drawdown will converge to s ln t q 4πt 1 once the cone of depression begins to reach boundary l1 tdl 0 2 transmissivity and storage coefficient ratios between the pumped d1 and the strip d aquifers change the character of the drawdown curves at that time the drawdown propagates along boundary l1 and within the strip aquifer for high t t1 or s s1 ratios the derivative slope tends to 1 showing that the fault zone acts as a steady state source i e constant head boundary abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 the higher the t t1 or s s1 ratios the more the 1 slope is established and the longer it lasts note that this trend generally characterizes a fault zone with infinite hydraulic conductivity near a pumping well abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 escobar et al 2013 however fig 4b also shows that a similar trend can be obtained for high s s1 ratios and not necessarily high t t1 ratios as in the previously cited literature then at medium stages tdl 10 0 when the fault begins to drain the whole aquifer system derivatives follow a near ¼ slope which describes a bi linear flow regime within d as mentioned in previously cited work however when s s1 ratios are high 100 0 on fig 4b the derivative s slope tends to ½ describing a linear flow regime within d it is also interesting to note that for intermediate t t1 ratios with t t1 or s s1 ratios drawdown behaves similarly to naturally fractured media like dual porosity aquifers abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 or dual permeability media such as multilayer aquifers when t t1 and s s1 ratios decrease figs 4a and b derivative curves rise up and durations of the 1 derivative slope period and subsequent ¼ or ½ slope decrease linear flow regimes showing that d is less able to drain the whole aquifer system in the proposed examples the derivative may form a hump at the end of the linear flow period within d tdl 30 on fig 4a or 6 000 on fig 4b on fig 4a it is the consequence of a decrease in the t t1 ratio 1 and on fig 4b it is the result of a lower diffusivity contrast between domains d and d2 the smaller the contrast the greater the hump which may cause boundary l1 fig 4a and l2 fig 4b to appear temporarily as a no flow boundary see blue curves on fig 4a at late pumping stages tdl 105 on figs 4a and 4b drawdown has diffused through the whole domain d and propagates significantly in the third domain d2 this period is characterized by a second radial flow regime illustrating the overall response of the aquifer system during very late stages of pumping i e t or tdl all strength coefficients γi and τi in eq 4 but also in eqs 5 and 6 tend to 1 therefore and after rearranging eq 4 the logarithmic derivative of the dimensionless drawdown for late pumping stages leads to 10 lim t d l s d t d l 2 t 1 t 1 t 1 2 t t 1 t t t 2 t 2 t n 0 1 2 t t 2 t 2 t n t t 1 t 1 t n as t t 2 t 2 t and t t 1 t 1 t ratios are between 1 and 1 the series can be regarded as a taylor series that tends for n to t 1 t t 2 t 2 t t 1 t 2 therefore the last equation simplifies to lim t d l s d t d l 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 showing that the logarithmic derivative of the dimensionless drawdown depends only on the transmissivities of the pumped aquifer d1 and of domain d2 thus the logarithmic derivative of drawdown s ln t will converge to a constant value inversely proportional to the average transmissivities of d1 and d2 s l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 this shows that for late stage pumping the drawdown slope does not depend on the transmissivity of the strip aquifer d representing a fault another geological discontinuity or another compartment but on those of the pumped compartment and of the compartment on the other side of the geological discontinuity this behaviour agrees with previous work abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 escobar et al 2013 3 2 anisotropic case as discussed above the solution with an anisotropic central compartment d is similar to that for the isotropic case eq 4 h being replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y therefore drawdown and derivative curves are characterized by a similar behaviour fig 5 during the early stage pumping tdl 0 2 sd ln tdl 1 2 or s ln t q 4πt 1 or the first infinite acting radial flow when boundary l1 has not been reached by the pumping and for late stage pumping sd ln tdl always tends to 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 or s l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 which characterizes the overall response of the aquifer system however compared to the isotropic case tx ty curves t t1 100 0 on fig 4a or s s1 20 0 on fig 4b the ty tx ratio increase induces a decrease of the derivative slope up to 1 for the highest ratios ty tx 100 0 because of the increasing transmissivity contrast ty t1 in a direction perpendicular to the central compartment x axis this shows that the anisotropy increase of transmissivity in d increases the capacity of the central compartment to drain the entire system and thus its capacity to supply water to the pumped d1 compartment consequently at medium stage bi linear flow ¼ derivatives slope or linear flow ½ derivatives slope regimes are shifted in time the higher the ty tx ratio the greater the offset conversely a decrease in the anisotropy ratio ty tx 1 0 fig 5 induces a lower transmissivity contrast between d1 and d ty t1 this reduces both the exchange between domains and the capacity of d to drain the whole system for the lowest contrast ty tx 10 2 d may act as a semi permeable boundary even though the overall transmissivity value of d is still significantly higher than that of d1 t t1 100 0 fig 5 4 comparison between developed solutions and numerical simulations we compared the performance of solutions with transmissivity anisotropy in d with numerical modelling to check their accuracy but also to evaluate eq 9 required for the drawdown solutions in d the numerical modelling was developed with the marthe 7 4 brgm computer code thiéry 2010 2015 2018 marthe allows 2d or 3d modelling of flow and mass transfers in aquifer systems including climatic and human influences groundwater flow is computed by a 3 d finite volume approach to solve the hydrodynamic equation based on darcy s law and mass conservation the grid geometry used in the numerical model is a 40 40 km square grid with a constant head boundary condition at each side in the x y plane cell size varies from 1 1 m at the origin pumping well up to 500 500 m near the limits of the model vertically the pumped aquifer is a 100 m thick layer subdivided into 25 4 m thick layers the aquifer is capped by an impermeable layer no flow condition creating a confined condition for the pumped layer several diffusivity ratios between the three domains and widths of the strip aquifer were prescribed to test the isotropic and the anisotropic solutions at various observation well locations i e in the pumped compartment d1 the strip aquifer d and in the right side compartment d2 fig 6 shows the results of two of these models for testing the anisotropic solutions in the model the pumping well fully penetrates the aquifer and is located at the centre of the grid x 0 y 0 and at 12 m a 12 m from a 8 m wide strip aquifer h 8 m in both cases transmissivity in the pumped compartment d1 t1 is 10 2 m2 s hydraulic conductivity k1 10 4 m s the storage coefficient s1 is 2 0 10 2 specific storage ss1 2 10 4 m 1 and the transmissivity and storage coefficient of the right hand side compartment d2 t2 is 5 10 3 m2 s k2 5 10 5 m s and s2 is 10 3 ss2 10 5 m 1 respectively only the properties of the strip aquifer d differ although the t y t x anisotropy ratio is the same at 10 0 in model 1 t is 10 1 m2 s k 10 3 m s and s is 10 1 ss 10 3 m 1 and in model 2 t is 3 10 3 m2 s k 3 10 5 m s and s is 2 10 2 ss 2 10 4 m 1 thus in model 1 the strip aquifer is the most transmissive and capacitive of the whole domain while it is the least transmissive and the least capacitive in model 2 for the simulations a constant pumping rate of q 1 11 10 2 m3 s 40 m3 h was set up for up to 700 days about 106 min in this context the model s boundaries were not reached and the aquifer remained saturated figs 6a and b compare the results of numerical modelling with analytically computed drawdown values as shown on the figures drawdown values and derivatives computed with the proposed solutions eqs 4 to 6 with the proposed re scaling rules of eqs 7 to 9 for observation wells in the pumped aquifer d1 curves a to d on figures for the ones in the strip aquifer d curves e and f and for the ones in the right side aquifer d2 curves g and h perfectly match the values from numerical modelling the root mean square error rmse was calculated for each numerical analytical comparison of drawdown values see inserted tables on figs 6a and 6b rmse values range between 1 4 10 3 and 1 7 10 2 m showing that the proposed analytical solutions agree with the numerical modelling a good indication of their accuracy 5 flow along and through boundaries l1 and l2 as mentioned in earlier studies flow through and across a fracture plane or geological discontinuity domain d is complex and may be locally reversed fig 7 particularly where the fault transmissivity is higher than that of other compartments abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 the aim of this section is to propose analytical solutions of such flows and to highlight their spatial and transient evolutions under different diffusivity contrasts t1 s1 t s t2 s2 the dimensionless forms of the following solutions are provided as supporting information 5 1 analytical solutions for flows through l1 and l2 analytical solutions for flow through both boundaries can be derived from eqs 4 to 6 for an isotropic central compartment d and with re scaling rules presented in section 2 4 2 for the anisotropic case eqs 7 to 9 the solutions for flow are normalized with respect to the pumping flowrate q thus representing the fraction of q that flows through l1 and l2 δ q l 1 q δ q l 2 q along boundary l1 x a between d1 and d according to eq 4 and for the anisotropic case the solution is 11 δ q l 1 y t q t 1 q s 1 a y t x t γ 0 π t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 a a 2 y 2 e

for flow along boundary l2 x a h between d and d2 according to eq 6 and for the anisotropic case the solution is 12 δ q l 2 y t q t 2 q s 2 a h y t x t γ 0 τ 0 π t 1 τ 0 t γ 0 n 2 4 6 2 t 2 γ n 1 τ n

and τ are determined from eqs 4 to 6 h is replaced by h t y t x and t by t x t y note that eq 11 and eq 12 can also be obtained from eq 5 domain d at the corresponding boundaries 5 2 flux profile along l1 and l2 eqs 11 and 12 are complex functions whose behaviour was explored through numerical experiments figs 8 a and b show the flow profile along both boundaries i e along the y axis with y 0 both solutions being symmetrical about the x axis after 21 days of pumping t 3 104 min and q 1 m3 h for this experiment the pumping well is located at 10 0 m from a 5 m wide strip aquifer a 10 0 m and h 5 0 m in all cases the hydraulic properties in d1 are identical t1 10 3 m2 s s1 5 10 3 for curves a to f the properties of d2 are identical to those of d1 t1 t2 s1 s2 d is isotropic but its properties differ t varies from 2 10 4 to 2 10 2 m2 s and s from 10 3 to 6 10 1 making compartment d both the most or the least transmissive or the most and the least diffusive aquifer curve g is similar to c but d2 is the least transmissive and storativity is the least t2 10 4 m2 s s2 10 3 curve h differs from g only because d is anisotropic in transmissivity ty tx 50 0 analysis of these curves shows that as mentioned in earlier studies abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 abbaszadeh et al 2000 rahman et al 2003 the flow through boundary l1 is mainly from the compartment d to d1 locally however it can also be reversed from d1 to d when the central compartment d becomes the most transmissive aquifer fig 8a curves a b c g and h this flow reversal indicates that at a certain distance along the y axis or from the pumping well and after a certain duration of pumping the hydraulic gradient at the boundary between d1 and d is reversed this implies that streamlines are reversed because drawdown within the central compartment propagates faster than in the surrounding compartments such behaviour stems from the higher transmissivity in d but not necessarily because of a higher diffusivity curves a b for curve e d is the most diffusive but reversed flow is absent curve a presents the equal diffusivity ratio case in which flow reversal occurs regarding the storativity s the higher the value the greater the reversed flow curves a b c when compartment d2 on the right side is the least transmissive curves g and h the flow in d and therefore the reversed flow d1 to d increase and an increase in transmissivity anisotropy of d ty tx enhances the flow reversal curve h when d2 is the least transmissive reversed flow may occur even if t t1 but with t t2 not shown on the figure the increase in anisotropy of d ty tx will still increase such flow logically when d is the least transmissive no reversed flow will occur curves d e f as well as when t2 becomes the most transmissive aquifer not shown on the figure other tests concerned the distance between the pumping well and l1 a and the width of the central compartment h they showed that regarding distance a the greater the distance the greater the influence of pumping on the pumped compartment d1 and therefore the less on d and d2 therefore logically flows along the two discontinuities are reduced as a increases an increase in the width of the central compartment h induces an increase in the lateral transmissivity of the central compartment perpendicular to the x axis which facilitates the propagation of drawdown in this direction to the detriment of the y axis consequently drawdown within the aquifer of the central strip aquifer propagates less rapidly reducing the reversal hydraulic gradient between d1 and d and therefore the reversed flow flow along boundary l2 between d and d2 is less complex as it is always positive from d2 to d fig 8b it increases when d is the least transmissive compartment curves d e f and decreases when d is the most transmissive or anisotropic with ty tx compartment curves a b c h or when d2 is the least transmissive curves g and h logically when d2 is the most transmissive compartment flow increases not shown on the figure 5 3 time variation of flux along l1 and l2 figs 9 a and b show the evolution of flow profiles through both boundaries for case h on fig 8 the anisotropic case t y t x 50 0 at time of pumping t 1 7 30 200 500 3 103 3 104 and 108 min up until 30 min the flow at boundary l1 is only from compartment d to d1 as the hydraulic gradient between d1 and d is always positive during this period particularly from about 2 min when drawdown begins to reach l1 to 30 min drawdown does not propagate more rapidly in d1 than in d from t 30 min the flow reversal starts as the drawdown begins to propagate faster in d the location of the point of reversed flow into from d increases slightly with time at t 200 min the reversal point is at about 48 0 m and then converges to about 58 m y 58 0 m at t 108 min along l2 the flow from d2 to d increases with time particularly for the smallest values of y 0 y 150 200 m t 1 7 and 30 min then it flattens for longer time values but total flow increases significantly in fact after 200 min linear to bi linear flow regimes start to occur in d fig 10 c which means that d begins to drain the two surrounding aquifers d2 and d1 the precise assessment of flow along l1 eq 11 figs 7a and 8a is a challenging task it requires separation of the two flow components the one from d to d1 positive flow and the one from d1 to d negative or reversed flow this implies separating the positive and negative values of the calculation of eq 11 the flow at each time t can be calculated by integrating eq 11 along the y axis at the appropriate interval for flow from d to d1 the solution is 13 δ q l 1 t q 2 0 y f δ q l 1 q d y and the one from d1 to d flow reversal is 14 δ q l 1 t q 2 y f δ q l 1 q d y where δ q l 1 q is given by eq 11 and yf is the location of the point of reversed flow into from compartment d onto the y axis however no formal solution of the roots of eq 11 was found and they were evaluated numerically using the newton raphson method for flow along l2 entering compartment d from d2 eq 12 has to be integrated along l2 y which gives 15 δ q l 2 t q 2 0 δ q l 2 q d y where δ q l 2 q is given by eq 12 note that all integrals in eqs 13 to 15 are multiplied by two to account for symmetrical properties of equations about the x axis net flow from domain d is obtained by subtracting eq 13 from both eqs 14 and 15 fig 10a shows the variations of the various flow components over time for the anisotropic example given in fig 9 t y tx 50 0 and for the case where the compartment d is isotropic t y tx 1 0 all other parameters remaining unchanged fig 10b presents the net flow from the strip aquifer d net flow eq 13 eq 14 eq 15 fig 10c shows the corresponding drawdowns and their derivatives at the pumping well flow entering d1 from d or the one entering d from d1 flow reversal increases sharply once drawdown begins to propagate significantly in d 1 or negative slope on derivatives then once the bi linear to linear flow regime is established in d t 100 min fig 10c and drawdown propagates in the right side compartment d2 the flow along l1 increases and then slows down almost stabilizing over long times when the whole system responds to pumping second radial flow regime the contribution of the strip aquifer to compartment d1 varies over time net flow fig 10b according to the various flow components it first increases rapidly due to the contribution of d to d1 positive flow and then once the feature begins to drain the system it decreases as reversed flow and flow from d2 increase logically an increase of the anisotropy ratio in d increases the net contribution of d 6 extension of the proposed theory to a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near an infinite fault we propose drawdown solutions for the case of a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length 2l making an angle α with the x axis fig 1b fig 11 near an infinite vertical discontinuity they are based on the drawdown solutions for the three compartments developed above for the isotropic and anisotropic cases the pumping well is located at the centre of the fracture at a distance a from l1 the fracture fully penetrates the aquifer and should not cross domain d i e lcosα a assuming that the pumping rate q is uniformly distributed along the fracture i e the rate of pumping per unit length of the fracture is q x y q 2 l according to dewandel et al 2018 drawdown solutions can be obtained by integrating the above solutions along the fracture axis solutions for the three domains then take the following general form 16 s f r a c x y t l l s x y t d ϑ where s x y t corresponds to eqs 4 5 or 6 for the isotropic case which combined with eqs 7 8 or 9 gives the solutions for the anisotropic case or t y t x 1 note that for the particular case where the distance of the pumped fracture to l1 is infinite a i e there is only one aquifer system d1 eq 16 corresponds exactly to a known analytical solution gringarten et al 1974 their eq 20 for drawdown in a well pumping a vertical fracture with uniform flux distribution that fully penetrates the aquifer dewandel et al 2018 the integral in eq 16 can be evaluated numerically with the gauss legendre quadrature as done here or evaluated using a discretized form of eq 16 by dividing the fracture into small elements and placing the appropriate line source solution at the centre of each segment dewandel et al 2018 their eq 7 6 1 drawdown and flow behaviours at the pumping well fig 11 presents the result of eq 16 for a pumping well of radius rw intercepting a fracture parallel to domain d i e parallel to the y axis α 90 dimensionless time according to fracture length tdf t 1 t s 1 l 2 and dimensionless drawdown s d f a l t d f 2 π t 1 q s p w f r w t are used for presenting the case where t1 s1 0 1 t s t2 s2 0 5 t y t x 10 0 t t1 100 0 t1 t2 20 0 h 5 m and a l ratios varying from 1 to 10 this setting describes the behaviour of a fracture with increasing distance from boundary l1 at the start of pumping the flow is linear half unit slope of derivative curves and corresponds to flow from aquifer d1 to the fracture intersected by the pumping well for intermediate pumping stages the derivative curves may describe the first infinite acting radial flow when both the boundary l1 has not yet been reached by pumping and the fracture is far enough from l1 a l 4 for this case sdf ln tdf 1 2 or sfrac ln t q 4πt 1 then once the cone of depression begins to reach boundary l1 the derivative slope decreases and may tend to 1 when the half fracture size is close to the distance between the centre of the fracture and l1 a l 3 this shows that d acts temporarily as a steady state source at times tdf 10 0 derivatives follow a near ¼ slope describing the earlier mentioned bi linear flow regime within domain d as for the case of pumping in a well without fracture the derivative slope may also tend to ½ when s s1 ratios are high linear flow regime within d for late pumping stages tdf 2 105 in fig 11 the drawdown has diffused through the whole domain d and propagates significantly into the right side aquifer domain d2 indicating that d drains the whole aquifer system a second radial flow regime is encountered and characterizes the overall response of the aquifer system the derivative always tending to 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 or s f r a c l n t q 2 π t 1 t 2 as in previous solutions see section 3 above 6 2 flow along and through boundaries l1 and l2 as done previously for pumping in a well without fracture flow along and across both boundaries l1 and l2 can also be computed using the same procedure as described before section 5 figs 12 and 13 show examples of flow profiles along l1 and l2 at t 3 104 min and time variations of fluxes along l1 and l2 respectively for pumping in a 20 m long fracture 2l 20 m either parallel α 90 perpendicular α 0 or making a 45 angle with compartment d α 45 in all cases the aquifer properties in all three compartments are identical to case h in fig 8 t1 10 3 m2 s

in a fracture flow profiles along both boundaries l1 and l2 have a similar shape compared to the case of pumping in a well and are logically symmetric to the y axis when the fracture is symmetric to the y axis α 0 and 90 fig 12 compared to pumping in a well flow along boundary l1 fig 12a is higher near the x axis x 0 when the fracture is perpendicular to d α 0 and is logically less important when it is parallel to it α 90 when the fracture makes a secant angle with d α 45 maximum flow shifts to the side where the fracture is closer to boundary l1 here to the right reversed flow from d1 to d is similar in all cases including the pumping well case as the reversal point is far from the fracture at about 50 m concerning flow along boundary l2 fig 12b the same remarks apply except that for the fracture cases flux distribution is characterized by a sharp distribution almost centred along the x axis near x 0 and is locally higher than that for the well case this shows that pumping in a fracture concentrates flow in a larger area and then solicits more compartment d2 near the fracture when pumping a fracture time variations of flow show similar behaviour to that of the pumping well case fig 13a in particular flow reversal is almost identical for all cases the main difference compared to the pumping well case occurs when the fracture makes a secant angle with d α 0 and 45 forcing d but also d2 to react more rapidly even at early stages during the linear flow caused by pumping in the fracture fig 13c however for late pumping stages the flow from d to d1 is less in the cases considering a fracture when compared to the pumping well case this difference stems from the larger pumped area that facilitates the reaction of d1 near the pumped fracture consequently the net flow from compartment d to d1 fig 13b is less important when pumping is done through a fracture 7 conclusion new analytical solutions for drawdown are proposed for a pumping well and for a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length near an infinite vertical fault zone or another vertical geological discontinuity vein dyke strip aquifer with finite width finite storativity and finite and possibly anisotropic hydraulic conductivity consequently the solutions proposed can relate to a relatively large set of hydrogeological situations however the dip of the structure must be close to vertical and long enough with regard to the pumping duration to be considered as infinite for a good use of the solutions see fig 1 the solutions are based on an unconventional application of well image theory without limitation on the diffusivity contrast between the aquifer compartments and considering flow transience within the fault solutions were developed for the drawdown in three aquifer compartments the pumped compartment the one within the fault zone and the compartment on the other side of the fault the solutions are good approximations of the corresponding partial differential equations and comparison with numerical simulations showed high accuracy drawdown and flow regimes in the pumping well were analysed in various configurations and overall are similar to previous studies especially when the fault zone is strongly permeable and anisotropic in the last case and once the cone of depression reaches the fault the slope of the logarithmic derivative of drawdown in the pumping well tends to 1 showing that the fault temporarily acts as a steady state source later when the fault begins to drain the whole aquifer system the derivative follows typical ¼ or ½ slopes depending upon the contrast in aquifer properties that describe bi linear to linear flow regimes within the fault zone for the late stages of pumping the derivative forms a second radial flow regime that depends upon the average transmissivities of the two external aquifer compartments but not on the fault zone the first radial flow is established at an early stage before the cone of depression reaches the fault zone this application of image well theory fits the need for other well functions which should be derivable on x to get mathematical expressions of strength coefficients therefore drawdown solutions were developed for a well intersecting and pumping a vertical fracture of finite length located near the same infinite vertical fault zone in terms of flow regimes behaviour was similar to the pumping well case except for early pumping stages when a first linear flow regime defines the response of the pumped vertical fracture we also believe that other solutions can be derived for a partially penetrating well or a partially penetrating fracture pumped by a well located near a 3 d anisotropic fault using the hantush and hantush leaky well functions hantush 1964 1966 dewandel et al 2014 a 3 d geometry of the pumped fracture could be considered as well an interesting point of the proposed solutions is the possibility to derive transient flow solutions along both sides of the fault zone and thus net transient flow from the fault itself depending on the contrast in aquifer parameters between the three compartments flow reversal between the fault and the pumped aquifer occurs as found in previous work when the fault zone is the most permeable we show that net flow from the fault into the pumped aquifer increases rapidly during the early pumping stage due to contribution of the fault zone and then once the fault begins to drain the system it decreases as reversed flow and flow from the opposite side aquifer increase logically an increasing anisotropy of the fault zone increases the net contribution of the fault when the pumping takes place through a vertical fracture near a fault zone net flow is less important because the fracture increases the reaction of the pumped compartment compared to the fault zone and the opposite side compartment furthermore all results show that the net flow contribution is characterized by strong time variation that stabilizes by long pumping stages this may influence the quality of the pumped water especially when the water quality of the fault zone is different from that where the well is located future work should focus on such flow computations in an experimental site using geochemical data for assessing the origin of water or fluid when pumping a well or one that intersects and pumps a fracture near a vertical geological discontinuity credit authorship contribution statement benoît dewandel conceptualization methodology writing original draft

208,sediment plume development was modelled using an euler lagrangian two way coupled large eddy simulation momentum exchange was calculated based on interaction forces in the maxey riley equation validation showed good agreement with experimental data from literature for analysis of interaction between sediment and fluid 6 859 particles were released into turbulent fluid flow in order to ensure independence of the results from arbitrary turbulent velocity fluctuations in the initial fluid velocity field 41 simulations of the test case starting from different initial flow fields were analysed results of these simulations are normally distributed mean values indicate three phases of the development of the sediment plume i acceleration phase ii transport phase and iii deposition phase significant slow down of fluid flow and particle sorting turned out to be relevant processes in the initial development of the sediment plume which are not accounted for in one way coupled models keywords computational fluid dynamics large eddy simulation lagrangian particle tracking sediment plume river 1 introduction sediment dumping is a frequently applied strategy following dredging operations in rivers hauer et al 2018 however only little is known about the development of a sediment plume after dumping observations in nature show highly dynamic processes in the area where the sediment enters the flow while some sediment particles remain close to the water surface others settle to the bottom of the channel haimann et al 2018 detailed studies of this process in nature are difficult to realize due to the high spatial and temporal variability experiments in the laboratory are limited because of the difficulty of properly scaling sediment particles hauer et al 2018 in addition simultaneous observations of the velocity of water and sediment are difficult to make zhong et al 2014 haimann et al 2018 carried out a detailed study of the development of a sediment plume after dumping of sediment from harbour dredging in danube river their study included on site monitoring during dumping accompanied by a three dimensional sediment transport model they concluded that the behaviour of sediment immediately after it is dumped into the river needs further investigation processes of particle fluid interaction need to be included in respective models based on theoretical considerations as well as physical and numerical models only some of the effects of sediment on turbulent fluid flow have been parametrized several studies show the reduction of the von kármán constant in the logarithmic layer e g nezu and azuma 2004 ferreira 2015 cheng et al 2018b the effect of particles on fluid turbulence have been incorporated into turbulence models hsu and liu 2004 amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 equations for the sediment concentration profile have been developed by rouse 1939 and hunt and inglis 1954 computational fluid dynamics provides an efficient way to obtain spatially and temporally highly resolved information about flow processes during the last decade several studies of sediment transport in fluid flow have been carried out using different numerical modelling approaches they can be divided into euler euler e g hsu and liu 2004 amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 dallali and armenio 2015 cheng et al 2017 2018b euler lagrangian e g squires and eaton 1990 vinkovic et al 2011 sun et al 2017 cheng et al 2018a sun et al 2018 elghannay and tafti 2018 ota et al 2019 and lagrangian lagrangian e g lobovský and křena 2007 crespo et al 2015 canelas et al 2016 2017 pahar and dhar 2017 based on the field theory used for fluid and particles respectively particle fluid interaction is described in detail by the maxey riley equations maxey and riley 1983 the equation describes forces relevant for particle fluid momentum exchange i lift and drag force ii added mass force and iii basset history forces for general flows the basset history term is difficult to implement as it includes the storage of a large number of time steps for this reason it is usually neglected despite prasath et al 2019 showed the importance of the basset integral in the solution models in literature have implemented momentum coupling in different detail the most basic method is the single phase approach in which sediment transport is modelled using an advection diffusion equation one way coupling this has been extended by dallali and armenio 2015 who accounted for the excess density due to sediment concentration through a buoyancy term in the momentum equation their analysis shows that this approach enables more accurate results than the classical single phase approach while still solving the momentum equation for the ambient phase only the complete two phase euler euler equations are among others solved in the model sedfoam developed by cheng et al 2017 added mass force lift force and basset forces were neglected in the model a 3d validation of the model has been carried out by large eddy simulation cheng et al 2018b models using lagrangian particle tracking for the dispersed phase allow studying the trajectory of individual particles turbulent particle dispersion can be accounted for through an eddy interaction model in which random velocities are added to the particle velocities cheng et al 2018a sun et al 2017 extended lagrangian particle tracking to capture rotational in addition to translational motion a set of common grain shapes was represented by bonded spheres particle turbulence interaction in steady state fluid flow has been studied using direct numerical simulations squires and eaton 1990 used a two way coupled euler lagrangian model to study both the effect of particle loading of different grain sizes on the turbulence and vice versa vinkovic et al 2011 one way coupled direct numerical simulation dns of fluid dynamics with lagrangian particle tracking for steady state suspended sediment transport their main focus was on the interaction of wall near turbulence structures and particles in both studies particles were distributed over the entire cross section of the channel thus it is difficult to draw conclusions on the development of a spatially confined sediment plume from their results incorporating the effects of sediment on fluid turbulence in a single phase model hsu and liu 2004 achieved concentration profiles for sheet flow similar to those that could be achieved with a two phase model furthermore also respective results of two phase euler euler models could be improved including the effects of the presence of sediment particles on fluid turbulence amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 despite the improvements of turbulence models particle fluid interactions are still modelled using highly empirical parametrizations and are very sensitive to model coefficients thus it is expected that turbulence resolving modelling approaches are still the best option for detailed studies on sediment transport particle fluid velocity differences were experimentally studied by e g greimann et al 1999 nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 as well as numerically by zhong et al 2014 nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 carried out velocity measurements of particle laden turbulent fluid flow in a laboratory channel amongst others they discussed the velocity difference between particles and fluid as well as turbulence modulation of particles turbulence intensities in the wall near region were enhanced by the presence of particles in the outer flow region no influence of particles on turbulence intensities has been observed by nezu and azuma 2004 this indicates that a detail model for sediment fluid interaction is particularly important in areas of unsteady and non uniform flow while a large number of studies dealing with steady sediment transport exist only a limited number of investigations of the transient transport of an individual sediment plume could be found in literature so far the flow of sediment suspensions has mainly been studied on the basis of time averaged profiles of velocities and concentrations e g zhong et al 2011 2014

hillebrand et al 2017 as well as test cases such as the failure of a column made of glass beads and dambreak cases e g pahar and dhar 2017 did include the unsteady movement of solid particles however the surrounding fluid did not have a superimposed velocity as in dumping situations liu et al 2018 study the saltation process of one individual particle using a les dem model no study investigating the development of a sediment plume in turbulent clear water flow could be found in literature in the present study a large eddy simulation of the development of a sediment plume released into fully developed turbulent fluid flow is investigated the applied numerical model uses euler lagrangian two way coupling for fluid solid momentum exchange and a stress term to account for particle particle interactions the results of the analysis should provide more detailed insights into the processes after dumping of sediment into a river the focus is on the portion of particles which are immediately taken up by the flow and do not settle to the bottom at the dumping site in order to study particle sorting processes different particle sizes are used covering stokes numbers in the range of 0 18 to 19 the model is solved using the open source package openfoam greenshields 2018 verification and validation of the model are carried out using literature data from settling experiments in moving water

relative importance needs more investigation it is generally expected to be low hence those forces have also been ignored in similar models by other authors e g sun et al 2017 cheng et al 2018b a particularly when the relative acceleration between particles and fluid is small it is not expected that the basset history forces play a crucial role small particle sizes involved in the model in this study make the calculation of collision forces of individual particle pairs e g cundall and strack 1979 tsuji et al 1992 impractical thus particle properties are mapped to an eulerian grid to

gaussian distribution 2 2 simulation set up 2 2 1 flow domain and boundary conditions flow depth in the channel is set to δ 0 17 m this is approximately the water depth used in the experiments by worf et al 2019 of which results will be used for validation streamwise and lateral extents of the channel are chosen large enough that all relevant turbulence structures are included l x 2 π δ 1 25 m for channel length and l z π δ 0 55 m for channel width are commonly accepted for smooth bed flows bomminayuni and stoesser 2011 see fig 1 for a longitudinal section cyclic boundary conditions are applied to inlet and outlet as well as to the lateral walls a no slip boundary condition is applied for the bottom wall and symmetry for the free surface turbulent fluid flow is initially generated in a single phase simulation starting from an initial flow field with a bulk velocity of u 0 5 m s 1 and random velocity fluctuations the flow is recycled through the domain for 120 flow through times 300s a constant bulk velocity is maintained through a momentum source implemented by adopting the pressure gradient this simulation for creating the initial turbulent flow field is referred to as precursor simulation flow fields from the precursor simulation results are stored from t 300 s onwards in regular intervals of 0 04 flow through times to be used as initial conditions for the test case in addition those results are used for comparison with flow fields of the sediment plume fluid properties are those of water with a kinematic viscosity of ν 1 17 10 6 m 2 s 1 and density ρ 1000 kg m 3

range of 0 07mm to 0 71mm see fig 2 this corresponds to a non dimensional grain size of d 1 13 and d 11 4 respectively where d is defined by e g nezu and azuma 2004 and dallali and armenio 2015 by the

for the particle diameters used in the model in this study the particle stokes number ranges from 0 183 to 18 8 2 2 2 sediment plume verification and validation of the model has been carried out reproducing the experiments by worf et al 2019 three measuring spoons 3 0 24 ml of sediment of different grain fractions were introduced into turbulent channel flow through a pipe over a time of approximately 1s sediment density was 2650kgm 3 and the shape factor 0 45 fall velocities were obtained from the experiments by worf et al 2019 based on the slope of the regression line through the x y positions of the particles multiplied with the fluid velocity x is the flow direction of the fluid acceleration due to gravity is acting in negative y direction the setup of the test case for studying the development of the sediment plume is similar to the validation case described above the main difference is that particles are not continuously released over a certain period of time 6859 particles are placed in a l 0 2 cm edge length grid 19 19 19 in the upper area of the channel close to the inlet see fig 1 this corresponds to an initial volumetric particle concentration of approximately 4 4 particle properties are the same as in the validation cases 2 3 discretization and numerical solution the governing equations described in section 2 1 are discretized in space on a structured mesh with about 5 5million cells 350 106 150 this corresponds to a dimensionless cell size of δ x δ x u ν 60 and δ z δ z u ν 60 in streamwise and lateral direction respectively the mesh is

the influence of instantaneous turbulent velocity fluctuations a total of 41 simulations using the same simulation set up and boundary conditions are carried out each of these simulations is started from a new initial flow field retrieved from the precursor simulation see above the results used as initial conditions for the test case cover a period of 16 flow through times after verifying normal distribution of the results of the 41 simulations further evaluation is done based on mean values precursor simulation results are also used for the comparison of the flow field of clear water flow with the flow field around the sediment plume at corresponding time steps this allows to directly observe the influence of the particles in each individual cell of the flow field influence of sediment on fluid flow is analysed based on differences between instantaneous fluid velocities in cells with particles present and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells from the precursor simulation a one sample student t test is used to test significance of the velocity difference averaged over all particles for each time step development of the shape of the sediment plume is analysed on the basis of the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the sediment particles for each time step preliminary tests showed that the shape of the sediment plume is quite sensitive to individual particles with 2 5 or more of the particles on the extreme ends of the sediment plume excluded from this evaluation the qualitative results remain constant hence in order for this analysis to be less sensitive to individual particles separated from the core of the plume 2 5 of the particles on the extreme ends in each direction are not included in this analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and validation 3 1 1 turbulent fluid flow validation of turbulent fluid flow is carried out based on spatial and temporal averages of velocity fluctuations fig 3 and velocities fig 4 time averages are calculated from 14 200 instantaneous velocity samples which were collected from a x normal sampling plane at x 1 0 m in regular intervals over a period of 56 8 flow through times time averages are denoted by and spatial averages by fig 3a displays root mean squared turbulent velocity fluctuations normalized by the shear velocity u these turbulence intensities normalized by the shear velocity are slightly over predicted by the model with respect to the experimental data by nezu and rodi 1986 particularly in the lower half of the channel the reason for this is expected to be the relatively low shear velocity in the model see below fig 3b displays spatial and temporal averages of reynolds shear stress normalized by the square of the shear velocity u x u y u reynolds shear stress is 0 at the bottom wall and steeply increases in the viscous sublayer and the buffer layer above the peak reynolds shear stress decreases linearly to 0 at the free surface which is consistent with theory pope 2000 dey 2014 a comparison of the reynolds stress profile with experimental data from literature nezu and rodi 1986 shows good agreement the extrapolation of the linear part of the reynolds shear stress profile to the channel bed yields a wall shear stress of τ w ρ 3 5476 10 4 m 2 s 2 thus the shear velocity is u τ w ρ 0 018 835 m s 1 and the shear reynolds number r e 2737 spatial and temporal averages of non dimensional streamwise fluid velocities u are plotted against channel height in fig 4a velocity is zero at the bottom wall and increases in wall normal direction following a logarithmic curve fig 4b displays the normalized velocity profile u together with a theoretical curve based on the velocity defect law guo 2017 22 u max u 1 κ ln 1 2 b 0 η

determined from the simulation results in fig 4a despite the velocity profile in fig 4 being consistent with the velocity defect law 22 streamwise velocities are slightly higher than respective experimental results by nezu and rodi 1986 at the same time velocities are relatively low in the near wall region the reason for this is the relatively coarse mesh with a non dimensional cell height of the bottom boundary cell of δ y δ y u ν 1 6 despite the wall adjacent cell centre being at y 1 which is the generally accepted value e g davidson 2009 there are only three cells resolving the laminar sublayer y 5 it is not expected though that this has considerable effect on the particle sediment interaction for this reason the flow field is considered accurate enough to be used as initial condition for the test case on sediment transport in order to account for the non resolved flow scales non dimensional wall units y y u ν eff in fig 4b are calculated based on the effective viscosity of ν eff 2 10 6 m 2 s 1 fig 5 displays two point correlations eq 21 in streamwise and lateral direction normalized by the temporal average of the squared velocity fluctuations in streamwise direction there are 29 cells with two point correlation of streamwise velocity greater than 0 3 and 10 cells with two point correlation for lateral velocity greater than 0 3 respectively in lateral direction there are 10 cells with two point correlation greater than 0 3 for the streamwise and the lateral velocity component this number of cells are considered enough to resolve large eddies but far from well resolved les davidson 2009 similarly to the velocity profile above the fulfilment of this requirement is considered appropriate for the purpose of this study 3 1 2 sediment transport fall velocities v s of the sediment plume in turbulent fluid flow at a bulk velocity of 0 5ms 1 are plotted against the particle diameter in fig 6 for particle sizes larger than 0 25mm the fall velocity in the results of the numerical model lies within the range of fall velocities measured by worf et al 2019 in the laboratory however the fall velocity of the fraction 0 18 mm d 0 25 mm is overestimated in the numerical model with respect to the measurements from the physical model worf et al 2019 observed that some particles hardly settled at all and remained in the upper part of the channel during their experiments they suggested that these particles have a very low shape factor flat plates and thus a low fall velocity however a constant shape factor is used in the numerical simulations as a result the very low fall velocities of flat plates are not reproduced in the numerical model it is assumed that the lack of particles with very low shape factors in the numerical model causes the overestimation of the fall velocity of the fraction 0 18 mm d 0 25 mm in order to compensate for this and also include particles with stokes numbers 1 in the model the range of particle sizes is extended by another fraction 0 07 mm d 0 18 mm fig 7 displays the particles at different timesteps after their release from the start of the channel in one exemplary simulation of the test case the sediment plume is transported by the fluid in direction of the fluid velocity this motion is superimposed by a gravity current as a result of the higher density of the sediment suspension compared to the surrounding clear water in addition particles settle in negative y direction as a result of diffusion turbulent dispersion and varying particle diameters the shape of the sediment plume gets distorted from its original shape 3 2 time dependent variability of the results fig 8 displays the distribution of the differences δ u of fluid velocities in cells with particles present and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells for all 41 simulations the velocity differences are averaged over all cells with particles present see also section 2 4 and normalized by the bulk flow velocity u the one sample student t test shows that streamwise fluid velocities in the sediment plume are significantly different from the respective velocity component in clear water flow over the first 0 9s of the development of the sediment plume for the vertical velocity component this difference is significant for the entire development of the sediment plume p 0 05 the implications of these observations on the importance of two way coupling will be discussed in section 3 5 below development of the shape of the sediment plume is analysed on the basis of the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the sediment particles see section 2 4 the development of the streamwise and vertical edge length of this bounding box normalized by the initial edge length l 0 is displayed in fig 9 in contrast to velocity differences the variation of edge length of the bounding box around the sediment plume from the 41 simulations increases with time fig 9 several outliers are visible in fig 9a for t 1 7 s in these runs a number of particles have reached the bottom of the channel from where they are not transported any further as other particles are still in suspension and transported by the flow the particle distribution in streamwise direction increases at a high rate with the exception of the streamwise plume extents for t 1 7 s velocity differences and plume extents in figs 8 and 9 show a normal distribution this indicates that further discussion based on means over all 41 runs of the test case is justified 3 3 fluid and particle velocities fig 10 displays the streamwise component of the particle velocities v x plotted against instantaneous fluid velocities u x in the respective cells the points are coloured by the diameter of the particle they represent black polygons show the range of particle velocities plotted against time averaged fluid velocities in the respective cells from the precursor simulation single phase an equivalent analysis for the vertical velocity components v y and u y is shown in fig 11 the average overall magnitude of instantaneous fluid and particle velocities is almost equal only at t 0 5 s and t 1 0 s large particles have a slightly higher velocity than their surrounding fluid the differences between particle and fluid velocities are decreasing with the development of the plume for the earlier time steps t 1 0 s displayed in fig 10 the distribution of instantaneous fluid velocities is tilted towards the lower velocities compared to clear water velocities with advancing time and evolution of the sediment plume the range of fluid velocities in the sediment plume approaches the respective range of clear water flow from the precursor simulation in contrast to the lower end of the fluid velocity distribution maximum values for fluid velocities in the area of the sediment plume are hardly affected by the presence of sediment at t 0 1 s and t 0 5 s velocity differences between large particles and their surrounding fluid in fig 10 are higher than those between smaller particles and fluid this shows the lower response time τ p of particles with lower stokes numbers in contrast to the streamwise velocity components a clear offset between fluid and particle velocities in direction of gravity u y is visible at all time steps displayed in fig 11 negative y particle velocity components v y are higher than the respective fluid velocity components the reason for this is particle settling as large particles have higher fall velocities than small particles particle sorting with respect to grain size is visible at all time steps in fig 11 typical single phase models of sediment transport account for the vertical velocity difference between sediment and fluid by adding the terminal fall velocity to the particle velocity however a comparison of the median value of the particle fluid vertical velocity differences in the model and the terminal velocity of the particles according to the formula by haider and levenspiel 1989 shows that the particle fluid velocity difference 0 030ms 1 is slightly lower than the theoretical terminal velocity 0 039ms 1 of the particles this is consistent with studies of fall velocities in turbulent fluid flow in literature e g worf et al 2019 similarly to streamwise fluid velocities the range of vertical fluid velocities is also extended towards negative y by the particles the reason for this is the higher density of the water sediment suspension this phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in the following sections for t 0 5 s after the release of the sediment plume higher negative y fluid velocity components are related to the presence of smaller particle diameters this can be explained by the lower fall velocities of fine grains due to their lower fall velocity a larger part of their potential energy is available for the formation of the gravity current driven by the density difference between the sediment plume and the surrounding clear water gladstone et al 1998 this effect is less clearly visible at t 0 1 s the reason is that larger particles have not yet separated from the smaller particles due to their higher fall velocity thus there are no areas in the sediment plume where certain particle sizes are dominating this process driven by initial particle sorting also results in a more narrow range of vertical particle velocities at later time steps t 1 s on the one hand small particle fractions have a lower terminal velocity but at the same time form a stronger gravity current in negative y direction on the other hand large particles have a higher fall velocity while a lower amount of their potential energy is available for acceleration of the gravity current in addition to buoyancy settling particles may accelerate their surrounding fluid in the direction of gravity via drag force while gravity currents have already been investigated in several studies in literature e g dallali and armenio 2015 this process is expected to play a less important role this assumption is supported by the above described observation that fluid surrounding large particles with high fall velocities is less influenced by the presence of particles than fluid surrounding fine particles thus while the effect of buoyancy appears to be crucial for an accurate model of sediment transport vertical momentum transfer through drag is not expected to play a major role 3 4 particle influence on fluid flow quadrant analysis is an efficient means of obtaining a quantitative measure for the influence of the sediment on the turbulent fluid flow vinkovic et al 2011 instantaneous fluid velocities in cells with particles present are compared to time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells these u x u y fluid velocity fluctuations are displayed in fig 12 the colour of the points shows the volumetric sediment concentration θ in the respective cell fig 12 shows that fluid velocities are tilted towards the third quadrant lower streamwise velocity and higher negative vertical velocity particularly in the earlier two time steps displayed this again shows the slowdown of the fluid by the inertia of the sediment see also fig 10 and the vertical acceleration due to the higher density of the water sediment suspension see also fig 11 maximum positive fluid velocity fluctuations in the sediment plume are similar to those of clear water flow as the sediment plume evolves particles and fluid accelerate in streamwise direction approximately 1s after the particles have been placed into the fluid streamwise velocity fluctuations are approximately within the same range as they are in clear water flow this is consistent with observations by nezu and azuma 2004 who observed no influence of particles on the fluid turbulence modulation in the outer region the offset of fluid velocity in vertical direction remains throughout the simulation but decreases with decreasing sediment concentration at the first time step displayed fluid velocities in cells with the highest particle concentration deviate most from time averaged fluid velocities this shows that the major part of the sediment plume has not yet accelerated with the flow only some individual particles have been separated from the plume and transported to higher velocity flow areas at t 0 5 s streamwise fluid velocities in high concentration cells are closer to the time averaged clear water velocity than in cells with lower concentration 3 5 development of the sediment plume fig 13 displays the temporal development of velocity differences δ u between fluid influenced by the particles and time averaged clear water flow top the development of the size of the sediment plume is displayed in the bottom panel the values displayed in fig 13 are means of the distributions visualized as boxplots in figs 8 and 9 respectively the figure is used to analyse the temporal development of the processes identified in the sections above in addition their influence on sediment dispersion is discussed based on the extents of the sediment plume temporal development of fluid velocity differences and the extents of the sediment plume in fig 13 indicates the existence of three phases during the development of the sediment plume acceleration phase initially the streamwise velocity in the sediment plume is significantly lower than in clear water flow see also section 3 2 at the same time the negative y component continuously increases during this initial phase the sediment plume grows in streamwise and vertical direction while its width in lateral direction is remaining constant during the first 0 2s after particles were added to the flow transport phase after approximately 0 4s the sediment plume has accelerated to a streamwise velocity which is within the range of turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations of clear water flow the rate of acceleration continuously decreases at the same time the negative y component of the fluid velocity has reached a maximum and starts to decrease while the rate of extension of the sediment plume is decaying in y direction the plume in this phase increasingly grows in lateral direction over a large part of the transport phase the lateral extension of the sediment plume even exceeds the vertical extension deposition phase approximately 1 6s after the sediment has been placed into the channel the mean of the instantaneous fluid velocity from all 41 simulations of the sediment plume reaches the time averaged velocity of the clear water flow sediment dispersion is increasing in x direction vertical extent of the sediment plume exceeds the lateral one as particles are placed into the channel at an initial velocity of zero sediment acts as an obstacle for fluid flow the resulting decrease of streamwise fluid velocity has already been observed in figs 10 and 12 for t 0 1 s and t 0 5 s fig 13 now shows that it takes approximately 0 5s for the sediment plume to be accelerated by the surrounding water through drag forces at the end of the acceleration phase streamwise acceleration of the sediment plume decreases in the transport phase a significant lag between streamwise velocities in the sediment plume and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water remains see also fig 8 this is consistent with the observations of nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 the high difference between streamwise velocities of clear water flow and fluid velocities in the sediment plume figs 10 12 and 13 shows the importance of two way coupling particularly in the acceleration phase alternatively a time dependent velocity correction could be applied in one way coupled models for this initial phase of sediment transport with such a correction accounting for the lower fluid velocities in the initial phase of the development of the sediment plume it is expected that particle trajectories can also be captured with reasonable accuracy e g using an eddy interaction model cheng et al 2018a the acceleration in negative y direction in the acceleration phase is a result of the surplus density of the water sediment suspension in the area of the sediment plume compared to the surrounding clear water heavier water sediment suspension falls below the lighter clear water the process has already been observed in figs 11 and 12 at four particular time steps fig 13 shows that at the transition from the acceleration phase to the transport phase this gravity current reaches its maximum velocity in the transport phase the gravity current is decaying due to ongoing dispersion and thus reduction of sediment concentration at its peak the average buoyancy induced vertical velocity differences between sediment plume and clear water flow reach a magnitude of almost 10 of the bulk velocity hence this process should be included in models for the development of a sediment plume the influence of the buoyancy can be implemented relatively easy by a source term in the fluid momentum equation without the need for a complete two way coupled model necker et al 2002 an et al 2012 dallali and armenio 2015 dallali and armenio 2015 particularly showed the effect of buoyancy on steady sediment transport in turbulent fluid flow using this method in the transport phase a one way coupling approach for sediment transport modelling can be sufficient for achieving acceptable modelling results in such a case effects of sediment on the fluid which have already been parametrized should still be accounted for these include the reduction of the von kármán constant nezu and azuma 2004 ferreira 2015 cheng et al 2018b effects of sediment particles on fluid turbulence hsu and liu 2004 and turbulent dispersion e g using an eddy interaction model cheng et al 2018a in the deposition phase the concentration in the sediment plume has reduced to the point that drag forces only have a minor effect on the fluid flow thus mean streamwise and lateral velocities in the sediment approach the time averaged respective fluid velocity of clear water flow for the vertical velocity component an offset remains resulting from buoyancy temporal development of the dimensions of the bounding box encircling the sediment plume in fig 13b also shows the three phases analysed above for fluid velocity while hardly any dispersion takes place in lateral direction particularly in the beginning of the acceleration phase the sediment plume grows in streamwise and vertical direction at a relatively high rate the streamwise velocity difference between clear water flow and the sediment plume in the acceleration phase provides an explanation for the low initial dispersion in lateral direction sediment leaving the core of the plume in lateral direction is immediately taken up by the flow inhibiting further movement normal to the flow this results in an increased dispersion in streamwise direction and at the same time reduced dispersion in lateral direction none of these processes are accounted for in one way coupled models and even many two way coupled euler euler models the relatively high dispersion of sediment in the acceleration phase in vertical direction particularly compared to lateral dispersion is a result of the high range of particle sizes included in the model fig 11 the difference in fall velocities causes the continuous extension in direction of gravity in the transport phase the sediment plume has accelerated in streamwise and vertical direction but at the same time still is compact so that the flow is highly stratified in the area of the sediment plume according to literature stratification inhibits vertical dispersion dallali and armenio 2015 the flattening of the growth rate of the sediment plume in the transport phase is consistent with this in addition further vertical separation of small and large particles is inhibited by small particles inducing higher vertical fluid velocities than large particles this compensates for lower fall velocities of small particles this process already described above and visible in fig 11 additionally causes lower vertical dispersion in the transport phase compared to the acceleration phase as the major part of the sediment plume has accelerated with the bulk of the flow the velocity difference between sediment plume and surrounding water is lower hence lateral dispersion increases in the transport phase at t 1 s after the release of the sediment the streamwise extent amounts to 2 5 l 0 the vertical extent to 1 9 l 0 and the lateral extent to 2 1 l 0 respectively when the sediment plume approaches the bottom wall of the channel the vertical velocity gradient increases fig 10 shows the high range of velocities in cells with particles present at the beginning of the deposition phase t 1 6 s particularly larger particles have already fallen to an area of the flow field where streamwise velocities are substantially lower due to wall friction the high velocity difference between different areas of the sediment plume causes a distortion of the sediment plume in streamwise direction and hence an increasing streamwise extent in addition turbulent velocity fluctuations are higher close to the bottom wall this enhances sediment dispersion also in vertical direction which exceeds lateral dispersion in the deposition phase this is consistent with findings of vinkovic et al 2011 4 conclusions average values of the simulation results show that the development of the sediment plume is dependent on the time passed since the particles have been released in addition the position of the sediment within the channel cross section influences the sediment transport processes three phases of the development of the sediment plume are identified i acceleration phase ii transport phase and iii deposition phase transport processes of the sediment plume can be related to these three phases particularly in the acceleration phase fluid velocities are decreased by the inertia of the sediment in addition the surplus density of the sediment suspension compared to the surrounding clear fluid induces a gravity current resulting in a shift of fluid velocities in direction of gravity the development of the sediment plume is driven by high temporal and spatial velocity gradients in the transport phase initial acceleration of the sediment plume is completed streamwise velocity components of the sediment plume remain slightly lower than the respective component in clear water flow but the difference is not statistically significant any more as the plume evolves turbulent dispersion and thus continuous reduction of sediment concentration are the main processes driving the development of the sediment plume from the results of the simulations in this study it is expected that the development of the sediment plume in this phase can be modelled with sufficient accuracy using a less detailed approach for particle fluid interaction as long as the effect of buoyancy is considered the final deposition phase is characterized by a higher vertical velocity gradient close to the bottom boundary this causes a distortion of the sediment plume in streamwise direction due to faster movement of particles in the upper area of the plume compared to particles close to the channel bed the simulation results of this study show the following processes related to the development of the sediment plume which are not captured by one way coupled models significant slow down of streamwise fluid velocity in the acceleration phase as a result of the inertia of the sediment additional streamwise dispersion in the acceleration phase due to increased variability of fluid velocities in the sediment plume reduced streamwise velocity in the transport phase depending on particle concentration reduced vertical dispersion in the transport phase due to stratification as well as particle sorting vertical acceleration of the fluid due to buoyancy already implemented in many models through a source term in the fluid momentum equation for both fluid velocities as well as the development of the sediment plume the acceleration phase turned out to be the phase of the sediment transport with the highest dynamics many processes in this phase are not accounted for in numerical models of sediment transport this explains challenges in modelling the development of a sediment plume our findings related to the development of the sediment plume in the acceleration phase can be used to improve results of models using a less detailed approach for particle fluid interaction for example a sediment plume can be initialized at a position and shape which is expected to occur after the acceleration phase e g using 2 5 l 0 for the streamwise extent 1 9 l 0 for the vertical extent and 2 1 l 0 for the lateral extent 1s after the sediment was added to the flow see fig 13 this way modelling the acceleration phase using a possibly unsuitable approach is avoided this would allow to model particle fluid interaction and turbulence in lower detail in the transport phase thus a larger spatial and temporal extent can be covered by the model for instance to optimize sediment dumping throughout an entire river section credit authorship contribution statement daniel wildt

208,sediment plume development was modelled using an euler lagrangian two way coupled large eddy simulation momentum exchange was calculated based on interaction forces in the maxey riley equation validation showed good agreement with experimental data from literature for analysis of interaction between sediment and fluid 6 859 particles were released into turbulent fluid flow in order to ensure independence of the results from arbitrary turbulent velocity fluctuations in the initial fluid velocity field 41 simulations of the test case starting from different initial flow fields were analysed results of these simulations are normally distributed mean values indicate three phases of the development of the sediment plume i acceleration phase ii transport phase and iii deposition phase significant slow down of fluid flow and particle sorting turned out to be relevant processes in the initial development of the sediment plume which are not accounted for in one way coupled models keywords computational fluid dynamics large eddy simulation lagrangian particle tracking sediment plume river 1 introduction sediment dumping is a frequently applied strategy following dredging operations in rivers hauer et al 2018 however only little is known about the development of a sediment plume after dumping observations in nature show highly dynamic processes in the area where the sediment enters the flow while some sediment particles remain close to the water surface others settle to the bottom of the channel haimann et al 2018 detailed studies of this process in nature are difficult to realize due to the high spatial and temporal variability experiments in the laboratory are limited because of the difficulty of properly scaling sediment particles hauer et al 2018 in addition simultaneous observations of the velocity of water and sediment are difficult to make zhong et al 2014 haimann et al 2018 carried out a detailed study of the development of a sediment plume after dumping of sediment from harbour dredging in danube river their study included on site monitoring during dumping accompanied by a three dimensional sediment transport model they concluded that the behaviour of sediment immediately after it is dumped into the river needs further investigation processes of particle fluid interaction need to be included in respective models based on theoretical considerations as well as physical and numerical models only some of the effects of sediment on turbulent fluid flow have been parametrized several studies show the reduction of the von kármán constant in the logarithmic layer e g nezu and azuma 2004 ferreira 2015 cheng et al 2018b the effect of particles on fluid turbulence have been incorporated into turbulence models hsu and liu 2004 amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 equations for the sediment concentration profile have been developed by rouse 1939 and hunt and inglis 1954 computational fluid dynamics provides an efficient way to obtain spatially and temporally highly resolved information about flow processes during the last decade several studies of sediment transport in fluid flow have been carried out using different numerical modelling approaches they can be divided into euler euler e g hsu and liu 2004 amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 dallali and armenio 2015 cheng et al 2017 2018b euler lagrangian e g squires and eaton 1990 vinkovic et al 2011 sun et al 2017 cheng et al 2018a sun et al 2018 elghannay and tafti 2018 ota et al 2019 and lagrangian lagrangian e g lobovský and křena 2007 crespo et al 2015 canelas et al 2016 2017 pahar and dhar 2017 based on the field theory used for fluid and particles respectively particle fluid interaction is described in detail by the maxey riley equations maxey and riley 1983 the equation describes forces relevant for particle fluid momentum exchange i lift and drag force ii added mass force and iii basset history forces for general flows the basset history term is difficult to implement as it includes the storage of a large number of time steps for this reason it is usually neglected despite prasath et al 2019 showed the importance of the basset integral in the solution models in literature have implemented momentum coupling in different detail the most basic method is the single phase approach in which sediment transport is modelled using an advection diffusion equation one way coupling this has been extended by dallali and armenio 2015 who accounted for the excess density due to sediment concentration through a buoyancy term in the momentum equation their analysis shows that this approach enables more accurate results than the classical single phase approach while still solving the momentum equation for the ambient phase only the complete two phase euler euler equations are among others solved in the model sedfoam developed by cheng et al 2017 added mass force lift force and basset forces were neglected in the model a 3d validation of the model has been carried out by large eddy simulation cheng et al 2018b models using lagrangian particle tracking for the dispersed phase allow studying the trajectory of individual particles turbulent particle dispersion can be accounted for through an eddy interaction model in which random velocities are added to the particle velocities cheng et al 2018a sun et al 2017 extended lagrangian particle tracking to capture rotational in addition to translational motion a set of common grain shapes was represented by bonded spheres particle turbulence interaction in steady state fluid flow has been studied using direct numerical simulations squires and eaton 1990 used a two way coupled euler lagrangian model to study both the effect of particle loading of different grain sizes on the turbulence and vice versa vinkovic et al 2011 one way coupled direct numerical simulation dns of fluid dynamics with lagrangian particle tracking for steady state suspended sediment transport their main focus was on the interaction of wall near turbulence structures and particles in both studies particles were distributed over the entire cross section of the channel thus it is difficult to draw conclusions on the development of a spatially confined sediment plume from their results incorporating the effects of sediment on fluid turbulence in a single phase model hsu and liu 2004 achieved concentration profiles for sheet flow similar to those that could be achieved with a two phase model furthermore also respective results of two phase euler euler models could be improved including the effects of the presence of sediment particles on fluid turbulence amoudry 2014 kranenburg et al 2014 despite the improvements of turbulence models particle fluid interactions are still modelled using highly empirical parametrizations and are very sensitive to model coefficients thus it is expected that turbulence resolving modelling approaches are still the best option for detailed studies on sediment transport particle fluid velocity differences were experimentally studied by e g greimann et al 1999 nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 as well as numerically by zhong et al 2014 nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 carried out velocity measurements of particle laden turbulent fluid flow in a laboratory channel amongst others they discussed the velocity difference between particles and fluid as well as turbulence modulation of particles turbulence intensities in the wall near region were enhanced by the presence of particles in the outer flow region no influence of particles on turbulence intensities has been observed by nezu and azuma 2004 this indicates that a detail model for sediment fluid interaction is particularly important in areas of unsteady and non uniform flow while a large number of studies dealing with steady sediment transport exist only a limited number of investigations of the transient transport of an individual sediment plume could be found in literature so far the flow of sediment suspensions has mainly been studied on the basis of time averaged profiles of velocities and concentrations e g zhong et al 2011 2014 cheng et al 2018b a thus the respective evaluations are limited to such conditions gravity currents e g de cesare et al 2001 necker et al 2002 lavelli et al 2002 la rocca et al 2008 an et al 2012 hillebrand et al 2017 as well as test cases such as the failure of a column made of glass beads and dambreak cases e g pahar and dhar 2017 did include the unsteady movement of solid particles however the surrounding fluid did not have a superimposed velocity as in dumping situations liu et al 2018 study the saltation process of one individual particle using a les dem model no study investigating the development of a sediment plume in turbulent clear water flow could be found in literature in the present study a large eddy simulation of the development of a sediment plume released into fully developed turbulent fluid flow is investigated the applied numerical model uses euler lagrangian two way coupling for fluid solid momentum exchange and a stress term to account for particle particle interactions the results of the analysis should provide more detailed insights into the processes after dumping of sediment into a river the focus is on the portion of particles which are immediately taken up by the flow and do not settle to the bottom at the dumping site in order to study particle sorting processes different particle sizes are used covering stokes numbers in the range of 0 18 to

particularly when the relative acceleration between particles and fluid is small it is not expected that the basset history forces play a crucial role small particle sizes involved in the model in this study make the calculation of collision forces of individual particle pairs e g cundall and strack 1979 tsuji et al 1992 impractical thus particle properties are mapped to an eulerian grid to

off centre particle collisions bring about isotropic particle distributions o rourke and snider 2012 this is accounted for in the model by adding the return to isotropy source term f t coll developed by o rourke and snider 2012 to eq 7 this term causes the particles to scatter due to collisions away from the direction of their original velocities and drives their velocities towards an isotropic gaussian distribution 2 2 simulation set up 2 2 1 flow domain and boundary conditions flow depth in the channel is set to δ 0 17 m this is approximately the water depth used in the experiments by worf et al 2019 of which results will be used for validation streamwise and lateral extents of the channel are chosen large enough that all relevant turbulence structures are included l x 2 π δ 1 25 m for channel length and l z π δ 0 55 m for channel width are commonly accepted for smooth bed flows bomminayuni and stoesser 2011 see fig 1 for a longitudinal section cyclic boundary conditions are applied to inlet and outlet as well as to the lateral walls a no slip boundary condition is applied for the bottom wall and symmetry for the free surface turbulent fluid flow is initially generated in a single phase simulation starting from an initial flow field with a bulk velocity of u 0 5 m s 1 and random velocity fluctuations the flow is recycled through the domain for 120 flow through times 300s a constant bulk velocity is maintained through a momentum source implemented by adopting the pressure gradient this simulation for creating the initial turbulent flow field is referred to as precursor simulation flow fields from the precursor simulation results are stored from t 300 s onwards in regular intervals of 0 04 flow through times to be used as initial conditions for the test case in addition those results are used for comparison with flow fields of the sediment plume fluid properties are those of water with a kinematic viscosity of ν 1 17 10 6 m 2 s 1 and density ρ 1000 kg m 3 based on a bulk fluid velocity of 0 5ms 1 and a channel height of 0 17m the reynolds number of the flow is r e 72 650 simulations are carried out with particles sizes uniformly distributed in the range of 0 07mm to 0 71mm see fig 2 this corresponds to a non dimensional grain size of d 1 13 and d 11 4 respectively where d is defined by e g nezu and azuma 2004 and dallali and armenio 2015 by the following equation 18 d u d ν shear velocity u is calculated from the wall shear stress which is determined by extrapolating the linear part of the reynolds shear stress profile see section 3 1 1 the

for the particle diameters used in the model in this study the particle stokes number ranges from 0 183 to 18 8 2 2 2 sediment plume verification and validation of the model has been carried out reproducing the experiments by worf et al 2019 three measuring spoons 3 0 24 ml of sediment of different grain fractions were introduced into turbulent channel flow through a pipe over a time of approximately 1s sediment density was 2650kgm 3 and the shape factor 0 45 fall velocities were obtained from the experiments by worf et al 2019 based on the slope of the regression line through the x y positions of the particles multiplied with the fluid velocity x is the flow direction of the fluid acceleration due to gravity is acting in negative y direction the setup of the test case for studying the development of the sediment plume is similar to the validation case described above the main difference is that particles are not continuously released over a certain period of time 6859 particles are placed in a l 0 2 cm edge length grid 19 19 19 in the upper area of the channel close to the inlet see fig 1 this corresponds to an initial volumetric particle concentration of approximately 4 4 particle properties are the same as in the validation cases 2 3 discretization and numerical solution the governing equations described in section 2 1 are discretized in space on a structured mesh with about 5 5million cells 350 106 150 this corresponds to a dimensionless cell size of δ x δ x u ν 60 and δ z δ z u ν 60 in streamwise and lateral direction respectively the mesh is refined towards the bottom wall no slip boundary condition so that the boundary cell height is approximately δ y δ y u ν 1 6 wall adjacent cell centres are at y 0 78 on average pressure coupling is accomplished by the piso algorithm pressure implicit split operator grid resolution in streamwise and lateral direction is evaluated based on two point correlations of turbulent velocity fluctuations

pisofoam is used for the model of fluid flow for initializing the flow field an adopted version of mppicfoam neglecting hydrostatic pressure for the eulerian phase is used for the two way coupled euler lagrange model of fluid and particles a second order implicit scheme is used for time discretization the time step is 0 5ms which corresponds to a maximum courant number of approximately 0 27 advection of velocity is discretized using standard gaussian finite volume integration with second order central differences interpolation greenshields 2018 2 4 result evaluation in order to analyse the influence of instantaneous turbulent velocity fluctuations a total of 41 simulations using the same simulation set up and boundary conditions are carried out each of these simulations is started from a new initial flow field retrieved from the precursor simulation see above the results used as initial conditions for the test case cover a period of 16 flow through times after verifying normal distribution of the results of the 41 simulations further evaluation is done based on mean values precursor simulation results are also used for the comparison of the flow field of clear water flow with the flow field around the sediment plume at corresponding time steps this allows to directly observe the influence of the particles in each individual cell of the flow field influence of sediment on fluid flow is analysed based on differences between instantaneous fluid velocities in cells with particles present and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells from the precursor simulation a one sample student t test is used to test significance of the velocity difference averaged over all particles for each time step development of the shape of the sediment plume is analysed on the basis of the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the sediment particles for each time step preliminary tests showed that the shape of the sediment plume is quite sensitive to individual particles with 2 5 or more of the particles on the extreme ends of the sediment plume excluded from this evaluation the qualitative results remain constant hence in order for this analysis to be less sensitive to individual particles separated from the core of the plume 2 5 of the particles on the extreme ends in each direction are not included in this analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification and validation 3 1 1 turbulent fluid flow validation of turbulent fluid flow is carried out based on spatial and temporal averages of velocity fluctuations fig 3 and velocities fig 4 time averages are calculated from 14 200 instantaneous velocity samples which were collected from a x normal sampling plane at x 1 0 m in regular intervals over a period of 56 8 flow through times time averages are denoted by and spatial averages by fig 3a displays root mean squared turbulent velocity fluctuations normalized by the shear velocity u these turbulence intensities normalized by the shear velocity are slightly over predicted by the model with respect to the experimental data by nezu and rodi 1986 particularly in the lower half of the channel the reason for this is expected to be the relatively low shear velocity in the model see below fig 3b displays spatial and temporal averages of reynolds shear stress normalized by the square of the shear velocity u x u y u reynolds shear stress is 0 at the bottom wall and steeply increases in the viscous sublayer and the buffer layer above the peak reynolds shear stress decreases linearly to 0 at the free surface which is consistent with theory pope 2000 dey 2014 a comparison of the reynolds stress profile with experimental data from literature nezu and rodi 1986 shows good agreement the extrapolation of the linear part of the reynolds shear stress profile to the channel bed yields a wall shear stress of τ w ρ 3 5476 10 4 m 2 s 2 thus the shear velocity is u τ w ρ 0 018 835 m s 1 and the shear reynolds number r e 2737 spatial and temporal averages of non dimensional streamwise fluid velocities u are plotted against channel height in fig 4a velocity is zero at the bottom wall and increases in wall normal direction following a logarithmic curve fig 4b displays the normalized velocity profile u together with a theoretical curve based on the velocity defect law guo 2017 22 u max u 1 κ ln 1 2 b 0 η 2 η 1 2 b 0 1 the von kármán constant in eq 22 is κ 0 39 and b 0 0 2 according to guo 2017 η y δ is the normalized wall normal coordinate maximum non dimensional streamwise velocity u max 29 3 is determined from the simulation results in fig 4a despite the velocity profile in fig 4 being consistent with the velocity defect law 22 streamwise velocities are slightly higher than respective experimental results by nezu and rodi 1986 at the same time velocities are relatively low in the near wall region the reason for this is the relatively coarse mesh with a non dimensional cell height of the bottom boundary cell of δ y δ y u ν 1 6 despite the wall adjacent cell centre being at y 1 which is the generally accepted value e g davidson 2009 there are only three cells resolving the laminar sublayer y 5 it is not expected though that this has considerable effect on the particle sediment interaction for this reason the flow field is considered accurate enough to be used as initial condition for the test case on sediment transport in order to account for the non resolved flow scales non dimensional wall units y y u ν eff in fig 4b are calculated based on the effective viscosity of ν eff 2 10 6 m 2 s 1 fig 5 displays two point correlations eq 21 in streamwise and lateral direction normalized by the temporal average of the squared velocity fluctuations in streamwise direction there are 29 cells with two point correlation of streamwise velocity greater than 0 3 and 10 cells with two point correlation for lateral velocity greater than 0 3 respectively in lateral direction there are 10 cells with two point correlation greater than 0 3 for the streamwise and the lateral velocity component this number of cells are considered enough to resolve large eddies but far from well resolved les davidson 2009 similarly to the velocity profile above the fulfilment of this requirement is considered appropriate for the purpose of this study 3 1 2 sediment transport fall velocities v s of the sediment plume in turbulent fluid flow at a bulk velocity of 0 5ms 1 are plotted against the particle diameter in fig 6 for particle sizes larger than 0 25mm the fall velocity in the results of the numerical model lies within the range of fall velocities measured by worf et al 2019 in the laboratory however the fall velocity of the fraction 0 18 mm d 0 25 mm is overestimated in the numerical model with respect to the measurements from the physical model worf et al 2019 observed that some particles hardly settled at all and remained in the upper part of the channel during their experiments they suggested that these particles have a very low shape factor flat plates and thus a low fall velocity however a constant shape factor is used in the numerical simulations as a result the very low fall velocities of flat plates are not reproduced in the numerical model it is assumed that the lack of particles with very low shape factors in the numerical model causes the overestimation of the fall velocity of the fraction 0 18 mm d 0 25 mm in order to compensate for this and also include particles with stokes numbers 1 in the model the range of particle sizes is extended by another fraction 0 07 mm d 0 18 mm fig 7 displays the particles at different timesteps after their release from the start of the channel in one exemplary simulation of the test case the sediment plume is transported by the fluid in direction of the fluid velocity this motion is superimposed by a gravity current as a result of the higher density of the sediment suspension compared to the surrounding clear water in addition particles settle in negative y direction as a result of diffusion turbulent dispersion and varying particle diameters the shape of the sediment plume gets distorted from its original shape 3 2 time dependent variability of the results fig 8 displays the distribution of the differences δ u of fluid velocities in cells with particles present and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells for all 41 simulations the velocity differences are averaged over all cells with particles present see also section 2 4 and normalized by the bulk flow velocity u the one sample student t test shows that streamwise fluid velocities in the sediment plume are significantly different from the respective velocity component in clear water flow over the first 0 9s of the development of the sediment plume for the vertical velocity component this difference is significant for the entire development of the sediment plume p 0 05 the implications of these observations on the importance of two way coupling will be discussed in section 3 5 below development of the shape of the sediment plume is analysed on the basis of the dimensions of the bounding box enclosing the sediment particles see section 2 4 the development of the streamwise and vertical edge length of this bounding box normalized by the initial edge length l 0 is displayed in fig 9 in contrast to velocity differences the variation of edge length of the bounding box around the sediment plume from the 41 simulations increases with time fig 9 several outliers are visible in fig 9a for t 1 7 s in these runs a number of particles have reached the bottom of the channel from where they are not transported any further as other particles are still in suspension and transported by the flow the particle distribution in streamwise direction increases at a high rate with the exception of the streamwise plume extents for t 1 7 s velocity differences and plume extents in figs 8 and 9 show a normal distribution this indicates that further discussion based on means over all 41 runs of the test case is justified 3 3 fluid and particle velocities fig 10 displays the streamwise component of the particle velocities v x plotted against instantaneous fluid velocities u x in the respective cells the points are coloured by the diameter of the particle they represent black polygons show the range of particle velocities plotted against time averaged fluid velocities in the respective cells from the precursor simulation single phase an equivalent analysis for the vertical velocity components v y and u y is shown in fig 11 the average overall magnitude of instantaneous fluid and particle velocities is almost equal only at t 0 5 s and t 1 0 s large particles have a slightly higher velocity than their surrounding fluid the differences between particle and fluid velocities are decreasing with the development of the plume for the earlier time steps t 1 0 s displayed in fig 10 the distribution of instantaneous fluid velocities is tilted towards the lower velocities compared to clear water velocities with advancing time and evolution of the sediment plume the range of fluid velocities in the sediment plume approaches the respective range of clear water flow from the precursor simulation in contrast to the lower end of the fluid velocity distribution maximum values for fluid velocities in the area of the sediment plume are hardly affected by the presence of sediment at t 0 1 s and t 0 5 s velocity differences between large particles and their surrounding fluid in fig 10 are higher than those between smaller particles and fluid this shows the lower response time τ p of particles with lower stokes numbers in contrast to the streamwise velocity components a clear offset between fluid and particle velocities in direction of gravity u y is visible at all time steps displayed in fig 11 negative y particle velocity components v y are higher than the respective fluid velocity components the reason for this is particle settling as large particles have higher fall velocities than small particles particle sorting with respect to grain size is visible at all time steps in fig 11 typical single phase models of sediment transport account for the vertical velocity difference between sediment and fluid by adding the terminal fall velocity to the particle velocity however a comparison of the median value of the particle fluid vertical velocity differences in the model and the terminal velocity of the particles according to the formula by haider and levenspiel 1989 shows that the particle fluid velocity difference 0 030ms 1 is slightly lower than the theoretical terminal velocity 0 039ms 1 of the particles this is consistent with studies of fall velocities in turbulent fluid flow in literature e g worf et al 2019 similarly to streamwise fluid velocities the range of vertical fluid velocities is also extended towards negative y by the particles the reason for this is the higher density of the water sediment suspension this phenomenon will be discussed in more detail in the following sections for t 0 5 s after the release of the sediment plume higher negative y fluid velocity components are related to the presence of smaller particle diameters this can be explained by the lower fall velocities of fine grains due to their lower fall velocity a larger part of their potential energy is available for the formation of the gravity current driven by the density difference between the sediment plume and the surrounding clear water gladstone et al 1998 this effect is less clearly visible at t 0 1 s the reason is that larger particles have not yet separated from the smaller particles due to their higher fall velocity thus there are no areas in the sediment plume where certain particle sizes are dominating this process driven by initial particle sorting also results in a more narrow range of vertical particle velocities at later time steps t 1 s on the one hand small particle fractions have a lower terminal velocity but at the same time form a stronger gravity current in negative y direction on the other hand large particles have a higher fall velocity while a lower amount of their potential energy is available for acceleration of the gravity current in addition to buoyancy settling particles may accelerate their surrounding fluid in the direction of gravity via drag force while gravity currents have already been investigated in several studies in literature e g dallali and armenio 2015 this process is expected to play a less important role this assumption is supported by the above described observation that fluid surrounding large particles with high fall velocities is less influenced by the presence of particles than fluid surrounding fine particles thus while the effect of buoyancy appears to be crucial for an accurate model of sediment transport vertical momentum transfer through drag is not expected to play a major role 3 4 particle influence on fluid flow quadrant analysis is an efficient means of obtaining a quantitative measure for the influence of the sediment on the turbulent fluid flow vinkovic et al 2011 instantaneous fluid velocities in cells with particles present are compared to time averaged fluid velocities of clear water flow in the respective cells these u x u y fluid velocity fluctuations are displayed in fig 12 the colour of the points shows the volumetric sediment concentration θ in the respective cell fig 12 shows that fluid velocities are tilted towards the third quadrant lower streamwise velocity and higher negative vertical velocity particularly in the earlier two time steps displayed this again shows the slowdown of the fluid by the inertia of the sediment see also fig 10 and the vertical acceleration due to the higher density of the water sediment suspension see also fig 11 maximum positive fluid velocity fluctuations in the sediment plume are similar to those of clear water flow as the sediment plume evolves particles and fluid accelerate in streamwise direction approximately 1s after the particles have been placed into the fluid streamwise velocity fluctuations are approximately within the same range as they are in clear water flow this is consistent with observations by nezu and azuma 2004 who observed no influence of particles on the fluid turbulence modulation in the outer region the offset of fluid velocity in vertical direction remains throughout the simulation but decreases with decreasing sediment concentration at the first time step displayed fluid velocities in cells with the highest particle concentration deviate most from time averaged fluid velocities this shows that the major part of the sediment plume has not yet accelerated with the flow only some individual particles have been separated from the plume and transported to higher velocity flow areas at t 0 5 s streamwise fluid velocities in high concentration cells are closer to the time averaged clear water velocity than in cells with lower concentration 3 5 development of the sediment plume fig 13 displays the temporal development of velocity differences δ u between fluid influenced by the particles and time averaged clear water flow top the development of the size of the sediment plume is displayed in the bottom panel the values displayed in fig 13 are means of the distributions visualized as boxplots in figs 8 and 9 respectively the figure is used to analyse the temporal development of the processes identified in the sections above in addition their influence on sediment dispersion is discussed based on the extents of the sediment plume temporal development of fluid velocity differences and the extents of the sediment plume in fig 13 indicates the existence of three phases during the development of the sediment plume acceleration phase initially the streamwise velocity in the sediment plume is significantly lower than in clear water flow see also section 3 2 at the same time the negative y component continuously increases during this initial phase the sediment plume grows in streamwise and vertical direction while its width in lateral direction is remaining constant during the first 0 2s after particles were added to the flow transport phase after approximately 0 4s the sediment plume has accelerated to a streamwise velocity which is within the range of turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations of clear water flow the rate of acceleration continuously decreases at the same time the negative y component of the fluid velocity has reached a maximum and starts to decrease while the rate of extension of the sediment plume is decaying in y direction the plume in this phase increasingly grows in lateral direction over a large part of the transport phase the lateral extension of the sediment plume even exceeds the vertical extension deposition phase approximately 1 6s after the sediment has been placed into the channel the mean of the instantaneous fluid velocity from all 41 simulations of the sediment plume reaches the time averaged velocity of the clear water flow sediment dispersion is increasing in x direction vertical extent of the sediment plume exceeds the lateral one as particles are placed into the channel at an initial velocity of zero sediment acts as an obstacle for fluid flow the resulting decrease of streamwise fluid velocity has already been observed in figs 10 and 12 for t 0 1 s and t 0 5 s fig 13 now shows that it takes approximately 0 5s for the sediment plume to be accelerated by the surrounding water through drag forces at the end of the acceleration phase streamwise acceleration of the sediment plume decreases in the transport phase a significant lag between streamwise velocities in the sediment plume and time averaged fluid velocities of clear water remains see also fig 8 this is consistent with the observations of nezu and azuma 2004 and muste et al 2005 the high difference between streamwise velocities of clear water flow and fluid velocities in the sediment plume figs 10 12 and 13 shows the importance of two way coupling particularly in the acceleration phase alternatively a time dependent velocity correction could be applied in one way coupled models for this initial phase of sediment transport with such a correction accounting for the lower fluid velocities in the initial phase of the development of the sediment plume it is expected that particle trajectories can also be captured with reasonable accuracy e g using an eddy interaction model cheng et al 2018a the acceleration in negative y direction in the acceleration phase is a result of the surplus density of the water sediment suspension in the area of the sediment plume compared to the surrounding clear water heavier water sediment suspension falls below the lighter clear water the process has already been observed in figs 11 and 12 at four particular time steps fig 13 shows that at the transition from the acceleration phase to the transport phase this gravity current reaches its maximum velocity in the transport phase the gravity current is decaying due to ongoing dispersion and thus reduction of sediment concentration at its peak the average buoyancy induced vertical velocity differences between sediment plume and clear water flow reach a magnitude of almost 10 of the bulk velocity hence this process should be included in models for the development of a sediment plume the influence of the buoyancy can be implemented relatively easy by a source term in the fluid momentum equation without the need for a complete two way coupled model necker et al 2002 an et al 2012 dallali and armenio 2015 dallali and armenio 2015 particularly showed the effect of buoyancy on steady sediment transport in turbulent fluid flow using this method in the transport phase a one way coupling approach for sediment transport modelling can be sufficient for achieving acceptable modelling results in such a case effects of sediment on the fluid which have already been parametrized should still be accounted for these include the reduction of the von kármán constant nezu and azuma 2004 ferreira 2015 cheng et al 2018b effects of sediment particles on fluid turbulence hsu and liu 2004 and turbulent dispersion e g using an eddy interaction model cheng et al 2018a in the deposition phase the concentration in the sediment plume has reduced to the point that drag forces only have a minor effect on the fluid flow thus mean streamwise and lateral velocities in the sediment approach the time averaged respective fluid velocity of clear water flow for the vertical velocity component an offset remains resulting from buoyancy temporal development of the dimensions of the bounding box encircling the sediment plume in fig 13b also shows the three phases analysed above for fluid velocity while hardly any dispersion takes place in lateral direction particularly in the beginning of the acceleration phase the sediment plume grows in streamwise and vertical direction at a relatively high rate the streamwise velocity difference between clear water flow and the sediment plume in the acceleration phase provides an explanation for the low initial dispersion in lateral direction sediment leaving the core of the plume in lateral direction is immediately taken up by the flow inhibiting further movement normal to the flow this results in an increased dispersion in streamwise direction and at the same time reduced dispersion in lateral direction none of these processes are accounted for in one way coupled models and even many two way coupled euler euler models the relatively high dispersion of sediment in the acceleration phase in vertical direction particularly compared to lateral dispersion is a result of the high range of particle sizes included in the model fig 11 the difference in fall velocities causes the continuous extension in direction of gravity in the transport phase the sediment plume has accelerated in streamwise and vertical direction but at the same time still is compact so that the flow is highly stratified in the area of the sediment plume according to literature stratification inhibits vertical dispersion dallali and armenio 2015 the flattening of the growth rate of the sediment plume in the transport phase is consistent with this in addition further vertical separation of small and large particles is inhibited by small particles inducing higher vertical fluid velocities than large particles this compensates for lower fall velocities of small particles this process already described above and visible in fig 11 additionally causes lower vertical dispersion in the transport phase compared to the acceleration phase as the major part of the sediment plume has accelerated with the bulk of the flow the velocity difference between sediment plume and surrounding water is lower hence lateral dispersion increases in the transport phase at t 1 s after the release of the sediment the streamwise extent amounts to 2 5 l 0 the vertical extent to 1 9 l 0 and the lateral extent to 2 1 l 0 respectively when the sediment plume approaches the bottom wall of the channel the vertical velocity gradient increases fig 10 shows the high range of velocities in cells with particles present at the beginning of the deposition phase t 1 6 s particularly larger particles have already fallen to an area of the flow field where streamwise velocities are substantially lower due to wall friction the high velocity difference between different areas of the sediment plume causes a distortion of the sediment plume in streamwise direction and hence an increasing streamwise extent in addition turbulent velocity fluctuations are higher close to the bottom wall this enhances sediment dispersion also in vertical direction which exceeds lateral dispersion in the deposition phase this is consistent with findings of vinkovic et al 2011 4 conclusions average values of the simulation results show that the development of the sediment plume is dependent on the time passed since the particles have been released in addition the position of the sediment within the channel cross section influences the sediment transport processes three phases of the development of the sediment plume are identified i acceleration phase ii transport phase and iii deposition phase transport processes of the sediment plume can be related to these three phases particularly in the acceleration phase fluid velocities are decreased by the inertia of the sediment in addition the surplus density of the sediment suspension compared to the surrounding clear fluid induces a gravity current resulting in a shift of fluid velocities in direction of gravity the development of the sediment plume is driven by high temporal and spatial velocity gradients in the transport phase initial acceleration of the sediment plume is completed streamwise velocity components of the sediment plume remain slightly lower than the respective component in clear water flow but the difference is not statistically significant any more as the plume evolves turbulent dispersion and thus continuous reduction of sediment concentration are the main processes driving the development of the sediment plume from the results of the simulations in this study it is expected that the development of the sediment plume in this phase can be modelled with sufficient accuracy using a less detailed approach for particle fluid interaction as long as the effect of buoyancy is considered the final deposition phase is characterized by a higher vertical velocity gradient close to the bottom boundary this causes a distortion of the sediment plume in streamwise direction due to faster movement of particles in the upper area of the plume compared to particles close to the channel bed the simulation results of this study show the following processes related to the development of the sediment plume which are not captured by one way coupled models significant slow down of streamwise fluid velocity in the acceleration phase as a result of the inertia of the sediment additional streamwise dispersion in the acceleration phase due to increased variability of fluid velocities in the sediment plume reduced streamwise velocity in the transport phase depending on particle concentration reduced vertical dispersion in the transport phase due to stratification as well as particle sorting vertical acceleration of the fluid due to buoyancy already implemented in many models through a source term in the fluid momentum equation for both fluid velocities as well as the development of the sediment plume the acceleration phase turned out to be the phase of the sediment transport with the highest dynamics many processes in this phase are not accounted for in numerical models of sediment transport this explains challenges in modelling the development of a sediment plume our findings related to the development of the sediment plume in the acceleration phase can be used to improve results of models using a less detailed approach for particle fluid interaction for example a sediment plume can be initialized at a position and shape which is expected to occur after the acceleration phase e g using 2 5 l 0 for the streamwise extent 1 9 l 0 for the vertical extent and 2 1 l 0 for the lateral extent 1s after the sediment was added to the flow see fig 13 this way modelling the acceleration phase using a possibly unsuitable approach is avoided this would allow to model particle fluid interaction and turbulence in lower detail in the transport phase thus a larger spatial and temporal extent can be covered by the model for instance to optimize sediment dumping throughout an entire river section credit authorship contribution statement daniel wildt

209,a growing body of site investigations have demonstrated that vadose zones serve as significant long term sources of pfas to groundwater quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater is therefore critical for characterizing managing and mitigating long term contamination risks mathematical models representing the pfas specific transport and retention processes including surfactant induced flow and rate limited nonlinear adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces have been recently developed while these advanced models provide fundamental insights into the primary processes controlling the long term retention of pfas they are less suitable for screening type applications due to significant computational cost and the requirement for detailed input parameters to address this knowledge gap we develop a simplified model by assuming steady state infiltration and linear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption a two domain model is used to represent kinetic solid phase adsorption we derive novel analytical solutions for the simplified model allowing for arbitrary initial conditions the newly derived analytical solutions are then validated by application to miscible displacement experiments under a wide range of conditions and by comparisons to a state of the art comprehensive model under both experimental and field conditions applicable to pfas contamination sites overall the simplified analytical model provides an efficient and accurate screening type tool for quantifying long term pfas leaching in the vadose zone graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas leaching interfacial adsorption analytical solution rate limited adsorption unsaturated zone 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have become emerging contaminants of critical concern large scale manufacturing and wide use of pfas since the 1940s have led to their ubiquitous presence in the environment including surface water soils sediments and groundwater a growing body of site investigations have established that vadose zones are significant pfas reservoirs that pose long term threats for contaminating groundwater even several decades after the contamination events were stopped xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 adamson et al 2020 cáñez et al 2021 most pfas are surfactants with unique interfacial properties that distinguish their transport behaviors from that of traditional non surfactant contaminants

displacement experiments under water unsaturated conditions lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019b 2021 lyu et al 2020 li et al 2021 have demonstrated that pfas tend to accumulate at air water interfaces in soils which can greatly increase retention in the vadose zone e g brusseau 2018 guo et al 2020 adsorption at the solid water interfaces resulting from hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions also enhances the retention of pfas in soils e g higgins and luthy 2006 barzen hanson et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 mejia avendaño et al 2020 wang et al 2021 additional processes including volatilization transformation of precursors and uptake by biota can add further complexities to the retention of some pfas in the vadose zone e g sima and jaffé 2020 sharifan et al 2021 mathematical models representing the complex retention and leaching processes of pfas in soils are critically needed for understanding long term risks of vadose zone pfas as a source of contamination to groundwater guo et al 2020 reported a new mathematical model that accounts for a set of unique transport behaviors of pfas in the vadose zone including nonlinear and rate limited adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces in the presence of transient variably saturated flow and surfactant induced flow the mathematical model has been validated by application to water unsaturated miscible displacement column experiments under a wide range of conditions el ouni et al 2021 brusseau et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 and applied to simulate long term pfas leaching at a model fire training area site guo et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 the simulated strong retention of pfas in the shallow vadose zone is consistent with many prior field observations e g anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 shortly thereafter a model similar to that of guo et al 2020 was independently reported by silva et al 2020 rate limited adsorption was not considered where example simulations were presented in one and two dimensions more recently zeng and guo 2021 extended the model formulations of guo et al 2020 to three dimensions and examined the impact of surfactant induced flow and preferential flow on long term pfas leaching in heterogeneous vadose zones while the comprehensive models discussed above provide fundamental insights into the primary processes controlling the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone their complexity and the associated significant computational cost make them less suitable for practical screening type application at field contamination sites such as for developing initial strategies for characterizing managing and mitigating pfas contamination risks based on limited site information screening type analysis usually employs much simpler analytical or semi analytical models that are computationally efficient and do not need detailed information for the input parameters and site conditions such simple models have been previously demonstrated as useful screening tools for guiding remediation strategies and determining regulatory standards for non pfas contaminants examples include the epa spreadsheet model for subsurface vapor intrusion us epa 2017 and remchlor md for modeling long term matrix diffusion of chlorinated solvent in aquifers falta et al 2018 however similar simple models for quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater are to date not available in the present work we address this knowledge gap by developing a simplified model for pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone that allows for analytical solutions specifically our model formulation assumes steady state infiltration and simplifies the transport processes by linearizing the nonlinear terms for adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces additionally rate limited adsorption at the solid water interfaces is represented by a two domain kinetic model new analytical solutions derived for the simplified model are validated by application to miscible displacement experiments for multiple pfas under a wide range of conditions as well as via comparisons to simulations produced with a comprehensive numerical model under both experimental and field conditions to the best of our knowledge the analytical solutions presented here are the first for solute transport that account for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption finally we present a workflow to demonstrate the application of the simplified models for analyzing long term pfas leaching in the vadose zone 2 mathematical model and simplifications we present the mathematical model from simplifying both the variably saturated flow and pfas transport processes represented in the model formulations of guo et al 2020 2 1 water flow we consider water flow driven by steady state infiltration in the vertical dimension of a homogeneous vadose zone water in the vadose zone is assumed unsaturated with a spatially uniform saturation i e h z 0 where h is the water pressure head and the unsaturated water flow q cm s is driven only by gravity assuming that z is positive downward from darcy s law q k z h z we obtain 1 q k where k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm s which can be approximated as an empirical function of the volumetric water

soil media though it is often set to 0 5 for simplicity m is related to the pore size distribution of the soil media and can be determined by fitting the soil water characteristic function of van genuchten 1980 to measured datasets we note that alternative models for k such as the equations proposed by kosugi 1999 may also be employed the kosugi model was shown to match better the measured unsaturated water conductivity than eq 2 for some soil media 2 2 transport of pfas transport of pfas in the vertical dimension of a vadose zone may be described by an advection dispersion equation

isotherm was reported to range from 0 75 to 1 1 for multiple pfas in a wide range of soils and sediments higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 van glubt et al 2020 a recent study showed that the fitted exponent parameter ranged from 0 64 to 1 27 median 0 82 and mean 0 85 for pfos in 114 tropical and temperate soils umeh et al 2021 because the present study focuses on formulating a simplified model for which analytical solutions can be derived we assume that the solid phase adsorption can be approximated by a linear isotherm kinetics associated with solid phase adsorption were shown to be present in both batch and miscible displacement experiments brusseau et al 2019a guelfo et al 2020 schaefer et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 guelfo et al 2020 and schaefer et al 2021 suggested that kinetic solid phase adsorption is only present in real soils with organic carbon or clay content greater than 0 we use a two domain model to represent kinetic solid phase adsorption i e c s c s 1

miscible displacement experiments using soil packed columns have demonstrated that the kinetics associated with air water interfacial adsorption is minimal under steady state flow conditions brusseau 2020 brusseau et al 2021 we thus assume equilibrium air water interfacial adsorption the adsorption at air water interfaces c a w in eq 3 is the product of the surface excess γ μ mol cm 2 and the air

adamson and gast 1997 8 σ σ 0 1 b ln 1 c a where σ 0 is the surface tension of the aqueous solution with no dissolved pfas dyn cm and a μ mol cm 3 and b are fitting parameters to experimental data substituting eq 8 into eq 7 yields 9 k a w 1 χ r g t σ 0 b a c substituting eqs 4 6 to eq 3 we obtain a linear advection dispersion equation eq 10 coupled with a two domain kinetic solid phase

retardation from solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption respectively for pfas migration in the vadose zone we consider the following initial and boundary conditions for eqs 10 and 5 assuming

water interfacial area a a w in eq 6 in soils is comprised of two types including capillary interfaces associated with menisci between bulk air and water and film related interfaces associated with wetting films surrounding grain surfaces both of which are relevant for pfas transport as demonstrated by prior miscible displacement experiments lyu et al 2018 2020 brusseau et al 2019b 2021 li et al 2021 brusseau and guo 2021 the combination of the two i e the total air water interfacial area is considered in the present study the total a a w usually increases as s w decreases we approximate a a

leverett 1941 morrow 1970 bradford and leij 1997 the thermodynamic based method is described in more detail in section 5 and employed for the soil media therein 3 analytical solutions we derive new analytical solutions for eqs 5 and 10 subject to the initial and boundary conditions of eqs 11 14 using the laplace transform similar derivation procedures were reported in the literature for solute transport in the presence of kinetic solid phase adsorption with no air water interfacial adsorption lindstrom and narasimham 1973 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 toride et al 1993 we therefore only present the final form of the analytical solutions with the detailed and rather tedious derivation steps omitted to the best of our knowledge the analytical solution reported here is the first that accounts for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption for convenience we define the following dimensionless variables and parameters t v t l t 0 v t 0 l z z l p v l d ω s α s 1 β s 1 r s l v where l is an arbitrary distance from the land surface which is taken as the depth of the vadose zone in the present study and β s 1 f s r s 1 r s ω s is often referred to as the damköhler number which represents the ratio between the characteristic time scales of transport i e advection in the present study and reaction i e kinetic solid phase adsorption in the present study because eqs 5 and 10 and the boundary conditions are linear the analytical solutions for the aqueous concentration c z t and adsorbed concentration at the kinetic sorption domain c s 2 z

simplified when kinetic solid phase adsorption is not considered in that case f s 1 c s 2 0 j a 1 b 1 1 and a z t can be integrated analytically the analytical solution for this special case with no kinetic solid phase adsorption is presented in appendix 2 the simplified model in section 2 is more general than the analytical solutions presented in section 3 because the transport equation eq 10 can involve spatial heterogeneities for example the solid phase adsorption coefficient k d can be a depth dependent function to reflect the change of sorption capacities along depth e g decrease of organic carbon content along the soil profile additionally the more general freundlich nonlinear adsorption model can also be used for representing solid phase adsorption however the presence of nonlinearities and heterogeneities would generally prevent the transport equation from being solved analytically 4 model validation and evaluation we validate the simplified analytical model by simulating breakthrough curves measured in multiple miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature and by conducting simulations of pfas leaching in the vadose zone at a model fire training area site under field relevant conditions the analytical based simulations are in both cases compared to numerical solutions of the full process model of guo et al 2020 4 1 simulating miscible displacement experiments we simulate three sets of pfas unsaturated miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature all of the experiments were conducted using columns packed with a commercially available natural quartz sand unimin corp referred to as accusand which has a mean grain diameter of 0 35 mm and a total organic carbon content of 0 04 aggregated data for the air water interfacial area under a wide range of water saturations for accusand were summarized in jiang et al 2020 the air water interfacial area measured by aqueous interfacial tracer methods was fitted to a second degree polynomial function of water saturation eq 15 x 2 548 54 x 1 1182 5 x 0 633 96 by guo et al 2020 and is employed here for simulating the experiments the first set of experiments were conducted for pfoa at three different input concentrations 0 01 0 1 and 1 mg l but only the arrival fronts of the breakthrough curves were measured lyu et al 2018 the second set of experiments was conducted for pfos at an input concentration of 0 1 mg l brusseau et al 2021 the third set of experiments was conducted for hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da also known as genx at an input concentration of 10 mg l yan et al 2020 full breakthrough curves were measured for both the second and third sets of experiments the water saturation of the sand column was 0 68 0 68 and 0 64 for the three sets of experiments respectively all of the miscible displacement experiments were conducted using a background electrolyte solution of 0 01 m nacl solution the surface tension of the nacl solution with no pfas is σ 0 71 4 dyn cm the szyskowski parameters for the five pfas in the nacl solution are pfba a 4702 6 mg l b 0 19 pfhxa a 502 1 mg l b 0 17 pfoa a 78 6 mg l b 0 2 pfos a 5 mg l b 0 1 genx a 109 mg l b 0 1 the hydraulic parameters of the sand were measured in the lab and were reported in guo et al 2020 the solid phase adsorption parameters were determined from transport experiments conducted under water saturated conditions it is important to point out that all of the parameters are determined independently with no fitting or calibration thus the model simulations are predictions of the experiments and comparisons between the simulations and measurements represent a direct validation test of the model the experimental data and the simulations from both the simplified analytical model and the full process numerical model are presented in fig 1 the flux averaged concentration at the outlet is used in the analytical solution the results show that the predictions from both the analytical and numerical models agree well with the experimental data the case that sees some deviation is pfoa with an input concentration of 0 1 mg l in the first set of experiments this may be caused by variability in the kinetics of the solid phase adsorption among the three columns in this set of experiments the kinetic parameters were determined from one of the columns under saturated condition and then employed for all three columns the comparisons in the semi log plots d f are generally consistent with those in the arithmetic plots a c the low concentration data points at approximately 0 2 pore volume for pfoa d and 17 pore volumes for genx f are near the detection limit of the analytical method and hence may not be accurate some deviation between the model simulations and the experimental data is observed for the two data points at approximately 12 and 13 pore volumes for genx this deviation indicates that there may be nonideal adsorption kinetics that are not captured by the two domain kinetic sorption model employed in the simulations according to the data and analysis presented in brusseau et al 2019a this long tailing behavior observed for genx is most likely caused by nonideal adsorption at the solid surfaces we would like to point out that guelfo et al 2020 using a similar sand but with a total organic carbon content of 0 concluded that the solid phase adsorption is not rate limited under the conditions examined in their experiments it is interesting that the analytical solutions are almost identical to the numerical solutions from the full process model for all of the experiments this implies that the additional processes included in the full process model have a minimal impact on pfas transport under the specific conditions employed in the experiments i e relatively low input concentrations these observations are consistent with the results reported in brusseau et al 2021 which concluded that surfactant induced flow and nonlinearity in air water interfacial adsorption are insignificant under those miscible displacement experimental conditions when the input concentration is sufficiently blow the critical reference concentration i e the concentration corresponding to 2 5 of reduction in surface tension given that the simulations are predictions with no parameter fitting the excellent agreement with the experimental data and the full process numerical model demonstrates the validity of the simplified analytical model for representing the transport processes of pfas in water unsaturated miscible displacement experiments 4 2 simulating pfas retention and leaching at a model afff impacted fire training area site we further evaluate the simplified analytical model by comparing it to the full process numerical model for simulating long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone under field relevant conditions we consider a model aqueous film forming foam afff impacted fire training area site with a 30 year contamination period pfas are being released to the vadose zone due to regular fire training activities and a 50 year post contamination period fire training activities are stopped and no additional pfas are being released to the vadose zone a 4 m deep vadose zone is assumed homogeneous and is composed of one of two porous media accusand and vinton soil for which extensive prior laboratory measurements are available the detailed hydraulic and transport parameters for accusand and vinton soil were reported in guo et al 2020 we consider four representative pfas including two short chain compounds pfpea and pfhxs and two long chain compounds pfoa and pfos as suggested by guo et al 2020 based on standard practices at fire training area sites the fire training is assumed to occur every ten days with each training lasting for 30 mins leading to a total infiltration of 0 0458 cm of diluted afff solution per training session pfas composition in afff varies among different products and in different years houtz et al 2013 here we adopt the composition reported in høisæter et al 2019 for a commercial afff with a 1 100 dilution the concentrations for pfpea pfhxs pfoa and pfos are 0 23 7 1 0 9 and 100 mg l respectively the surface tension data for the pfas measured in synthetic groundwater are used to determine the szyskowski parameters which are presented together with other pfas in section 5 table 2 similar to the simulations reported in guo et al 2020 rainfall and evapotranspiration data measured at 30 min resolution from a site in arizona az and a site in new jersey nj downloaded from the ameriflux database url https ameriflux lbl gov are used to represent semiarid and humid regions respectively both models consider a one dimensional domain along the vertical dimension of the vadose zone the numerical model employs a uniform grid δ z 1 cm free drainage i e normal gradient of capillary pressure is zero and zero dispersion i e advective flux only are assumed at the bottom boundary the full process model accounts for surfactant induced flow rate limited and nonlinear solid phase adsorption and rate limited and nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption guo et al 2020 the coupled richards equation and nonlinear advection dispersion equation are solved in a fully implicit numerical framework by newton raphson iterations further details about the model setup and numerical algorithms for the full process model can be found in guo et al 2020 for the simplified analytical model we need to make three simplifications to represent the field conditions 1 since the analytical solution can only represent steady state infiltration we take the average annual net infiltration rate computed from the numerical simulations and convert it to steady state infiltration 2 we also need to compute the average pfas infiltration and convert it to steady state infiltration during the active contamination period 3 finally the nonlinear solid phase adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption both need to be linearized the linear solid phase adsorption coefficients k d k f c r e p n 1 are computed at representative concentration values see table 1 while the constant air water interfacial adsorption coefficient k a w is computed at c 0 mg l for simplicity comparisons between the simulations from the simplified analytical model and the full process numerical model are presented in figs 2 and 3 despite the various assumptions employed by the analytical model the simplified analytical model agrees well with the full process numerical model for the simulated retention i e mass remaining in the vadose zone and cumulative mass discharge to groundwater fig 2 as well as the time dependent spatial profiles of pfas concentrations in the vadose zone fig 3 an exception is pfos where the simplified analytical model substantially underestimates the leaching compared to the full process numerical model the underestimated leaching observed for pfos may be attributed to two of the assumptions made in the simplified analytical model 1 steady state infiltration and 2 linear air water interfacial adsorption while transient variably saturated flow due to time dependent rainfall infiltration does not substantially change water saturation at deeper locations in the vadose zone it leads to significant changes in the water saturation near the land surface the increases in water saturation during rainfall events destroy air water interfaces and reduce air water interfacial adsorption which then leads to accelerated leaching of pfas this phenomenon has a more significant impact on the leaching of pfos because it is more strongly retained in soils and stays in the shallow vadose zone for a longer period of time a close inspection also reveals that the impact of transient infiltration has a greater impact during the active contamination period because transient infiltration dynamically redistributes the released pfas near the land surface this is not accounted for in the simplified analytical model so its simulated concentration profiles deviate from those simulated by the full process model during the active contamination period t 30 years especially near the land surface concomitantly the release concentration of pfos 100 mg l is the highest among the four pfas which leads to stronger nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption therefore using the maximum k a w 0 048 cm 3 cm 2 i e c 0 mg l in the analytical solution underestimates leaching of pfos in the vadose zone to further illustrate the influence of the two assumptions discussed above and to explore ways to improve the prediction of the simplified analytical model we conduct two sets of additional simulations for pfos using the simplified analytical model the first set of simulations uses k a w 0 038 cm 3 cm 2 corresponding to a representative aqueous concentration in the vadose zone c r e p 1 mg l the representative concentration is estimated from the original simulated plume i e assuming maximum k a w note that the representative aqueous concentration in the vadose zone is substantially lower than the release concentration 100 mg l for pfos this is because the majority of the pfos is adsorbed at the solid water and air water interfaces leaving only a small fraction in the aqueous phase the second set of simulations in addition to using k a w at a representative concentration uses the solution of the full process numerical model at t 30 years as the initial condition and only focuses on simulating post contamination comparisons between the two additional simulations with the original simulations are presented in fig 4 the scenario for accusand and nj climate is used as an example the results show that using the representative k a w leads to greater leaching and a better agreement with the full process numerical model see the first two rows of fig 4 the post contamination simulation that uses the 30 year solution of the full process numerical model as the initial condition further improves the prediction of the simplified analytical model the above results and analysis demonstrate that the deviations observed for pfos in figs 2 and 3 are indeed in part caused by the steady state infiltration and linear air water interfacial assumptions employed in the original simulations furthermore the simplified analytical model can be improved by using a representative aqueous concentration to compute k a w and when simulating post contamination which would be the case for most of the legacy contamination sites we point out that the pfas contamination scenarios considered here afff impacted fire training area sites are among the pfas source zones with the highest concentrations as demonstrated by many prior field investigations e g anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 pfas concentrations at other source zones including agricultural lands that receive pfas contaminated biosolids and irrigation water and wastewater treatment plant sites are often several orders of magnitude lower e g brusseau et al 2020 therefore it is expected that the linear air water interfacial adsorption employed in the simplified analytical model would be more appropriate for other source zones compared to the simulations presented here for the afff impacted fire training area sites finally we note that there is an ongoing debate as to whether the air water interfacial adsorption can be considered linear at lower concentrations schaefer et al 2019a 2020 arshadi et al 2020 i e whether eq 9 or another equation that represents freundlich adsorption should be used to compute the air water interfacial coefficient some additional data and analyses were recently added to this discussion brusseau 2021 reported that the air water interfacial adsorption of two hydrocarbon surfactants sds and sdbs determined by eq 9 matches with the air water interfacial adsorption measured directly by neutron reflectometry for concentrations down to lower than 10 5 m in another study brusseau et al 2021 employed miscible displacement data of pfoa at a concentration of c 1 μ g l and showed that the air water interfacial coefficient computed from the experimental breakthrough curve matches well with that determined by eq 9 nevertheless further research and data are needed to test the potential nonlinearity of air water interfacial adsorption at lower concentrations for a wider range of pfas and under a broader range of conditions 5 demonstration of model application we present a workflow to demonstrate how to employ the simplified analytical model as a screening tool for analyzing pfas retention and leaching at field contamination sites we take a model afff impacted fire training area site as an example for the demonstration suppose we are interested in quantifying the leaching of nine representative pfas varying in headgroups and chain lengths six pfcas and three perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids pfsas in a homogeneous vadose zone represented by six soils the annual net water recharge rate is assumed 30 cm similar to the scenarios considered in section 4 2 we consider an active contamination period of 30 years followed by 50 years of post contamination for the nine pfas the szyskowski parameters for the surface tension in synthetic groundwater silva et al 2019 2021 molecular weights and the release concentrations from a diluted afff solution høisæter et al 2019 are provided in table 2 the six soils include sand soil 1 sandy loam soil 2 two loams soils 3 4 sandy clay soil 5 and a sandy clay loam soil 6 for the present study the solid phase adsorption coefficients for the six soils were measured for the nine pfas nguyen et al 2020 and are summarized in table 3 if no measured solid phase adsorption coefficients are available they may be estimated using the so called distributed sorption models that represent the contribution of individual soil constituents soil organic carbon clay minerals metal oxides to the total sorption the distributed sorption models can implicitly represent the different potential sorption mechanisms such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and have been developed and applied for quantifying the solid phase adsorption of pfoa and pfos in soil media higgins and luthy 2007 knight et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the hydraulic parameters for the six soils are not available and are estimated see table 4 using the rosetta pedotransfer model zhang and schaap 2017 based on soil texture and bulk density reported in nguyen et al 2020 no measurements of air water interfacial area are available for the soils one approach is to employ the thermodynamic based method to estimate the air water interfacial area as a function of water saturation leverett 1941 morrow 1970 bradford and leij 1997 the thermodynamic based method assumes that the mechanical work done for fluid fluid displacement is fully converted to surface energy i e generating air water interfaces as a result the air water interfacial area can be estimated by computing the area under the capillary pressure water saturation curve as 30 a a w ϕ σ s w 1 p c s w d s w where ϕ is the porosity of the soil σ is the surface tension and p c is the capillary pressure prior studies have shown that the thermodynamic based method significantly underestimates the air water interfacial area compared to that measured by aqueous interfacial tracers jiang et al 2020 but the latter was suggested to be more relevant for pfas transport in the vadose zone brusseau and guo 2021 here we employ a scaling method to correct the estimated air water interfacial area estimated from the thermodynamic based method we take the vinton soil introduced in section 4 2 to compute the ratio between the a a w estimated from the thermodynamic based method and the measured a a w by aqueous interfacial tracer the ratio varies from 3 89 to 4 41 for the entire saturation range as an approximation the mean ratio 4 15 is applied to correct the air water interfacial area for the six soils when computing the thermodynamic based a a w the surface tension σ in eq 30 is taken as the surface tension with no dissolved pfas note that because parameters for kinetic solid phase adsorption are not available kinetic solid phase adsorption is not accounted for in these simulations the simulated pfas retention in the vadose zone is presented in fig 5 for the nine pfas in the six soils the results clearly demonstrate that the retention of pfas vary strongly with different chain lengths and functional groups for both pfcas and pfsas the longer chain pfas are much more strongly retained in the vadose zone than their shorter chain counterparts which is consistent with the increasing solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption for longer chain pfas while variations in the retention of a given pfas exist among the six soils the difference between the soils is not significant except for soil 2 which has the strongest retention due to its much stronger solid phase adsorption the similar retention among the soils is in part caused by the same net recharge rate 30 cm per year employed for all of the six soils at field sites the net recharge rate will likely change with different soils in the vadose zone as a result of different surface evaporation rates due to different water retention capacities for example this was the case for the accusand and vinton soil employed in section 4 2 where their net recharge rates differ by almost 2 times this also implies that it is critical to obtain a more accurate estimate of the net recharge rate for improved prediction of pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone when applying the simplified analytical model another way to analyze the strength of retention is to compare the retardation factors among different pfas and soils the computed retardation factors are presented in fig 6 from which we can make the following observations consistent with the retention behavior shown in fig 5 the retardation factors increase with chain length for the same soil the retardation factors for the short chain pfas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs are smaller than 10 for all soils except for pfhpa in soil 1 sand that has a retardation factor of 11 1 comparisons among the soils reveal that for the longer chain pfas the retardation factors for soil 1 sand and soil 2 sandy loam are greater than the other finer grain soils the reason for this rather counterintuitive observation is that for a given infiltration rate the finer grain soils have a much higher water saturation that leads to a much smaller air water interfacial area this then leads to reduced air water interfacial adsorption and total retention of pfas in the vadose zone comprised of finer grain soils overall the above workflow and analyses demonstrate that the simplified analytical model provides a computationally efficient means to quantify pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater 6 summary and conclusion we present a simplified model for quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater the model assumes steady state infiltration and linear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption rate limited solid phase adsorption is represented by a two domain kinetic model air water interfacial adsorption is assumed instantaneous i e equilibrium new analytical solutions for the simplified model are derived that allow for arbitrary initial conditions these analytical solutions are the first that account for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption for solute transport while the model formulation involves a number of simplifications predicted simulations using the analytical solution agree well with a wide range of sand packed miscible displacement experiments for pfas under water unsaturated conditions for these experiments the analytical solution is almost identical to the solution from a numerical model that accounts for a set of comprehensive pfas specific transport processes including surfactant induced flow and rate limited and nonlinear adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces these comparisons demonstrate the validity of the simplified model and the analytical solution for representing the pfas specific transport processes under laboratory conditions the simplified model is then compared to the full process numerical model for simulating long term pfas leaching at a model afff impacted fire training area site despite that several processes and conditions are not represented in the simplified model e g surfactant induced flow time dependent infiltration and evapotranspiration and nonlinearity in the solid water and air water interfacial adsorption close agreement is observed between the simplified analytical and full process numerical models in their simulated long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater practically the analytical solution provides a simple approach for estimating pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater at pfas contamination sites this screening type tool allows stakeholders and practitioners to develop quantitative guidance for characterizing managing and mitigating the long term risks of pfas contamination in particular because the simplified model can be solved analytically 1 000s of simulations can be easily conducted for a given problem using a wide range of input parameters these simulations can be used to quantify the uncertainty propagated from the input parameters to the final predictions and also to gain critical insights into the primary parameters or factors that control the long term risks of pfas contamination at sites in addition to the computationally focused analyses this screening type tool can also be combined with direct measurements of soil porewater concentrations proposed in a recent perspective by anderson 2021 for quantifying soil to groundwater mass discharge and providing remedial guidance at pfas contamination sites the simplified model is nevertheless limited by the imposed assumptions here we briefly discuss the limitations and propose strategies that may be employed to partially address these limitations when applying the model to analyze practical problems for example the analytical solution is unable to simulate pfas leaching in the presence of spatial heterogeneities such as soil layering that can lead to both heterogeneous hydraulic and sorption properties zeng and guo 2021 the impact of heterogeneities may be indirectly accounted for by conducting a range of simulations using different soil types relevant to a specific site these simulations can be used to provide upper and lower bounds for the estimates of pfas leaching and mass discharge similarly since the analytical solution is derived under steady state infiltration it cannot represent the impact of dynamic infiltration on pfas leaching however the simulation results presented in section 4 2 show that the simulated pfas leaching by assuming steady state flow agrees well with those generated by the full process numerical model that accounts for highly dynamic infiltration rates from real rainfall data at a 30 min temporal resolution while only homogeneous vadose zones are considered in section 4 2 a prior study by russo and fiori 2008 suggested that assuming steady state flow is sufficient for predicting solute transport even in heterogeneous vadose zones note that a non surfactant solute in the absence of complex retention processes was considered therein provided that the groundwater table is located at sufficiently large distance from the land surface nonetheless when dynamic infiltration does influence pfas leaching as a practical approach one may examine the impact of varying infiltration rates by comparing results from a range of simulations that cover the common or possible ranges

209,a growing body of site investigations have demonstrated that vadose zones serve as significant long term sources of pfas to groundwater quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater is therefore critical for characterizing managing and mitigating long term contamination risks mathematical models representing the pfas specific transport and retention processes including surfactant induced flow and rate limited nonlinear adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces have been recently developed while these advanced models provide fundamental insights into the primary processes controlling the long term retention of pfas they are less suitable for screening type applications due to significant computational cost and the requirement for detailed input parameters to address this knowledge gap we develop a simplified model by assuming steady state infiltration and linear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption a two domain model is used to represent kinetic solid phase adsorption we derive novel analytical solutions for the simplified model allowing for arbitrary initial conditions the newly derived analytical solutions are then validated by application to miscible displacement experiments under a wide range of conditions and by comparisons to a state of the art comprehensive model under both experimental and field conditions applicable to pfas contamination sites overall the simplified analytical model provides an efficient and accurate screening type tool for quantifying long term pfas leaching in the vadose zone graphical abstract keywords per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas leaching interfacial adsorption analytical solution rate limited adsorption unsaturated zone 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have become emerging contaminants of critical concern large scale manufacturing and wide use of pfas since the 1940s have led to their ubiquitous presence in the environment including surface water soils sediments and groundwater a growing body of site investigations have established that vadose zones are significant pfas reservoirs that pose long term threats for contaminating groundwater even several decades after the contamination events were stopped xiao et al 2015 weber et al 2017 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al

column experiments under a wide range of conditions el ouni et al 2021 brusseau et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 and applied to simulate long term pfas leaching at a model fire training area site guo et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 the simulated strong retention of pfas in the shallow vadose zone is consistent with many prior field observations e g anderson et al 2019 dauchy et al 2019 høisæter et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 shortly thereafter a model similar to that of guo et al 2020 was independently reported by silva et al 2020 rate limited adsorption was not considered where example simulations were presented in one and two dimensions more recently zeng and guo 2021 extended the model formulations of guo et al 2020 to three dimensions and examined the impact of surfactant induced flow and preferential flow on long term pfas leaching in heterogeneous vadose zones while the comprehensive models discussed above provide fundamental insights into the primary processes controlling the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone their complexity and the associated significant computational cost make them less suitable for practical screening type application at field contamination sites such as for developing initial strategies for characterizing managing and mitigating pfas contamination risks based on limited site information screening type analysis usually employs much simpler analytical or semi analytical models that are computationally efficient and do not need detailed information for the input parameters and site conditions such simple models have been previously demonstrated as useful screening tools for guiding remediation strategies and determining regulatory standards for non pfas contaminants examples include the epa spreadsheet model for subsurface vapor intrusion us epa 2017 and remchlor md for modeling long term matrix diffusion of chlorinated solvent in aquifers falta et al 2018 however similar simple models for quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater are to date not available in the present work we address this knowledge gap by developing a simplified model for pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone that allows for analytical solutions specifically our model formulation assumes steady state infiltration and simplifies the transport processes by linearizing the nonlinear terms for adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces additionally rate limited adsorption at the solid water interfaces is represented by a two domain kinetic model new analytical solutions derived for the simplified model are validated by application to miscible displacement experiments for multiple pfas under a wide range of conditions as well as via comparisons to simulations produced with a comprehensive numerical model under both experimental and field conditions to the best of our knowledge the analytical solutions presented here are the first for solute transport that account for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption finally we present a workflow to demonstrate the application of the simplified models for analyzing long term pfas leaching in the vadose zone 2 mathematical model and simplifications we present the mathematical model from simplifying both the variably saturated flow and pfas transport processes represented in the model formulations of guo et al 2020 2 1 water flow we consider water flow driven by steady state infiltration in the vertical dimension of a homogeneous vadose zone water in the vadose zone is assumed unsaturated with a spatially uniform saturation i e h z 0 where h is the water pressure head and the unsaturated water flow q cm s is driven only by gravity assuming that z is positive downward from darcy s law q k z h z we obtain 1 q k where k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm s which can be approximated as an empirical function of the volumetric water content θ here we present the widely used empirical function proposed by mualem 1976 and van genuchten 1980 as an example 2 k θ k s s w e λ 1 1 s w e 1 m m 2 where k s is the saturated conductivity cm s s w e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective water saturation where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water contents cm 3 cm 3 respectively λ and m are empirical parameters λ can vary for different soil media though it is often set to 0 5 for simplicity m is related to the pore size distribution of the soil media and can be determined by fitting the soil water characteristic function of van genuchten 1980 to measured datasets we note that alternative models for k such as the equations proposed by kosugi 1999 may also be employed the kosugi model was shown to match better the measured unsaturated water conductivity than eq 2 for some soil media 2 2 transport of pfas transport of pfas in the vertical dimension of a vadose zone may be described by an advection dispersion equation

isotherm was reported to range from 0 75 to 1 1 for multiple pfas in a wide range of soils and sediments higgins and luthy 2006 guelfo and higgins 2013 van glubt et al 2020 a recent study showed that the fitted exponent parameter ranged from 0 64 to 1 27 median 0 82 and mean 0 85 for pfos in 114 tropical and temperate soils umeh et al 2021 because the present study focuses on formulating a simplified model for which analytical solutions can be derived we assume that the solid phase adsorption can be approximated by a linear isotherm kinetics associated with solid phase adsorption were shown to be present in both batch and miscible displacement experiments brusseau et al 2019a guelfo et al 2020 schaefer et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 guelfo et al 2020 and schaefer et al 2021 suggested that kinetic solid phase adsorption is only present in real soils with organic carbon or clay content greater than 0 we use a two domain model to represent kinetic solid phase adsorption i e c s c s 1

miscible displacement experiments using soil packed columns have demonstrated that the kinetics associated with air water interfacial adsorption is minimal under steady state flow conditions brusseau 2020 brusseau et al 2021 we thus assume equilibrium air water interfacial adsorption the adsorption at air water interfaces c a w in eq 3 is the product of the surface excess γ μ mol cm 2 and the air

retardation from solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption respectively for pfas migration in the vadose zone we consider the following initial and boundary conditions for eqs 10 and 5 assuming

water interfacial area a a w in eq 6 in soils is comprised of two types including capillary interfaces associated with menisci between bulk air and water and film related interfaces associated with wetting films surrounding grain surfaces both of which are relevant for pfas transport as demonstrated by prior miscible displacement experiments lyu et al 2018 2020 brusseau et al 2019b 2021 li et al 2021 brusseau and guo 2021 the combination of the two i e the total air water interfacial area is considered in the present study the total a a w usually increases as s w decreases we approximate a a

leverett 1941 morrow 1970 bradford and leij 1997 the thermodynamic based method is described in more detail in section 5 and employed for the soil media therein 3 analytical solutions we derive new analytical solutions for eqs 5 and 10 subject to the initial and boundary conditions of eqs 11 14 using the laplace transform similar derivation procedures were reported in the literature for solute transport in the presence of kinetic solid phase adsorption with no air water interfacial adsorption lindstrom and narasimham 1973 van genuchten and wagenet 1989 toride et al 1993 we therefore only present the final form of the analytical solutions with the detailed and rather tedious derivation steps omitted to the best of our knowledge the analytical solution reported here is the first that accounts for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption for convenience we define the following dimensionless variables and parameters t v t l t 0 v t 0 l z z l p v l d ω s α s 1 β s 1 r s l v where l is an arbitrary distance from the land surface which is taken as the depth of the vadose zone in the present study and β s 1 f s r s 1 r s ω s is often referred

simplified when kinetic solid phase adsorption is not considered in that case f s 1 c s 2 0 j a 1 b 1 1 and a z t can be integrated analytically the analytical solution for this special case with no kinetic solid phase adsorption is presented in appendix 2 the simplified model in section 2 is more general than the analytical solutions presented in section 3 because the transport equation eq 10 can involve spatial heterogeneities for example the solid phase adsorption coefficient k d can be a depth dependent function to reflect the change of sorption capacities along depth e g decrease of organic carbon content along the soil profile additionally the more general freundlich nonlinear adsorption model can also be used for representing solid phase adsorption however the presence of nonlinearities and heterogeneities would generally prevent the transport equation from being solved analytically 4 model validation and evaluation we validate the simplified analytical model by simulating breakthrough curves measured in multiple miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature and by conducting simulations of pfas leaching in the vadose zone at a model fire training area site under field relevant conditions the analytical based simulations are in both cases compared to numerical solutions of the full process model of guo et al 2020 4 1 simulating miscible displacement experiments we simulate three sets of pfas unsaturated miscible displacement experiments reported in the literature all of the experiments were conducted using columns packed with a commercially available natural quartz sand unimin corp referred to as accusand which has a mean grain diameter of 0 35 mm and a total organic carbon content of 0 04 aggregated data for the air water interfacial area under a wide range of water saturations for accusand were summarized in jiang et al 2020 the air water interfacial area measured by aqueous interfacial tracer methods was fitted to a second degree polynomial function of water saturation eq 15 x 2 548 54 x 1 1182 5 x 0 633 96 by guo et al 2020 and is employed here for simulating the experiments the first set of experiments were conducted for pfoa at three different input concentrations 0 01 0 1 and 1 mg l but only the arrival fronts of the breakthrough curves were measured lyu et al 2018 the second set of experiments was conducted for pfos at an input concentration of 0 1 mg l brusseau et al 2021 the third set of experiments was conducted for hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da also known as genx at an input concentration of 10 mg l yan et al 2020 full breakthrough curves were measured for both the second and third sets of experiments the water saturation of the sand column was 0 68 0 68 and 0 64 for the three sets of experiments respectively all of the miscible displacement experiments were conducted using a background electrolyte solution of 0 01 m nacl solution the surface tension of the nacl solution with no pfas is σ 0 71 4 dyn cm the szyskowski parameters for the five pfas in the nacl solution are pfba a 4702 6 mg l b 0 19 pfhxa a 502 1 mg l b 0 17 pfoa a 78 6 mg l b 0 2 pfos a 5 mg l b 0 1 genx a 109 mg l b 0 1 the hydraulic parameters of the sand were measured in the lab and were reported in guo et al 2020 the solid phase adsorption parameters were determined from transport experiments conducted under water saturated conditions it is important to point out that all of the parameters are determined independently with no fitting or calibration thus the model simulations are predictions of the experiments and comparisons between the simulations and measurements represent a direct validation test of the model the experimental data and the simulations from both the simplified analytical model and the full process numerical model are presented in fig 1 the flux averaged concentration at the outlet is used in the analytical solution the results show that the predictions from both the analytical and numerical models agree well with the experimental data the case that sees some deviation is pfoa with an input concentration of 0 1 mg l in the first set of experiments this may be caused by variability in the kinetics of the solid phase adsorption among the three columns in this set of experiments the kinetic parameters were determined from one of the columns under saturated condition and then employed for all three columns the comparisons in the semi log plots d f are generally consistent with those in the arithmetic plots a c the low concentration data points at approximately 0 2 pore volume for pfoa d and 17 pore volumes for genx f are near the detection limit of the analytical method and hence may not be accurate some deviation between the model simulations and the experimental data is observed for the two data points at approximately 12 and 13 pore volumes for genx this deviation indicates that there may be nonideal adsorption kinetics that are not captured by the two domain kinetic sorption model employed in the simulations according to the data and analysis presented in brusseau et al 2019a this long tailing behavior observed for genx is most likely caused by nonideal adsorption at the solid surfaces we would like to point out that guelfo et al 2020 using a similar sand but with a total organic carbon content of 0 concluded that the solid phase adsorption is not rate limited under the conditions examined in their experiments it is interesting that the analytical solutions are almost identical to the numerical solutions from the full process model for all of the experiments this implies that the additional processes included in the full process model have a minimal impact on pfas transport under the specific conditions employed in the experiments i e relatively low input concentrations these observations are consistent with the results reported in brusseau et al 2021 which concluded that surfactant induced flow and nonlinearity in air water interfacial adsorption are insignificant under those miscible displacement experimental conditions when the input concentration is sufficiently blow the critical reference concentration i e the concentration corresponding to 2 5 of reduction in surface tension given that the simulations are predictions with no parameter fitting the excellent agreement with the experimental data and the full process numerical model demonstrates the validity of the simplified analytical model for representing the transport processes of pfas in water unsaturated miscible displacement experiments 4 2 simulating pfas retention and leaching at a model afff impacted fire training area site we further evaluate the simplified analytical model by comparing it to the full process numerical model for simulating long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone under field relevant conditions we consider a model aqueous film forming foam afff impacted fire training area site with a 30 year contamination period pfas are being released to the vadose zone due to regular fire training activities and a 50 year post contamination period fire training activities are stopped and no additional pfas are being released to the vadose zone a 4 m deep vadose zone is assumed homogeneous and is composed of one of two porous media accusand and vinton soil for which extensive prior laboratory measurements are available the detailed hydraulic and transport parameters for accusand and vinton soil were reported in guo et al 2020 we consider four representative pfas including two short chain compounds pfpea and pfhxs and two long chain compounds pfoa and pfos as suggested by guo et al 2020 based on standard practices at fire training area sites the fire training is assumed to occur every ten days with each training lasting for 30 mins leading to a total infiltration of 0 0458 cm of diluted afff solution per training session pfas composition in afff varies among different products and in different years houtz et al 2013 here we adopt the composition reported in høisæter et al 2019 for a commercial afff with a 1 100 dilution the concentrations for pfpea pfhxs pfoa and pfos are 0 23 7 1 0 9 and 100 mg l respectively the surface tension data for the pfas measured in synthetic groundwater are used to determine the szyskowski parameters which are presented together with other pfas in section 5 table 2 similar to the simulations reported in guo et al 2020 rainfall and evapotranspiration data measured at 30 min resolution from a site in arizona az and a site in new jersey nj downloaded from the ameriflux database url https ameriflux lbl gov are used to represent semiarid and humid regions respectively both models consider a one dimensional domain along the vertical dimension of the vadose zone the numerical model employs a uniform grid δ z 1 cm free drainage i e normal gradient of capillary pressure is zero and zero dispersion i e advective flux only are assumed at the bottom boundary the full process model accounts for surfactant induced flow rate limited and nonlinear solid phase adsorption and rate limited and nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption guo et al 2020 the coupled richards equation and nonlinear advection dispersion equation are solved in a fully implicit numerical framework by newton raphson iterations further details about the model setup and numerical algorithms for the full process model can be found in guo et al 2020 for the simplified analytical model we need to make three simplifications to represent the field conditions 1 since the analytical solution can only represent steady state infiltration we take the average annual net infiltration rate computed from the numerical simulations and convert it to steady state infiltration 2 we also need to compute the average pfas infiltration and convert it to steady state infiltration during the active contamination period 3 finally the nonlinear solid phase adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption both need to be linearized the linear solid phase adsorption coefficients k d k f c r e p n 1 are computed at representative concentration values see table 1 while the constant air water interfacial adsorption coefficient k a w is computed at c 0 mg l for simplicity comparisons between the simulations from the simplified analytical model and the full process numerical model are presented in figs 2 and 3 despite the various assumptions employed by the analytical model the simplified analytical model agrees well with the full process numerical model for the simulated retention i e mass remaining in the vadose zone and cumulative mass discharge to groundwater fig 2 as well as the time dependent spatial profiles of pfas concentrations in the vadose zone fig 3 an exception is pfos where the simplified analytical model substantially underestimates the leaching compared to the full process numerical model the underestimated leaching observed for pfos may be attributed to two of the assumptions made in the simplified analytical model 1 steady state infiltration and 2 linear air water interfacial adsorption while transient variably saturated flow due to time dependent rainfall infiltration does not substantially change water saturation at deeper locations in the vadose zone it leads to significant changes in the water saturation near the land surface the increases in water saturation during rainfall events destroy air water interfaces and reduce air water interfacial adsorption which then leads to accelerated leaching of pfas this phenomenon has a more significant impact on the leaching of pfos because it is more strongly retained in soils and stays in the shallow vadose zone for a longer period of time a close inspection also reveals that the impact of transient infiltration has a greater impact during the active contamination period because transient infiltration dynamically redistributes the released pfas near the land surface this is not accounted for in the simplified analytical model so its simulated concentration profiles deviate from those simulated by the full process model during the active contamination period t 30 years especially near the land surface concomitantly the release concentration of pfos 100 mg l is the highest among the four pfas which leads to stronger nonlinear air water interfacial adsorption therefore using the maximum k a w 0 048 cm 3 cm 2 i e c 0 mg l in the analytical solution underestimates leaching of pfos in the vadose zone to further illustrate the influence of the two assumptions discussed above and to explore ways to improve the prediction of the simplified analytical model we conduct two sets of additional simulations for pfos using the simplified analytical model the first set of simulations uses k a w 0 038 cm 3 cm 2 corresponding to a representative aqueous concentration in the vadose zone c r e p 1 mg l the representative concentration is estimated from the original simulated plume i e assuming maximum k a w note that the representative aqueous concentration in the vadose zone is substantially lower than the release concentration 100 mg l for pfos this is because the majority of the pfos is adsorbed at the solid water and air water interfaces leaving only a small fraction in the aqueous phase the second set of simulations in addition to using k a w at a representative concentration uses the solution of the full process numerical model at t 30 years as the initial condition and only focuses on simulating post contamination comparisons between the two additional simulations with the original simulations are presented in fig 4 the scenario for accusand and nj climate is used as an example the results show that using the representative k a w leads to greater leaching and a better agreement with the full process numerical model see the first two rows of fig 4 the post contamination simulation that uses the 30 year solution of the full process numerical model as the initial condition further improves the prediction of the simplified analytical model the above results and analysis demonstrate that the deviations observed for pfos in figs 2 and 3 are indeed in part caused by the steady state infiltration and linear air water interfacial assumptions employed in the original simulations furthermore the simplified analytical model can be improved by using a representative aqueous concentration to compute k a w and when simulating post contamination which would be the case for most of the legacy contamination sites we point out that the pfas contamination scenarios considered here afff impacted fire training area sites are among the pfas source zones with the highest concentrations as demonstrated by many prior field investigations e g anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020 pfas concentrations at other source zones including agricultural lands that receive pfas contaminated biosolids and irrigation water and wastewater treatment plant sites are often several orders of magnitude lower e g brusseau et al 2020 therefore it is expected that the linear air water interfacial adsorption employed in the simplified analytical model would be more appropriate for other source zones compared to the simulations presented here for the afff impacted fire training area sites finally we note that there is an ongoing debate as to whether the air water interfacial adsorption can be considered linear at lower concentrations schaefer et al 2019a 2020 arshadi et al 2020 i e whether eq 9 or another equation that represents freundlich adsorption should be used to compute the air water interfacial coefficient some additional data and analyses were recently added to this discussion brusseau 2021 reported that the air water interfacial adsorption of two hydrocarbon surfactants sds and sdbs determined by eq 9 matches with the air water interfacial adsorption measured directly by neutron reflectometry for concentrations down to lower than 10 5 m in another study brusseau et al 2021 employed miscible displacement data of pfoa at a concentration of c 1 μ g l and showed that the air water interfacial coefficient computed from the experimental breakthrough curve matches well with that determined by eq 9 nevertheless further research and data are needed to test the potential nonlinearity of air water interfacial adsorption at lower concentrations for a wider range of pfas and under a broader range of conditions 5 demonstration of model application we present a workflow to demonstrate how to employ the simplified analytical model as a screening tool for analyzing pfas retention and leaching at field contamination sites we take a model afff impacted fire training area site as an example for the demonstration suppose we are interested in quantifying the leaching of nine representative pfas varying in headgroups and chain lengths six pfcas and three perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids pfsas in a homogeneous vadose zone represented by six soils the annual net water recharge rate is assumed 30 cm similar to the scenarios considered in section 4 2 we consider an active contamination period of 30 years followed by 50 years of post contamination for the nine pfas the szyskowski parameters for the surface tension in synthetic groundwater silva et al 2019 2021 molecular weights and the release concentrations from a diluted afff solution høisæter et al 2019 are provided in table 2 the six soils include sand soil 1 sandy loam soil 2 two loams soils 3 4 sandy clay soil 5 and a sandy clay loam soil 6 for the present study the solid phase adsorption coefficients for the six soils were measured for the nine pfas nguyen et al 2020 and are summarized in table 3 if no measured solid phase adsorption coefficients are available they may be estimated using the so called distributed sorption models that represent the contribution of individual soil constituents soil organic carbon clay minerals metal oxides to the total sorption the distributed sorption models can implicitly represent the different potential sorption mechanisms such as hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and have been developed and applied for quantifying the solid phase adsorption of pfoa and pfos in soil media higgins and luthy 2007 knight et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the hydraulic parameters for the six soils are not available and are estimated see table 4 using the rosetta pedotransfer model zhang and schaap 2017 based on soil texture and bulk density reported in nguyen et al 2020 no measurements of air water interfacial area are available for the soils one approach is to employ the thermodynamic based method to estimate the air water interfacial area as a function of water saturation leverett 1941 morrow 1970 bradford and leij 1997 the thermodynamic based method assumes that the mechanical work done for fluid fluid displacement is fully converted to surface energy i e generating air water interfaces as a result the air water interfacial area can be estimated by computing the area under the capillary pressure water saturation curve as 30 a a w ϕ σ s w 1 p c s w d s w where ϕ is the porosity of the soil σ is the surface tension and p c is the capillary pressure prior studies have shown that the thermodynamic based method significantly underestimates the air water interfacial area compared to that measured by aqueous interfacial tracers jiang et al 2020 but the latter was suggested to be more relevant for pfas transport in the vadose zone brusseau and guo 2021 here we employ a scaling method to correct the estimated air water interfacial area estimated from the thermodynamic based method we take the vinton soil introduced in section 4 2 to compute the ratio between the a a w estimated from the thermodynamic based method and the measured a a w by aqueous interfacial tracer the ratio varies from 3 89 to 4 41 for the entire saturation range as an approximation the mean ratio 4 15 is applied to correct the air water interfacial area for the six soils when computing the thermodynamic based a a w the surface tension σ in eq 30 is taken as the surface tension with no dissolved pfas note that because parameters for kinetic solid phase adsorption are not available kinetic solid phase adsorption is not accounted for in these simulations the simulated pfas retention in the vadose zone is presented in fig 5 for the nine pfas in the six soils the results clearly demonstrate that the retention of pfas vary strongly with different chain lengths and functional groups for both pfcas and pfsas the longer chain pfas are much more strongly retained in the vadose zone than their shorter chain counterparts which is consistent with the increasing solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption for longer chain pfas while variations in the retention of a given pfas exist among the six soils the difference between the soils is not significant except for soil 2 which has the strongest retention due to its much stronger solid phase adsorption the similar retention among the soils is in part caused by the same net recharge rate 30 cm per year employed for all of the six soils at field sites the net recharge rate will likely change with different soils in the vadose zone as a result of different surface evaporation rates due to different water retention capacities for example this was the case for the accusand and vinton soil employed in section 4 2 where their net recharge rates differ by almost 2 times this also implies that it is critical to obtain a more accurate estimate of the net recharge rate for improved prediction of pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone when applying the simplified analytical model another way to analyze the strength of retention is to compare the retardation factors among different pfas and soils the computed retardation factors are presented in fig 6 from which we can make the following observations consistent with the retention behavior shown in fig 5 the retardation factors increase with chain length for the same soil the retardation factors for the short chain pfas pfpea pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs are smaller than 10 for all soils except for pfhpa in soil 1 sand that has a retardation factor of 11 1 comparisons among the soils reveal that for the longer chain pfas the retardation factors for soil 1 sand and soil 2 sandy loam are greater than the other finer grain soils the reason for this rather counterintuitive observation is that for a given infiltration rate the finer grain soils have a much higher water saturation that leads to a much smaller air water interfacial area this then leads to reduced air water interfacial adsorption and total retention of pfas in the vadose zone comprised of finer grain soils overall the above workflow and analyses demonstrate that the simplified analytical model provides a computationally efficient means to quantify pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater 6 summary and conclusion we present a simplified model for quantifying pfas leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater the model assumes steady state infiltration and linear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption rate limited solid phase adsorption is represented by a two domain kinetic model air water interfacial adsorption is assumed instantaneous i e equilibrium new analytical solutions for the simplified model are derived that allow for arbitrary initial conditions these analytical solutions are the first that account for the two domain solid phase kinetic adsorption and air water interfacial adsorption for solute transport while the model formulation involves a number of simplifications predicted simulations using the analytical solution agree well with a wide range of sand packed miscible displacement experiments for pfas under water unsaturated conditions for these experiments the analytical solution is almost identical to the solution from a numerical model that accounts for a set of comprehensive pfas specific transport processes including surfactant induced flow and rate limited and nonlinear adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces these comparisons demonstrate the validity of the simplified model and the analytical solution for representing the pfas specific transport processes under laboratory conditions the simplified model is then compared to the full process numerical model for simulating long term pfas leaching at a model afff impacted fire training area site despite that several processes and conditions are not represented in the simplified model e g surfactant induced flow time dependent infiltration and evapotranspiration and nonlinearity in the solid water and air water interfacial adsorption close agreement is observed between the simplified analytical and full process numerical models in their simulated long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater practically the analytical solution provides a simple approach for estimating pfas retention and leaching in the vadose zone and mass discharge to groundwater at pfas contamination sites this screening type tool allows stakeholders and practitioners to develop quantitative guidance for characterizing managing and mitigating the long term risks of pfas contamination in particular because the simplified model can be solved analytically 1 000s of simulations can be easily conducted for a given problem using a wide range of input parameters these simulations can be used to quantify the uncertainty propagated from the input parameters to the final predictions and also to gain critical insights into the primary parameters or factors that control the long term risks of pfas contamination at sites in addition to the computationally focused analyses this screening type tool can also be combined with direct measurements of soil porewater concentrations proposed in a recent perspective by anderson 2021 for quantifying soil to groundwater mass discharge and providing remedial guidance at pfas contamination sites the simplified model is nevertheless limited by the imposed assumptions here we briefly discuss the limitations and propose strategies that may be employed to partially address these limitations when applying the model to analyze practical problems for example the analytical solution is unable to simulate pfas leaching in the presence of spatial heterogeneities such as soil layering that can lead to both heterogeneous hydraulic and sorption properties zeng and guo 2021 the impact of heterogeneities may be indirectly accounted for by conducting a range of simulations using different soil types relevant to a specific site these simulations can be used to provide upper and lower bounds for the estimates of pfas leaching and mass discharge similarly since the analytical solution is derived under steady state infiltration it cannot represent the impact of dynamic infiltration on pfas leaching however the simulation results presented in section 4 2 show that the simulated pfas leaching by assuming steady state flow agrees well with those generated by the full process numerical model that accounts for highly dynamic infiltration rates from real rainfall data at a 30 min temporal resolution while only homogeneous vadose zones are considered in section 4 2 a prior study by russo and fiori 2008 suggested that assuming steady state flow is sufficient for predicting solute transport even in heterogeneous vadose zones note that a non surfactant solute in the absence of complex retention processes was considered therein provided that the groundwater table is located at sufficiently large distance from the land surface nonetheless when dynamic infiltration does influence pfas leaching as a practical approach one may examine the impact of varying infiltration rates by comparing results from a range of simulations that cover the common or possible ranges
