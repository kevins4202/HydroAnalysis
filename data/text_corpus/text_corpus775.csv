3875,based on the back analysis of equivalent continuum theory in frcatued media by snow 1969 an equivalent fracture network model is proposed to evaluate steady seepage problems with free surface in porous media in contrast to the continuum based approaches on seepage flow the continuum is replaced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures the relationships between the permeability coefficients of porous media and equivalent parameters of fracture dip spacing and aperture are deduced the corresponding governing equations and finite element procedure according to the variational inequality theory are developed through good agreements of free surface locations between the proposed method numerical data and field measurement in four typical examples the proposed equivalent fracture network model is validated in modelling free surface flow in porous media the solutions on the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams show that the proposed model has weak sensitivity of the fracture dip and mesh size and its equivalence to the continuum based method is also proved in addition the proposed model can be successfully used for the fractured media as well as porous media the fracture direction has a significant impact on the free surface flow behavior in the fractured media in which the fracture directions are negative for the antidip slope and positive for the dip slope to drain ground water finally the results from the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model in complex dam engineerings with isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneity media keywords free surface equivalent fracture network continuum numerical simulation 1 introduction seepage problems with free surfaces are of great importance and interest in dam engineering chen et al 2011 2016 underground engineering ren et al 2016 wang et al 2016 and slope engineering ye et al 2017 li and li 2019 yao et al 2019 for the heterogeneity media with arbitrary geometry boundaries it is arduous to obtain analytical solutions for these problems therefore a number of numerical procedures have been developed to simulate seepage flow in porous media so far numerical models applied to solve seepage problems with free surfaces can be classified into two categories the continuum based approaches and the equivalent pipe network representations in the continuum based approaches the porous media including numerous solid grains and pores is homogenized as a continuum associated with the representative elementary volume in which the seepage flow is governed by the darcy s law and continuity equation in consideration of the uncertainty of the free surface and seepage point a wide range of numerical procedures have been developed based on finite element neuman and witherspoon 1970 bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 desai and li 1983 finite difference bardet and tobita 2002 numerical manifold zheng et al 2015 boundary element wu et al 1996 natural element jie et al 2013 variational inequality lacy and prevost 1987 zheng et al 2009 chen et al 2011 methods for the adaptive mesh methods the free surface should be initialized and modified iteratively neuman and witherspoon 1970 conversely the fixed mesh methods apply a heuristic iterative procedure to locate free surface and eliminate the flow in the dry domain such as the permeability adjustment method bathe and khoshgoftaar 1979 the residual flow method desai and li 1983 and the initial flow method zheng et al 2005 however the flow domain should be divided into finite elements for numerical analysis of free surface flow and the relatively time consuming meshing differential discretization of governing equations or element integration are required xu et al 2014 the alternative way to solve the seepage problems with free surface is based on the equivalent pipe network model in which the continuum is conceptualized as a pipe networks and computational efficiency can be highly improved through the reduction of the problems to a one dimensional system in solution space in recent years great progress has been made in modeling seepage flow in which the linear and nonlinear free surface flow behavior through the porous and fractured media were investigated by xu et al 2014 ren et al 2016 afzali and monadjemi 2014 abareshi et al 2017 moosavian 2019 and xiong et al 2020 2021 in addition the equivalent pipe network model is also extended to analyze co2 sequestration ren et al 2017 wormhole propagation chen et al 2018a and evaluation of geothermal development chen et al 2018b in complicated geological media however for the two dimensional seepage problems only triangular elements can be processed by the equivalent pipe network model and the equivalent hydraulic parameters depend on the shapes of triangles and limited by the isotropic material when the triangular elements are cut by the free surface auxiliary pipes are required to maintain the wetting and dry domain around the free surface to be triangle ren et al 2016 thus the mesh needs to be updated through iterative process until convergence is reached different from conventional equivalent pipe network models ye at al 2020 2021 proposed an orthogonal pipe network model to evaluate the steady and unsteady seepage flow with free surfaces in porous media in which the homogeneous porous media is represented by a network of horizontal and vertical straight pipes lines on the basis of representative elementary volume in addition there is no mesh dependency during free surface iteration mathematically only flow and gradient coincide with the principal axes of permeability will the orthogonal pipe network model be validated the general formulations between the equivalent hydraulic parameters and the full second rank tensor of permeability coefficient are not derived explicitly in theory the major objective of this study is to address these issues as the extension of our previous work using principal permeability coefficient a new equivalent fracture network model with full tensor of permeability coefficient for steady seepage flow with free surface is proposed based on the back analysis of equivalent continuum theory by snow 1969 the basic partial differential equations of steady seepage flow with free surface is described in section 2 the hydraulic equivalence between the fracture network model and porous media is proved and the equivalent geometric parameters of two fracture sets are derived as functions of permeability coefficients in section 3 a numerical procedure based on finite element implementation of the variational inequality theory is suggested to garantee the numerical staibility in section 4 validation of the proposed equivalent fracture network model is estimated by four typical examples with free surface flow including the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the fractured rock slope the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam in section 5 2 basic theory for steady seepage problems with free surfaces considering a control volume in the porous medium domain as shown in fig 1 the porous medium composed of solid grains and pores is conceptualized as a two dimensional homogeneous conutniuum on the macroscopic scale based on the traditional continuum approach the seepage flow can occur through the whole domain occupied by solid grains and pores bear 1972 the steady state impressible seepage flow through porous media follow the continuity

permeability coefficients ϕ p z is the hydraulic head the sum of the pressure head p and elevation z h ϕ z is a heaviside function 3 h ϕ z 1 if ϕ z 0 0 if ϕ z 0 which indicates that the seepage flow is confined in the wet domain below the free surface and water flow in the dry domain above the the free surface is neglected in mathematics zheng et al 2005 2009 chen et al 2011 the boundary conditions for this boudary value problem can be expressed as 1 the water head boundary condition 4 ϕ ϕ on ab and cd where ϕ is the prescribed water head the upstream boundary ab is assigned with ϕ 1 and the downstream boundary cd with ϕ 2 respectively 2 the flux boundary condition 5 q n v x n x v z n z q on bc where q is the prescribed flux on bc nx and nz are the cosine of the outward unit normal vector to the boundary for an impermeable boundary q 0 3 the signorini type of seepage face boundary 6 ϕ z q n 0 ϕ z q n 0 on de and agfe 4 the free surface boundary 7 ϕ z q n 0 on ae 3 equivalent fracture network model based on the mathematical studies of extensive fracture systems in the fractured rock with an impervious matrix by snow 1969 the equivalent permeability tensor of fracture networks can be quantified by each individual fracture with arbitrary dip spacing and aperture and proceed to determine the hydraulic behavior when the fracture networks behave like a homogeneous porous medium conversely the flow domain of the two dimensional homogeneous porous medium in this study is reproduced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures with constant dip spacing and aperture as shown in fig 2 in the equivalent fracture network model it is assumed that seepage flow only occurs in fractures while the surrounding matrix is impermeable each individual fracture is supposed as a pair of smooth parallel plate conduit the fluid flow through the fractures is governed by the well known cubic law snow 1969 thus the flow velocity vf in the single fractures with aperture b can be expressed as 8 v f λ h ϕ z k f λ ϕ l g b λ 2 12 υ ϕ l where λ denotes the number of fracture sets λ 1 for fracture set 1 and λ 2 for fracture set 2 v f λ is the equivalent permeability coefficient of the single fractures g is gravitational acceleration υ is the fluid kinematic viscosity l is the local coordinate system parallel to fracture direction ϕ l is the hydraulic head gradient parallel to fracture direction when the dip angle of fracture sets 1 and 2 are specified as α 1 and α 2 the hydraulic head gradient parallel to the fracture direction ϕ l can be rewritten as 9 ϕ l ϕ x x l ϕ z z l ϕ x cos α λ ϕ z sin α λ substituting eq 9 into eq 8 gives 10 v f λ h ϕ z g b λ 2 12 υ ϕ x cos α λ ϕ z sin α λ the velocity components

gives 17 k x k z f 1 f 2 based on the double angle formulas eqs 13 and 14 can be represented as 18 2 k x f 1 cos 2 α 1 1 f 2 cos 2 α 2 1 19 2 k xz f 1 sin 2 α 1 f 2 sin 2 α 2 combing eqs 18 and 19 the following equation can be obtained in terms of α1 20 2 k x f 1 cos 2 α 1 1 f 2 f 2 2 2 k xz f 1 sin 2 α 1 f 2 2 1 inserting eq 17 into eq 20 the equivalent hydraulic parameter f1 of fracture set 1 can be derived as follows 21 f 1 k x k z k xz 2 k x sin 2 α 1 k xz sin 2 α 1 k z cos 2 α 1 from eq 17 the equivalent hydraulic parameter f2 of fracture set 2 is 22 f 2 k x k z f 1 based on eq 16 the equivalent apertures of fracture sets 1 and 2 can be expressed as 23 b 1 12 υ b 1 f 1 g 1 3 b 2 12 υ b 2 f 2 g 1 3 for a given dip angle α1 of fracture sets 1 the equivalent dip angle α2 of fracture

kxz and kz of the porous media and equivalent parameters b 1 b 2 and α 2 of the related fracture network model when the permeability coefficients kx kxz and kz the fracture spacings b 1 and b 2 and the dip angle α 1 of fracture set 1 are specified eqs 23 and 24 are applied to calculate equivalent apertures and the dip angle α 2 of fracture set 2 4 numerical procedure in the equivalent fracture network model the porous media is discretized by connected fracture networks instead of two dimensional plane elements as a result of that the normal flux across the fracture is zero the continuity equation in the single fractures can be derived from eqs 1 and 8 as follows 25 v f l 0 based on the principle of mass conservation the total flux of inflow and outflow at the fracture intersection should be zero which can be expressed as 26 j q ij j b f v f 0 where qij is the flow flux through each fracture segment ij connected at intersection i as shown in fig 2 for the discrete fracture network model the water head boundary flux boundary seepage face boundary and free surface boundary become 27 ϕ i t ϕ on ab and cd 28 q ij b f v f q on bc 29 ϕ i z i q ij 0 ϕ i z i q ij 0 on de and agfe 30 ϕ i z i q ij 0 on ae in order to solve this boundary value problem associated with the equivalent fracture network model the distribution of hydraulic head in each fracture segment is approximated by the following linear shape function jiang et al 2013 2014 xu at al 2014 ren et al 2016 31 ϕ n i ϕ i n j ϕ j where ϕ i and ϕ j are the nodal hydraulic heads of the two endpoints ni and nj are the linear functions with n i 1 l l ij and n j l l ij lij is the length of the fracture segment nevertheless the position of free surface and seepage points are both uncertain a priori which is critical for steady seepage problems with free surfaces according to the variational inequality theory carried out by zheng et al 2009 and jiang et al 2013 the free surface boundary and singularity of seepage points can be transformed into the natural boundaries on the basis of a signorini type finite element formulations similar to zheng et al 2009 and jiang et al 2013 a continuous heaviside function h λ ϕ z is applied to overcome the numerical oscillation during finite element solution process instead of the discontinuous heaviside function h ϕ z 32 h λ ϕ z 1 if ϕ z 0 λ ϕ z λ if 0 ϕ z λ 0 if ϕ z λ by the finite element discretization to eq 31 the formulation of the equivalent fracture network model based on the discrete variational inequality can be described as seek a hydraulic head

where ε is a user specified error tolerance and take the value of 0 001 herein in which the numerical solutions agree closely with the empirical solution 5 applications in order to assess the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model numerical data of free surface flow analysis from three typical examples are employed the first example is used to verify the feasibility on solving free seepage problem in isotropic and anisotropic porous media of the proposed method with respect to solution accuracy and mesh independency the second example is performed to examine the capacity of the proposed method on seepage flow in the fractured rock slope with high permeable fractures where the effect of fracture dip is contained the third example is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method in complex dam engineering including the sensitivity of the permeability coefficient of the clay core the fourth example is employed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method in a pratical enginenring case with anisotropic heterogeneity media 5 1 isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the numerical solutions of free surface presented by jie et al 2013 are adopted to examine the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model in a rectangular dam with a height of 6 m and a length of 4 m in which the upstream and downstream water levels are 6 m and 1 m as shown in fig 3 a the bottom boundary is impermeable firstly the porous media is treated as isotropic kx kz 0 1 m d and kxz 0 to verify the effect of equivalent fracture dip on the seepage flow behavior the rectangular flow domain is meshed by two sets of artificial fractures with five different dips when the dip of one set α 1 ranges from 0 to 60 the dip of other set α 2 increases from 90 to 120 based on eq 24 the spacing size is b 1 b 2 0 1 m all the corresponding fracture equivalent apertures calculated from eq 23 are equal to 5 23 10 4m for different fracture sets fig 3 a shows comparison of free surface locations predicted by the proposed model and jie et al 2013 it can be seen that the predictions given by the proposed equivalent fracture network model are both highly consistent with the numerical solution from jie et al 2013 indicating that the location accuracy of free surfaces in isotropic media can be obtained from the equivalent fracture network with various dips the mesh dependence of the proposed equivalent fracture network model is also examined with three different mesh sizes b 1 b 2 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 2 m and same fracture dips α 1 0 and α 2 90 good agreements of free surface curves between the propsoed method and jie et al 2013 suggests that the proposed equivalent fracture network model has weak sensitivity of the mesh size secondly the dam treated as anisotropic with kx 5kz 0 5 m d and kxz 0 similar to the isotropic rectangular dam the locations of free surfaces predicted by the proposed equivalent fracture network model with different fracture dips and mesh sizes are plotted in fig 4 a and b respectively for different fracture dips the spacing sizes are both b 1 b 2 0 1 m for different mesh sizes the fracture dips are α 1 0 and α 2 90 because of no empirical solution on this anisotropic media previously the variational inequality methods proposed by zheng et al 2009 is applied to analyze the free surface seepage problem on the basis of quadrilateral elements of a uniform size 0 1 m 0 1 m and the related free surface curve is also illustrated in fig 4 it is found that the predictions for different fracture dips and mesh sizes are almost consistent and very close to the numerical solution obtained from zheng et al 2009 as a result the proposed equivalent fracture network model is reliable for free surface flow analysis in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams and its equivalence to the continuum based method is also proved by the good agreements with the numerical solutions presented by jie et al 2013 and zheng et al 2009 based on eqs 21 24 and its applications in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the following two properties for equivalent fracture dip can be stated as 1 for the isotropic media the dips of two equivalent fracture sets must be orthogonal or α 1 α 2 90 2 for the anisotropic media the dip of one equivalent fracture set must be parallel to one principal axis of permeability if the dip of the other set is parallel to the other principal axis of permeability as a result of that there is kxz 0 and kx kz in isotropic media eqs 21 22 give f 1 f 2 kx and then lead to α 2 arccot tanα 1 thus we get α 1 α 2 90 and property 1 holds for simplicity suppose that kxz 0 and one principal axis of permeability and fracture dip are both coincided with x axis there is α 1 0 inserting eq 21 and α 1 0 into eq 24 yields α 2 arccot 0 thus the corresponding dip of other set is 90 and property 2 is also valid therefore no matter the isotropic media or the anisotropic media can be easily replaced by an equivalent orthogonal fracture network where the dips of two fracture sets are parallel to the two principal axes of permeability respectively 5 2 seepage flow in the fractured rock slope the second example including a trapezoidal slope reported by lacy and prevost 1987 is employed to investigate the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model on free surface seepage through fractured porous media a rock slope with a height of 5 m and a length of 7 m is shown in fig 5 a and the bottom boundary is impervious the upstream and downstream water levels are 5 m and 1 m respectively the permeability coefficient of rock matrix is 1 16 10 8m s it is supposed that there is one set of fracture with trace length of 1 5 m gap of 0 2 m and spacing of 1 m embedded in the rock slope to assess the effect of fracture dip on free surface seepage in the fractured rock slope fracture patterns with various dips from 30 to 150 and constant aperture 0 1 mm are considered during numerical analysis the low permeability rock matrix is meshed by two orthogonal sets of artifical fractures with constant spacing size of 0 05 m and the high permeability fractures is directly simulated by interconnected fracture segment based on the cubic law eq 8 fig 5 b shows comparison of free surface locations predicted by the proposed model from different fracture dips for comparison free surface in the homogeneous rock slope without fracture is also presented and a fairy good agreement between the proposed method and lacy and prevost 1987 is achieved as a result of the anisotropic heterogeneity of the fractured rock slope the locations of free surface turn to be ragged as well as the contours of hydraulic head as shown in fig 5 c and d as the fracture dip ranged from 30 to 150 the free surafce in the slope increases at first and then decreases gradually this is because the models with fracture dips of 30 and 60 are antidip slopes and the fracture directions are negative to drain ground water while the models with fracture dips of 30 and 60 are dip slopes and the fracture directions are positive with water flowing out which is in accord with the observations by jiang et al 2014 for the antidip slopes the seepage points of the fracture set of 30 is higher than that of the fracture set of 60 for the dip slopes the seepage points of the fracture set of 120 is lower than that of the fracture set of 150 it is implied that when the fracture direction is closer to the direction of hydraulic head gradient the variation of the free surface is more drastic consequently the proposed equivalent fracture network model is feasible to determine the free surface in fractured rock slope which provide a new way to solve seepage problems with free surfaces in fractured porous media 5 3 seepage flow in the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell the third example involves the free surafce flow in a zoned dam with clay core and sand shell lacy and prevost 1987 with a height of 67 m and a length of 180 m as shown in fig 6 a the dam is composed of a clay core and a sandy shell with the permeability coefficients being 5 10 6m s and 3 10 5m s respectively the gradients of the upstream and downstream surface are 1 1 348 and 1 1 194 respectively the length of mattress drainage in the bottom right is 32 m and the rest of bottom boundary is impermeable the upstream and downstream water levels are 60 m and 0 m respectively the clay core and sand shell are meshed by two orthogonal sets of artificial fractures with dips of 0 and 90 the spacing are both 3 m and equivalent apertures of the clay core and sand shell are 2 64 10 5m and 4 81 10 4m respectively the free surface locations predicated by the proposed method against the numerical results performed by lacy and prevost 1987 are presented in fig 6 a which suggests that there is good agreement between two methods to minimize the underground water level in the core dam and improve its stability the value for permeability coefficient of the core has a pronounced impact on the seepage flow behavior the effect of permeability coefficient of the core on the free surface locations through the dam is depicted in fig 6 b with decreasing of the permeability coefficient of the core ranges from 5 10 6 m s to 1 10 6m s the shape of free surface in the upstream sandy shell remains almost horizontal without obvious variation but the depression of free surface in the core is more drastic which indicates that the smaller the permeability coefficient of the clay core is the more obvious the water blocking effect is meanwhile the free surface in the downstream sandy shell is obviously lowered and the elevation of the free surface across the material boundary between the core and the downstream sandy shell decreases from 29 43 m to 8 36 m 5 4 the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam the fourth example is an application on the free surface seepage in the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam from chen at al 2016 which is loacted in a typical v shaped gorge at the middle reach of yalong river in southwestern china the left bank slope at cross section ⅱ1 ⅱ1 mainly consists of a series of epizonal metamorphic rocks of the zagunao group of upper to middle triassic system t2 3z with the second members t 2 3 z 2 and the third member t 2 3 z 3 as shown in fig 7 the second member is divided into eight layers from t 2 3 z 2 1 to t 2 3 z 2 8 and consists of marble breccia marble lens of calcareous tuff phyllite and green schist and thin layers of crystalline limestone the third member is grouped into six layers from t 2 3 z 3 1 to t 2 3 z 3 6 and mainly consists of slate and metamorphosed sandstone there is a lamprophyre dike x and three large scale faults f 2 f 5 and f 8 in the left bank abutment according to the field geometrical survey and inverse analysis of hydraulic properties the permeability coefficient of the rock layers dike and faults are given by chen et al 2016 as listed in table 1 the permeability coefficient of t 2 3 z 2 6 t 2 3 z 2 7 and t 2 3 z 2 8 are anisotropic and the related mesh style are shown at the top right corner of in fig 7 while other rock layers dike and faults are isotropic and meshed by orthogonal fracture networks for different rock materials the spacing sizes of two fracture sets are both sepcified as 3 m the groundwater level in the left bank slope is relatively low in which the reservoir water and intra mountain levels are 1640 m and 1660 m respectively the measured free surface matched with the proposed model are shown in fig 7 the free surface predicted by the proposed model agrees closely with the field data which suggests that the proposed model is capable of free surface flow analysis in the practical engineering case with anisotropic heterogeneity media 6 conclusions different from the traditional continuum based approached on free surface flow in porous media an equivalent fracture network model is developed on the basis of back analysis of equivalent continuum theory by snow 1969 in which the continuum is replaced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures with constant dip spacing and aperture rather the plane element the relationships between the permeability coefficients of porous media and equivalent parameters of fracture dip spacing and aperture are derived the corresponding governing equations and boundary conditions for the proposed equivalent fracture network model are also established combining the continuous heaviside function and the variational inequality theory a finite element procedure is presented the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model has been examined by solving seepage problems with free surface in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the fractured rock slope the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam the locations of free surface predicted by the proposed equivalent fracture network model are in fairy good consistency with numerical solutions from other methods and field measurement by analyzing the effect of fracture dip and spacing size on the efficiency of the proposed method in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams it is indicated that the solution accuracy is weak dependent on the fracture dip and mesh size and agree quite well with the other continuum based methods performed by jie et al 2013 and zheng et al 2009 from the free surface flow simulations in the fractured rock slope the proposed model can be successfully used for the fractured media as well as porous media the fracture aperture has pronounced effect on the free surface flow behavior in the fractured media when the fracture direction is closer to the direction of hydraulic head gradient the variation of the free surface is more pronounced the fracture directions are negative for the antidip slope and positive for the dip slope to drain ground water respectively in addition the model calculation on the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell demonstrated the capability of the proposed approach in describing the sudden depression of free surface in the clay core with low permeability where the water blocking effect is more obvious with decreasing the permeability coefficient of the clay core then the application of the proposed method to predict the free surface seepage behavior in the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam presents a good agreement with the field data therefore it is convenient to model free surface flow in porous media with equivalent fracture network model especially for the low permeability rock matrix with high permeable fractures in which the continuous matrix and discontinuous fractures are both treated as the connected fracture networks the 2d seepage problems with free surface is transformed into a 1d system in solution space however the effectiveness of the proposed method in the fractured porous media is required to be further investigated based on the similarity between darcy s law newton s law and fourier s law it is desirable to apply the proposed equivalent

3875,based on the back analysis of equivalent continuum theory in frcatued media by snow 1969 an equivalent fracture network model is proposed to evaluate steady seepage problems with free surface in porous media in contrast to the continuum based approaches on seepage flow the continuum is replaced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures the relationships between

complex dam engineerings with isotropic and anisotropic heterogeneity media keywords free surface equivalent fracture network continuum numerical simulation 1 introduction seepage problems with free

al 2019 for the heterogeneity media with arbitrary geometry boundaries it is arduous to obtain analytical solutions for these problems therefore a number of numerical procedures have been developed to simulate seepage flow in porous media so far numerical models applied to solve seepage problems with free surfaces can be classified into two categories the continuum based approaches and the equivalent pipe network representations in the continuum based approaches the porous media including numerous solid grains and pores is homogenized as a continuum associated with the representative

be divided into finite elements for numerical analysis of free surface flow and the relatively time consuming meshing differential discretization of governing equations or element integration are required xu et al 2014 the alternative way to solve the seepage problems with free surface is based on the equivalent pipe network model in which the continuum is conceptualized as a pipe networks and computational efficiency can be highly improved through the reduction of the problems to a one dimensional system in solution space in recent years great progress has been made in modeling seepage flow in which the linear and nonlinear free surface flow behavior through the porous and fractured media were investigated by xu et al 2014 ren et al 2016 afzali and monadjemi 2014 abareshi et al 2017 moosavian 2019 and xiong et al 2020 2021 in addition the equivalent pipe network model is also extended to analyze co2 sequestration ren et al 2017 wormhole propagation chen et al 2018a and evaluation of geothermal development chen et al 2018b in complicated geological media however for the two dimensional seepage problems only triangular elements can be processed by the equivalent pipe network model and the equivalent hydraulic parameters depend on the shapes of triangles and limited by the isotropic material when the triangular elements are cut by the free surface auxiliary pipes are required to maintain the wetting and dry domain around the free surface to be triangle ren et al 2016 thus the mesh needs to be updated through iterative process until convergence is reached different from conventional equivalent pipe network models ye at al 2020 2021 proposed an orthogonal pipe network model to evaluate the steady and unsteady seepage flow with free surfaces in porous media in which the homogeneous porous media is represented by a network of horizontal and vertical straight pipes lines on the basis of representative elementary volume in addition there is no mesh dependency during free surface iteration mathematically only flow and gradient coincide with the principal axes of permeability will the orthogonal pipe network model be validated the general formulations between the equivalent hydraulic parameters and the full second rank tensor of permeability coefficient are not derived explicitly in theory the major objective of this study is to address these issues as the extension of our previous work using principal permeability coefficient a new equivalent fracture network model with full tensor of permeability coefficient for steady seepage flow with free surface is proposed based on the back analysis of equivalent continuum theory by snow 1969 the basic partial differential equations of steady seepage flow with free surface is described in section 2 the hydraulic equivalence between the fracture network model and porous media is proved and the equivalent geometric parameters of two fracture sets are derived as functions of permeability coefficients in section 3 a numerical procedure based on finite element implementation of the variational inequality theory is suggested to garantee the numerical staibility in section 4 validation of the proposed equivalent fracture network model is estimated by four typical examples with free surface flow including the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the fractured rock slope the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam in section 5 2 basic theory for steady seepage problems with free surfaces considering a control volume in the porous medium domain as shown in fig 1 the porous medium composed of solid grains and pores is conceptualized as a two dimensional homogeneous conutniuum on the macroscopic scale based on the traditional continuum approach the seepage flow can occur through the whole domain occupied by solid grains and pores bear 1972 the steady state impressible seepage flow through porous media follow the continuity

permeability coefficients ϕ p z is the hydraulic head the sum of the pressure head p and elevation z h ϕ z is a heaviside function 3 h ϕ z 1 if ϕ z 0 0 if ϕ z 0 which indicates that the seepage flow is confined in the wet domain below the free surface and water flow in the dry domain above the the free surface is neglected in mathematics zheng et al 2005 2009 chen et al 2011 the boundary conditions for this boudary value problem can be expressed as 1 the water head boundary condition 4 ϕ ϕ on ab and cd where ϕ is the prescribed water head the upstream boundary ab is assigned with ϕ 1

equivalent fracture network model based on the mathematical studies of extensive fracture systems in the fractured rock with an impervious matrix by snow 1969 the equivalent permeability tensor of fracture networks can be quantified by each individual fracture with arbitrary dip spacing and aperture and proceed to determine the hydraulic behavior when the fracture networks behave like a homogeneous porous medium conversely the flow domain of the two dimensional homogeneous porous medium in this study is reproduced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures with constant dip spacing and aperture as shown in fig 2 in the equivalent fracture network model it is assumed that seepage flow only occurs in fractures while the surrounding matrix is impermeable each individual fracture is supposed as a pair of smooth parallel plate conduit the fluid flow through the fractures is governed by the well known cubic law snow 1969 thus the flow velocity vf in the single fractures with aperture b can be expressed as 8 v f λ h ϕ z k f λ ϕ l g b λ 2 12 υ ϕ l where λ denotes the number of fracture sets λ 1 for fracture set 1 and λ 2 for fracture

gives 17 k x k z f 1 f 2 based on the double angle formulas eqs 13 and 14 can be represented as 18 2 k x f 1 cos 2 α 1 1 f 2 cos 2 α 2 1 19 2 k xz f 1 sin 2 α 1 f 2 sin 2 α 2 combing eqs 18 and 19 the

be derived as follows 21 f 1 k x k z k xz 2 k x sin 2 α 1 k xz sin 2 α 1 k z cos 2 α 1 from eq 17 the equivalent hydraulic parameter f2 of fracture set 2 is 22 f 2 k x k z f 1 based on eq 16 the equivalent apertures of fracture sets 1 and 2 can be expressed as 23 b 1 12 υ b 1 f 1 g 1 3 b 2 12 υ b 2 f 2 g 1 3 for a given dip angle α1 of fracture sets 1 the equivalent dip angle α2 of fracture

kxz and kz of the porous media and equivalent parameters b 1 b 2 and α 2 of the related fracture network model when the permeability coefficients kx kxz and kz the fracture spacings b 1 and b 2 and the dip angle α 1 of fracture set 1 are specified eqs 23 and 24 are applied to calculate equivalent apertures and the dip angle α 2 of fracture set 2 4 numerical procedure in the equivalent fracture network model the porous media is discretized by connected fracture networks instead of two dimensional plane elements as a result of that the normal flux across the fracture is zero the continuity equation in the single fractures can be derived from eqs 1 and 8 as follows 25 v f l 0 based on the principle of mass conservation the total flux of inflow and outflow at the fracture intersection should be zero which can be expressed as 26 j q ij j b f v f 0 where qij is the flow flux through each fracture segment ij connected at intersection i as shown in fig 2 for the discrete fracture network model the water head boundary flux boundary seepage face boundary and free surface boundary become 27 ϕ i t ϕ on ab and cd 28 q ij b f v f q on bc 29 ϕ i z i q ij 0 ϕ i z i q ij 0 on de and agfe 30 ϕ i z i q ij 0 on ae in order to solve this boundary value problem associated with the equivalent fracture network model the distribution of hydraulic head in each fracture segment is approximated by the following linear shape function jiang et al 2013 2014 xu at al 2014 ren et al 2016 31 ϕ n i ϕ i n j ϕ j where ϕ i and ϕ j are the nodal hydraulic heads of the two endpoints ni and nj are the linear functions with n i 1 l l ij and n j l l ij lij is the length of the fracture segment nevertheless the position of free surface and seepage points are both uncertain a priori which is critical for steady seepage problems with free surfaces according to the variational inequality theory carried out by zheng et al 2009 and jiang et al 2013 the free surface boundary and singularity of seepage points can be transformed into the natural boundaries on the basis of a signorini type finite element formulations similar to zheng et al 2009 and jiang et al 2013 a continuous heaviside function h λ ϕ z is applied to overcome the numerical oscillation during finite element solution process instead of the discontinuous heaviside function h ϕ z 32 h λ ϕ z 1 if ϕ z 0 λ ϕ z λ if 0 ϕ z λ 0 if ϕ z λ by the finite element discretization to eq 31 the formulation of the equivalent fracture network model based on the discrete variational inequality can be described as seek a hydraulic head

where ε is a user specified error tolerance and take the value of 0 001 herein in which the numerical solutions agree closely with the empirical solution 5 applications in order to assess the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model numerical data of free surface flow analysis from three typical examples are employed the first example is used to verify the feasibility on solving free seepage problem in isotropic and anisotropic porous media of the proposed method with respect to solution accuracy and mesh independency the second example is performed to examine the capacity of the proposed method on seepage flow in the fractured rock slope with high permeable fractures where the effect of fracture dip is contained the third example is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method in complex dam engineering including the sensitivity of the permeability coefficient of the clay core the fourth example is employed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method in a pratical enginenring case with anisotropic heterogeneity media 5 1 isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the numerical solutions of free surface presented by jie et al 2013 are adopted to examine the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model in a rectangular dam with a height of 6 m and a length of 4 m in which the upstream and downstream water levels are 6 m and 1 m as shown in fig 3 a the bottom boundary is impermeable firstly the porous media is treated as isotropic kx kz 0 1 m d and kxz 0 to verify the effect of equivalent fracture dip on the seepage flow behavior the rectangular flow domain is meshed by two sets of artificial fractures with five different dips when the dip of one set α 1 ranges from 0 to 60 the dip of other set α 2 increases from 90 to 120 based on eq 24 the spacing size is b 1 b 2 0 1 m all the corresponding fracture equivalent apertures calculated from eq 23 are equal to 5 23 10 4m for different fracture sets fig 3 a shows comparison of free surface locations predicted by the proposed model and jie et al 2013 it can be seen that the predictions given by the proposed equivalent fracture network model are both highly consistent with the numerical solution from jie et al 2013 indicating that the location accuracy of free surfaces in isotropic media can be obtained from the equivalent fracture network with various dips the mesh dependence of the proposed equivalent fracture network model is also examined with three different mesh sizes b 1 b 2 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 2 m and same fracture dips α 1 0 and α 2 90 good agreements of free surface curves between the propsoed method and jie et al 2013 suggests that the proposed equivalent fracture network model has weak sensitivity of the mesh size secondly the dam treated as anisotropic with kx 5kz 0 5 m d and kxz 0 similar to the isotropic rectangular dam the locations of free surfaces predicted by the proposed equivalent fracture network model with different fracture dips and mesh sizes are plotted in fig 4 a and b respectively for different fracture dips the spacing sizes are both b 1 b 2 0 1 m for different mesh sizes the fracture dips are α 1 0 and α 2 90 because of no empirical solution on this anisotropic media previously the variational inequality methods proposed by zheng et al 2009 is applied to analyze the free surface seepage problem on the basis of quadrilateral elements of a uniform size 0 1 m 0 1 m and the related free surface curve is also illustrated in fig 4 it is found that the predictions for different fracture dips and mesh sizes are almost consistent and very close to the numerical solution obtained from zheng et al 2009 as a result the proposed equivalent fracture network model is reliable for free surface flow analysis in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams and its equivalence to the continuum based method is also proved by the good agreements with the numerical solutions presented by jie et al 2013 and zheng et al 2009 based on eqs 21 24 and its applications in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the following two properties for equivalent fracture dip can be stated as 1 for the isotropic media the dips of two equivalent fracture sets must be orthogonal or α 1 α 2 90 2 for the anisotropic media the dip of one equivalent fracture set must be parallel to one principal axis of permeability if the dip of the other set is parallel to the other principal axis of permeability as a result of that there is kxz 0 and kx kz in isotropic media eqs 21 22 give f 1 f 2 kx and then lead to α 2 arccot tanα 1 thus we get α 1 α 2 90 and property 1 holds for simplicity suppose that kxz 0 and one principal axis of permeability and fracture dip are both coincided with x axis there is α 1 0 inserting eq 21 and α 1 0 into eq 24 yields α 2 arccot 0 thus the corresponding dip of other set is 90 and property 2 is also valid therefore no matter the isotropic media or the anisotropic media can be easily replaced by an equivalent orthogonal fracture network where the dips of two fracture sets are parallel to the two principal axes of permeability respectively 5 2 seepage flow in the fractured rock slope the second example including a trapezoidal slope reported by lacy and prevost 1987 is employed to investigate the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model on free surface seepage through fractured porous media a rock slope with a height of 5 m and a length of 7 m is shown in fig 5 a and the bottom boundary is impervious the upstream and downstream water levels are 5 m and 1 m respectively the permeability coefficient of rock matrix is 1 16 10 8m s it is supposed that there is one set of fracture with trace length of 1 5 m gap of 0 2 m and spacing of 1 m embedded in the rock slope to assess the effect of fracture dip on free surface seepage in the fractured rock slope fracture patterns with various dips from 30 to 150 and constant aperture 0 1 mm are considered during numerical analysis the low permeability rock matrix is meshed by two orthogonal sets of artifical fractures with constant spacing size of 0 05 m and the high permeability fractures is directly simulated by interconnected fracture segment based on the cubic law eq 8 fig 5 b shows comparison of free surface locations predicted by the proposed model from different fracture dips for comparison free surface in the homogeneous rock slope without fracture is also presented and a fairy good agreement between the proposed method and lacy and prevost 1987 is achieved as a result of the anisotropic heterogeneity of the fractured rock slope the locations of free surface turn to be ragged as well as the contours of hydraulic head as shown in fig 5 c and d as the fracture dip ranged from 30 to 150 the free surafce in the slope increases at first and then decreases gradually this is because the models with fracture dips of 30 and 60 are antidip slopes and the fracture directions are negative to drain ground water while the models with fracture dips of 30 and 60 are dip slopes and the fracture directions are positive with water flowing out which is in accord with the observations by jiang et al 2014 for the antidip slopes the seepage points of the fracture set of 30 is higher than that of the fracture set of 60 for the dip slopes the seepage points of the fracture set of 120 is lower than that of the fracture set of 150 it is implied that when the fracture direction is closer to the direction of hydraulic head gradient the variation of the free surface is more drastic consequently the proposed equivalent fracture network model is feasible to determine the free surface in fractured rock slope which provide a new way to solve seepage problems with free surfaces in fractured porous media 5 3 seepage flow in the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell the third example involves the free surafce flow in a zoned dam with clay core and sand shell lacy and prevost 1987 with a height of 67 m and a length of 180 m as shown in fig 6 a the dam is composed of a clay core and a sandy shell with the permeability coefficients being 5 10 6m s and 3 10 5m s respectively the gradients of the upstream and downstream surface are 1 1 348 and 1 1 194 respectively the length of mattress drainage in the bottom right is 32 m and the rest of bottom boundary is impermeable the upstream and downstream water levels are 60 m and 0 m respectively the clay core and sand shell are meshed by two orthogonal sets of artificial fractures with dips of 0 and 90 the spacing are both 3 m and equivalent apertures of the clay core and sand shell are 2 64 10 5m and 4 81 10 4m respectively the free surface locations predicated by the proposed method against the numerical results performed by lacy and prevost 1987 are presented in fig 6 a which suggests that there is good agreement between two methods to minimize the underground water level in the core dam and improve its stability the value for permeability coefficient of the core has a pronounced impact on the seepage flow behavior the effect of permeability coefficient of the core on the free surface locations through the dam is depicted in fig 6 b with decreasing of the permeability coefficient of the core ranges from 5 10 6 m s to 1 10 6m s the shape of free surface in the upstream sandy shell remains almost horizontal without obvious variation but the depression of free surface in the core is more drastic which indicates that the smaller the permeability coefficient of the clay core is the more obvious the water blocking effect is meanwhile the free surface in the downstream sandy shell is obviously lowered and the elevation of the free surface across the material boundary between the core and the downstream sandy shell decreases from 29 43 m to 8 36 m 5 4 the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam the fourth example is an application on the free surface seepage in the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam from chen at al 2016 which is loacted in a typical v shaped gorge at the middle reach of yalong river in southwestern china the left bank slope at cross section ⅱ1 ⅱ1 mainly consists of a series of epizonal metamorphic rocks of the zagunao group of upper to middle triassic system t2 3z with the second members t 2 3 z 2 and the third member t 2 3 z 3 as shown in fig 7 the second member is divided into eight layers from t 2 3 z 2 1 to t 2 3 z 2 8 and consists of marble breccia marble lens of calcareous tuff phyllite and green schist and thin layers of crystalline limestone the third member is grouped into six layers from t 2 3 z 3 1 to t 2 3 z 3 6 and mainly consists of slate and metamorphosed sandstone there is a lamprophyre dike x and three large scale faults f 2 f 5 and f 8 in the left bank abutment according to the field geometrical survey and inverse analysis of hydraulic properties the permeability coefficient of the rock layers dike and faults are given by chen et al 2016 as listed in table 1 the permeability coefficient of t 2 3 z 2 6 t 2 3 z 2 7 and t 2 3 z 2 8 are anisotropic and the related mesh style are shown at the top right corner of in fig 7 while other rock layers dike and faults are isotropic and meshed by orthogonal fracture networks for different rock materials the spacing sizes of two fracture sets are both sepcified as 3 m the groundwater level in the left bank slope is relatively low in which the reservoir water and intra mountain levels are 1640 m and 1660 m respectively the measured free surface matched with the proposed model are shown in fig 7 the free surface predicted by the proposed model agrees closely with the field data which suggests that the proposed model is capable of free surface flow analysis in the practical engineering case with anisotropic heterogeneity media 6 conclusions different from the traditional continuum based approached on free surface flow in porous media an equivalent fracture network model is developed on the basis of back analysis of equivalent continuum theory by snow 1969 in which the continuum is replaced by an artificial fracture network system formed by two sets of fractures with constant dip spacing and aperture rather the plane element the relationships between the permeability coefficients of porous media and equivalent parameters of fracture dip spacing and aperture are derived the corresponding governing equations and boundary conditions for the proposed equivalent fracture network model are also established combining the continuous heaviside function and the variational inequality theory a finite element procedure is presented the validity of the proposed equivalent fracture network model has been examined by solving seepage problems with free surface in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams the fractured rock slope the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell and the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam the locations of free surface predicted by the proposed equivalent fracture network model are in fairy good consistency with numerical solutions from other methods and field measurement by analyzing the effect of fracture dip and spacing size on the efficiency of the proposed method in the isotropic and anisotropic rectangular dams it is indicated that the solution accuracy is weak dependent on the fracture dip and mesh size and agree quite well with the other continuum based methods performed by jie et al 2013 and zheng et al 2009 from the free surface flow simulations in the fractured rock slope the proposed model can be successfully used for the fractured media as well as porous media the fracture aperture has pronounced effect on the free surface flow behavior in the fractured media when the fracture direction is closer to the direction of hydraulic head gradient the variation of the free surface is more pronounced the fracture directions are negative for the antidip slope and positive for the dip slope to drain ground water respectively in addition the model calculation on the zoned dam with clay core and sand shell demonstrated the capability of the proposed approach in describing the sudden depression of free surface in the clay core with low permeability where the water blocking effect is more obvious with decreasing the permeability coefficient of the clay core then the application of the proposed method to predict the free surface seepage behavior in the left bank abutment of jinping i arch dam presents a good agreement with the field data therefore it is convenient to model free surface flow in porous media with equivalent fracture network model especially for the low permeability rock matrix with high permeable fractures in which the continuous matrix and discontinuous fractures are both treated as the connected fracture networks the 2d seepage problems with free surface is transformed into a 1d system in solution space however the effectiveness of the proposed method in the fractured porous media is required to be further investigated based on the similarity between darcy s law newton s law and fourier s law it is desirable to apply the proposed equivalent

3876,modeling heat transfer in complex heterogeneous fractured system is key for geothermal energy applications discrete fracture network dfn modeling is the classical framework to reproduce the advective part of the transport which is determined by the fracture connectivity and heterogeneity this approach in general sacrifices the representation of the rock matrix disregarding both its diffusive heat exchange with the fractures and the effects of its thermo mechanical deformation on the fracture aperture here we propose a new semi analytic formulation that can be implemented in a dfn simulator with particle tracking approach the contribution of the rock matrix in terms of diffusive heat exchange and thermal contraction expansion is analytically evaluated which respectively impact the advective heat transfer and the fracture aperture variation the method is proved to be accurate and robust results from simulations of cold fluid injection show that rock contraction affects the transmissivity which accelerates the advective transport resulting in a faster recovery of cold fluid at the outlet the methodology enables investigating the reservoir behavior and optimizing the geothermal performance while keeping the computational effort within reasonable values this allows exploring the uncertainty in cases when the in situ characterization is poor which is the spirit of the dfn modeling keywords heat transport particle tracking discrete fracture network geothermal systems thermo hydro mechanical coupling 1 introduction deep geothermal energy represents a powerful and clean energy prospect with the potential to generate huge and virtually unlimited energy giardini 2009 tester et al 2007 geothermal plants generally involve the circulation of fluids into hot reservoirs located in the crystalline basement characterized by a very low permeability of the rock mass and a complex system of preexisting natural fractures jung 2013 enhancement of fracture transmissivity is often performed by means of massive fluid injection during the preliminary stimulation stage leading to the development of the so called enhanced geothermal systems egs both before and after the stimulation operations a full characterization of the rock and fracture properties is difficult which increases the uncertainty on the heat extraction performance in this context numerical modeling is a key instrument to forecast the potential heat production of geothermal reservoirs under a number of scenarios baria et al 1999 heat transfer in fractured reservoirs is driven by fluid advection through the fracture network and diffusion in the host rock the first process defines the spatial extension of the affected domain while the second one controls the fluid solid heat exchange and therefore the geothermal performance bruel 2002 the behavior may be complex because the two processes are coupled and because of the heterogeneity of the flow velocity and fracture aperture fields in the network becker and shapiro 2003 the complexity is further increased when thermal deformations are taken into account long term fluid circulation leads to the cooling and consequent contraction of the host rock which tends to increase the fracture aperture koh et al 2011 the variation of the fracture aperture has two effects on the one hand it affects the fluid filled fracture volume that exchanges heat with the rock through the fracture surface and therefore the exchanged heat on the other hand it may imply a variation of the flow velocity which in turn affects the heat advective transport slowing down or speeding up the heat production a potential consequence is the opening of new fast flow paths that may short circuit the connection between the paired injection and extraction wells with negative impacts on the geothermal production mcdermott et al 2006 quantifying these processes is crucial for the design and optimization of heat extraction however modeling these processes in heterogeneous fractured systems poses a number of numerical challenges because they occur on very different length and time scales and because of the large variability of fracture size and transmissivity bonnet et al 2001 bour and davy 1997 bour and davy 1999 de dreuzy et al 2001 davy et al 2010 continuum based approaches accurately reproduce the fully coupled thermo hydro mechanical thm process but they are not able to reproduce the intricate structure of fractured reservoir unless the fracture system is dense enough to be represented as an equivalent porous medium discrete fracture network dfn modeling is the most appropriate framework to reproduce the advective part of the problem which is determined by the fracture connectivity and heterogeneity however the representation of the diffusive heat exchange with the rock matrix and of the thermo mechanical tm coupling suffers from some limitations jing 2003 a number of dfn based approaches focuses on the advective transport in the network of connected fractures disregarding the effects of the rock matrix e g frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2019 however the diffusive exchange between fracture and rock is recognized as playing a key role in all transport problems carrera et al 1998 and in particular in the case of heat transfer moreover the mechanical response of fractures to heat is due to the rock thermal expansion or contraction thus it depends on the portion of the rock matrix affected by thermal diffusion and on the rock properties discrete fracture matrix dfm models reproduce the behavior of fractures embedded in a rock matrix through explicit representation of rock blocks e g hu et al 2017 odsæter et al 2019 flemisch et al 2018 although this approach is accurate and it may be combined with the numerical simulation of the thermal deformations it incurs high computational cost which limits the number of fractures that may be explicitly represented or the number of scenarios that may be analyzed see lei et al 2017 for a comprehensive review to represent the exchange with the rock the assumption of a diffusive heat flux perpendicular to the fracture plane is widely adopted which can be solved analytically the adoption of analytic solutions greatly reduces the computational effort which allows for stochastic modeling of large three dimensional reservoirs with thousands of fractures several authors have combined lagrangian particle tracking solvers and analytic solutions of the diffusion process to reproduce transport of solute mass of chemical species dagan et al 1992 cvetkovic et al 1999 painter and cvetkovic 2005 the framework has been recently applied to heat transport by gisladottir et al 2016 in many cases the approach is limited by some underlying assumptions the first is the one of infinite matrix which is reasonable only for short time or large fracture spacing the second is that the trajectories are stationary in time and independent on each other in addition the tm coupling is rarely contemplated in this context in this paper we present a new simplified methodology to simulate heat transfer in fractured media taking into account the diffusive exchange with the rock matrix and the consequent thermo mechanical fracture aperture variation due to rock deformation the methodology is based on a particle tracking approach and it is similar to the method of the characteristics konikow and bredehoeft 1978 the contribution of the rock matrix in terms of diffusive heat exchange and thermal contraction expansion is analytically evaluated which respectively impact the heat transfer and the fracture aperture variation this latter in turns affects the heat transfer and the velocity field which is updated in time assuming quasi steady state conditions we disregard the effects of the pore pressure variations on the fracture aperture and in the rock hydro mechanical hm coupling however we do take into account the impact of the flow velocity on the heat transfer as well as the effects of the temperature on the fracture aperture and the impact of the aperture variation on the flow velocity we therefore describe this approach as a model for simulating t h m coupling given its semi analytic nature this formulation allows reproducing heat transport in temperature dependent complex fracture networks while keeping the computational time within reasonable values in the following we first introduce the conceptual model and summarize the governing equations then we show the classical analytic solution for a single trajectory with constant in time fracture aperture and velocity afterwards we present the detail of the proposed semi analytic method for single trajectory with temperature dependent fracture aperture and velocity we show that extending the second approach to the case of multiple trajectories allows us to deal with non stationary trajectories in a changing environment after presenting the details of the method its implementation and validation we compare the behavior for constant and non constant fracture aperture and velocity for the case of a single trajectory and we discuss the numerical issues and the implications finally we show results for a dfn and we discuss the effects of non stationary trajectories on the observed temperatures 2 governing equations and assumptions let a heterogeneous fracture network be composed by connected fractures embedded in a rock matrix we assume that each fracture is planar and perfectly symmetric with respect to its central axis and thus we refer to the semi volume fig 1 the fracture half aperture b x t is variable in time and space where x represents the coordinate vector in the fracture plane and t is time the variability in space is smooth such that we can keep the assumption of planar fracture as valid no distinction is made between hydraulic aperture and mechanical aperture and fracture roughness is disregarded we focus on the thermo mechanic processes occurring for long term non isothermal injection and we do not consider the fracture aperture variations due to pressure increase which mostly occur during the stimulation phase or at the beginning of injection operations baria et al 1999 fracture failure with either opening mode i or shearing mode ii mechanism is not contemplated here and linear elastic behavior is assumed creation of new fractures or propagation of the pre existing ones are also neglected this conceptual model is used in the following to illustrate the governing equations for flow heat transport and mechanical deformation with respect to a single fracture and it is successively extended to the case of a streamline through a fracture network 2 1 fluid flow we consider that fractures are fluid saturated and that fluid flow occurs exclusively in the fracture network while the rock matrix is impermeable conservation of fluid mass for unit volume of fracture gives the flow equation for the fracture 1 b x t t b x t v x t w 0 where we have assumed homogeneous fluid density and incompressible fluid the term w represents a sink source while v x t is the fluid flow velocity vector that is proportional to the pressure gradient p assuming the validity of the cubic law with the fracture hydraulic aperture coinciding with the mechanical aperture and equal to 2 b it reads 2 v x t 4 b x t 2 12 μ p x t where μ is the fluid viscosity the boundary conditions bcs at the inlet can be either of imposed pressure or flow rate in the following we assume that the fracture aperture variation is slow which allows for considering quasi steady state conditions for flow i e the velocity field does not change over a certain time under this condition the first term of eq 1 vanishes 2 2 heat transport we consider that heat transfer occurs by fluid advection within the fracture system and by thermal diffusion within the rock matrix mostly in the direction orthogonal to the fracture lateral diffusion is disregarded both in the fracture and in the matrix but we will partly introduce this effect in the following we also assume infinite diffusive matrix and flat temperature profile within the fracture thickness according to this setting the heat transport within the fracture is described by the energy balance for an arbitrary semi volume of fracture carrera et al 1998 3 b x t c t x t t b x t c v x t t x t j x t where c is the fluid heat capacity assumed as constant and t x t represents the fluid temperature in the fracture j x t is the diffusive heat flux that the fluid exchanges with the rock matrix per unit surface which is defined as 4 j x t κ t m x z t z z b where κ is the rock thermal conductivity assumed as constant and z is the coordinate in the direction normal to the fracture with origin at the fracture center the temperature in the matrix t m x z t is given by the energy balance 5 c m t m x z t t κ 2 t m x z t z 2 for b z c m represents the rock heat capacity assumed as constant eqs 3 and 5 are coupled by means of eq 4 and they have to be solved together another coupling condition is provided by the temperature continuity at the fracture wall i e the fluid temperature in the fracture is equal to the rock temperature at the fracture edge which defines a bc for eq 5 6 t m x b t t x t x t the other bc for eq 5 is given by the hypothesis of infinite matrix without any loss of generality we assume that the initial temperature is uniform in the system and equal to 0 both in the fractures and in the rock different initial conditions are easily reproduced by considering the temperature values as temperature variations we want to solve the problem of continuous imposed fluid temperature at one extreme of the fracture x x 0 which is also considered as infinite in the longitudinal direction therefore the initial and boundary conditions for the matrix and the fracture are the following 7 t m x z 0 0 t x 0 0 t m x b t t x t t x 0 t t 0 t t m x t 0 t t 0 2 3 mechanical deformation the rock matrix behaves as a linear elastic material which under non isothermal conditions is governed by the constitutive law timoshenko and goodier 1951 8 σ 2 g ε λ ε vol i 2 g 3 λ α t t m i where σ is the stress tensor g and λ are the shear and lamé moduli respectively α t is the linear thermal expansion coefficient i is the identity matrix ε 1 2 u u t is the strain tensor and ε vol u is the volumetric strain which corresponds to ε x ε y ε z u x x u y y u z z where u is the displacement vector stresses strains and displacements evolve in time in response to changes in temperature the stress tensor refers to stress variation if an initial stress 0 is assumed we assume the sign convention such that tensile stress and extensional strain are positive the x and y axes are taken as respectively parallel and transverse to the flow direction in the fracture plane while the z axis is perpendicular to the fracture wall the mechanical equilibrium in absence of body and surface forces is therefore expressed by 9 g 2 u g λ u 2 g 3 λ α t t m where we observe that the deformation is driven by the temperature gradient note that the effects of the pore pressure variation is neglected as the rock matrix is assumed as impermeable considering a uniform temperature profile zero gradient in the fracture in plane transverse direction we can assume plane strain conditions in the y direction i e ε y 0 the deformations in the direction longitudinal to the fracture are disregarded because they are small given the temperature distribution we also assume free thermal deformation in the direction transverse to the fracture into the matrix which implies that the corresponding compressive stress is zero i e σ z 0 furthermore we disregard the shear stress τ xz based on the assumption that the temperature gradient is smooth in the longitudinal direction we test and discuss these assumptions in section 5 3 under these hypothesis the problem is greatly simplified into the one dimensional equilibrium equation along the direction z for each location x such as eq 9 translates into 10 2 u z x z t z 2 1 ν 1 ν α t t m x z t z b z where ν is the poisson ratio and the following relation holds 1 ν 1 ν 2 g 3 λ 2 g λ the displacement u z is found by solving eq 10 under the boundary conditions of free displacement i e zero stress at z b and infinite rock matrix i e zero displacement at z at each fracture location and time the variation of the semi aperture with respect to the initial conditions δ b x t b x t b x 0 is equal to the displacement undergone by the fracture wall in the direction perpendicular to the fracture u z x b t such as 11 δ b x t u z x b t b 1 ν 1 ν α t t m x z t d z note that the expression corresponds to the integral over space of the rock matrix thermal deformation ε z u z z because we assume that the displacement is 0 at z where the temperature variation is zero 3 solutions for a single flow path 3 1 single flow path with constant fracture aperture and flow velocity assume a single flow path with longitudinal coordinate ℓ parallel to the flow direction and constant in time fracture aperture such as b b ℓ in this framework the fluid flow is steady state and the velocity is constant and equal to v ℓ the energy balance of eq 3 is therefore simplified into 12 t ℓ t t v ℓ t ℓ t ℓ j ℓ t cb ℓ this problem can be solved analytically as proposed by several authors e g liu et al 2007 and as we summarize in appendix a the temperature evolution in the fluid and in the rock matrix in the case of constant temperature bc at ℓ ℓ 0 are therefore expressed respectively as 13 t ℓ t t 0 erfc θ d b 2 t τ t τ t ℓ t 0 t τ 14 t m ℓ z t t 0 erfc θ db z b 2 d t τ t τ t m ℓ t 0 t τ where d κ c m is the rock thermal diffusion θ is the ratio of rock to fluid heat capacity i e θ c m c while τ and b represent the fluid advective travel time and the flow wetted surface moreno and neretnieks 1993 respectively 15 τ ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v ℓ b ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v ℓ b ℓ note that for t τ the response of eq 13 is controlled by the relationship between t and the characteristic time θ 2 db 2 4 solution of eq 13 corresponds to the convolution over time of the response to an instantaneous pulse injection cvetkovic et al 1999 painter and cvetkovic 2005 in fact given the linearity of the process the superposition principle can be applied in the case of uniform velocity and fracture aperture eq 13 coincides with the solution for a single fracture proposed by tang et al 1981 3 2 single flow path with temperature dependent fracture aperture and flow velocity we assume the same setting as in the previous section consisting in a single trajectory defined by the longitudinal coordinate ℓ but with temperature dependent fracture aperture and flow velocity b ℓ t and v ℓ t the non linearity of the problem hinders the derivation of a closed analytic solution considering a lagrangian approach we transform the eulerian variables defined at ℓ t into the lagrangian variables defined at τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 where t 0 t τ and τ is the travel time to reach the position ℓ for a moving front originated at coordinate ℓ 0 at time t 0 and displacing along the trajectory by advection such as 16 τ ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 all lagrangian quantities are locally equal to their respective eulerian quantities such as 17 υ τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 υ ℓ t 0 τ for simplicity we adopt the same nomenclature for the eulerian and lagrangian quantities but we use a different notation to distinguish them where the presence of the semicolon indicates the lagrangian quantities according to this framework the energy balance in the fracture can be expressed as the variation of temperature of a moving front cvetkovic et al 1999 18 t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 t t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 τ j ℓ τ t 0 c b ℓ τ t 0 where we keep the terms in the right hand side of the equation in terms of eulerian quantities ackwowleging the identity of eq 17 the left hand side of the equation can be rewritten in terms of total derivative d d τ t τ such as 19 d d τ t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 j ℓ τ t 0 c b ℓ τ t 0 note that both the front temperature and velocity are not only a function of the position and therefore of the travel time τ but they are also a function of the kick off time t 0 and therefore of the global elapsed time t t 0 τ the initial value of the front temperature t 0 ℓ 0 t 0 constitutes a boundary condition of the problem the temperature t decays during the travel because of the diffusive heat exchange with the rock j this latter is defined in the eulerian field and it is a function of the matrix temperature gradient at the fracture matrix interface eq 4 the temperature in the matrix t m ℓ z t is the result of the diffusion problem recall eq 5 whose linearity still holds solution of this latter for a variable bc allows us to obtain an expression for j as the integral of the pulse heat transfer flux over the time appendix b 20 j ℓ t κ 0 t t m ℓ b t 2 π d t t 3 2 exp z b 2 4 d t t 1 z b 2 2 d t t d t z b the temperature at the fracture rock interface t m ℓ b t is also defined in the eulerian field and it is determined through continuity by the temperature of the front that is at that position at that specific time such as 21 t m ℓ b t t ℓ t t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 t τ the formulation detailed so far acknowledges the variable in time nature of the fracture aperture which changes in response to the thermal deformation of the rock matrix for example the rock shrinks when it is cooled down which causes an increase of the fracture aperture while the rock expands when it is warmed up which causes a decrease of the fracture aperture within the rock matrix both the heat diffusion and the elastic deformation are linear problems so superposition in time and space applies replacing t m ℓ z t in eq 11 by its expression in eq b 1 and solving the integral in z we get 22 δ b ℓ t 1 ν 1 ν α t d π 0 t t m ℓ b t t t d t where we highlight that a negative temperature variation causes an increase in fracture aperture in the following we extend this approach to the case of multiple trajectories and we solve eqs 19 22 by adopting a semi analytic scheme with time and space discretization 4 formulation for multiple flow paths in heterogeneous deformable fractured systems 4 1 lagrangian fluid volume particles we now consider a three dimensional heterogeneous fractured system to solve the problem detailed in section 2 we start by discretizing the duration of the injection in time steps t 0 with interval δ t 0 we assume that the fracture aperture variation is slow so as we consider the flow as quasi steady state i e steady state conditions applies during each time step with constant fracture aperture and velocity field under this assumption we consider that the fluid flow is solved numerically by finite difference or finite element methods over a mesh grid at each time step the fracture aperture variation and the consequent new fracture aperture 2 b x t 0 and velocity v x t 0 fields are estimated once the velocity field in the fracture network is determined it is possible to define multiple flow paths following the maximum pressure gradients and to simulate the advective transport by means of a lagrangian particle tracking approach dagan and bresler 1979 the condition of imposing a fixed temperature t 0 at the inlet corresponds to imposing the heat energy e 0 cv 0 t 0 over a fluid volume v 0 entering the system for the duration of each time step i e v 0 q 0 δ t 0 where q 0 is the injected flow rate we represent this energy as an ensemble of n particles which are released at each t 0 at locations x 0 on the boundary particles are considered as fluid cells with equal volumes whose sum equates the hot cold volume introduced in the domain v 0 the particle volumes do not undergo any change during the travel i e any deformation keeps the volume unchanged see top picture of fig 2 although the conceptualization of particles as volume cells is useful for the purpose of this approach the magnitude of the particle volume is irrelevant as shown in the next section particles hold an energy e and the total energy is given by the sum of the individual particle energy therefore all particle volumes are initially charged with the energy e 0 e 0 n and with the temperature equal to the injection temperature t 0 x 0 q t 0 t 0 q note that we retain the same notation adopted in section 3 2 to define particle quantities as a function of their residence time injection position and injection time e g υ τ x x 0 t 0 fluid particles change their energy because of their diffusive heat exchange with the rock matrix since we assume that both particle volume and heat capacity are constant particle energy and particle temperature are related by a constant proportion therefore we can arbitrarily adopt one or the other as the working variable the adoption of the temperature will prove convenient to our purpose particles move into the fracture system by advection along different trajectories that may change from a time step to another due to the temporal variation of the velocity in the system each particle changes its position x such as 23 d x τ x 0 t 0 d τ v τ x 0 t 0 x 0 x 0 t 0 x 0 the particle lagrangian velocity is equal to the local eulerian velocity e g v τ x x 0 t 0 v x t 0 where we use the same notation for lagrangian and eulerian quantities as in the previous section and where we apply eq 17 highlighting that the velocity field is only updated at each time step similarly to section 3 2 τ x x 0 t 0 is the time that the particle released at position x 0 and time t 0 has spent to travel from x 0 to the position x it can also be expressed as a function of the trajectory length ℓ x and the particle velocity component in the direction parallel to the trajectory v ℓ ℓ x x 0 t 0 v τ x x 0 t 0 such as 24 τ x x 0 t 0 0 τ d τ 0 ℓ x d ℓ v ℓ ℓ x x 0 t 0 thus the particle arrival time at x is t x t 0 τ x x 0 t 0 note that in the case of constant in time fracture aperture both the travel time and the velocity are not a function of t 0 since space is discretized into a mesh grid the particle travel time is calculated as the sum of the times to jump over the crossed mesh elements where each jump is defined by the two successive intersections of the particle trajectory with the element edges in order acknowledge the variation of the velocity field particles only move for the duration of the time interval δ t 0 if they have not reached the outlet during the time step in which they are injected they resume their travel in the following time iteration along newly defined trajectories originating at their last position this operation may imply that a large number of fractures are circulating within the network during each time step which increases the computing memory demand the adoption of a time interval larger than the advective time to reach the outlet prevent the simultaneous presence of multiple particle sets in the system as we will further discuss in section 8 particle injection in the network satisfies a flux weighted injection mode and particle behavior at fracture intersections follows a complete mixing rule i e particles are distributed proportional to the outgoing fluxes this condition together with the assumptions detailed above implies the following relationship between the number of particles n fluid volume v e and flow rate q e entering a generic mesh element and the number of particles n fluid volume v 0 and flow rate q 0 introduced in the system for each time step 25 n n v e v 0 q e q 0 4 2 particle temperature variation due to fluid rock diffusion particles change their temperature during the travel because of the thermal diffusion between the fluid and the rock matrix the estimation of the particle temperature variation is performed by extending the semi analytic method for a single trajectory detailed in section 3 2 to the case of multiple trajectories at each t 0 we release n particles with assigned temperature at the inlet and we consider continuous injection during the time step we differentiate the temperature at the fracture rock interface t m x b t defined in the eulerian field from the particle temperature t τ x 0 t 0 defined in the lagrangian field fig 2 this dichotomy allows for defining the variation of t τ x 0 t 0 as a function of the diffusive heat flux eq 19 which is estimated for each particle and it based on the local eulerian temperature history t m x b t eq 20 this latter is in turn determined by the temperature of the crossing particles because of the equilibrium between fluid and rock temperatures at the interface recall eq 21 for a generic particle crossing the location x at time t 0 τ t m x b t is equal to the temperature of the particle itself for the duration of the time interval while for times smaller than t 0 τ it is equal to the temperature at the fracture matrix interface collected at the grid mesh elements t b x t as expressed by 26 t m x b t t τ x x 0 t 0 t 0 τ t t 0 τ δ t 0 t b x t t t 0 τ where x represents the coordinate identifying the generic mesh element ω x containing x this definition builds on the assumption that fluid particle volumes released at the same time do not directly exchange heat because the differences in arrival times are small compared to the diffusive time to cross the distance between different trajectories although particle trajectories do not directly interact during their travel particles have indirect effects on future particles in fact we consider that a time larger than the time interval is sufficient for a complete homogenization of each volume temperature to occur over the mesh element thanks to lateral diffusion processes according with this assumption the temperature at the mesh element t b x t coincides with the temperature of the crossing fluid volume let n x t 0 n be the number of particles released at the same t 0 that cross the mesh element ω x at different times t 0 τ ξ where ξ is a generic position that falls within the mesh element ω x it is worth reminding at this point that we assume continuous heat injection during the time step which means that each temperature persists at each location for the duration of the time interval δ t 0 the total volume crossing ω x in the time interval is v and its temperature in time is determined by the sum of the energy of the particle volumes crossing the mesh element at that time such that t b x t is 27 t b x t 1 cv x t q 1 n x t 0 e τ ξ x 0 q t τ ξ 1 n x t 0 q 1 n x t 0 t τ ξ x 0 q t τ ξ ξ ω x the second equivalence is derived acknowledging that the energy of the generic particle q is e q cv q t q and that the total crossing volume v is equal to the sum of the n particle fluid volumes crossing the element which is v nv q because all the particles have equal and invariable volumes by using the second equivalence the estimation of t b x t does not depend on the magnitude of the particle volumes after substitution of eqs 26 and 27 into eq 20 and after integration by time intervals see also appendix b the expression of the heat exchanged by a particle p released at t 0 i corresponding to the i th time step is 28 j p i x κ c m π t p i x δ t 0 j ω p i x where we make use of the generic short notation υ p i x υ τ x x 0 p t 0 i the second term in the right hand side represents the memory diffusive heat exchange which is defined on the mesh element such as 29 j ω p i x κ c m π j 1 i 1 1 n j x q 1 n j x t q j ξ f t p i x t q j ξ ξ ω x where t p i x τ p i x t 0 i τ x x 0 p t 0 i t 0 i and where f is defined as 30 f t a t b 1 t a t b 1 t a t b δ t 0 expression 28 reflects the convolution over time of different temperature values each one considered as constant over the time step the first term represents the current temperature at the location x i e the temperature of the particle p itself while the second term represents the memory of all the past temperatures recorded at x over the time the contributions of the different temperatures at the fracture rock interface are superposed acknowledging the linearity of the diffusion process in the rock note that the denominators of eq 30 are always real numbers as the terms in the square root are always positive this is ensured by the fact that particles are stopped at the end of the time step so the travel time to reach a given position is never larger than δ t 0 it is worth reminding that the mutual effects between flow paths released in the same time step is disregarded based on the assumption that differences in arrival time are small compared with the diffusive time acknowledging this effect would require sorting the particles by passage time order at each crossed element which dramatically increases the computational cost despite that the operation defined by eq 29 still requires dealing with a large amount of data which leads us to the simplification described in the next section 4 3 a meta particle concept to reduce stored data at each time step and mesh element the passage time and temperature of each particle have to be stored which translates into huge sets of data considering that the particle number is also large in order to reduce the amount of stored data we build on the observation that the trajectories crossing a mesh element have similar temperatures and passage times therefore at each time step we keep track of the effects of the particle passage time and temperature by assigning to each mesh element the values of a meta particle whose passage time and temperature is equal to the average passage times and temperatures of the n particles released at that time step and crossing the element such as 31 t b j x 1 n j x q 1 n j x t q j ξ ξ ω x 32 t j x t 0 j 1 n j x q 1 n j x τ q j ξ ξ ω x where the meta particle variables are expressed using again the short notation e g υ j x υ τ x x 0 t 0 j note that since the discretization for ξ corresponds to the mesh edges i e the intersections between the particle trajectories and the mesh elements we estimate t b j x and t j x as the average between the values at the two adjacent edges of ω x these average times and temperatures substitute t b in eq 26 such as t b x t x t b x under this framework the heat flux that a particle p released at time t 0 exchanges at the position x is still expressed by eq 28 but the memory diffusive heat exchange is evaluated according with the meta particle temperatures and passage times recorded at the position over the time steps such as j ω p i x is substituted by j ω p i x 33 j ω p i x κ c m π j 1 i 1 t b j x f t p i x t j x the adoption of this meta particle concept sensibly reduces the amount of stored data with respect to evaluating the diffusive flux considering the individual contribution of all the crossing particles released in the previous time steps as described in the previous section at the end of each time step the recorded particle passage times and temperatures of each location are translated into one value of temperature and associated time for each fracture mesh element the consequent loss of accuracy is minimal as we discuss in section 5 4 thus the particle temperature variation during the advective displacement across the element ω x k is evaluated by solving eq 19 which is discretized according to a crank nicolson scheme into 34 t p i x k t p i x k τ p i x k τ p i x k j p i x k j p i x k 2 j ω p i x k 2 c b x k t 0 i where the subscripts k and k identify the trajectory entrance and exit points in the grid element ω x k note that the fracture half aperture value refers to the injection time in fact the fracture aperture and velocity fields are updated at each time step and they are considered constant for the duration of the time step the fracture half aperture variation is estimated at each mesh element according to the meta particle average values of temperature and time such that eq 22 translates into 35 δ b i x 2 1 ν 1 ν α t d π j 1 i t b j x g t i x t j x where 36 g t a t b t a t b t a t b δ t 0 finally the fracture semi aperture field is updated at each time step according to the more recently recorded values of δ b at each x such as 37 b i 1 x b 0 x δ b i x note that this formulation disregards the effects of lateral mechanical continuity because the thermal displacement is assumed as exclusively dependent on the temperature variation in the direction perpendicular to the fracture while in practice mechanical deformation is instantaneously transferred far from the thermal perturbation through the solid matrix in other words the fracture opening should propagate laterally both in the fracture longitudinal ℓ and on plane transverse y directions however the lack of this effect is partly compensated by the smooth nature of the heat propagation in the fracture both in the longitudinal direction as a consequence of the diffusive exchange with the matrix and in the on plane transverse direction because of the similar velocities of adjacent streamlines over the same fracture we test the validity of this assumption in section 5 3 4 4 implementation in a dfn simulator the formulation has been implemented in the dfn lab software platform which provides a set of tools for the generation of stochastic and deterministic heterogeneous fracture networks and for the modeling of flow in the connected network through mixed hybrid finite element scheme le goc et al 2019 pinier et al 2021 this scheme ensures fluid mass conservation including for unstructured meshes with a high variability in element quality the particle tracking module already implemented in the software constitutes the basis for the advective part of this formulation the algorithm is designed to develop accurate particle tracing on unstructured meshes matringe et al 2006 particle trajectories are defined on the grid mesh according with the velocity field which is approximated as constant within each element at each element crossed the particle motion occurs on a straight line the velocity vector determines the exit point i e the position where the trajectory crosses the element edge while the velocity norm determines the time for the particle to jump across the element since particle motion occurs for the duration of the time interval section 4 1 it may occur that some particles have not reached the outlet during the time interval in this case particles are stopped and their travel resume when a new time step is initiated to do so the particle position at the stop time is evaluated by means of a linear interpolation on the trajectory line crossing the last visited element 5 validation of the proposed approach 5 1 validation and convergence analysis in the case of constant fracture aperture and velocity in the case of a single trajectory with constant in time fracture aperture and velocity the semi analytic solution described in sections 3 2 and 4 should provide the same estimates of temperature than the analytic solution of section 3 1 we make use of this equivalence to analyze the convergence performance of the semi analytic solution under different conditions of time discretization we consider a fracture of 10 m length with constant in time fracture aperture and steady state flow velocity this corresponds to either constant flow or constant pressure boundary conditions at the fracture inlet x 0 where we also impose a constant temperature condition the rock matrix thermal diffusivity is d 1 10 6 m2 s and the parameter θ is 1 i e c m c we test the performance of the semi analytic formulation for two cases one with uniform velocity and regular spatial grid the other with more general conditions of non uniform velocity and irregular spatial grid for both cases the semi aperture is uniform and equal to b 1 10 4 m for the first case we consider flow velocity v 2 5 10 2 m s we adopt a space discretization such that δ x 1 m while for the time discretization we consider different time intervals δ t 0 to keep generality the analysis is performed in terms of dimensionless values making use of the characteristic time t c θ 2 d δ τ 2 π b 2 which represents the ratio of the square of the advective characteristic time for the single jump δ τ δ x u to the diffusive characteristic time π b 2 θ 2 d the value of the characteristic time is approximately 0 5 days for this specific example the adoption of t c will prove convenient as shown in the following fig 3 shows the comparison between the two solutions under values of time intervals from 0 1 t c to 10 t c which correspond to values from 102 δ τ to 104 δ τ in the left panel the temperature variation in time is represented for three different control planes at x 1 5 δ x x 3 5 δ x and x 9 5 δ x respectively since values are stored on the grid element we take the middle point of the element as x at the first control plane the temperature starts to change for time larger than 0 2 t c which is expected as in eq 13 the temperature is larger than zero for arguments of the complementary error function smaller than 2 i e when t t c 5 if t τ in the right panel we show the result vs space at t 30 t c the semi analytic solution shows a good agreement with the classical solution and it is most accurate for smaller values of δ t 0 t c the error increases for increasing values of the time interval and it incurs an overestimation of the temperature especially for small times in fact if eq 28 is replaced into eq 34 one obtains that the temperature variation of the front depends on the ratio θ d δ τ π δ t 0 b which coincides with t c δ t 0 overall we observe that the adoption of the crank nicolson scheme ensures stability while preserving accuracy we also perform a convergence analysis for the case of non uniform velocity and non uniform space discretization fig 4 the fracture semi aperture is assumed as uniform and equal to b 1 10 4 m which means that the variation of velocity corresponds to an equivalent variation of fluid flow with this example we mimic the general case of a trajectory crossing several fractures and intersections like in a complex fracture network although we keep the fracture aperture as uniform the variability of the advective time for each jump is such that the characteristic time t c evaluated for each space grid element spans over several orders of magnitude and it is distributed as shown in the inset of fig 4 we test the convergence assuming values of time interval proportional to the average characteristic time t c the results confirm the accuracy of the solution under a strong heterogeneity although some oscillations are observed at short times for the case of small time interval although results are sufficiently accurate for all the time intervals a small time interval may incur large computational time while if the time interval is very large temperatures are not calculated for short time i e time smaller than the time interval considering the large variability of the characteristic time in a heterogeneous medium the evaluation of a minimum and maximum time interval at the beginning of the simulation may be useful to prevent from this inconvenient 5 2 convergence analysis in the case of variable fracture aperture and velocity here we analyze the consequences of the thermo mechanical coupling for a single fracture we compare the heat transfer for the case of constant fracture aperture and velocity with the case when the fracture aperture and the flow velocity change because of the temperature dependent deformation we consider the same setting and parameter values as for the first case of section 5 1 with initial uniform semi aperture b 0 equal to 1 10 4 m and uniform space discretization δ x 1 m however to evaluate the velocity field variation consequent to the fracture aperture variation we distinguish two different cases of boundary conditions bcs at the inlet in one case we consider constant inflow in the other we assume constant pressure in both cases the outlet at x l is subject to a constant zero pressure bc and the initial velocity is v 0 2 5 10 2 m s since we consider the case of a single fracture with no intersections the condition of steady state flow at each time step implies that the flow is uniform along the trajectory although we show the results by means of dimensionless parameters the aperture variation depends on the injected temperature which we fix as t 0 10 c for the mechanical parameters the linear thermal expansion α t is 1 10 5 c 1 while the poisson ratio ν is 0 3 we consider three different time interval values from 0 1 t c 0 to 10 t c 0 in order to show the convergence performance under the circumstance of changing aperture the characteristic time t c 0 refers to the initial values of semi aperture b 0 and velocity v 0 therefore it has the same value as in the section 5 1 i e t c 0 0 5 days fig 5 shows the temporal variation of temperature and fracture semi aperture observed at one control plane placed at x 3 5 m from the inlet for the case with constant aperture and variable aperture under the two different bcs in the case analyzed here the cooling of the rock causes an increase in fracture aperture this implies the variation of both the flow velocity and the fluid volume exchanging heat with the rock this latter becomes larger which leads to smaller temperature variations for unitary advective displacement note that in the case of constant aperture the velocity is invariant regardless of the bc when the aperture is temperature dependent on the contrary the bc has a great impact on the velocity which is also shown in fig 6 where results are presented as a function of the longitudinal direction for the sole case with time interval equal to t c 0 if the inflow is kept constant at the inlet flow velocity changes proportionally to the inverse of the local fracture half aperture i e v x t b x t 1 this implies that the advective time increases proportionally to the increase of b which counterbalances the increase of fluid volume in contact with the rock therefore the characteristic time remains equal to the initial conditions and to the constant aperture case this has two consequences the first is that the convergence is not affected second the temperature response remains the same as in the constant case this equivalence of results is specific of considering a single trajectory in a one dimensional domain with two dimensional fractures in a three dimensional domain the variation in velocity promotes the migration of the trajectory towards faster preferential zones as we will see in section 7 the behavior is different when a constant pressure is imposed at the inlet in this case flow velocity is proportional to b x t i t 1 where i t 0 l b x t 3 dx according with the assumption that the cubic law applies locally see section 2 1 the characteristic time is therefore proportional to the square of i t for any x this non locality affects both the observed response and the convergence conditions at short times the increase in fracture aperture only occurs over a small portion of the domain observe fig 6 the velocity is reduced for short x and slightly increased for large x the value of the characteristic time is similar to the initial one which makes the temperature responses for constant and variable aperture comparable later on the aperture variation propagates to the rest of the domain which gives a major importance to the integral i compared to b the consequent acceleration of the temperature front in turn increases the propagation of the aperture variation which dramatically speeds up the heat transfer giving the abrupt evolution of temperature observed in fig 5 as said when a constant pressure bc is imposed the characteristic time of the problem changes according to the square of the space integral i which has direct consequences on the accuracy of the calculation if the aperture increases corresponding to a cooling of the rock the characteristic time decreases which means that the relationship δ t 0 t c increases this may generate less accurate results and lack of information fig 5 on the contrary if the rock is heated up the consequent reduction of b ensures that the relationship δ t 0 t c decreases and therefore that the accuracy is preserved as shown in supplementary information 5 3 validation of the thermo mechanical response the accuracy of the analytic evaluation of the tm fracture aperture eqs 22 and 35 is tested against results from a fully coupled thm numerical simulation performed with the finite element method simulator codebright olivella et al 1996 we consider a single fracture embedded in a rock matrix both the fracture and the rock are represented as porous media in the finite element simulator therefore we build the model in order to have it consistent with our assumptions we set the longitudinal thermal conductivity in the fracture as very low in order to the heat transport in the fracture be governed by advection according with the assumptions here a low intrinsic permeability is assigned to the rock matrix in order to make it consistent with our assumption that the rock is impermeable and that the heat transport in the rock is exclusively driven by thermal diffusion we impose a small pressure gradient with a highly conductive fracture to reduce the hydro mechanical deformations and only observe the thermo mechanical deformations the viscosity is set as insensitive to the temperature variations we assume constant velocity i e the fracture aperture variation does not affect the velocity field or the transport behavior thus we only evaluate the aperture variation in response to the temperature field generated by a continuous injection for a certain time the fracture is 100 m long with a steady state flow rate of 5 10 5 m2 s the rock thermal diffusivity d is equal to 1 6 10 6 m2 s and the parameter θ is approximately 0 9 we simulate 20 days of continuous injection of the temperature t 0 at the x 0 nevertheless we show the results in terms of dimensionless time which allows for extending them to other sets of parameters to this end the characteristic time t c θ 2 d τ 2 π b 2 is adopted as described in the previous section where the characteristic length for δ τ is set as equal to 1 m for the mechanical parameters the linear thermal expansion α t is 1 10 5 c 1 while the poisson ratio ν is 0 3 we set the domain size such that the mechanical boundary conditions do not affect the behavior fig 7 shows that the analytic estimation of both the temperature and the semi aperture variation is very accurate which confirms the validity of the assumptions described in section 2 3 we observe that considering the mechanical problem as one dimensional in z does not incur large errors because the lateral mechanical propagation of the displacement is reproduced by the smooth heat propagation small discrepancies are observed when the fluid temperature profile is sharp observe the blue and orange lines a condition that is slightly smoothed out by the fully coupled numerical simulator this impacts the rock temperature profiles and consequently the strains for short times 5 4 accuracy of the meta particle assumption as described in section 4 3 the memory diffusive heat exchange is calculated by making use of a meta particle concept i e at each time step we operate an averaging of the arrival time and temperature over the particles crossing each grid mesh element here we test the effects of this averaging by comparing the particle rock heat exchange flux and the particle temperatures after the diffusive exchange evaluated considering the meta particle eq 33 or the individual particle temperatures eq 29 to perform this analysis we consider observing one location at which 10 particles arrive with a certain distribution of passage time and temperature we evaluate the fluid rock heat exchange for each particle j p and the consequent outgoing particle temperature after having exchanged j p for a δ τ 1 s this is performed for several observation times corresponding to the passage of particle sets released at different t 0 the parameters b θ and d are set as in section 5 1 the characteristic time for the unitary δ τ is therefore equal to 50 s without loss of generality we consider stationary trajectories i e the particle sets released at different t 0 cross the control location with constant in time values of passage time τ their probability density function pdf follows an upper truncated power law distribution with exponent γ such as pdf τ γ τ γ 1 τ m γ τ m γ the minimum and maximum cutoff values τ m and τ m are set as 10s and 1010s respectively we explore two scenarios with values of γ equal to 0 5 and 2 5 for the time interval of particle release δ t 0 we consider different values corresponding to ratios of τ m τ m to δ t 0 ranging between 0 1 and 1 each particle crosses the control location with a temperature correlated with its passage time and with the observation time by means of the relation t erfc τ t according with eq 13 where we assume that the imposed initial temperature is t 0 50 c this assumption reflects the condition in which the particles have traveled through independent trajectories before converging to the control location therefore particle temperature increases with increasing observation time and with decreasing passage time i e fast particles have higher temperature than slow ones moreover the variability is large for short observation time and it reduces as the observation time increases for each scenario we perform 100 realizations and we evaluate the average of the maximum differences in particle exit temperature fig 8 a and b show results at different observation times for one realization of the case with γ 0 5 and δ t 0 τ m τ m to improve visualization results are plotted with a frequency time smaller than δ t 0 panel a shows the diffusive heat exchanged by each particle j p at the observed location and at different times when the contribution of all particles blue markers or the meta particle contribution orange markers is considered at each observation time the particles cross the location with temperature proportional with their passage time the heat that a particle exchanges depends on its temperature and on the local rock temperature therefore j p is larger for the first arrival particles which have a higher temperature observe the inset plot hottest particles undergo a positive heat exchange they give heat while coldest particles undergo a negative heat exchange they receive heat in both cases the absolute values of j p first increase with time and eventually decrease as larger rock volumes are heated up this time of trend inversion depends on the particle passage times and temperatures for the example analyzed here the inversion time is larger than the simulated time for the slowest particles so we do not observe any reduction of j p for those particles note also the sign variation of j p for particles with intermediate velocity which indicates that they receive heat at the beginning while they give heat later results show that considering all the values of particle temperature and passage time or the meta particle average values gives similar results compare the blue and orange markers after having exchanged j p the particles exit the location with a new temperature fig 8b shows the relative difference between the outgoing temperatures evaluated with the meta particle values and considering the particle contributions with their respective τ and t values are normalized with respect to the latter after the first observation time when the two methods give the same outgoing temperatures they diverge in particular the error is positive but small when the meta particle method is adopted and it reduces with time the trend is similar when other scenarios are analyzed for which the maximum positive and negative errors averaged over the 100 realizations are shown in fig 8c results are shown for the two scenarios of γ with each line of the plot corresponding to a different value of the time interval δ t 0 and columns representing different observation times the error associated with the meta particle averaging operation is always positive the maximum negative colorplot exhibits zero values the accuracy of the averaging operation is sensitive to the ratio of τ m τ m to δ t 0 which we explore by varying δ t 0 the error increases when the ratio increases reflecting that the averaging process incurs overestimation of the particle temperature if the time interval is similar to the maximum difference in particle arrival time this occurs under all the assumed scenarios but it is particularly evident for smaller γ i e when the number of particles with large arrival time is larger moreover the error is larger for short times and decreases as the time increases which is a consequence of the reduction of the variability in particle arrival temperature with time in general large variability increases the error yet the maximum error is overall smaller than 5 which confirms the accuracy of the meta particle method although we have performed the analysis assuming the case of a hot fluid injection the same normalized results would be found in the case of cold injection 6 comparison with classical solution for multiple stationary and independent trajectories if thermal deformations are neglected the fracture aperture and the velocity fields are constant in time this implies that the trajectories are stationary for the duration of the heat injection under this circumstance it seems natural to extend the solution of section 3 1 to the case of multiple trajectories which is easily carried out by evaluating eq 13 on each trajectory for a given time this approach has been proposed by several authors for the case of pulse or continuous injection of solute tracer e g yamashita and kimura 1990 cvetkovic et al 1999 tsang and tsang 2001 liu et al 2007 and recently applied to the case of heat injection gisladottir et al 2016 the adoption of this methodology implicitly entails neglecting the mutual effects between neighboring trajectories for all the duration of the injection thus each trajectory is independent from the others and the fluid rock heat exchange on one trajectory depends exclusively on the temperature evolution in time on the same trajectory this is equivalent to consider that the heat exchanged by the generic particle p at the time interval i is 38 j p i x κ c m π t p i x δ t 0 j 1 i 1 t p j x f t 0 i t 0 j neglecting the effects of the lateral diffusion between neighboring trajectories is reasonable in the case of a pulse injection because the time is too short for the heat to diffuse in the rock over the distance between the trajectories the question is whether this assumption is valid for the case of a long continuous injection which we analyze and discuss in this section to illustrate the effects of the assumption of independent trajectories when several particles crosses close locations we perform the same analysis of section 5 4 in which we have considered that the trajectories and the velocity field are stationary we compare the results obtained with our approach with the ones obtained from the approach of section 3 1 extended to multiple flow paths the difference between the two methods is analyzed using the results evaluated with the contribution of all particles taken individually as the reference in order to avoid interference with the error associated with the meta particle assumption fig 9 a shows that the assumption of independent flow paths leads to overestimate or underestimate j p observe the green markers because it is assumed to be exclusively a function of the temperature evolution on the particle trajectory therefore j p is underestimated for the hottest particles and overestimated for the coldest ones observe that when trajectories are not independent blue markers j p is negative for the slowest and coldest particles because the rock matrix has increased its temperature so the diffusive heat flux is reverted the cold particle can receive the heat released by the hot ones this effect is not captured under the assumption of independent flow paths as a consequence of the large differences in j p the estimation of the exit temperature under the assumption of independent flow paths incurs substantial differences which however decrease in time fig 9b the error is positive for most particles but the negative error is larger that the positive reflecting that the temperature is significantly underestimated for a few particles this is a consequence of the assumed distribution of arrival time and temperature with more particles with hot temperature than with low temperature the heating of the rock matrix due to the hot particle contributions is not captured in the case of independent trajectories as expected the negative error is larger for the late arriving particles which are the coldest ones since the particle entrance temperature is proportional to the erfc 1 t the error decreases with time as all the particles tend to similar temperatures results shown in fig 9a and b refer to the case with exponent of the passage times pdf distribution γ equal to 0 5 which corresponds to a case with high probability of having particles with large arrival time and low temperature when many of such extremely slow particles exist the classical method fails in estimating their temperatures and large relative errors are observed with negative values up to 100 and positive values below 8 the behavior is however highly sensitive to the probability distribution exponent fig 9c in fact the existence of a large number of particles with very different arrival times and temperatures constitutes a situation far from the independent trajectories assumption while if many particles exhibit similar temperature and arrival time the system approaches the behavior of a single trajectory for this reason the negative relative error is smaller than 30 when γ 2 5 indicating the two methods give similar results notice also that the difference between the two methods is almost insensitive to the time interval value a slight increase of the error is observed for decreasing time interval because for short time interval the particle temperatures are more often adjusted when based on the previous particle transition while the time interval does not impact the results in the case of independent trajectories as also commented in section 5 4 the error decreases with time coinciding with a reduction of the variability of particle arrival temperature despite the large difference observed for a few particle temperatures the average temperature estimated over the ensemble of particles gives similar values with the two methods because most particles have similar arrival times this means that if the average temperature results are observed at a control point coinciding with the observation location here we observe similar temperature whether we adopt the classical method or the new one however results evaluated at a downstream control section with one method or the other may differ if particles diverge as they bring a different temperature it is clear that under certain conditions the mutual effect between converging flow paths may affect the behavior and it should therefore be considered the analysis performed here and in section 5 4 is intended to represent some of the most critical cases in fact trajectories with such heterogeneous characteristics converging into the same location reflects an extreme case that is hardly encountered in fracture networks where adjacent trajectories typically exhibit similar arrival times we further analyze and discuss the difference between the two methods by observing the result on a dfn in the next section 7 heat transport in a dfn to analyze the effects of the thermo mechanical rock deformation on the heat transport in a fracture network we compare the results from simulations with temperature dependent fracture aperture and with constant fracture aperture we also show the results evaluated with the classical approach of independent stationary trajectories recall section 6 we consider a simple dfn composed by 10 fractures with equal fracture semi aperture b 10 4 m corresponding to a transmissivity approximately equal to 7 10 6 m2 s the domain has a cubic volume of 100 m side a temperature colder than the resident fluid by 50 c is injected from one section of the domain on which we consider two scenarios of boundary conditions one with constant inflow the other with constant pressure while constant pressure equal to zero is imposed at the opposite section the constant inflow is set as equal to 3 10 3 m3 s while the constant pressure is 5 mpa the two scenarios generating similar velocity fields to perform the simulation 500 particles are introduced in the system from the inlet at each time step the resulting pdf distribution of particle travel times from inlet to outlet follows a power law with exponent slightly larger than 2 and the maximum value is 2 10 4 s fig 10 left panel the characteristic time for the single jumps spans over 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 10 1 s to 10 9 s with an average value of 3 10 6 s and a pdf distribution as shown in fig 10 right panel according with these values the time interval δ t 0 is set as equal to 1 10 6 s approximately 11 days different values of particle number and time interval have been also considered to ensure that results are independent on these factors see supplementary information for illustrative purposes we first consider injecting only four particles at each time step for the scenario with fixed inflow boundary condition at the inlet fig 11 shows the velocity field and trajectories of the four particles at the initial time and at time equal to 2 10 7 s for the case of temperature dependent fracture aperture as the velocity field evolve in time particle trajectories migrate towards faster flow paths these correspond to zones where the fracture aperture and transmissivity has increased as a consequence of the rock cooling and contraction observe panel c it is worth noting that given the fixed inflow bc flow velocity decreases everywhere in the network but it is larger where the fracture aperture increases which is different from what observed for the one dimensional domain in section 5 2 this different behavior is related to the increased complexity of the flow field the example above illustrates that the injection of a cold fluid and the consequent rock contraction and fracture aperture increase may cause the progressive concentration of the heat transport along preferential fast flow paths to analyze the consequence of this behavior on the heat transport we analyze the results of the simulation with the full set of 500 particles fig 12 shows the temporal evolution of the temperature at the outlet evaluated as the average temperature over the cross section the comparison of the results for the two cases of constant and variable fracture aperture shows that heat transport is significantly accelerated when fracture aperture is temperature dependent this behavior is observed for both scenarios of boundary conditions but the temperature profile is sharper when constant pressure is imposed at the inlet this is not only a consequence of the non locality of the velocity field under this boundary condition as observed in section 5 2 but it also depends on the particle injection mode since particles at the inlet are distributed proportionally to the flow velocity at each time step more particles are injected in places with increased flow velocity this mechanisms means that velocity will significantly increase on initially high velocity paths enlarging the difference between slow and fast paths when the imposed boundary condition is of constant inflow particles are uniformly distributed over the inlet section however as observed in fig 11 particles tend to migrate towards faster regions which promotes the advective transport resulting in a faster temperature response than in the case with constant aperture where the trajectories are stationary this migration explains the difference from what was observed for the one dimensional domain where the fracture with temperature dependent aperture exhibits the same behavior than the fracture with constant aperture compare fig 12 with fig 5 in general the dramatic acceleration of the advective transport is the primary reason for the faster heat transfer there are however additional mechanisms involved the passage through fractures with larger aperture implies a smaller diffusive temperature variation because the fluid volume in contact with the rock surface is larger or equivalently the surface of diffusive exchange per fluid volume is smaller recall eq 3 moreover the heat moves through rocks already affected by significant temperature variations which reduces the temperature gradient at the fracture rock interface and therefore the heat exchange flux in the specific example here all trajectories converge to the same fracture at the outlet fig 11 it is therefore interesting to compare the results of the case with constant fracture aperture against the results estimated by means of the classical method of independent trajectories fig 12 shows that the two methods give similar values of average temperature at the outlet however the individual particle temperature evolution fig 13 shows that the assumption of independent trajectories implies a small overestimation and a large underestimation of the particle temperature which is similar to what observed in section 6 this occurs for a small number of particles and therefore the temperature estimated as the average over all the particle temperatures is similar nevertheless the error may propagate if particles diverge down stream which will be the focus of future investigations 8 discussion the formulation presented above is ideally conceived to modeling heat transport with thermo mechanical effects due to continuous non isothermal injection into a complex fracture system such as in the case of geothermal technologies eulerian numerical models such as finite element or finite difference methods typically suffer from numerical instability in solving transport problems especially when the advective front is sharp lagrangian methods overcome this problem but in general they do not allow taking into account variability in time of the parameters the hybrid approach proposed in this paper provides a stable algorithm for the transport advective diffusive problem while keeping the variable in time nature of the parameters the adoption of a grid defined memory diffusive heat exchange allows us to deal with trajectories that change in time because of the thermal deformation of the host rock the analytic solution of both the diffusive and the mechanical part of the problem sensibly reduces the computational cost these remarkable advantages imply the cost of sacrificing some of the complexities of the problem injection of cold fluids in fractured media causes an increase in pore pressure and a decrease in temperature both processes leading to an increase in the fracture aperture koh et al 2011 ghassemi and tao 2016 the two processes act on very different time scales with heat transfer occurring at very large time scale compared to the pressure diffusion de simone et al 2017 building on this concept we disregard the hm fracture aperture variation and we concentrate on the solely tm elastic deformations this conceptually corresponds to analyzing the long term effects after the early time pressure driven deformations have occurred at the same time we disregard some complexity intrinsic to the coupled thm process like the transient undrained increase in pore pressure consequent to the thermal deformation of low transmissivity saturated rocks since we assume impermeable rock mass fluid pressure leak off and the associated hydro mechanical rock deformation are also disregarded these effects may be significant in certain situations whose modeling requires the use of fully coupled thm simulations rutqvist et al 2002 variation of fluid density and viscosity due to temperature variations has not been considered but it can be easily incorporated as a feature of the velocity field update we also make the assumption that the matrix is infinite in the direction perpendicular to the fracture walls this is of course an over simplification whose effect is twofold on the one hand diffusion through the matrix may lead to temperature variations in fractures not directly involved by advective processes or to faster temperature variations in fractures where the advective transport is slow thus neglecting the finite size of the rock may lead to overestimations of the transfer times roubinet et al 2010 on the other hand the infinite matrix assumption does not consider that the deformation of the rock matrix may affect the aperture of other fractures both effects take place for time larger than the diffusive time over the distance between two fractures d t d d 2 d which is approximately 11 days if d 1 m and 3 years if d 10 m this time constitutes a threshold for the validity of our formulation and relaxing this limitation will be object of future work with respect to the heat transport within the fractures we assume the parallel plate model with transverse diffusion into the matrix however field experiments have shown that rough fractures often exhibit flow concentration into channels which have diffusive interfaces more similar to tubes than to planes klepikova et al 2016 de la bernardie et al 2018 this leads to a faster heat transfer and a different scaling in time with respect to the parallel plate model the incorporation of these features is beyond the scope of this paper but it will be the object of future developments although no explicit term relative to lateral diffusion is included in our formulation section 2 2 its effects are somehow modeled by means of the memory diffusive heat exchange whose values are updated at each time step as the result of a temperature homogenization over each mesh element recall section 4 this operation may appear mesh size dependent however a necessary condition to get representative results in any particle tracking simulation is considering a large number of particles when a sufficient large number of particles is introduced in the system neighboring mesh elements undergo similar temperature variations thus the mesh size does not have great impacts on the resulting temperature field for the same reason we do not explicitly introduce any lateral diffusion between mesh elements the operation of rock temperature homogenization over the mesh grid marks the difference with respect to the classical method where trajectories are assumed as independent and the fracture rock heat exchange is independently evaluated on each trajectory the assumption of independent trajectories may be limiting in cases where different trajectories cross neighboring locations at different times because previous variations of the rock temperature due to the contribution of other particles are disregarded this may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of j which is significant if the particles converge to the same mesh element with very different travel times a condition that is scarcely encountered in most dfn section 6 similar to any other numerical method based on time increments the accuracy and efficiency of the here proposed method is affected by the adopted time interval as discussed in section 4 the adoption of a time interval larger than the advective time for traveling from the inlet to the outlet is convenient to prevent the simultaneous presence of multiple particle sets in the system and the associated memory demand time intervals larger than the advective travel time variance are convenient to prevent large errors associated with the meta particle assumption section 5 4 finally a large time interval helps in speeding up the simulation time on the other hand we have shown that time intervals much larger than the problem characteristic time may give less accurate results see section 5 1 it is clear that an evaluation of the optimal time interval is required previous to performing the simulation in order to find a value large enough to ensure efficiency while preserving accuracy defining a time interval that meet the above discussed requirements is however not difficult provided the range of values that define the problem for the sake of simplicity consider the time for a particle to travel a distance l as equal to the number of jumps over the mesh elements m multiplied by the average time for the jump δ τ we seek for a δ t 0 larger than the total travel time but smaller than the characteristic time for the jump i e δ t 0 m δ τ and δ t 0 d δ τ 2 π b 2 where d is approximately 10 6 m2 s for rocks and b typically ranges between 10 6 and 10 2 m2 for example if the average value of b is 10 4 m2 the average velocity is 10 3 m s l 100 and the average mesh size equal to 1 m then m 100 δ τ 10 3 s and the optimum δ t 0 is between 10 5 s and 10 7 s nevertheless the variability of the characteristic time for the single jump may be large fig 10 as it is defined by the spatial variability of fracture aperture flow velocity and jump length the latter is related with the mesh size which can be highly variable in networks with many intersections and large variability of the fracture size the jump length is very small when the trajectory crosses small mesh elements or mesh element corners which requires reducing the time interval the consequent increase of computational time may be significant especially in the case of complex networks with large number of fractures and particles improving this aspect is crucial to reduce the computational time and it will be the topic of future work 9 conclusions we have proposed and validated a new formulation to simulate advective diffusive heat transport in heterogeneous three dimensional fracture networks with thermo mechanical fracture aperture and flow velocity variation the method is conceived to be implemented into a particle tracking approach where each particle holds a temperature that changes because of the diffusive exchange with the rock matrix the diffusive flux and the associate thermo mechanical rock deformation are estimated adopting a semi analytic scheme with time discretization this allows to consider trajectory variations due to thermo mechanical deformations to our best knowledge the current study represents the first attempt to incorporate the thermo mechanical behavior of the rock matrix into a particle tracking method further work will entail overcoming the limiting assumption of infinite rock matrix and perfectly planar fractures as well as improving the time interval control to ensure accuracy although subject to several simplifications the methodology enables investigating the reservoir long term tm behavior while keeping the computational effort within reasonable values the computation time is in fact of the order of minutes hours compared with the hours days required by fully coupled methods our formulation is therefore ideal for stochastic modeling which allows exploring the uncertainty in cases when the site characterization is poor for this reason this method represents a useful tool for the identification of potential bottlenecks the design of optimal strategies for heat recovery and the management of geothermal system exploitation credit authorship contribution statement silvia de simone

3876,modeling heat transfer in complex heterogeneous fractured system is key for geothermal energy applications discrete fracture network dfn modeling is the classical framework to reproduce the advective part of the transport which is determined by the fracture connectivity and heterogeneity this approach in general sacrifices the representation of the rock matrix disregarding both its diffusive heat exchange with the fractures and the effects of its thermo mechanical deformation on the fracture aperture here we propose a new semi analytic formulation that can be implemented in a dfn simulator with particle tracking approach the contribution of the rock matrix in terms of diffusive heat exchange and thermal contraction expansion is analytically evaluated which respectively impact the advective heat transfer and the fracture aperture variation the method is proved to be accurate and robust results from simulations of cold fluid injection show that rock contraction affects the transmissivity which accelerates the advective transport resulting in a faster recovery of cold fluid at the outlet the methodology enables investigating the reservoir behavior and optimizing the geothermal performance while keeping the computational effort within reasonable values this allows exploring the uncertainty in cases when the in situ characterization is poor which is the spirit of the dfn modeling keywords heat transport particle tracking discrete fracture network geothermal systems thermo hydro mechanical coupling 1 introduction deep geothermal energy represents a powerful and clean energy prospect with the potential to generate huge and virtually unlimited energy giardini 2009 tester et al 2007 geothermal plants generally involve the circulation of fluids into hot reservoirs located in the crystalline basement characterized by a very low permeability of the rock mass and a complex system of preexisting natural fractures jung 2013 enhancement of fracture transmissivity is often performed by means of massive fluid injection during the preliminary stimulation stage leading to the development of the so called enhanced geothermal systems egs both before and after the stimulation operations a full characterization of the rock and fracture properties is difficult which increases the uncertainty on the heat extraction performance in this context numerical modeling is a key instrument to forecast the potential heat production of geothermal reservoirs under a number of scenarios baria et al 1999 heat transfer in fractured reservoirs is driven by fluid advection through the fracture network and diffusion in the host rock the first process defines the spatial extension of the affected domain while the second one controls the fluid solid heat exchange and therefore the geothermal performance bruel 2002 the behavior may be complex because the two processes are coupled and because of the heterogeneity of the flow velocity and fracture aperture fields in the network becker and shapiro 2003 the complexity is further increased when thermal deformations are taken into account long term fluid circulation leads to the cooling and consequent contraction of the host rock which tends to increase the fracture aperture koh et al 2011 the variation of the fracture aperture has two effects on the one hand it affects the fluid filled fracture volume that exchanges heat with the rock through the fracture surface and therefore the exchanged heat on the other hand it may imply a variation of the flow velocity which in turn affects the heat advective transport slowing down or speeding up the heat production a potential consequence is the opening of new fast flow paths that may short circuit the connection between the paired injection and extraction wells with negative impacts on the geothermal production mcdermott et al 2006 quantifying these processes is crucial for the design and optimization of heat extraction however modeling these processes in heterogeneous fractured systems poses a number of numerical challenges because they occur on very different length and time scales and because of the large variability of fracture size and transmissivity bonnet et al 2001 bour and davy 1997 bour and davy 1999 de dreuzy et al 2001 davy et al 2010 continuum based approaches accurately reproduce the fully coupled thermo hydro mechanical thm process but they are not able to reproduce the intricate structure of fractured reservoir unless the fracture system is dense enough to be represented as an equivalent porous medium discrete fracture network dfn modeling is the most appropriate framework to reproduce the advective part of the problem which is determined by the fracture connectivity and heterogeneity however the representation of the diffusive heat exchange with the rock matrix and of the thermo mechanical tm coupling suffers from some limitations jing 2003 a number of dfn based approaches focuses on the advective transport in the network of connected fractures disregarding the effects of the rock matrix e g frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2019 however the diffusive exchange between fracture and rock is recognized as playing a key role in all transport problems carrera et al 1998 and in particular in the case of heat transfer moreover the mechanical response of fractures to heat is due to the rock thermal expansion or contraction thus it depends on the portion of the rock matrix affected by thermal diffusion and on the rock properties discrete fracture matrix dfm models reproduce the behavior of fractures embedded in a rock matrix through explicit representation of rock blocks e g hu et al 2017 odsæter et al 2019 flemisch et al 2018 although this approach is accurate and it may be combined with the numerical simulation of the thermal deformations it incurs high computational cost which limits the number of fractures that may be explicitly represented or the number of scenarios that may be analyzed see lei et al 2017 for a comprehensive review to represent the exchange with the rock the assumption of a diffusive heat flux perpendicular to the fracture plane is widely adopted which can be solved analytically the adoption of analytic solutions greatly reduces the computational effort which allows for stochastic modeling of large three dimensional reservoirs with thousands of fractures several authors have combined lagrangian particle tracking solvers and analytic solutions of the diffusion process to reproduce transport of solute mass of chemical species dagan et al 1992 cvetkovic et al 1999 painter and cvetkovic 2005 the framework has been recently applied to heat transport by gisladottir et al 2016 in many cases the approach is limited by some underlying assumptions the first is the one of infinite matrix which is reasonable only for short time or large fracture spacing the second is that the trajectories are stationary in time and independent on each other in addition the tm coupling is rarely contemplated in this context in this paper we present a new simplified methodology to simulate heat transfer in fractured media taking into account the diffusive exchange with the rock matrix and the consequent thermo mechanical fracture aperture variation due to rock deformation the methodology is based on a particle tracking approach and it is similar to the method of the characteristics konikow and bredehoeft 1978 the contribution of the rock matrix in terms of diffusive heat exchange and thermal contraction expansion is analytically evaluated which respectively impact the heat transfer and the fracture aperture variation this latter in turns affects the heat transfer and the velocity field which is updated in time assuming quasi steady state conditions we disregard the effects of the pore pressure variations on the fracture aperture and in the rock hydro mechanical hm coupling however we do take into account the impact of the flow velocity on the heat transfer as well as the effects of the temperature on the fracture aperture and the impact of the aperture variation on the flow velocity we therefore describe this approach as a model for simulating t h m coupling given its semi analytic nature this formulation allows reproducing heat transport in temperature dependent complex fracture networks while keeping the computational time within reasonable values in the following we first introduce the conceptual model and summarize the governing equations then we show the classical analytic solution for a single trajectory with constant in time fracture aperture and velocity afterwards we present the detail of the proposed semi analytic method for single trajectory with temperature dependent fracture aperture and velocity we show that extending the second approach to the case of multiple trajectories allows us to deal with non stationary trajectories in a changing environment after presenting the details of the method its implementation and validation we compare the behavior for constant and non constant fracture aperture and velocity for the case of a single trajectory and we discuss the numerical issues and the implications finally we show results for a dfn and we discuss the effects of non stationary trajectories on the observed temperatures 2 governing equations and assumptions let a heterogeneous fracture network be composed by connected fractures embedded in a rock matrix we assume that each fracture is planar and perfectly symmetric with respect to its central axis and thus we refer to the semi volume fig 1 the fracture half aperture b x t is variable in time and space where x represents the coordinate vector in the fracture plane and t is time the variability in space is smooth such that we can keep the assumption of planar fracture as valid no distinction is made between hydraulic aperture and mechanical aperture and fracture roughness is disregarded we focus on the thermo mechanic processes occurring for long term non isothermal injection and we do not consider the fracture aperture variations due to pressure increase which mostly occur during the stimulation phase or at the beginning of injection operations baria et al 1999 fracture failure with either opening mode i or shearing mode ii mechanism is not contemplated here and linear elastic behavior is assumed creation of new fractures or propagation of the pre existing ones are also neglected this conceptual model is used in the following to illustrate the governing equations for flow heat transport and mechanical deformation with respect to a single fracture and it is successively extended to the case of a streamline through a fracture network 2 1 fluid flow we consider that fractures are fluid saturated and that fluid flow occurs exclusively in the fracture network while the rock matrix is impermeable conservation of fluid mass for unit volume of fracture gives the flow equation for the fracture 1 b x t t b x t v x t w 0 where we have assumed homogeneous fluid density and incompressible fluid the term w represents a sink source while v x t is the fluid flow velocity vector that is proportional to the pressure gradient p assuming the validity of the cubic law with the fracture hydraulic aperture coinciding with the mechanical aperture and equal to 2 b it reads 2 v x t 4 b x t 2 12 μ p x t where μ is the fluid viscosity the boundary conditions bcs at the inlet can be either of imposed pressure or flow rate in the following we assume that the fracture aperture variation is slow which allows for considering quasi steady state conditions for flow i e the velocity field does not change over a certain time under this condition the first term of eq 1 vanishes 2 2 heat transport we consider that heat transfer occurs by fluid advection within the fracture system and by thermal diffusion within the rock matrix mostly in the direction orthogonal to the fracture lateral diffusion is disregarded both in the fracture and in the matrix but we will partly introduce this effect in the following we also assume infinite diffusive matrix and flat temperature profile within the fracture thickness according to this setting the heat transport within the fracture is described by the energy balance for an arbitrary semi volume of fracture carrera et al 1998 3 b x t c t x t t b x t c v x t t x t j x t where c is the fluid heat capacity assumed as constant and t x t represents the fluid temperature in the fracture j x t is the diffusive heat flux that the fluid exchanges with the rock matrix per unit surface which is defined as 4 j x t κ t m x z t z z b where κ is the rock thermal conductivity assumed as constant and z is the coordinate in the direction normal to the fracture with origin at the fracture center the temperature in the matrix t m x z t is given by the energy balance 5 c m t m x z t t κ 2 t m x z t z 2 for b z c m represents the rock heat capacity assumed as constant eqs 3 and 5 are coupled by means of eq 4 and they have to be solved together another coupling condition is provided by the temperature continuity at the fracture wall i e the fluid temperature in the fracture is equal to the rock temperature at the fracture edge which defines a bc for eq 5 6 t m x b t t x t x t the other bc for eq 5 is given by the hypothesis of infinite matrix without any loss of generality we assume that the initial temperature is uniform in the system and equal to 0 both in the fractures and in the rock different initial conditions are easily reproduced by considering the temperature values as temperature variations we want to solve the problem of continuous imposed fluid temperature at one extreme of the fracture x x 0 which is also considered as infinite in the longitudinal direction therefore the initial and boundary conditions for the matrix and the fracture are the following 7 t m x z 0 0 t x 0 0 t m x b t t x t t x 0 t t 0 t t m x t 0 t t 0 2 3 mechanical deformation the rock matrix behaves as a linear elastic material which under non isothermal conditions is governed by the constitutive law timoshenko and goodier 1951 8 σ 2 g ε λ ε vol i 2 g 3 λ α t t m i where σ is the stress tensor g and λ are the shear and lamé moduli respectively α t is the linear thermal expansion coefficient i is the identity matrix ε 1 2 u u t is the strain tensor and ε vol u is the volumetric strain which corresponds to ε x ε y ε z u x x u y y u z z where u is the displacement vector stresses strains and displacements evolve in time in response to changes in temperature the stress tensor refers to stress variation if an initial stress 0 is assumed we assume the sign convention such that tensile stress and extensional strain are positive the x and y axes are taken as respectively parallel and transverse to the flow direction in the fracture plane while the z axis is perpendicular to the fracture wall the mechanical equilibrium in absence of body and surface forces is therefore expressed by 9 g 2 u g λ u 2 g 3 λ α t t m where we observe that the deformation is driven by the temperature gradient note that the effects of the pore pressure variation is neglected as the rock matrix is assumed as impermeable considering a uniform temperature profile zero gradient in the fracture in plane transverse direction we can assume plane strain conditions in the y direction i e ε y 0 the deformations in the direction longitudinal to the fracture are disregarded because they are small given the temperature distribution we also assume free thermal deformation in the direction transverse to the fracture into the matrix which implies that the corresponding compressive stress is zero i e σ z 0 furthermore we disregard the shear stress τ xz based on the assumption that the temperature gradient is smooth in the longitudinal direction we test and discuss these assumptions in section 5 3 under these hypothesis the problem is greatly simplified into the one dimensional equilibrium equation along the direction z for each location x such as eq 9 translates into 10 2 u z x z t z 2 1 ν 1 ν α t t m x z t z b z where ν is the poisson ratio and the following relation holds 1 ν 1 ν 2 g 3 λ 2 g λ the displacement u z is found by solving eq 10 under the boundary conditions of free displacement i e zero stress at z b and infinite rock matrix i e zero displacement at z at each fracture location and time the variation of the semi aperture with respect to the initial conditions δ b x t b x t b x 0 is equal to the displacement undergone by the fracture wall in the direction perpendicular to the fracture u z x b t such as 11 δ b x t u z x b t b 1 ν 1 ν α t t m x z t d z note that the expression corresponds to the integral over space of the rock matrix thermal deformation ε z u z z because we assume that the displacement is 0 at z where the temperature variation is zero 3 solutions for a single flow path 3 1 single flow path with constant fracture aperture and flow velocity assume a single flow path with longitudinal coordinate ℓ parallel to the flow direction and constant in time fracture aperture such as b b ℓ in this framework the fluid flow is steady state and the velocity is constant and equal to v ℓ the energy balance of eq 3 is therefore simplified into 12 t ℓ t t v ℓ t ℓ t ℓ j ℓ t cb ℓ this problem can be solved analytically as proposed by several authors e g liu et al 2007 and as we summarize in appendix a the temperature evolution in the fluid and in the rock matrix in the case of constant temperature bc at ℓ ℓ 0 are therefore expressed respectively as 13 t ℓ t t 0 erfc θ d b 2 t τ t τ t ℓ t 0 t τ 14 t m ℓ z t t 0 erfc θ db z b 2 d t τ t τ t m ℓ t 0 t τ where d κ c m is the rock thermal diffusion θ is the ratio of rock to fluid heat capacity i e θ c m c while τ and b represent the fluid advective travel time and the flow wetted surface moreno and neretnieks 1993 respectively 15 τ ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v ℓ b ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v ℓ b ℓ note that for t τ the response of eq 13 is controlled by the relationship between t and the characteristic time θ 2 db 2 4 solution of eq 13 corresponds to the convolution over time of the response to an instantaneous pulse injection cvetkovic et al 1999 painter and cvetkovic 2005 in fact given the linearity of the process the superposition principle can be applied in the case of uniform velocity and fracture aperture eq 13 coincides with the solution for a single fracture proposed by tang et al 1981 3 2 single flow path with temperature dependent fracture aperture and flow velocity we assume the same setting as in the previous section consisting in a single trajectory defined by the longitudinal coordinate ℓ but with temperature dependent fracture aperture and flow velocity b ℓ t and v ℓ t the non linearity of the problem hinders the derivation of a closed analytic solution considering a lagrangian approach we transform the eulerian variables defined at ℓ t into the lagrangian variables defined at τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 where t 0 t τ and τ is the travel time to reach the position ℓ for a moving front originated at coordinate ℓ 0 at time t 0 and displacing along the trajectory by advection such as 16 τ ℓ 0 ℓ d ℓ v τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 all lagrangian quantities are locally equal to their respective eulerian quantities such as 17 υ τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 υ ℓ t 0 τ for simplicity we adopt the same nomenclature for the eulerian and lagrangian quantities but we use a different notation to distinguish them where the presence of the semicolon indicates the lagrangian quantities according to this framework the energy balance in the fracture can be expressed as the variation of temperature of a moving front cvetkovic et al 1999 18 t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 t t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 τ j ℓ τ t 0 c b ℓ τ t 0 where we keep the terms in the right hand side of the equation in terms of eulerian quantities ackwowleging the identity of eq 17 the left hand side of the equation can be rewritten in terms of total derivative d d τ t τ such as 19 d d τ t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 j ℓ τ t 0 c b ℓ τ t 0 note that both the front temperature and velocity are not only a function of the position and therefore of the travel time τ but they are also a function of the kick off time t 0 and therefore of the global elapsed time t t 0 τ the initial value of the front temperature t 0 ℓ 0 t 0 constitutes a boundary condition of the problem the temperature t decays during the travel because of the diffusive heat exchange with the rock j this latter is defined in the eulerian field and it is a function of the matrix temperature gradient at the fracture matrix interface eq 4 the temperature in the matrix t m ℓ z t is the result of the diffusion problem recall eq 5 whose linearity still holds solution of this latter for a variable bc allows us to obtain an expression for j as the integral of the pulse heat transfer flux over the time appendix b 20 j ℓ t κ 0 t t m ℓ b t 2 π d t t 3 2 exp z b 2 4 d t t 1 z b 2 2 d t t d t z b the temperature at the fracture rock interface t m ℓ b t is also defined in the eulerian field and it is determined through continuity by the temperature of the front that is at that position at that specific time such as 21 t m ℓ b t t ℓ t t τ ℓ ℓ 0 t 0 t τ the formulation detailed so far acknowledges the variable in time nature of the fracture aperture which changes in response to the thermal deformation of the rock matrix for example the rock shrinks when it is cooled down which causes an increase of the fracture aperture while the rock expands when it is warmed up which causes a decrease of the fracture aperture within the rock matrix both the heat diffusion and the elastic deformation are linear problems so superposition in time and space applies replacing t m ℓ z t in eq 11 by its expression in eq b 1 and solving the integral in z we get 22 δ b ℓ t 1 ν 1 ν α t d π 0 t t m ℓ b t t t d t where we highlight that a negative temperature variation causes an increase in fracture aperture in the following we extend this approach to the case of multiple trajectories and we solve eqs 19 22 by adopting a semi analytic scheme with time and space discretization 4 formulation for multiple flow paths in heterogeneous deformable fractured systems 4 1 lagrangian fluid volume particles we now consider a three dimensional heterogeneous fractured system to solve the problem detailed in section 2 we start by discretizing the duration of the injection in time steps t 0 with interval δ t 0 we assume that the fracture aperture variation is slow so as we consider the flow as quasi steady state i e steady state conditions applies during each time step with constant fracture aperture and velocity field under this assumption we consider that the fluid flow is solved numerically by finite difference or finite element methods over a mesh grid at each time step the fracture aperture variation and the consequent new fracture aperture 2 b x t 0 and velocity v x t 0 fields are estimated once the velocity field in the fracture network is determined it is possible to define multiple flow paths following the maximum pressure gradients and to simulate the advective transport by means of a lagrangian particle tracking approach dagan and bresler 1979 the condition of imposing a fixed temperature t 0 at the inlet corresponds to imposing the heat energy e 0 cv 0 t 0 over a fluid volume v 0 entering the system for the duration of each time step i e v 0 q 0 δ t 0 where q 0 is the injected flow rate we represent this energy as an ensemble of n particles which are released at each t 0 at locations x 0 on the boundary particles are considered as fluid cells with equal volumes whose sum equates the hot cold volume introduced in the domain v 0 the particle volumes do not undergo any change during the travel i e any deformation keeps the volume unchanged see top picture of fig 2 although the conceptualization of particles as volume cells is useful for the purpose of this approach the magnitude of the particle volume is irrelevant as shown in the next section particles hold an energy e and the total energy is given by the sum of the individual particle energy therefore all particle volumes are initially charged with the energy e 0 e 0 n and with the temperature equal to the injection temperature t 0 x 0 q t 0 t 0 q note that we retain the same notation adopted in section 3 2 to define particle quantities as a function of their residence time injection position and injection time e g υ τ x x 0 t 0 fluid particles change their energy because of their diffusive heat exchange with the rock matrix since we assume that both particle volume and heat capacity are constant particle energy and particle temperature are related by a constant proportion therefore we can arbitrarily adopt one or the other as the working variable the adoption of the temperature will prove convenient to our purpose particles move into the fracture system by advection along different trajectories that may change from a time step to another due to the temporal variation of the velocity in the system each particle changes its position x such as 23 d x τ x 0 t 0 d τ v τ x 0 t 0 x 0 x 0 t 0 x 0 the particle lagrangian velocity is equal to the local eulerian velocity e g v τ x x 0 t 0 v x t 0 where we use the same notation for lagrangian and eulerian quantities as in the previous section and where we apply eq 17 highlighting that the velocity field is only updated at each time step similarly to section 3 2 τ x x 0 t 0 is the time that the particle released at position x 0 and time t 0 has spent to travel from x 0 to the position x it can also be expressed as a function of the trajectory length ℓ x and the particle velocity component in the direction parallel to the trajectory v ℓ ℓ x x 0 t 0 v τ x x 0 t 0 such as 24 τ x x 0 t 0 0 τ d τ 0 ℓ x d ℓ v ℓ ℓ x x 0 t 0 thus the particle arrival time at x is t x t 0 τ x x 0 t 0 note that in the case of constant in time fracture aperture both the travel time and the velocity are not a function of t 0 since space is discretized into a mesh grid the particle travel time is calculated as the sum of the times to jump over the crossed mesh elements where each jump is defined by the two successive intersections of the particle trajectory with the element edges in order acknowledge the variation of the velocity field particles only move for the duration of the time interval δ t 0 if they have not reached the outlet during the time step in which they are injected they resume their travel in the following time iteration along newly defined trajectories originating at their last position this operation may imply that a large number of fractures are circulating within the network during each time step which increases the computing memory demand the adoption of a time interval larger than the advective time to reach the outlet prevent the simultaneous presence of multiple particle sets in the system as we will further discuss in section 8 particle injection in the network satisfies a flux weighted injection mode and particle behavior at fracture intersections follows a complete mixing rule i e particles are distributed proportional to the outgoing fluxes this condition together with the assumptions detailed above implies the following relationship between the number of particles n fluid volume v e and flow rate q e entering a generic mesh element and the number of particles n fluid volume v 0 and flow rate q 0 introduced in the system for each time step 25 n n v e v 0 q e q 0 4 2 particle temperature variation due to fluid rock diffusion particles change their temperature during the travel because of the thermal diffusion between the fluid and the rock matrix the estimation of the particle temperature variation is performed by extending the semi analytic method for a single trajectory detailed in section 3 2 to the case of multiple trajectories at each t 0 we release n particles with assigned temperature at the inlet and we consider continuous injection during the time step we differentiate the temperature at the fracture rock interface t m x b t defined in the eulerian field from the particle temperature t τ x 0 t 0 defined in the lagrangian field fig 2 this dichotomy allows for defining the variation of t τ x 0 t 0 as a function of the diffusive heat flux eq 19 which is estimated for each particle and it based on the local eulerian temperature history t m x b t eq 20 this latter is in turn determined by the temperature of the crossing particles because of the equilibrium between fluid and rock temperatures at the interface recall eq 21 for a generic particle crossing the location x at time t 0 τ t m x b t is equal to the temperature of the particle itself for the duration of the time interval while for times smaller than t 0 τ it is equal to the temperature at the fracture matrix interface collected at the grid mesh elements t b x t as expressed by 26 t m x b t t τ x x 0 t 0 t 0 τ t t 0 τ δ t 0 t b x t t t 0 τ where x represents the coordinate identifying the generic mesh element ω x containing x this definition builds on the assumption that fluid particle volumes released at the same time do not directly exchange heat because the differences in arrival times are small compared to the diffusive time to cross the distance between different trajectories although particle trajectories do not directly interact during their travel particles have indirect effects on future particles in fact we consider that a time larger than the time interval is sufficient for a complete homogenization of each volume temperature to occur over the mesh element thanks to lateral diffusion processes according with this assumption the temperature at the mesh element t b x t coincides with the temperature of the crossing fluid volume let n x t 0 n be the number of particles released at the same t 0 that cross the mesh element ω x at different times t 0 τ ξ where ξ is a generic position that falls within the mesh element ω x it is worth reminding at this point that we assume continuous heat injection during the time step which means that each temperature persists at each location for the duration of the time interval δ t 0 the total volume crossing ω x in the time interval is v and its temperature in time is determined by the sum of the energy of the particle volumes crossing the mesh element at that time such that t b x t is 27 t b x t 1 cv x t q 1 n x t 0 e τ ξ x 0 q t τ ξ 1 n x t 0 q 1 n x t 0 t τ ξ x 0 q t τ ξ ξ ω x the second equivalence is derived acknowledging that the energy of the generic particle q is e q cv q t q and that the total crossing volume v is equal to the sum of the n particle fluid volumes crossing the element which is v nv q because all the particles have equal and invariable volumes by using the second equivalence the estimation of t b x t does not depend on the magnitude of the particle volumes after substitution of eqs 26 and 27 into eq 20 and after integration by time intervals see also appendix b the expression of the heat exchanged by a particle p released at t 0 i corresponding to the i th time step is 28 j p i x κ c m π t p i x δ t 0 j ω p i x where we make use of the generic short notation υ p i x υ τ x x 0 p t 0 i the second term in the right hand side represents the memory diffusive heat exchange which is defined on the mesh element such as 29 j ω p i x κ c m π j 1 i 1 1 n j x q 1 n j x t q j ξ f t p i x t q j ξ ξ ω x where t p i x τ p i x t 0 i τ x x 0 p t 0 i t 0 i and where f is defined as 30 f t a t b 1 t a t b 1 t a t b δ t 0 expression 28 reflects the convolution over time of different temperature values each one considered as constant over the time step the first term represents the current temperature at the location x i e the temperature of the particle p itself while the second term represents the memory of all the past temperatures recorded at x over the time the contributions of the different temperatures at the fracture rock interface are superposed acknowledging the linearity of the diffusion process in the rock note that the denominators of eq 30 are always real numbers as the terms in the square root are always positive this is ensured by the fact that particles are stopped at the end of the time step so the travel time to reach a given position is never larger than δ t 0 it is worth reminding that the mutual effects between flow paths released in the same time step is disregarded based on the assumption that differences in arrival time are small compared with the diffusive time acknowledging this effect would require sorting the particles by passage time order at each crossed element which dramatically increases the computational cost despite that the operation defined by eq 29 still requires dealing with a large amount of data which leads us to the simplification described in the next section 4 3 a meta particle concept to reduce stored data at each time step and mesh element the passage time and temperature of each particle have to be stored which translates into huge sets of data considering that the particle number is also large in order to reduce the amount of stored data we build on the observation that the trajectories crossing a mesh element have similar temperatures and passage times therefore at each time step we keep track of the effects of the particle passage time and temperature by assigning to each mesh element the values of a meta particle whose passage time and temperature is equal to the average passage times and temperatures of the n particles released at that time step and crossing the element such as 31 t b j x 1 n j x q 1 n j x t q j ξ ξ ω x 32 t j x t 0 j 1 n j x q 1 n j x τ q j ξ ξ ω x where the meta particle variables are expressed using again the short notation e g υ j x υ τ x x 0 t 0 j note that since the discretization for ξ corresponds to the mesh edges i e the intersections between the particle trajectories and the mesh elements we estimate t b j x and t j x as the average between the values at the two adjacent edges of ω x these average times and temperatures substitute t b in eq 26 such as t b x t x t b x under this framework the heat flux that a particle p released at time t 0 exchanges at the position x is still expressed by eq 28 but the memory diffusive heat exchange is evaluated according with the meta particle temperatures and passage times recorded at the position over the time steps such as j ω p i x is substituted by j ω p i x 33 j ω p i x κ c m π j 1 i 1 t b j x f t p i x t j x the adoption of this meta particle concept sensibly reduces the amount of stored data with respect to evaluating the diffusive flux considering the individual contribution of all the crossing particles released in the previous time steps as described in the previous section at the end of each time step the recorded particle passage times and temperatures of each location are translated into one value of temperature and associated time for each fracture mesh element the consequent loss of accuracy is minimal as we discuss in section 5 4 thus the particle temperature variation during the advective displacement across the element ω x k is evaluated by solving eq 19 which is discretized according to a crank nicolson scheme into 34 t p i x k t p i x k τ p i x k τ p i x k j p i x k j p i x k 2 j ω p i x k 2 c b x k t 0 i where the subscripts k and k identify the trajectory entrance and exit points in the grid element ω x k note that the fracture half aperture value refers to the injection time in fact the fracture aperture and velocity fields are updated at each time step and they are considered constant for the duration of the time step the fracture half aperture variation is estimated at each mesh element according to the meta particle average values of temperature and time such that eq 22 translates into 35 δ b i x 2 1 ν 1 ν α t d π j 1 i t b j x g t i x t j x where 36 g t a t b t a t b t a t b δ t 0 finally the fracture semi aperture field is updated at each time step according to the more recently recorded values of δ b at each x such as 37 b i 1 x b 0 x δ b i x note that this formulation disregards the effects of lateral mechanical continuity because the thermal displacement is assumed as exclusively dependent on the temperature variation in the direction perpendicular to the fracture while in practice mechanical deformation is instantaneously transferred far from the thermal perturbation through the solid matrix in other words the fracture opening should propagate laterally both in the fracture longitudinal ℓ and on plane transverse y directions however the lack of this effect is partly compensated by the smooth nature of the heat propagation in the fracture both in the longitudinal direction as a consequence of the diffusive exchange with the matrix and in the on plane transverse direction because of the similar velocities of adjacent streamlines over the same fracture we test the validity of this assumption in section 5 3 4 4 implementation in a dfn simulator the formulation has been implemented in the dfn lab software platform which provides a set of tools for the generation of stochastic and deterministic heterogeneous fracture networks and for the modeling of flow in the connected network through mixed hybrid finite element scheme le goc et al 2019 pinier et al 2021 this scheme ensures fluid mass conservation including for unstructured meshes with a high variability in element quality the particle tracking module already implemented in the software constitutes the basis for the advective part of this formulation the algorithm is designed to develop accurate particle tracing on unstructured meshes matringe et al 2006 particle trajectories are defined on the grid mesh according with the velocity field which is approximated as constant within each element at each element crossed the particle motion occurs on a straight line the velocity vector determines the exit point i e the position where the trajectory crosses the element edge while the velocity norm determines the time for the particle to jump across the element since particle motion occurs for the duration of the time interval section 4 1 it may occur that some particles have not reached the outlet during the time interval in this case particles are stopped and their travel resume when a new time step is initiated to do so the particle position at the stop time is evaluated by means of a linear interpolation on the trajectory line crossing the last visited element 5 validation of the proposed approach 5 1 validation and convergence analysis in the case of constant fracture aperture and velocity in the case of a single trajectory with constant in time fracture aperture and velocity the semi analytic solution described in sections 3 2 and 4 should provide the same estimates of temperature than the analytic solution of section 3 1 we make use of this equivalence to analyze the convergence performance of the semi analytic solution under different conditions of time discretization we consider a fracture of 10 m length with constant in time fracture aperture and steady state flow velocity this corresponds to either constant flow or constant pressure boundary conditions at the fracture inlet x 0 where we also impose a constant temperature condition the rock matrix thermal diffusivity is d 1 10 6 m2 s and the parameter θ is 1 i e c m c we test the performance of the semi analytic formulation for two cases one with uniform velocity and regular spatial grid the other with more general conditions of non uniform velocity and irregular spatial grid for both cases the semi aperture is uniform and equal to b 1 10 4 m for the first case we consider flow velocity v 2 5 10 2 m s we adopt a space discretization such that δ x 1 m while for the time discretization we consider different time intervals δ t 0 to keep generality the analysis is performed in terms of dimensionless values making use of the characteristic time t c θ 2 d δ τ 2 π b 2 which represents the ratio of the square of the advective characteristic time for the single jump δ τ δ x u to the diffusive characteristic time π b 2 θ 2 d the value of the characteristic time is approximately 0 5 days for this specific example the adoption of t c will prove convenient as shown in the following fig 3 shows the comparison between the two solutions under values of time intervals from 0 1 t c to 10 t c which correspond to values from 102 δ τ to 104 δ τ in the left panel the temperature variation in time is represented for three different control planes at x 1 5 δ x x 3 5 δ x and x 9 5 δ x respectively since values are stored on the grid element we take the middle point of the element as x at the first control plane the temperature starts to change for time larger than 0 2 t c which is expected as in eq 13 the temperature is larger than zero for arguments of the complementary error function smaller than 2 i e when t t c 5 if t τ in the right panel we show the result vs space at t 30 t c the semi analytic solution shows a good agreement with the classical solution and it is most accurate for smaller values of δ t 0 t c the error increases for increasing values of the time interval and it incurs an overestimation of the temperature especially for small times in fact if eq 28 is replaced into eq 34 one obtains that the temperature variation of the front depends on the ratio θ d δ τ π δ t 0 b which coincides with t c δ t 0 overall we observe that the adoption of the crank nicolson scheme ensures stability while preserving accuracy we also perform a convergence analysis for the case of non uniform velocity and non uniform space discretization fig 4 the fracture semi aperture is assumed as uniform and equal to b 1 10 4 m which means that the variation of velocity corresponds to an equivalent variation of fluid flow with this example we mimic the general case of a trajectory crossing several fractures and intersections like in a complex fracture network although we keep the fracture aperture as uniform the variability of the advective time for each jump is such that the characteristic time t c evaluated for each space grid element spans over several orders of magnitude and it is distributed as shown in the inset of fig 4 we test the convergence assuming values of time interval proportional to the average characteristic time t c the results confirm the accuracy of the solution under a strong heterogeneity although some oscillations are observed at short times for the case of small time interval although results are sufficiently accurate for all the time intervals a small time interval may incur large computational time while if the time interval is very large temperatures are not calculated for short time i e time smaller than the time interval considering the large variability of the characteristic time in a heterogeneous medium the evaluation of a minimum and maximum time interval at the beginning of the simulation may be useful to prevent from this inconvenient 5 2 convergence analysis in the case of variable fracture aperture and velocity here we analyze the consequences of the thermo mechanical coupling for a single fracture we compare the heat transfer for the case of constant fracture aperture and velocity with the case when the fracture aperture and the flow velocity change because of the temperature dependent deformation we consider the same setting and parameter values as for the first case of section 5 1 with initial uniform semi aperture b 0 equal to 1 10 4 m and uniform space discretization δ x 1 m however to evaluate the velocity field variation consequent to the fracture aperture variation we distinguish two different cases of boundary conditions bcs at the inlet in one case we consider constant inflow in the other we assume constant pressure in both cases the outlet at x l is subject to a constant zero pressure bc and the initial velocity is v 0 2 5 10 2 m s since we consider the case of a single fracture with no intersections the condition of steady state flow at each time step implies that the flow is uniform along the trajectory although we show the results by means of dimensionless parameters the aperture variation depends on the injected temperature which we fix as t 0 10 c for the mechanical parameters the linear thermal expansion α t is 1 10 5 c 1 while the poisson ratio ν is 0 3 we consider three different time interval values from 0 1 t c 0 to 10 t c 0 in order to show the convergence performance under the circumstance of changing aperture the characteristic time t c 0 refers to the initial values of semi aperture b 0 and velocity v 0 therefore it has the same value as in the section 5 1 i e t c 0 0 5 days fig 5 shows the temporal variation of temperature and fracture semi aperture observed at one control plane placed at x 3 5 m from the inlet for the case with constant aperture and variable aperture under the two different bcs in the case analyzed here the cooling of the rock causes an increase in fracture aperture this implies the variation of both the flow velocity and the fluid volume exchanging heat with the rock this latter becomes larger which leads to smaller temperature variations for unitary advective displacement note that in the case of constant aperture the velocity is invariant regardless of the bc when the aperture is temperature dependent on the contrary the bc has a great impact on the velocity which is also shown in fig 6 where results are presented as a function of the longitudinal direction for the sole case with time interval equal to t c 0 if the inflow is kept constant at the inlet flow velocity changes proportionally to the inverse of the local fracture half aperture i e v x t b x t 1 this implies that the advective time increases proportionally to the increase of b which counterbalances the increase of fluid volume in contact with the rock therefore the characteristic time remains equal to the initial conditions and to the constant aperture case this has two consequences the first is that the convergence is not affected second the temperature response remains the same as in the constant case this equivalence of results is specific of considering a single trajectory in a one dimensional domain with two dimensional fractures in a three dimensional domain the variation in velocity promotes the migration of the trajectory towards faster preferential zones as we will see in section 7 the behavior is different when a constant pressure is imposed at the inlet in this case flow velocity is proportional to b x t i t 1 where i t 0 l b x t 3 dx according with the assumption that the cubic law applies locally see section 2 1 the characteristic time is therefore proportional to the square of i t for any x this non locality affects both the observed response and the convergence conditions at short times the increase in fracture aperture only occurs over a small portion of the domain observe fig 6 the velocity is reduced for short x and slightly increased for large x the value of the characteristic time is similar to the initial one which makes the temperature responses for constant and variable aperture comparable later on the aperture variation propagates to the rest of the domain which gives a major importance to the integral i compared to b the consequent acceleration of the temperature front in turn increases the propagation of the aperture variation which dramatically speeds up the heat transfer giving the abrupt evolution of temperature observed in fig 5 as said when a constant pressure bc is imposed the characteristic time of the problem changes according to the square of the space integral i which has direct consequences on the accuracy of the calculation if the aperture increases corresponding to a cooling of the rock the characteristic time decreases which means that the relationship δ t 0 t c increases this may generate less accurate results and lack of information fig 5 on the contrary if the rock is heated up the consequent reduction of b ensures that the relationship δ t 0 t c decreases and therefore that the accuracy is preserved as shown in supplementary information 5 3 validation of the thermo mechanical response the accuracy of the analytic evaluation of the tm fracture aperture eqs 22 and 35 is tested against results from a fully coupled thm numerical simulation performed with the finite element method simulator codebright olivella et al 1996 we consider a single fracture embedded in a rock matrix both the fracture and the rock are represented as porous media in the finite element simulator therefore we build the model in order to have it consistent with our assumptions we set the longitudinal thermal conductivity in the fracture as very low in order to the heat transport in the fracture be governed by advection according with the assumptions here a low intrinsic permeability is assigned to the rock matrix in order to make it consistent with our assumption that the rock is impermeable and that the heat transport in the rock is exclusively driven by thermal diffusion we impose a small pressure gradient with a highly conductive fracture to reduce the hydro mechanical deformations and only observe the thermo mechanical deformations the viscosity is set as insensitive to the temperature variations we assume constant velocity i e the fracture aperture variation does not affect the velocity field or the transport behavior thus we only evaluate the aperture variation in response to the temperature field generated by a continuous injection for a certain time the fracture is 100 m long with a steady state flow rate of 5 10 5 m2 s the rock thermal diffusivity d is equal to 1 6 10 6 m2 s and the parameter θ is approximately 0 9 we simulate 20 days of continuous injection of the temperature t 0 at the x 0 nevertheless we show the results in terms of dimensionless time which allows for extending them to other sets of parameters to this end the characteristic time t c θ 2 d τ 2 π b 2 is adopted as described in the previous section where the characteristic length for δ τ is set as equal to 1 m for the mechanical parameters the linear thermal expansion α t is 1 10 5 c 1 while the poisson ratio ν is 0 3 we set the domain size such that the mechanical boundary conditions do not affect the behavior fig 7 shows that the analytic estimation of both the temperature and the semi aperture variation is very accurate which confirms the validity of the assumptions described in section 2 3 we observe that considering the mechanical problem as one dimensional in z does not incur large errors because the lateral mechanical propagation of the displacement is reproduced by the smooth heat propagation small discrepancies are observed when the fluid temperature profile is sharp observe the blue and orange lines a condition that is slightly smoothed out by the fully coupled numerical simulator this impacts the rock temperature profiles and consequently the strains for short times 5 4 accuracy of the meta particle assumption as described in section 4 3 the memory diffusive heat exchange is calculated by making use of a meta particle concept i e at each time step we operate an averaging of the arrival time and temperature over the particles crossing each grid mesh element here we test the effects of this averaging by comparing the particle rock heat exchange flux and the particle temperatures after the diffusive exchange evaluated considering the meta particle eq 33 or the individual particle temperatures eq 29 to perform this analysis we consider observing one location at which 10 particles arrive with a certain distribution of passage time and temperature we evaluate the fluid rock heat exchange for each particle j p and the consequent outgoing particle temperature after having exchanged j p for a δ τ 1 s this is performed for several observation times corresponding to the passage of particle sets released at different t 0 the parameters b θ and d are set as in section 5 1 the characteristic time for the unitary δ τ is therefore equal to 50 s without loss of generality we consider stationary trajectories i e the particle sets released at different t 0 cross the control location with constant in time values of passage time τ their probability density function pdf follows an upper truncated power law distribution with exponent γ such as pdf τ γ τ γ 1 τ m γ τ m γ the minimum and maximum cutoff values τ m and τ m are set as 10s and 1010s respectively we explore two scenarios with values of γ equal to 0 5 and 2 5 for the time interval of particle release δ t 0 we consider different values corresponding to ratios of τ m τ m to δ t 0 ranging between 0 1 and 1 each particle crosses the control location with a temperature correlated with its passage time and with the observation time by means of the relation t erfc τ t according with eq 13 where we assume that the imposed initial temperature is t 0 50 c this assumption reflects the condition in which the particles have traveled through independent trajectories before converging to the control location therefore particle temperature increases with increasing observation time and with decreasing passage time i e fast particles have higher temperature than slow ones moreover the variability is large for short observation time and it reduces as the observation time increases for each scenario we perform 100 realizations and we evaluate the average of the maximum differences in particle exit temperature fig 8 a and b show results at different observation times for one realization of the case with γ 0 5 and δ t 0 τ m τ m to improve visualization results are plotted with a frequency time smaller than δ t 0 panel a shows the diffusive heat exchanged by each particle j p at the observed location and at different times when the contribution of all particles blue markers or the meta particle contribution orange markers is considered at each observation time the particles cross the location with temperature proportional with their passage time the heat that a particle exchanges depends on its temperature and on the local rock temperature therefore j p is larger for the first arrival particles which have a higher temperature observe the inset plot hottest particles undergo a positive heat exchange they give heat while coldest particles undergo a negative heat exchange they receive heat in both cases the absolute values of j p first increase with time and eventually decrease as larger rock volumes are heated up this time of trend inversion depends on the particle passage times and temperatures for the example analyzed here the inversion time is larger than the simulated time for the slowest particles so we do not observe any reduction of j p for those particles note also the sign variation of j p for particles with intermediate velocity which indicates that they receive heat at the beginning while they give heat later results show that considering all the values of particle temperature and passage time or the meta particle average values gives similar results compare the blue and orange markers after having exchanged j p the particles exit the location with a new temperature fig 8b shows the relative difference between the outgoing temperatures evaluated with the meta particle values and considering the particle contributions with their respective τ and t values are normalized with respect to the latter after the first observation time when the two methods give the same outgoing temperatures they diverge in particular the error is positive but small when the meta particle method is adopted and it reduces with time the trend is similar when other scenarios are analyzed for which the maximum positive and negative errors averaged over the 100 realizations are shown in fig 8c results are shown for the two scenarios of γ with each line of the plot corresponding to a different value of the time interval δ t 0 and columns representing different observation times the error associated with the meta particle averaging operation is always positive the maximum negative colorplot exhibits zero values the accuracy of the averaging operation is sensitive to the ratio of τ m τ m to δ t 0 which we explore by varying δ t 0 the error increases when the ratio increases reflecting that the averaging process incurs overestimation of the particle temperature if the time interval is similar to the maximum difference in particle arrival time this occurs under all the assumed scenarios but it is particularly evident for smaller γ i e when the number of particles with large arrival time is larger moreover the error is larger for short times and decreases as the time increases which is a consequence of the reduction of the variability in particle arrival temperature with time in general large variability increases the error yet the maximum error is overall smaller than 5 which confirms the accuracy of the meta particle method although we have performed the analysis assuming the case of a hot fluid injection the same normalized results would be found in the case of cold injection 6 comparison with classical solution for multiple stationary and independent trajectories if thermal deformations are neglected the fracture aperture and the velocity fields are constant in time this implies that the trajectories are stationary for the duration of the heat injection under this circumstance it seems natural to extend the solution of section 3 1 to the case of multiple trajectories which is easily carried out by evaluating eq 13 on each trajectory for a given time this approach has been proposed by several authors for the case of pulse or continuous injection of solute tracer e g yamashita and kimura 1990 cvetkovic et al 1999 tsang and tsang 2001 liu et al 2007 and recently applied to the case of heat injection gisladottir et al 2016 the adoption of this methodology implicitly entails neglecting the mutual effects between neighboring trajectories for all the duration of the injection thus each trajectory is independent from the others and the fluid rock heat exchange on one trajectory depends exclusively on the temperature evolution in time on the same trajectory this is equivalent to consider that the heat exchanged by the generic particle p at the time interval i is 38 j p i x κ c m π t p i x δ t 0 j 1 i 1 t p j x f t 0 i t 0 j neglecting the effects of the lateral diffusion between neighboring trajectories is reasonable in the case of a pulse injection because the time is too short for the heat to diffuse in the rock over the distance between the trajectories the question is whether this assumption is valid for the case of a long continuous injection which we analyze and discuss in this section to illustrate the effects of the assumption of independent trajectories when several particles crosses close locations we perform the same analysis of section 5 4 in which we have considered that the trajectories and the velocity field are stationary we compare the results obtained with our approach with the ones obtained from the approach of section 3 1 extended to multiple flow paths the difference between the two methods is analyzed using the results evaluated with the contribution of all particles taken individually as the reference in order to avoid interference with the error associated with the meta particle assumption fig 9 a shows that the assumption of independent flow paths leads to overestimate or underestimate j p observe the green markers because it is assumed to be exclusively a function of the temperature evolution on the particle trajectory therefore j p is underestimated for the hottest particles and overestimated for the coldest ones observe that when trajectories are not independent blue markers j p is negative for the slowest and coldest particles because the rock matrix has increased its temperature so the diffusive heat flux is reverted the cold particle can receive the heat released by the hot ones this effect is not captured under the assumption of independent flow paths as a consequence of the large differences in j p the estimation of the exit temperature under the assumption of independent flow paths incurs substantial differences which however decrease in time fig 9b the error is positive for most particles but the negative error is larger that the positive reflecting that the temperature is significantly underestimated for a few particles this is a consequence of the assumed distribution of arrival time and temperature with more particles with hot temperature than with low temperature the heating of the rock matrix due to the hot particle contributions is not captured in the case of independent trajectories as expected the negative error is larger for the late arriving particles which are the coldest ones since the particle entrance temperature is proportional to the erfc 1 t the error decreases with time as all the particles tend to similar temperatures results shown in fig 9a and b refer to the case with exponent of the passage times pdf distribution γ equal to 0 5 which corresponds to a case with high probability of having particles with large arrival time and low temperature when many of such extremely slow particles exist the classical method fails in estimating their temperatures and large relative errors are observed with negative values up to 100 and positive values below 8 the behavior is however highly sensitive to the probability distribution exponent fig 9c in fact the existence of a large number of particles with very different arrival times and temperatures constitutes a situation far from the independent trajectories assumption while if many particles exhibit similar temperature and arrival time the system approaches the behavior of a single trajectory for this reason the negative relative error is smaller than 30 when γ 2 5 indicating the two methods give similar results notice also that the difference between the two methods is almost insensitive to the time interval value a slight increase of the error is observed for decreasing time interval because for short time interval the particle temperatures are more often adjusted when based on the previous particle transition while the time interval does not impact the results in the case of independent trajectories as also commented in section 5 4 the error decreases with time coinciding with a reduction of the variability of particle arrival temperature despite the large difference observed for a few particle temperatures the average temperature estimated over the ensemble of particles gives similar values with the two methods because most particles have similar arrival times this means that if the average temperature results are observed at a control point coinciding with the observation location here we observe similar temperature whether we adopt the classical method or the new one however results evaluated at a downstream control section with one method or the other may differ if particles diverge as they bring a different temperature it is clear that under certain conditions the mutual effect between converging flow paths may affect the behavior and it should therefore be considered the analysis performed here and in section 5 4 is intended to represent some of the most critical cases in fact trajectories with such heterogeneous characteristics converging into the same location reflects an extreme case that is hardly encountered in fracture networks where adjacent trajectories typically exhibit similar arrival times we further analyze and discuss the difference between the two methods by observing the result on a dfn in the next section 7 heat transport in a dfn to analyze the effects of the thermo mechanical rock deformation on the heat transport in a fracture network we compare the results from simulations with temperature dependent fracture aperture and with constant fracture aperture we also show the results evaluated with the classical approach of independent stationary trajectories recall section 6 we consider a simple dfn composed by 10 fractures with equal fracture semi aperture b 10 4 m corresponding to a transmissivity approximately equal to 7 10 6 m2 s the domain has a cubic volume of 100 m side a temperature colder than the resident fluid by 50 c is injected from one section of the domain on which we consider two scenarios of boundary conditions one with constant inflow the other with constant pressure while constant pressure equal to zero is imposed at the opposite section the constant inflow is set as equal to 3 10 3 m3 s while the constant pressure is 5 mpa the two scenarios generating similar velocity fields to perform the simulation 500 particles are introduced in the system from the inlet at each time step the resulting pdf distribution of particle travel times from inlet to outlet follows a power law with exponent slightly larger than 2 and the maximum value is 2 10 4 s fig 10 left panel the characteristic time for the single jumps spans over 10 orders of magnitude ranging from 10 1 s to 10 9 s with an average value of 3 10 6 s and a pdf distribution as shown in fig 10 right panel according with these values the time interval δ t 0 is set as equal to 1 10 6 s approximately 11 days different values of particle number and time interval have been also considered to ensure that results are independent on these factors see supplementary information for illustrative purposes we first consider injecting only four particles at each time step for the scenario with fixed inflow boundary condition at the inlet fig 11 shows the velocity field and trajectories of the four particles at the initial time and at time equal to 2 10 7 s for the case of temperature dependent fracture aperture as the velocity field evolve in time particle trajectories migrate towards faster flow paths these correspond to zones where the fracture aperture and transmissivity has increased as a consequence of the rock cooling and contraction observe panel c it is worth noting that given the fixed inflow bc flow velocity decreases everywhere in the network but it is larger where the fracture aperture increases which is different from what observed for the one dimensional domain in section 5 2 this different behavior is related to the increased complexity of the flow field the example above illustrates that the injection of a cold fluid and the consequent rock contraction and fracture aperture increase may cause the progressive concentration of the heat transport along preferential fast flow paths to analyze the consequence of this behavior on the heat transport we analyze the results of the simulation with the full set of 500 particles fig 12 shows the temporal evolution of the temperature at the outlet evaluated as the average temperature over the cross section the comparison of the results for the two cases of constant and variable fracture aperture shows that heat transport is significantly accelerated when fracture aperture is temperature dependent this behavior is observed for both scenarios of boundary conditions but the temperature profile is sharper when constant pressure is imposed at the inlet this is not only a consequence of the non locality of the velocity field under this boundary condition as observed in section 5 2 but it also depends on the particle injection mode since particles at the inlet are distributed proportionally to the flow velocity at each time step more particles are injected in places with increased flow velocity this mechanisms means that velocity will significantly increase on initially high velocity paths enlarging the difference between slow and fast paths when the imposed boundary condition is of constant inflow particles are uniformly distributed over the inlet section however as observed in fig 11 particles tend to migrate towards faster regions which promotes the advective transport resulting in a faster temperature response than in the case with constant aperture where the trajectories are stationary this migration explains the difference from what was observed for the one dimensional domain where the fracture with temperature dependent aperture exhibits the same behavior than the fracture with constant aperture compare fig 12 with fig 5 in general the dramatic acceleration of the advective transport is the primary reason for the faster heat transfer there are however additional mechanisms involved the passage through fractures with larger aperture implies a smaller diffusive temperature variation because the fluid volume in contact with the rock surface is larger or equivalently the surface of diffusive exchange per fluid volume is smaller recall eq 3 moreover the heat moves through rocks already affected by significant temperature variations which reduces the temperature gradient at the fracture rock interface and therefore the heat exchange flux in the specific example here all trajectories converge to the same fracture at the outlet fig 11 it is therefore interesting to compare the results of the case with constant fracture aperture against the results estimated by means of the classical method of independent trajectories fig 12 shows that the two methods give similar values of average temperature at the outlet however the individual particle temperature evolution fig 13 shows that the assumption of independent trajectories implies a small overestimation and a large underestimation of the particle temperature which is similar to what observed in section 6 this occurs for a small number of particles and therefore the temperature estimated as the average over all the particle temperatures is similar nevertheless the error may propagate if particles diverge down stream which will be the focus of future investigations 8 discussion the formulation presented above is ideally conceived to modeling heat transport with thermo mechanical effects due to continuous non isothermal injection into a complex fracture system such as in the case of geothermal technologies eulerian numerical models such as finite element or finite difference methods typically suffer from numerical instability in solving transport problems especially when the advective front is sharp lagrangian methods overcome this problem but in general they do not allow taking into account variability in time of the parameters the hybrid approach proposed in this paper provides a stable algorithm for the transport advective diffusive problem while keeping the variable in time nature of the parameters the adoption of a grid defined memory diffusive heat exchange allows us to deal with trajectories that change in time because of the thermal deformation of the host rock the analytic solution of both the diffusive and the mechanical part of the problem sensibly reduces the computational cost these remarkable advantages imply the cost of sacrificing some of the complexities of the problem injection of cold fluids in fractured media causes an increase in pore pressure and a decrease in temperature both processes leading to an increase in the fracture aperture koh et al 2011 ghassemi and tao 2016 the two processes act on very different time scales with heat transfer occurring at very large time scale compared to the pressure diffusion de simone et al 2017 building on this concept we disregard the hm fracture aperture variation and we concentrate on the solely tm elastic deformations this conceptually corresponds to analyzing the long term effects after the early time pressure driven deformations have occurred at the same time we disregard some complexity intrinsic to the coupled thm process like the transient undrained increase in pore pressure consequent to the thermal deformation of low transmissivity saturated rocks since we assume impermeable rock mass fluid pressure leak off and the associated hydro mechanical rock deformation are also disregarded these effects may be significant in certain situations whose modeling requires the use of fully coupled thm simulations rutqvist et al 2002 variation of fluid density and viscosity due to temperature variations has not been considered but it can be easily incorporated as a feature of the velocity field update we also make the assumption that the matrix is infinite in the direction perpendicular to the fracture walls this is of course an over simplification whose effect is twofold on the one hand diffusion through the matrix may lead to temperature variations in fractures not directly involved by advective processes or to faster temperature variations in fractures where the advective transport is slow thus neglecting the finite size of the rock may lead to overestimations of the transfer times roubinet et al 2010 on the other hand the infinite matrix assumption does not consider that the deformation of the rock matrix may affect the aperture of other fractures both effects take place for time larger than the diffusive time over the distance between two fractures d t d d 2 d which is approximately 11 days if d 1 m and 3 years if d 10 m this time constitutes a threshold for the validity of our formulation and relaxing this limitation will be object of future work with respect to the heat transport within the fractures we assume the parallel plate model with transverse diffusion into the matrix however field experiments have shown that rough fractures often exhibit flow concentration into channels which have diffusive interfaces more similar to tubes than to planes klepikova et al 2016 de la bernardie et al 2018 this leads to a faster heat transfer and a different scaling in time with respect to the parallel plate model the incorporation of these features is beyond the scope of this paper but it will be the object of future developments although no explicit term relative to lateral diffusion is included in our formulation section 2 2 its effects are somehow modeled by means of the memory diffusive heat exchange whose values are updated at each time step as the result of a temperature homogenization over each mesh element recall section 4 this operation may appear mesh size dependent however a necessary condition to get representative results in any particle tracking simulation is considering a large number of particles when a sufficient large number of particles is introduced in the system neighboring mesh elements undergo similar temperature variations thus the mesh size does not have great impacts on the resulting temperature field for the same reason we do not explicitly introduce any lateral diffusion between mesh elements the operation of rock temperature homogenization over the mesh grid marks the difference with respect to the classical method where trajectories are assumed as independent and the fracture rock heat exchange is independently evaluated on each trajectory the assumption of independent trajectories may be limiting in cases where different trajectories cross neighboring locations at different times because previous variations of the rock temperature due to the contribution of other particles are disregarded this may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of j which is significant if the particles converge to the same mesh element with very different travel times a condition that is scarcely encountered in most dfn section 6 similar to any other numerical method based on time increments the accuracy and efficiency of the here proposed method is affected by the adopted time interval as discussed in section 4 the adoption of a time interval larger than the advective time for traveling from the inlet to the outlet is convenient to prevent the simultaneous presence of multiple particle sets in the system and the associated memory demand time intervals larger than the advective travel time variance are convenient to prevent large errors associated with the meta particle assumption section 5 4 finally a large time interval helps in speeding up the simulation time on the other hand we have shown that time intervals much larger than the problem characteristic time may give less accurate results see section 5 1 it is clear that an evaluation of the optimal time interval is required previous to performing the simulation in order to find a value large enough to ensure efficiency while preserving accuracy defining a time interval that meet the above discussed requirements is however not difficult provided the range of values that define the problem for the sake of simplicity consider the time for a particle to travel a distance l as equal to the number of jumps over the mesh elements m multiplied by the average time for the jump δ τ we seek for a δ t 0 larger than the total travel time but smaller than the characteristic time for the jump i e δ t 0 m δ τ and δ t 0 d δ τ 2 π b 2 where d is approximately 10 6 m2 s for rocks and b typically ranges between 10 6 and 10 2 m2 for example if the average value of b is 10 4 m2 the average velocity is 10 3 m s l 100 and the average mesh size equal to 1 m then m 100 δ τ 10 3 s and the optimum δ t 0 is between 10 5 s and 10 7 s nevertheless the variability of the characteristic time for the single jump may be large fig 10 as it is defined by the spatial variability of fracture aperture flow velocity and jump length the latter is related with the mesh size which can be highly variable in networks with many intersections and large variability of the fracture size the jump length is very small when the trajectory crosses small mesh elements or mesh element corners which requires reducing the time interval the consequent increase of computational time may be significant especially in the case of complex networks with large number of fractures and particles improving this aspect is crucial to reduce the computational time and it will be the topic of future work 9 conclusions we have proposed and validated a new formulation to simulate advective diffusive heat transport in heterogeneous three dimensional fracture networks with thermo mechanical fracture aperture and flow velocity variation the method is conceived to be implemented into a particle tracking approach where each particle holds a temperature that changes because of the diffusive exchange with the rock matrix the diffusive flux and the associate thermo mechanical rock deformation are estimated adopting a semi analytic scheme with time discretization this allows to consider trajectory variations due to thermo mechanical deformations to our best knowledge the current study represents the first attempt to incorporate the thermo mechanical behavior of the rock matrix into a particle tracking method further work will entail overcoming the limiting assumption of infinite rock matrix and perfectly planar fractures as well as improving the time interval control to ensure accuracy although subject to several simplifications the methodology enables investigating the reservoir long term tm behavior while keeping the computational effort within reasonable values the computation time is in fact of the order of minutes hours compared with the hours days required by fully coupled methods our formulation is therefore

3877,in the field of hydrology the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh is central to describing a watershed response the application of giuh is extended to individual hydrological events by accounting for the influence of rainfall spatial distribution a method is proposed herein to identify the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph specific to each flood event i e e giuh when runoff of effective rainfall is the dominant process the e giuh is derived from observational data namely rainfall field time series and a hydrograph such an identification process is formulated as an inverse problem with parameters such as the e giuh velocity and coefficient of dispersion as well as the hyetograph of rainfall excess the proposed method is applied to several flood events across two mountainous catchments within the cevennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory territory prone to flash flooding results indicate that the e giuhs display significant variability over the two basins and the e giuh parameters appear to be correlated with the flood event magnitude the e giuh synthetizes the basin response to rain forcing and can be considered as a signature of flood events a sensitivity study suggests that e giuh identification is fairly robust even with respect to the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall keywords giuh

geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh defined as the probability density function pdf of water travel time along the channel links of the hydrographic network was developed by gupta et al 1980 rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 by linking the unit hydrograph dooge 1959 sherman 1932 to the geomorphological parameters of a catchment the emergence of giuh has contributed to the success of lumped rainfall runoff models which are widely used for their parsimony and robustness in both flash flood prediction and hydrograph analysis when runoff of effective rainfall is the dominant process of floods wood et al 1990 more specifically the giuh is well suited to treating the ungauged basin modeling problem which pertains to the longstanding challenge of regional modeling over large areas as exposed in the review paper by singh et al 2014 the widespread use of giuh within the hydrology community coupled with its development over the decades attests to its relevance in representing watershed responses and moreover confirms the ability of this approach to complement distributed models fatichi et al 2016 the initial giuh formulation relies on the channel links in hydrographic networks as described by the horton classification marani et al 1991 and rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 extended this formulation to the probability density function pdf of hydrological distances to the basin outlet as described by the width function kirkby 1976 and went on to propose the width function geomorphological approach d odorico and rigon 2003 rigon et al 2016 an assumption of constant velocity is adopted to convert the distribution of flow distances into a pdf of travel times along flow paths the travel time pdf may be represented by the advection dispersion equation ade rinaldo et al 1991 and a unique solution of the diffusive wave equation hayami 1951 moussa 1997 the giuh is thus defined by the width function and the two parameters characterizing the ade and dwe i e flow velocity and coefficient of dispersion saco and kumar 2002a justified this constant velocity assumption by showing that varying flow path velocities can be taken into account by means of a kinematic geomorphic dispersion that increases the coefficient of dispersion parameter giuh applications often rely on a unique set of parameters in order to calibrate the model e g boudhraâ et al 2018 chen et al 2019 choi et al 2011 moussa 1997 yao et al 2014 thereby suggesting that a single representative giuh can be associated with a catchment however several studies have highlighted the influence on the catchment response of i the rain spatial distribution emmanuel et al 2017 goni et al 2019 olivera and maidment 1999 zoccatelli et al 2010 and ii the rain event magnitude rodriguez et al 2005 saco and kumar 2002b these findings have been confirmed by the post event analysis of floods smith et al 2005 smith et al 2002 among others and simulation studies emmanuel et al 2015 volpi et al 2012 hence acknowledging the giuh limitations listed by rigon et al 2016 who specifically noted these shortcomings when accounting for the rainfall distribution broadly speaking these results indicate that the giuh depends on rainfall runoff processes that drive the flow dynamics in the hydrograph network consequently every flood event can be characterized by its own giuh hereafter denoted as the e giuh which is capable of enriching the signatures of hydrological processes driving the basin response to rainfall forcing at the flood event scale mcmillan 2020 this manuscript aims to advance the width function based giuh by i adapting its formulation in order to account for the influence of spatial rainfall variability and ii proposing a method to determine the e giuh for each flood event first the giuh formulation is adapted to take into account the spatial rainfall pattern by means of replacing the width function by the rainfall width function emmanuel et al 2015 woods and sivapalan 1999 this improvement serves to overcome a key limitation of the giuh as highlighted by rigon et al 2016 second a novel e giuh identification method based on observed data is developed and tested the typical approach consists of assuming a production function and jointly calibrating the giuh and the production function parameters hence results depend on the a priori production function to address this problem the original method proposed herein formulates event giuh identification as an inverse problem menke 2012 tarentola 2005 inverse theory was defined by menke 2012 as a set of mathematical techniques for reducing data to obtain knowledge about the physical world on the basis of inferences drawn from observations inverse techniques have been used in hydrology e g by pan and wood 2013 to derive spatially distributed runoff by fisher et al 2020 for the purpose of determining spatially distributed continuous river discharge from discrete flow data as well as by boudhraâ et al 2018 to derive the hyetograph of effective rainfall from flow data the e giuh is identified from the observed hydrograh and from an estimation of the hyetograph of effective rainfall it is likely that this hyetograph influences the resulting e giuh the use of an inverse algorithm makes it possible to explicitly consider the specific role of this hyetograph it can be done by considering it as a set of parameters of the problem to solve the algorithm is initialized by the priori information about this hyetograph which combines the estimation of the a posteriori hyetograph and its accuracy the inverse algorithm will give more or less importance to the a priori hyetograph according to its accuracy and will propose an improved shape more generally the adopted framework is well adapted to considering the weight of data a priori parameter values and model on the solution based on their accuracy the proposed approach extends the domain of application of the giuh it allows to characterize each event in terms of a specific e giuh that can be viewed as the signature of this event section 2 presents an adaptation of the width function based giuh which takes into account the spatial rainfall variability and develops the approach employed to identify the e giuh from observed data namely the hydrograph and rainfall field time series the case study serving to test the proposed e giuh identification method is described in section 3 this case study combines a set of events affecting two basins located in southern france section 4 provides the application conditions of this e giuh identification approach and second 5 discusses the results obtained section 6 concludes the manuscript 2 methods 2 1 the event specific geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph e giuh this section introduces the spatial variability of rainfall in the derivation of the width function based e giuh d odorico and rigon 2003 rigon et al 2016 the travel time of water drops and the giuh both depend primarily on the hydrological distance l defined as the distance to the outlet from any point on the hydrological network let w be the width function of the basin defined as the portion of the basin area at the hydrological distance l which in addition represents the transverse extent of the basin at l rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 the spatial rainfall variability is represented by the rainfall variability along hydrological paths smith et al 2005 the flow at the catchment outlet can be expressed as 1 q t 0 l max d q l t d l d q l t a w l d l 0 t r e l t τ f l τ d τ with d q l t denoting the outflow at time t from surface area da a w l d l at hydrological distance l r e the effective rainfall at time τ and at hydrological distance l l max the maximum hydrological distance and f the travel time distribution of water particles from da it is assumed that the probability density function pdf of travel time can be modeled by the following law rigon et al 2016 rinaldo et al 1991 2 f l t l 4 π d l t 3 e x p l u l t 2 4 d l t with u l and d l denoting the respective parameters of velocity and coefficient of dispersion sometimes called diffusivity of the travel time pdf let s note that eq 2 is also the hayami 1951 solution of the diffusive wave equation moussa 1997 with u d standing for the mean velocity and coefficient of dispersion respectively of the wave flow the influence of rainfall spatial variability on flow conditions may explain why u and d both depend on the rainfall variability along flow paths can be introduced by defining the rainfall width function as inspired from smith et al 2005 3 w r l t r e l t r e t w l with w r rainfall width function and r e t mean value of effective rainfall over the basin at time τ unlike the width function the rainfall width function does depend on time emmanuel et al 2015 showed that the influence of spatial rainfall variability on the basin response is well explained by the deviation between the width function and the rainfall width function associated to the pattern of rain amount during a time interval of approximately two to three times the basin response time which is thus close to the time of concentration the event rainfall width function w e is defined over this duration it was first introduced by woods and sivapalan 1999 to analyze the effect of spatial rainfall variability and runoff formation on catchment response according to these authors it can be assumed that the spatio temporal variability of rainfall along flow paths can be written as the product of two independent functions i e 4 r e l t w e l r e t with w e event rainfall width function which depends only on hydrologic distance and r e hyetograph of effective rainfall which depends only on time introducing eq 4 into eq 1 leads to the following expression of outflow 5 q t 0 l max a w e l d l 0 t r e l t τ f l τ d τ which can also be written 6 q t a 0 t r e t τ f e τ d τ f e τ 0 lmax w e l f l τ d l f e is the e giuh associated with the flood event e saco and kumar 2002a stated that the pdf of travel time f can be approximated by replacing the varying parameters u and d by an equivalent network velocity u e and equivalent hydrodynamic coefficient of dispersion d e which enable preserving the mean and variance of f e they noticed that although used as spatially invariant parameters they are estimated to account for the nonlinear effects that arise when varying hydrodynamic parameters ultimately the expression of e giuh is 7 f e t 0 l b l w e l 4 π d e t 3 e x p l u e t 2 4 d e t d τ in addition rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 found that the first two moments of f e must satisfy the following expressions 8 e t 1 u e e l a n d v a r t 2 d e u e 2 e l 1 u e 2 v a r l where e l and v a r l are the first two moments of the pdf of hydrological paths in sum the spatial variability of rainfall can be integrated into the width function based giuh by replacing the width function by the rainfall width function this formulation paves the way to determining the e giuh which characterizes the basin response to each rain event forcing 2 2 principles of the e giuh identification process the problem posed consists of identifying the e giuh specific to flood event e that leads to the best reconstitution of the observed hydrograph at the basin outlet this e giuh is defined by two parameters u e and d e as well as by the event rainfall width function w e note that equation 6 expresses the hydrograph as a function of both e giuh and the hyetograph of effective rainfall meaning that the identification of effective rainfall and event giuh are not independent of one another and moreover that the transformation of observed rainfall data fields into a hyetograph of effective rainfall might influence the identified e giuh for this reason the components of the hyetograph of effective rainfall are also considered as parameters nevertheless the adopted identification algorithm section 4 provides the opportunity to introduce the hyetograph of effective rainfall as an a priori information to which a level of confidence is ascribed thus making it possible to control its influence on the result lastly the e giuh identification process calls for a model capable of combining the following equations i flow at the catchment outlet expressed as the convolution product q r e f e u e d e written in a discretized manner 9 q j a k 1 k j r e j 1 k f e k u e d e with 10 f e k u e d e γ 1 γ n w w r γ k δ t k 1 δ t

in the southeastern part of france s massif central sector fig 1 the southeastern end of this range consists of a plateau and a plain area extending to the mediterranean coast several rivers originate in the cevennes mountains and cross the intermediate plain to empty into the rhone river or flow into the mediterranean sea this region displays typical mediterranean climate and is subject to heavy rainfall events during the fall causing flash floods that can result in considerable damage and losses the cevennes region is covered by a network of rain gauges at a density of roughly 1 gauge every 150 km2 complemented by two weather radars that provide quantitative precipitation estimates qpe at a high spatial 1 km 1 km and temporal 5 min resolution hydrometeorological recordings in this region are enhanced by the presence of the ohmcv cevennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory http www ohmcv fr this long term observatory has built an integrated hydrometeorological database of flash flood events across the cevennes vivarais area the available operational datasets have therefore undergone a thorough quality control and can be considered highly accurate boudevillain et al 2011 the ohmcv provides several qpe products for purposes of this study the hourly rainfall fields of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution obtained by means of a radar rain gauge merging technique proposed by delrieu et al 2014 have been used these fields offer a high level of accuracy compared to other qpe products the basins considered herein are gard at the anduze gauging station surface area 545 km2 and ardèche at the vogüe gauging station 620 km2 upstream of anduze the gard bedrock consists mainly of schist 61 and granite 18 the ardèche bedrock upstream of vogüe is mostly granitic 72 douinot et al 2018 the hydrographic network of these two basins has been determined with the taudem tool tarboton 1997 in using a dtm at a spatial resolution of 250 m both basins are well documented and have been the subject of several works on rainfall runoff modeling adamovic et al 2015 douinot et al 2018 moussa et al 2007 naulin et al 2013 saulnier and le lay 2009 tramblay et al 2011 vannier et al 2016 and flash flood forecasting alfieri et al 2011 dolcine et al 2001 the qpe product covers a time period from 2011 to 2014 and includes one very intense and significant rain event in september 2002 delrieu et al 2005 a sample of six flood events at each basin have been selected comprising both rain and flow data all these events are single peak hydrographs which are more easily adapted to characterizing a unit hydrograph some selected events occurred during long rainy periods which explains the high flow values observed upon their initiation the main features of these flood events are summarized in table 1 the peak flow of a two year return period is respectively q2 630 m3 s for gard anduze and q2 740 m3 s for ardèche vogüe thus indicating that the dataset contains flow events of various magnitudes the coefficient of variation in the spatial rainfall amount ranges from 0 08 to 1 04 for gard anduze and from 0 22 to 0 76 for ardèche vogüe which confirms the varied characteristics of the selected flood events fig 2 illustrates one event for each basin g5 for gard a2 for ardèche the other events of each basin are displayed in the supplementary information section it can be noted that the rainfall map of event g5 indicates that the maximum rainfall occurs downstream as confirmed by the corresponding rainfall width function shown in fig 3 left graph the rainfall map of event a2 is quite different with the maximum rainfall being located upstream which has been clearly confirmed by the associated rainfall width function fig 3 right graph the rainfall width functions presented in fig 3 reveal that most rain events feature significant variability along the hydrological path and moreover the events of the two basins are of a different nature for gard anduze left graph all events but one are characterized by a higher rainfall amount downstream while for ardèche vogüe most rain events are characterized by a higher rainfall amount upstream or in the central part of the basin it is clear that these rainfall features can influence the basin response to rainfall forcing along with the e giuh summarizing this response 4 application and results 4 1 the identification algorithm it has been proposed to treat e giuh identification within the framework of inverse theory as detailed in the textbooks by menke w 2012 tarentola 2005 the solution minimizes the following expression 15 φ d p m d d t c q 1 m p d 0 p p 0 t c p 1 p p 0 d m p where φ is the likelihood function t signifies transpose m denotes the model relating data and parameters p 0 is the vector of a priori parameters c p is the covariance matrices of residuals between truth and unknown and a priori parameters and c dm the covariance matrix combining data and modeling uncertainties tarentola 2005 the statistical distributions of both d d 0 and p p 0 are assumed to be unbiased and gaussian menke 1989 demonstrated that the solution vector p satisfies 16 p p 0 c p m t m t c p m c dm 1 d 0 m p m p p 0 where m is the matrix of first order partial derivatives of model m if model m is nonlinear tarentola 2005 demonstrated that the solution can be obtained using a quasi newton method by means of the following algorithm equation 3 51 p 69 17 p n 1 p n μ n m n t c p 1 m n c d 1 1 m n t c dm 1 m p n d 0 c p 1 p n p 0 in which p n constitutes the result of the nth iteration m n m p n p n is the matrix of first order partial derivatives of the model at point p n and μ n 1 serves to control the convergence more information regarding the resolution of such nonlinear problems can be found in menke 2012 tarentola 2005 the a priori information introduced in terms of p 0 c p contains the initial knowledge of the parameters to be identified along with the confidence ascribed to this knowledge if the observed data are insufficient or if the level of confidence in the data is low then the problem becomes underdetermined and the a priori information assumes a dominant role if the problem is over determined i e availability of very high quality data in sufficient quantity the solution would only depend very little on the a priori information the next section presents the application conditions of this inverse algorithm in order to identify the e giuh by focusing on the a priori information that initializes the identification process 4 2 identification algorithm a priori information 4 2 1 data and associated covariance matrix the data vector which regroups n d m q 3 components d 0 q 0 k 1 k m r q 0 k 0 0 0 0 was introduced in section 2 2 its covariance matrix c dm characterizes the uncertainties on both the data and model equations this matrix is assumed to be diagonal and the standard deviations associated with both the data and model equations have been assembled in the vector σ d 0 σ q 0 σ σ q 0 σ e σ v with 18 σ q 0 σ q 1 σ q m q a n d σ q 0 i m a x α q q 0 i σ q min σ σ q 0 α σ k 1 k m q q k σ e α e e t u e d e σ v α v v a r t u e d e α σ α e α v are the coefficients of variation of the errors associated with equations 11 12 and 13 respectively 4 2 2 a priori e giuh parameters the two e giuh parameters are velocity u e and the coefficient of dispersion d e nevertheless the e giuh components also depend on the event rainfall width function w e which reveals the spatial pattern of effective rainfall the rainfall width function is derived from radar time series data let s note that this choice is associated with the measured rainfall width function and not the effective rainfall width function such caution is exercised in seeking to maintain the e giuh independent of the a priori effective rainfall which may be erroneous comparison tests conducted between rainfall width functions and effective rainfall width functions by means of the kolmogorof smirnov protocol have confirmed that the two pdfs are not significantly different the a priori velocity u e 0 and a priori hydrodynamic coefficient of dispersion d e 0 are both set by the user and accompanied by their standard deviations of σ u and σ d respectively the total coefficient of dispersion of the giuh is expressed as follows rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 19 d g 0 d e 0 u e 0 2 v a r t 2 l a n d d g 0 u e 0 v l 2 l 4 2 3 a priori parameters hyetograph of effective rainfall r e the giuh expresses the transformation of effective rainfall over the basin to flow at its outlet it is worth considering the accuracy of effective rainfall the hydrograph of effective rainfall is incorporated into the parameters of the inverse algorithm and moreover defined by its a priori components r n 0 as well as the associated error covariance matrix the inverse algorithm offers a flexibility that enables taking the effective rainfall into account in various ways ranging between two extreme situations namely i the basin production function giving rise to a vector grouping the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall components r e 0 is considered to be accurate and the associated covariance terms are very weak the inverse algorithm does not significantly modify the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall and its functioning is nearly the equivalent to the calibration of the two parameters defining the e giuh ii the production function is unknown and the hyetograph of effective rainfall components are the parameters to be determined in this case r e 0 is not considered to be accurate and the associated covariance terms are assigned large values the inverse algorithm identifies both the net hyetograph and e giuh and moreover may be viewed as an evolution of the method developed by duband et al 1993 to simultaneously identify the unit hydrograph common to all events and the hyetograph of effective rainfall of each of them the matrix of error covariance of the effective rainfall hyetograph is defined as follows 20 c o v r e 0 i r e 0 j σ ri σ rj exp i j δ t t r 2 σ ri max α r r e 0 i σ rmin with i and j being time indices σ ri and σ rj the error standard deviation of r e 0 i and r e 0 j respectively α r is the coefficient of variation in the error characterizing the hyetograph of effective rainfall β r denotes the minimum value assigned to the error standard deviation and t r is the decorrelation time controlling the temporal structure of the errors affecting successive components of the a priori net hyetograph the role of the a priori net hyetograph in the e giuh identification is defined by the value assigned to α r a very weak value e g 0 05 means that the a priori net hyetograph is assumed to be highly accurate whereas a larger value e g 0 2 to 0 3 indicates that the a priori net hyetograph is assumed to be inaccurate 4 3 reference e giuhs 4 3 1 data and model description the flow data are assumed to be of good quality the coefficient of variation of the flow measurement error has been set at α q 0 10 with a minimum value of 2 m 3 s 1 equation 9 is assumed to be exact and free of any error equation 11 which expresses the budget equation and is assumed to be associated with a weak error characterized by its small coefficient of variation α σ 0 05 the theoretical giuh framework coupled with the introduction of the spatial rainfall variability accurately depicts the true e giuh equations 12 and 13 this modeling error is then defined by weak coefficients of variations α e 0 05 and α v 0 05 respectively 4 3 2 a priori e giuh a constant a priori velocity has been adopted for all flow events of the same basin the standard deviation values retained are σ u 0 5 m s 1 and σ d 1000 m 2 s 1 in order to leave a wide interval of variation with respect to the a priori values the a priori e giuh also depends on the rainfall width function w e 0 which has been derived from radar time series data let s note once again that this choice is associated with the measured rainfall width function and not the effective rainfall width function such an exercise of caution aims to maintain the e giuh independent of the a priori effective rainfall which may be erroneous in addition the comparison of rainfall width functions and effective rainfall width functions for these case study events by means of the kolmogorof smirnov test have confirmed that they do not differ significantly the scs model has been adopted to provide the a priori values of the net hyetograph this classical model is widely used and recent tools have been developed to derive the curve number values from remote sensing data ross et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 the scs model has been successfully applied to basins subject to flooding in this mediterranean region naulin et al 2013 it is being used herein by considering a parameter s moy that represents the mean storage capacity of the basin for a given event the runoff volume is defined by 21 vr k 1 p rt k ia k 2 r t k ia k s k with vr denoting the runoff volume at the basin outlet p the number of meshes in the basin grid rt k the rainfall amount s k the storage capacity and ia k 0 2 s k the initial loss of mesh k the cn values are then transformed into a map of relative storage capacity from which the storage capacity of each mesh is derived s k s moy γ k with γ k being the relative storage capacity of mesh k s moy has been calibrated for each flood event so that the effective rainfall volume is equal to the runoff volume as runoff generated by the effective rainfall is assumed to be the dominant process of flow generation the base flow is removed from the observed flow values the pre event base flow is the measured flow at the beginning of the rain event at the end of the event it is assumed that the runoff contribution becomes negligible after the rain has stopped for a period equal to the basin time of concentration the post event base flow is the flow measured at this time it is assumed that the base flow varies linearly between these values during the flood event the time of concentration is estimated to be 18 h for the gard anduze basin and 24 h for the ardèche vogüe basin changing the concentration times by a few hours don t significantly affect the obtained results the net hyetograph r e 0 is thus deduced from the time series of hourly effective rainfall maps for the identification of the reference e giuh it is assumed that the a priori effective rainfall is highly accurate the coefficient of variation of each net hyetograph component is then given by the value α r 0 10 in addition t r 2 h controls the temporal structure of the error on the a priori net hyetograph the application conditions selected to derive the reference e giuhs are collated in table 2 4 4 results and discussion the accuracy of the identified e giuh can only be evaluated indirectly the classical nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion denoted nse is used for such a purpose 22 nse x 1 i 1 i n x refi x tesi 2 i 1 i n x refi x 2 with x refi reference vector of n components of mean x tes x i vector to be tested the e giuhs identified according to the reference application conditions are displayed in fig 4 these results have been assessed by calculating four criteria 1 nse q between observed hydrographs and hydrographs modeled using a priori e giuh and an a priori net hyetograph 2 nse q between observed hydrographs and hydrographs modeled using the identification results 3 nse rn between the a priori net hyetograph and the identified net hyetograph and 4 nse giuh between the a priori e giuh and the identified e giuh these criteria are calculated for each flood event their average value is computed for the two basins so as to provide an overview of the results obtained these criteria have been compiled in table 3 leading to the following comments the identified e giuhs allow improving the simulation of observed hydrographs this improvement seems as more pronounced as the identified values of u e d e differ from the a priori values the average increase in nse q is significant from 0 72 to 0 83 for gard anduze and from 0 65 to 0 84 for ardèche vogüe this increase primarily results from an evolution in e giuhs indeed a comparison of the net hyetographs indicates that the a priori ones slightly differ from the identified ones the average value of nse rn equals 0 97 for gard anduze and 0 96 for ardèche vogüe in all cases the criterion is above 0 92 a comparison of the a priori and identified e giuhs confirms quite well that based on the reference conditions the identification method acts primarily on e giuhs indeed the average values of nse giuh 0 74 for gard anduze and 0 65 for ardèche vogüe underscore that a priori e giuhs differ considerably from identified ones beyond these criteria it is very interesting to note the wide diversity and wide variability of the e giuhs of each basin for instance the time to peak for gard anduze flood events left graph ranges from one hour to seven hours while the time to peak for ardèche vogüe flood events ranges from 5 to 10 h these results confirm not only the influence of rainfall variability on the e giuh but also the fact that the e giuh could be well adapted to serve as a signature characteristic of a flood event the a priori values of the e giuh parameters u e 0 d e 0 have been chosen regardless of the event features what conclusions can be drawn from their resulting values for the sake of simplicity the hydrological features of a flood event are summarized by its specific flow peak q max considered as an indicator of the event magnitude the use of a specific flow peak allows regrouping the events of both catchments on the same graph in order to study a possible relationship between this indicator and the e giuh parameters the scattergrams u e q max and d e q max with q max as the specific flow peak are displayed in fig 5 it can be observed that a significant correlation exists between the two e giuh parameters and the specific flow peak let s note that the coefficient of determination r 2 has been calculated without accounting for the exceptional flow event that occurred on sept 20 21 2002 the limited size of the dataset and the fairly low value of r 2 do not offer the basis for a more detailed analysis this result however could suggest that the mean flow velocity u e increases with the magnitude of the flood event which appears to be logical and consistent with previous results it is interesting to note that taking the rainfall width function into consideration does not alter this mean trend even though it could be surmised that flood events displaying a strong rainfall variability also exhibit a stronger variability in flow velocity within the hydrological network results regarding the coefficient of dispersion d e are not simple to analyze the model equations relate d e and u e which would contribute to the link between q max and d e similarly the average values of d e and u e table 2 indicate a strong increase in d e values with respect to the a priori values thereby likely to generate an accurate restitution of the observed hydrographs lastly the sensitivity study next section suggests that this identification procedure is not highly sensitive to d e moreover it is not yet possible to draw a clear conclusion and studying a larger sample of events would allow progressing in this effort 4 5 sensitivity study of the e giuh identification this sensitivity study addresses the influence of the application conditions on the identified e giuhs this section provides the main results and conclusions of the sensitivity study a detailed presentation can be found in the supporting information note that special attention has been paid to the influence of the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall 4 5 1 sensitivity to u e d e variations this test examines the influence of u e d e variations on the simulated e giuhs and hydrographs the e giuhs and hydrographs obtained by varying u e d e values with respect to the reference solution are compared to the e giuhs and hydrographs of this reference solution by calculating the nse values fig 5 illustrates the results of this test which yields two key indications i the influence of d e is much weaker than that of u e and ii the simulated hydrographs are much less influenced by u e d e variations than the simulated e giuhs this latter result proves to be important given that the identification procedure is mostly based on observed hydrographs this sensitivity study confirms that a reliable estimation of u e d e from hydrographs is far from being straightforward 4 5 2 sensitivity of the e giuh to inverse algorithm application conditions this part of the sensitivity study comprises i the confidence assigned to flow data coefficient of variation α q ii the confidence assigned to the giuh theoretical model coefficients of variation α e and α v iii the influence of the a priori value of d e 0 iv the influence of the a priori value of u e 0 and lastly v the confidence assigned to the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall coefficient of variation α r it is performed by running the e giuh identification in varying one of these factors with respect to the reference conditions the results obtained are summarized in table 4 and then detailed in the appendix it is interesting to emphasize the influence of an increase of α r which controls the error variance on the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall it is confirmed that an increase of α r results in an improvement of the restitution of the observed hydrograph the overall improvement is obtained by changes in the resulting effective rainfall hyetograph thus confirming the capability of this method to identify both the e giuh and the hyetograh of effective rainfall rn this result might extend the application domain of the proposed method but this subject is out the scope of the present work which focuses on the identification of e giuhs 4 5 3 influence of the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall the previous results have been obtained by considering that the widely used scs production function accurately represents basin operations the question raised then is whether the choice of an a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall affects the identified e giuhs this test is conducted by running the method with an a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall that s very different from the scs one so as to introduce a sharp contrast with the reference application conditions the selected production function denoted cr pi assumes initial losses of 20 mm in each mesh of the basin along with a constant runoff coefficient for each flood event this coefficient is estimated such that the effective rainfall volume is equal to the runoff volume the choice of the a priori net hyetograph is the only modification adopted with respect to the reference application conditions the two a priori net hyetographs are assumed to be rather inaccurate with an error covariance α r 0 25 it then becomes possible to compare the e giuhs identified based on the scs and cr pi production function respectively the a priori e giuhs turn out to be similar for both cases the comparison results are detailed in the supporting information section and illustrated in fig 6 which displays the 12 e giuhs obtained from the scs continuous line and the cr pi dashed line net hyetographs respectively the reference e giuh thin continuous line has been added to this comparison the sensitivity test shows that for 9 of the 12 flood events the identified e giuh is very weakly affected by the change in a priori net hyetograph nse giuh 0 94 only moderately affected for 2 of them n s e giuh 0 88 and significantly affected for 1 other event a1 nse giuh 0 80 more specifically fig 7 indicates that the differences between the 12 e giuhs remain quite pronounced and much larger than the fluctuations of each e giuh in addition it is confirmed that the identification method serves to improve the net hyetograph with the identified ones lying much closer than the a priori ones 5 summary and conclusion the giuh has become a classical representation of the rapid response of a basin when adapted to rainfall runoff modeling if the giuh depends on the morphological features of a basin then it is also influenced by the characteristics of rainfall patterns as well as by the variability of flow path velocities we have therefore considered that an event specific giuh or e giuh exists that actually characterizes the catchment response under the specific conditions of each flood event the method proposed herein to identify this e giuh relies on the width function based giuh rigon et al 2016 as adapted to take into account the spatial variability of rainfall through replacing the width function by the rainfall width function emmanuel et al 2015 woods and sivapalan 1999 the e giuh is identified from data combining time series of rain fields and observed hydrographs this e giuh identification has been tested on a dataset composed of 12 flood events that occurred on catchments within the ohmcv observatory territory despite being of limited range this evaluation has provided interesting insights namely the concept of e giuh appears to be relevant and moreover the proposed identification method seems easily applicable and flexible for users who are now able to define the adapted application conditions the e giuhs associated with the various flood events of a catchment display very distinct characteristics thus confirming that e giuh shape depends on the giuh model parameters as well as on the rainfall width function both of which are specific to the flood events for both basins the two e giuh parameters u e d e lie within the range 0 9 m s 1 8 m s for u e and 600 m2 s 5 200 m2 s for d e these two parameters appear to be correlated with the event peak flow which serves as an indicator of flow magnitude even though this tenuous link needs to be confirmed and warrants further investigation the identification procedure is more sensitive to parameter u e than to parameter d e mainly because the direct model is not highly sensitive to this latter parameter the results obtained appear to be fairly robust and in most cases remain relatively independent of the a priori rainfall hyetograph this result indicates that representative e giuhs could be derived by defining the a priori effective rainfall from a widely used production function and then calibrating the two e giuh parameters this work would need to be pursued in several directions in order to improve our knowledge and develop applications relying on the e giuh concept including a more robust assessment of the proposed method seems to be a priority this could be achieved by application to a large numbers of catchments located in various climatic zones the e giuh which is mostly based on observed data could be considered as a signature characterizing flood events the flood events that affect a basin stem from diverse conditions moisture status of the basin spatial and temporal characteristics of the rain event the e giuh associated with a given basin summarizes the basin response under such conditions an analysis of the population of e giuhs would pave the way to a hydro climatological catchment response to rainfall forcing the relatively small number of basins and flood events described here does not allow a complete assessment of the limitations of the method under all circumstances for instance the method might be less suitable if the rainfall influence results from moving rainfall fields interacting with the basin volpi et al 2013 in addition the method might be less efficient when the statistical framework is outside of its application domain e g when the distribution of error is not gaussian or at least unimodal or when the a priori conditions are not relevant the e giuh represents a signature of the basin response that could prove useful for various applications first it can be used to diagnose basin responses to rainfall forcing the e giuh summarizes the basin response that stems from diverse physiographic climatological and meteorological conditions such as moisture status of the basin and the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall forcing the e giuh signature can be used to compare and classify basin responses for different forcing rain events or to analyse the influence of land use and change e g recovery after wildfire among other factors analysing populations of e giuhs that represent various conditions opens the way to hydro climatological studies of catchment responses finally it could contribute to improving lumped rainfall runoff modelling through transfer function adapted to

nnx16al23g appendix a sensitivity study this sensitivity analysis has focused on the influence of the application conditions on the identified e giuhs more specifically it has concerned the confidence assigned to flow data coefficient of variation α q the confidence assigned to the giuh theoretical model coefficients of variation α e and α v the influence of the a priori value of d e 0 the influence of the a priori value of u e 0 and lastly the influence of this error on the a priori net hyetograph this study has been performed by running the e giuh identification method while varying one of these factors with respect to the reference conditions the influence was then assessed by calculating i the mean nash efficiency criterion between the observed and resulting hydrographs nse q ii the mean nash efficiency criterion between the resulting e giuhs and the reference e giuh nse giuh and iii the mean absolute deviation between the series of reference values of u e and d e respectively the results of this sensitivity analysis are displayed in fig a1 and lead to the following conclusions confidence assigned to flow data fig a1 a the increase in the coefficient of variation α q which reflects a loss of confidence in the measured flow data clearly yields a reduced quality of the resulting hydrographs blue line the value of nse giuh remains above 0 94 which denotes a moderate influence on the identified e giuh with respect to the reference one except for α q 0 3 where the e giuh change is more pronounced nse giuh 0 89 confidence assigned to the giuh model fig a1 b a very strong confidence in giuh theory α e α v 0 02 results in a lower quality of the obtained hydrographs this quality improves and stabilizes quickly at nse q 0 85 0 86 as α e and α v increase the value of nse giuh is higher than 0 95 when α e a n d α e 0 05 which denotes a weak influence on the identified e giuh with respect to the reference one the more noteworthy effect pertains to the mean identified value of d e which rises from 1560 m 2 s 1 to 3700 m 2 s 1 at which point the constraints on giuh theory are relaxed without the quality criteria being significantly modified this finding confirms that the identification of d e is far from being straightforward based on the available observations influence of the a priori value of d e 0 fig a1 c the a priori value of d e 0 has been increased from 0 35 d g 0 to d g 0 the influence of this value appears to be very weak while the values of nse q and nse giuh remain nearly constant at respectively 0 83 0 84 and 0 99 the mean identified value of d e increases from 2110 m 2 s 1 to 2800 m 2 s 1 with respect to d e 0 this influence is less marked than that for α e and α v influence of the a priori value of u e 0 fig a1 d this influence is tested by defining the a priori value u e 0 u e δ u with u e being the solution obtained according to the reference application conditions and δ u 0 5 0 25 0 0 0 25 0 5 m s note that a modification of u e 0 also de facto affects d e 0 the results obtained indicate that i a strong underestimation of u e δ u 0 5 m s cannot be corrected by the identification procedure n s e q 0 66 n s e giuh 0 7 a n d mad u 0 2 m s ii the situation is more satisfactory for a moderate underestimation or overestimation δ u 0 25 m s for which the final giuhs do not differ substantially from the reference solutions n s e giuh 0 92 a n d 0 93 and mad u 0 11 a n d 0 09 m s respectively and iii an initial overestimation of velocity by the a priori value appears to be less detrimental than an underestimation influence of this error covariance on the a priori net hyetograph the e giuh identification has been performed by varying the value of α r from α r 0 03 excellent confidence in the a priori net hyetograph to α r 0 0 30 weak confidence these results are illustrated in fig a2 in its display of the evolution in nse q between the observed hydrographs and the hydrographs simulated using the final set of parameters in offering the following insights the increase of α r results in an increase of nse q which rises from nse q 0 83 for α r 0 03 to nse q 0 88 for α r 0 24 meaning that the set of parameters characterizing basin operations r n e g i u h is globally better determined this improvement is not correlated with significant changes in the identified e giuhs which do not differ significantly from the e giuh reference application conditions indeed the value of nse giuh remains above 0 97 for α r 0 17 and α r 0 24 this improvement is mainly derived from changes in the resulting net hyetographs in comparison with the a priori net hyetographs as confirmed by the value of nse rn calculated between the a priori and identified net hyetographs which decreases from 0 99 to 0 55 as α r increases from 0 05 to 0 3 this sensitivity analysis has confirmed that relaxing the constraint on the a priori net hyetograph yields an overall more efficient functioning of the identification algorithm which leads to a coupled identification of the r n e g i u h couple without modifying the resulting e giuh by considering the a priori net hyetograph to be accurate appendix b

3877,in the field of hydrology the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh is central to describing a watershed response the application of giuh is extended to individual hydrological events by accounting for the influence of rainfall spatial distribution a method is proposed herein to identify the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph specific to each flood event i e e giuh when runoff of effective rainfall is the dominant process the e giuh is derived from observational data namely rainfall field time series and a hydrograph such an identification process is formulated as an inverse problem with parameters such as the e giuh velocity and coefficient of dispersion as well as the hyetograph of rainfall excess the proposed method is applied to several flood events across two mountainous catchments within the cevennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory territory prone to flash flooding results indicate that the e giuhs display significant variability over the two basins and the e giuh parameters appear to be correlated with the flood event magnitude the e giuh synthetizes the basin response to rain forcing and can be considered as a signature of flood events a sensitivity study suggests that e giuh identification is fairly robust even with respect to the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall keywords giuh

geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh defined as the probability density function pdf of water travel time along the channel links of the hydrographic network was developed by gupta et al 1980 rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 by linking the unit hydrograph dooge 1959 sherman 1932 to the geomorphological parameters of a catchment the emergence of giuh has contributed to the success of lumped rainfall runoff models which are widely used for their parsimony and robustness in both flash flood prediction and hydrograph analysis when runoff of effective rainfall is the dominant process of floods wood et al 1990 more specifically the giuh is well suited to treating the ungauged basin modeling problem which pertains to the longstanding challenge of regional modeling over large areas as exposed in the review paper by singh et al 2014 the widespread use of giuh within the hydrology community coupled with its development over the decades attests to its relevance in representing watershed responses and moreover confirms the ability of this approach to complement distributed models fatichi et al 2016 the initial giuh formulation relies on the channel links in hydrographic networks as described by the horton classification marani et al 1991 and rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 extended this formulation to the probability density function pdf of hydrological distances to the basin outlet as described by the width function kirkby 1976 and went on to propose the width function geomorphological approach d odorico and rigon 2003 rigon et al 2016 an assumption of constant velocity is adopted to convert the distribution of flow distances into a pdf of travel times along flow paths the travel time pdf may be represented by the advection dispersion equation ade rinaldo et al 1991 and a unique solution of the diffusive wave equation hayami 1951 moussa 1997 the giuh is thus defined by the width function and the two parameters characterizing the ade and dwe i e flow velocity and coefficient of dispersion saco and kumar 2002a justified this constant velocity assumption by showing that varying flow path velocities can be taken into account by means of a kinematic geomorphic dispersion that increases the coefficient of dispersion parameter giuh applications often rely on a unique set of parameters in order to calibrate the model e g boudhraâ et al 2018 chen et al 2019 choi et al 2011 moussa 1997 yao et al 2014 thereby suggesting that a single representative giuh can be associated with a catchment however several studies have highlighted the influence on the catchment response of i the rain spatial distribution emmanuel et al 2017 goni et al 2019 olivera and maidment 1999 zoccatelli et al 2010 and ii the rain event magnitude rodriguez et al 2005 saco and kumar 2002b these findings have been confirmed by the post event analysis of floods smith et al 2005 smith et al 2002 among others and simulation studies emmanuel et al 2015 volpi et al 2012 hence acknowledging the giuh limitations listed by rigon et al 2016 who specifically noted these shortcomings when accounting for the rainfall distribution broadly speaking these results indicate that the giuh depends on rainfall runoff processes that drive the flow dynamics in the hydrograph network consequently every flood event can be characterized by its own giuh hereafter denoted as the e giuh which is capable of enriching the signatures of hydrological processes driving the basin response to rainfall forcing at the flood event scale mcmillan 2020 this manuscript aims to advance the width function based giuh by i adapting its formulation in order to account for the influence of spatial rainfall variability and ii proposing a method to determine the e giuh for each flood event first the giuh formulation is adapted to take into account the spatial rainfall pattern by means of replacing the width function by the rainfall width function emmanuel et al 2015 woods and sivapalan 1999 this improvement serves to overcome a key limitation of the giuh as highlighted by rigon et al 2016 second a novel e giuh identification method based on observed data is developed and tested the typical approach consists of assuming a production function and jointly calibrating the giuh and the production function parameters hence results depend on the a priori production function to address this problem the original method proposed herein formulates event giuh identification as an inverse problem menke 2012 tarentola 2005 inverse theory was defined by menke 2012 as a set of mathematical techniques for reducing data to obtain knowledge about the physical world on the basis of inferences drawn from observations inverse techniques have been used in hydrology e g by pan and wood 2013 to derive spatially distributed runoff by fisher et al 2020 for the purpose of determining spatially distributed continuous river discharge from discrete flow data as well as by boudhraâ et al 2018 to derive the hyetograph of effective rainfall from flow data the e giuh is identified from the observed hydrograh and from an estimation of the hyetograph of effective rainfall it is likely that this hyetograph influences the resulting e giuh the use of an inverse algorithm makes it possible to explicitly consider the specific role of this hyetograph it can be done by considering it as a set of parameters of the problem to solve the algorithm is initialized by the priori information about this hyetograph which combines the estimation of the a posteriori hyetograph and its accuracy the inverse algorithm will give more or less importance to the a priori hyetograph according to its accuracy and will propose an improved shape more generally the adopted framework is well adapted to considering the weight of data a priori parameter values and model on the solution based on their accuracy the proposed approach extends the domain of application of the giuh it allows to characterize each event in terms of a specific e giuh that can be viewed as the signature of this event section 2 presents an adaptation of the width function based giuh which takes into account the spatial rainfall variability and develops the approach employed to identify the e giuh from observed data namely the hydrograph and rainfall field time series the case study serving to test the proposed e giuh identification method is described in section 3 this case study combines a set of events affecting two basins located in southern france section 4 provides the application conditions of this e giuh identification approach and second 5 discusses the results obtained section 6 concludes the manuscript 2 methods 2 1 the event specific geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph e giuh this section introduces the spatial variability of rainfall in the derivation of the width function based e giuh d odorico and rigon 2003 rigon et al 2016 the travel time of water drops and the giuh both depend primarily on the hydrological distance l defined as the distance to the outlet from any point on the hydrological network let w be the width function of the basin defined as the portion of the basin area at the hydrological distance l which in addition represents the transverse extent of the basin at l rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 the spatial rainfall variability is represented by the rainfall variability along hydrological paths smith et al 2005 the flow at the catchment outlet can be expressed as 1 q t 0 l max d q l t d l d q l t a w l d l 0 t r e l t τ f l τ d τ with d q l t denoting the outflow at time t from surface area da a w l d l at hydrological distance l r e the effective rainfall at time τ and at hydrological distance l l max the maximum hydrological distance and f the travel time distribution of water particles from da it is assumed that the probability density function pdf of travel time can be modeled by the following law rigon et al 2016 rinaldo et al 1991 2 f l t l 4 π d l t 3 e x p l u l t 2 4 d l t with u l and d l denoting the respective parameters of velocity and coefficient of dispersion sometimes called diffusivity of the travel time pdf let s note that eq 2 is also the hayami 1951 solution of the diffusive wave equation moussa 1997 with u d standing for the mean velocity and coefficient of dispersion respectively of the wave flow the influence of rainfall spatial variability on flow conditions may explain why u and d both depend on the rainfall variability along flow paths can be introduced by defining the rainfall width function as inspired from smith et al 2005 3 w r l t r e l t r e t w l with w r rainfall width function and r e t mean value of effective rainfall over the basin at time τ unlike the width function the rainfall width function does depend on time emmanuel et al 2015 showed that the influence of spatial rainfall variability on the basin response is well explained by the deviation between the width function and the rainfall width function associated to the pattern of rain amount during a time interval of approximately two to three times the basin response time which is thus close to the time of concentration the event rainfall width function w e is defined over this duration it was first introduced by woods and sivapalan 1999 to analyze the effect of spatial rainfall variability and runoff formation on catchment response according to these authors it can be assumed that the spatio temporal variability of rainfall along flow paths can be written as the product of two independent functions i e 4 r e l t w e l r e t with w e event rainfall width function which depends only on hydrologic distance and r e hyetograph of effective rainfall which depends only on time introducing eq 4 into eq 1 leads to the following expression of outflow 5 q t 0 l max a w e l d l 0 t r e l t τ f l τ d τ which can also be written 6 q t a 0 t r e t τ f e τ d τ f e τ 0 lmax w e l f l τ d l f e is the e giuh associated with the flood event e saco and kumar 2002a stated that the pdf of travel time f can be approximated by replacing the varying parameters u and d by an equivalent network velocity u e and equivalent hydrodynamic coefficient of dispersion d e which enable preserving the mean and variance of f e they noticed that although used as spatially invariant parameters they are estimated to account for the nonlinear effects that arise when varying hydrodynamic parameters ultimately the expression of e giuh is 7 f e t 0 l b l w e l 4 π d e t 3 e x p l u e t 2 4 d e t d τ in addition rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 found that the first two moments of f e must satisfy the following expressions 8 e t 1 u e e l a n d v a r t 2 d e u e 2 e l 1 u e 2 v a r l where e l and v a r l are the first two moments of the pdf of hydrological paths in sum the spatial variability of rainfall can be integrated into the width function based giuh by replacing the width function by the rainfall width function this formulation paves the way to determining the e giuh which characterizes the basin response to each rain event forcing 2 2 principles of the e giuh identification process the problem posed consists of identifying the e giuh specific to flood event e that leads to the best reconstitution of the observed hydrograph at the basin outlet this e giuh is defined by two parameters u e and d e as well as by the event rainfall width function w e note that equation 6 expresses the hydrograph as a function of both e giuh and the hyetograph of effective rainfall meaning that the identification of effective rainfall and event giuh are not independent of one another and moreover that the transformation of observed rainfall data fields into a hyetograph of effective rainfall might influence the identified e giuh for this reason the components of the hyetograph of effective rainfall are also considered as parameters nevertheless the adopted identification algorithm section 4 provides the opportunity to introduce the hyetograph of effective rainfall as an a priori information to which a level of confidence is ascribed thus making it possible to control its influence on the result lastly the e giuh identification process calls for a model capable of combining the following equations i flow at the catchment outlet expressed as the convolution product q r e f e u e d e written in a discretized manner 9 q j a k 1 k j r e j 1 k f e k u e d e with 10 f e k u e d e γ 1 γ n w w r γ k δ t k 1 δ t

in the southeastern part of france s massif central sector fig 1 the southeastern end of this range consists of a plateau and a plain area extending to the mediterranean coast several rivers originate in the cevennes mountains and cross the intermediate plain to empty into the rhone river or flow into the mediterranean sea this region displays typical mediterranean climate and is subject to heavy rainfall events during the fall causing flash floods that can result in considerable damage and losses the cevennes region is covered by a network of rain gauges at a density of roughly 1 gauge every 150 km2 complemented by two weather radars that provide quantitative precipitation estimates qpe at a high spatial 1 km 1 km and temporal 5 min resolution hydrometeorological recordings in this region are enhanced by the presence of the ohmcv cevennes vivarais mediterranean hydrometeorological observatory http www ohmcv fr this long term observatory has built an integrated hydrometeorological database of flash flood events across the cevennes vivarais area the available operational datasets have therefore undergone a thorough quality control and can be considered highly accurate boudevillain et al 2011 the ohmcv provides several qpe products for purposes of this study the hourly rainfall fields of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution obtained by means of a radar rain gauge merging technique proposed by delrieu et al 2014 have been used these fields offer a high level of accuracy compared to other qpe products the basins considered herein are gard at the anduze gauging station surface area 545 km2 and ardèche at the vogüe gauging station 620 km2 upstream of anduze the gard bedrock consists mainly of schist 61 and granite 18 the ardèche bedrock upstream of vogüe is mostly granitic 72 douinot et al 2018 the hydrographic network of these two basins has been determined with the taudem tool tarboton 1997 in using a dtm at a spatial resolution of 250 m both basins are well documented and have been the subject of several works on rainfall runoff modeling adamovic et al 2015 douinot et al 2018 moussa et al 2007 naulin et al 2013 saulnier and le lay 2009 tramblay et al 2011 vannier et al 2016 and flash flood forecasting alfieri et al 2011 dolcine et al 2001 the qpe product covers a time period from 2011 to 2014 and includes one very intense and significant rain event in september 2002 delrieu et al 2005 a sample of six flood events at each basin have been selected comprising both rain and flow data all these events are single peak hydrographs which are more easily adapted to characterizing a unit hydrograph some selected events occurred during long rainy periods which explains the high flow values observed upon their initiation the main features of these flood events are summarized in table 1 the peak flow of a two year return period is respectively q2 630 m3 s for gard anduze and q2 740 m3 s for ardèche vogüe thus indicating that the dataset contains flow events of various magnitudes the coefficient of variation in the spatial rainfall amount ranges from 0 08 to 1 04 for gard anduze and from 0 22 to 0 76 for ardèche vogüe which confirms the varied characteristics of the selected flood events fig 2 illustrates one event for each basin g5 for gard a2 for ardèche the other events of each basin are displayed in the supplementary information section it can be noted that the rainfall map of event g5 indicates that the maximum rainfall occurs downstream as confirmed by the corresponding rainfall width function shown in fig 3 left graph the rainfall map of event a2 is quite different with the maximum rainfall being located upstream which has been clearly confirmed by the associated rainfall width function fig 3 right graph the rainfall width functions presented in fig 3 reveal that most rain events feature significant variability along the hydrological path and moreover the events of the two basins are of a different nature for gard anduze left graph all events but one are characterized by a higher rainfall amount downstream while for ardèche vogüe most rain events are characterized by a higher rainfall amount upstream or in the central part of the basin it is clear that these rainfall features can influence the basin response to rainfall forcing along with the e giuh summarizing this response 4 application and results 4 1 the identification algorithm it has been proposed to treat e giuh identification within the framework of inverse theory as detailed in the textbooks by menke w 2012 tarentola 2005 the solution minimizes the following expression 15 φ d p m d d t c q 1 m p d 0 p p 0 t c p 1 p p 0 d m p where φ is the likelihood function t signifies transpose m denotes the model relating data and parameters p 0 is the vector of a priori parameters c p is the covariance matrices of residuals between truth and unknown and a priori parameters and c dm the covariance matrix combining data and modeling uncertainties tarentola 2005 the statistical distributions of both d d 0 and p p 0 are assumed to be unbiased and gaussian menke 1989 demonstrated that the solution vector p satisfies 16 p p 0 c p m t m t c p m c dm 1 d 0 m p m p p 0 where m is the matrix of first order partial derivatives of model m if model m is nonlinear tarentola 2005 demonstrated that the solution can be obtained using a quasi newton method by means of the following algorithm equation 3 51 p 69 17 p n 1 p n μ n m n t c p 1 m n c d 1 1 m n t c dm 1 m p n d 0 c p 1 p n p 0 in which p n constitutes the result of the nth iteration m n m p n p n is the matrix of first order partial derivatives of the model at point p n and μ n 1 serves to control the convergence more information regarding the resolution of such nonlinear problems can be found in menke 2012 tarentola 2005 the a priori information introduced in terms of p 0 c p contains the initial knowledge of the parameters to be identified along with the confidence ascribed to this knowledge if the observed data are insufficient or if the level of confidence in the data is low then the problem becomes underdetermined and the a priori information assumes a dominant role if the problem is over determined i e availability of very high quality data in sufficient quantity the solution would only depend very little on the a priori information the next section presents the application conditions of this inverse algorithm in order to identify the e giuh by focusing on the a priori information that initializes the identification process 4 2 identification algorithm a priori information 4 2 1 data and associated covariance matrix the data vector which regroups n d m q 3 components d 0 q 0 k 1 k m r q 0 k 0 0 0 0 was introduced in section 2 2 its covariance matrix c dm characterizes the uncertainties on both the data and model equations this matrix is assumed to be diagonal and the standard deviations associated with both the data and model equations have been assembled in the vector σ d 0 σ q 0 σ σ q 0 σ e σ v with 18 σ q 0 σ q 1 σ q m q a n d σ q 0 i m a x α q q 0 i σ q min σ σ q 0 α σ k 1 k m q q k σ e α e e t u e d e σ v α v v a r t u e d e α σ α e α v are the coefficients of variation of the errors associated with equations 11 12 and 13 respectively 4 2 2 a priori e giuh parameters the two e giuh parameters are velocity u e and the coefficient of dispersion d e nevertheless the e giuh components also depend on the event rainfall width function w e which reveals the spatial pattern of effective rainfall the rainfall width function is derived from radar time series data let s note that this choice is associated with the measured rainfall width function and not the effective rainfall width function such caution is exercised in seeking to maintain the e giuh independent of the a priori effective rainfall which may be erroneous comparison tests conducted between rainfall width functions and effective rainfall width functions by means of the kolmogorof smirnov protocol have confirmed that the two pdfs are not significantly different the a priori velocity u e 0 and a priori hydrodynamic coefficient of dispersion d e 0 are both set by the user and accompanied by their standard deviations of σ u and σ d respectively the total coefficient of dispersion of the giuh is expressed as follows rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 19 d g 0 d e 0 u e 0 2 v a r t 2 l a n d d g 0 u e 0 v l 2 l 4 2 3 a priori parameters hyetograph of effective rainfall r e the giuh expresses the transformation of effective rainfall over the basin to flow at its outlet it is worth considering the accuracy of effective rainfall the hydrograph of effective rainfall is incorporated into the parameters of the inverse algorithm and moreover defined by its a priori components r n 0 as well as the associated error covariance matrix the inverse algorithm offers a flexibility that enables taking the effective rainfall into account in various ways ranging between two extreme situations namely i the basin production function giving rise to a vector grouping the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall components r e 0 is considered to be accurate and the associated covariance terms are very weak the inverse algorithm does not significantly modify the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall and its functioning is nearly the equivalent to the calibration of the two parameters defining the e giuh ii the production function is unknown and the hyetograph of effective rainfall components are the parameters to be determined in this case r e 0 is not considered to be accurate and the associated covariance terms are assigned large values the inverse algorithm identifies both the net hyetograph and e giuh and moreover may be viewed as an evolution of the method developed by duband et al 1993 to simultaneously identify the unit hydrograph common to all events and the hyetograph of effective rainfall of each of them the matrix of error covariance of the effective rainfall hyetograph is defined as follows 20 c o v r e 0 i r e 0 j σ ri σ rj exp i j δ t t r 2 σ ri max α r r e 0 i σ rmin with i and j being time indices σ ri and σ rj the error standard deviation of r e 0 i and r e 0 j respectively α r is the coefficient of variation in the error characterizing the hyetograph of effective rainfall β r denotes the minimum value assigned to the error standard deviation and t r is the decorrelation time controlling the temporal structure of the errors affecting successive components of the a priori net hyetograph the role of the a priori net hyetograph in the e giuh identification is defined by the value assigned to α r a very weak value e g 0 05 means that the a priori net hyetograph is assumed to be highly accurate whereas a larger value e g 0 2 to 0 3 indicates that the a priori net hyetograph is assumed to be inaccurate 4 3 reference e giuhs 4 3 1 data and model description the flow data are assumed to be of good quality the coefficient of variation of the flow measurement error has been set at α q 0 10 with a minimum value of 2 m 3 s 1 equation 9 is assumed to be exact and free of any error equation 11 which expresses the budget equation and is assumed to be associated with a weak error characterized by its small coefficient of variation α σ 0 05 the theoretical giuh framework coupled with the introduction of the spatial rainfall variability accurately depicts the true e giuh equations 12 and 13 this modeling error is then defined by weak coefficients of variations α e 0 05 and α v 0 05 respectively 4 3 2 a priori e giuh a constant a priori velocity has been adopted for all flow events of the same basin the standard deviation values retained are σ u 0 5 m s 1 and σ d 1000 m 2 s 1 in order to leave a wide interval of variation with respect to the a priori values the a priori e giuh also depends on the rainfall width function w e 0 which has been derived from radar time series data let s note once again that this choice is associated with the measured rainfall width function and not the effective rainfall width function such an exercise of caution aims to maintain the e giuh independent of the a priori effective rainfall which may be erroneous in addition the comparison of rainfall width functions and effective rainfall width functions for these case study events by means of the kolmogorof smirnov test have confirmed that they do not differ significantly the scs model has been adopted to provide the a priori values of the net hyetograph this classical model is widely used and recent tools have been developed to derive the curve number values from remote sensing data ross et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 the scs model has been successfully applied to basins subject to flooding in this mediterranean region naulin et al 2013 it is being used herein by considering a parameter s moy that represents the mean storage capacity of the basin for a given event the runoff volume is defined by 21 vr k 1 p rt k ia k 2 r t k ia k s k with vr denoting the runoff volume at the basin outlet p the number of meshes in the basin grid rt k the rainfall amount s k the storage capacity and ia k 0 2 s k the initial loss of mesh k the cn values are then transformed into a map of relative storage capacity from which the storage capacity of each mesh is derived s k s moy γ k with γ k being the relative storage capacity of mesh k s moy has been calibrated for each flood event so that the effective rainfall volume is equal to the runoff volume as runoff generated by the effective rainfall is assumed to be the dominant process of flow generation the base flow is removed from the observed flow values the pre event base flow is the measured flow at the beginning of the rain event at the end of the event it is assumed that the runoff contribution becomes negligible after the rain has stopped for a period equal to the basin time of concentration the post event base flow is the flow measured at this time it is assumed that the base flow varies linearly between these values during the flood event the time of concentration is estimated to be 18 h for the gard anduze basin and 24 h for the ardèche vogüe basin changing the concentration times by a few hours don t significantly affect the obtained results the net hyetograph r e 0 is thus deduced from the time series of hourly effective rainfall maps for the identification of the reference e giuh it is assumed that the a priori effective rainfall is highly accurate the coefficient of variation of each net hyetograph component is then given by the value α r 0 10 in addition t r 2 h controls the temporal structure of the error on the a priori net hyetograph the application conditions selected to derive the reference e giuhs are collated in table 2 4 4 results and discussion the accuracy of the identified e giuh can only be evaluated indirectly the classical nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion denoted nse is used for such a purpose 22 nse x 1 i 1 i n x refi x tesi 2 i 1 i n x refi x 2 with x refi reference vector of n components of mean x tes x i vector to be tested the e giuhs identified according to the reference application conditions are displayed in fig 4 these results have been assessed by calculating four criteria 1 nse q between observed hydrographs and hydrographs modeled using a priori e giuh and an a priori net hyetograph 2 nse q between observed hydrographs and hydrographs modeled using the identification results 3 nse rn between the a priori net hyetograph and the identified net hyetograph and 4 nse giuh between the a priori e giuh and the identified e giuh these criteria are calculated for each flood event their average value is computed for the two basins so as to provide an overview of the results obtained these criteria have been compiled in table 3 leading to the following comments the identified e giuhs allow improving the simulation of observed hydrographs this improvement seems as more pronounced as the identified values of u e d e differ from the a priori values the average increase in nse q is significant from 0 72 to 0 83 for gard anduze and from 0 65 to 0 84 for ardèche vogüe this increase primarily results from an evolution in e giuhs indeed a comparison of the net hyetographs indicates that the a priori ones slightly differ from the identified ones the average value of nse rn equals 0 97 for gard anduze and 0 96 for ardèche vogüe in all cases the criterion is above 0 92 a comparison of the a priori and identified e giuhs confirms quite well that based on the reference conditions the identification method acts primarily on e giuhs indeed the average values of nse giuh 0 74 for gard anduze and 0 65 for ardèche vogüe underscore that a priori e giuhs differ considerably from identified ones beyond these criteria it is very interesting to note the wide diversity and wide variability of the e giuhs of each basin for instance the time to peak for gard anduze flood events left graph ranges from one hour to seven hours while the time to peak for ardèche vogüe flood events ranges from 5 to 10 h these results confirm not only the influence of rainfall variability on the e giuh but also the fact that the e giuh could be well adapted to serve as a signature characteristic of a flood event the a priori values of the e giuh parameters u e 0 d e 0 have been chosen regardless of the event features what conclusions can be drawn from their resulting values for the sake of simplicity the hydrological features of a flood event are summarized by its specific flow peak q max considered as an indicator of the event magnitude the use of a specific flow peak allows regrouping the events of both catchments on the same graph in order to study a possible relationship between this indicator and the e giuh parameters the scattergrams u e q max and d e q max with q max as the specific flow peak are displayed in fig 5 it can be observed that a significant correlation exists between the two e giuh parameters and the specific flow peak let s note that the coefficient of determination r 2 has been calculated without accounting for the exceptional flow event that occurred on sept 20 21 2002 the limited size of the dataset and the fairly low value of r 2 do not offer the basis for a more detailed analysis this result however could suggest that the mean flow velocity u e increases with the magnitude of the flood event which appears to be logical and consistent with previous results it is interesting to note that taking the rainfall width function into consideration does not alter this mean trend even though it could be surmised that flood events displaying a strong rainfall variability also exhibit a stronger variability in flow velocity within the hydrological network results regarding the coefficient of dispersion d e are not simple to analyze the model equations relate d e and u e which would contribute to the link between q max and d e similarly the average values of d e and u e table 2 indicate a strong increase in d e values with respect to the a priori values thereby likely to generate an accurate restitution of the observed hydrographs lastly the sensitivity study next section suggests that this identification procedure is not highly sensitive to d e moreover it is not yet possible to draw a clear conclusion and studying a larger sample of events would allow progressing in this effort 4 5 sensitivity study of the e giuh identification this sensitivity study addresses the influence of the application conditions on the identified e giuhs this section provides the main results and conclusions of the sensitivity study a detailed presentation can be found in the supporting information note that special attention has been paid to the influence of the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall 4 5 1 sensitivity to u e d e variations this test examines the influence of u e d e variations on the simulated e giuhs and hydrographs the e giuhs and hydrographs obtained by varying u e d e values with respect to the reference solution are compared to the e giuhs and hydrographs of this reference solution by calculating the nse values fig 5 illustrates the results of this test which yields two key indications i the influence of d e is much weaker than that of u e and ii the simulated hydrographs are much less influenced by u e d e variations than the simulated e giuhs this latter result proves to be important given that the identification procedure is mostly based on observed hydrographs this sensitivity study confirms that a reliable estimation of u e d e from hydrographs is far from being straightforward 4 5 2 sensitivity of the e giuh to inverse algorithm application conditions this part of the sensitivity study comprises i the confidence assigned to flow data coefficient of variation α q ii the confidence assigned to the giuh theoretical model coefficients of variation α e and α v iii the influence of the a priori value of d e 0 iv the influence of the a priori value of u e 0 and lastly v the confidence assigned to the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall coefficient of variation α r it is performed by running the e giuh identification in varying one of these factors with respect to the reference conditions the results obtained are summarized in table 4 and then detailed in the appendix it is interesting to emphasize the influence of an increase of α r which controls the error variance on the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall it is confirmed that an increase of α r results in an improvement of the restitution of the observed hydrograph the overall improvement is obtained by changes in the resulting effective rainfall hyetograph thus confirming the capability of this method to identify both the e giuh and the hyetograh of effective rainfall rn this result might extend the application domain of the proposed method but this subject is out the scope of the present work which focuses on the identification of e giuhs 4 5 3 influence of the a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall the previous results have been obtained by considering that the widely used scs production function accurately represents basin operations the question raised then is whether the choice of an a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall affects the identified e giuhs this test is conducted by running the method with an a priori hyetograph of effective rainfall that s very different from the scs one so as to introduce a sharp contrast with the reference application conditions the selected production function denoted cr pi assumes initial losses of 20 mm in each mesh of the basin along with a constant runoff coefficient for each flood event this coefficient is estimated such that the effective rainfall volume is equal to the runoff volume the choice of the a priori net hyetograph is the only modification adopted with respect to the reference application conditions the two a priori net hyetographs are assumed to be rather inaccurate with an error covariance α r 0 25 it then becomes possible to compare the e giuhs identified based on the scs and cr pi production function respectively the a priori e giuhs turn out to be similar for both cases the comparison results are detailed in the supporting information section and illustrated in fig 6 which displays the 12 e giuhs obtained from the scs continuous line and the cr pi dashed line net hyetographs respectively the reference e giuh thin continuous line has been added to this comparison the sensitivity test shows that for 9 of the 12 flood events the identified e giuh is very weakly affected by the change in a priori net hyetograph nse giuh 0 94 only moderately affected for 2 of them n s e giuh 0 88 and significantly affected for 1 other event a1 nse giuh 0 80 more specifically fig 7 indicates that the differences between the 12 e giuhs remain quite pronounced and much larger than the fluctuations of each e giuh in addition it is confirmed that the identification method serves to improve the net hyetograph with the identified ones lying much closer than the a priori ones 5 summary and conclusion the giuh has become a classical representation of the rapid response of a basin when adapted to rainfall runoff modeling if the giuh depends on the morphological features of a basin then it is also influenced by the characteristics of rainfall patterns as well as by the variability of flow path velocities we have therefore considered that an event specific giuh or e giuh exists that actually characterizes the catchment response under the specific conditions of each flood event the method proposed herein to identify this e giuh relies on the width function based giuh rigon et al 2016 as adapted to take into account the spatial variability of rainfall through replacing the width function by the rainfall width function emmanuel et al 2015 woods and sivapalan 1999 the e giuh is identified from data combining time series of rain fields and observed hydrographs this e giuh identification has been tested on a dataset composed of 12 flood events that occurred on catchments within the ohmcv observatory territory despite being of limited range this evaluation has provided interesting insights namely the concept of e giuh appears to be relevant and moreover the proposed identification method seems easily applicable and flexible for users who are now able to define the adapted application conditions the e giuhs associated with the various flood events of a catchment display very distinct characteristics thus confirming that e giuh shape depends on the giuh model parameters as well as on the rainfall width function both of which are specific to the flood events for both basins the two e giuh parameters u e d e lie within the range 0 9 m s 1 8 m s for u e and 600 m2 s 5 200 m2 s for d e these two parameters appear to be correlated with the event peak flow which serves as an indicator of flow magnitude even though this tenuous link needs to be confirmed and warrants further investigation the identification procedure is more sensitive to parameter u e than to parameter d e mainly because the direct model is not highly sensitive to this latter parameter the results obtained appear to be fairly robust and in most cases remain relatively independent of the a priori rainfall hyetograph this result indicates that representative e giuhs could be derived by defining the a priori effective rainfall from a widely used production function and then calibrating the two e giuh parameters this work would need to be pursued in several directions in order to improve our knowledge and develop applications relying on the e giuh concept including a more robust assessment of the proposed method seems to be a priority this could be achieved by application to a large numbers of catchments located in various climatic zones the e giuh which is mostly based on observed data could be considered as a signature characterizing flood events the flood events that affect a basin stem from diverse conditions moisture status of the basin spatial and temporal characteristics of the rain event the e giuh associated with a given basin summarizes the basin response under such conditions an analysis of the population of e giuhs would pave the way to a hydro climatological catchment response to rainfall forcing the relatively small number of basins and flood events described here does not allow a complete assessment of the limitations of the method under all circumstances for instance the method might be less suitable if the rainfall influence results from moving rainfall fields interacting with the basin volpi et al 2013 in addition the method might be less efficient when the statistical framework is outside of its application domain e g when the distribution of error is not gaussian or at least unimodal or when the a priori conditions are not relevant the e giuh represents a signature of the basin response that could prove useful for various applications first it can be used to diagnose basin responses to rainfall forcing the e giuh summarizes the basin response that stems from diverse physiographic climatological and meteorological conditions such as moisture status of the basin and the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall forcing the e giuh signature can be used to compare and classify basin responses for different forcing rain events or to analyse the influence of land use and change e g recovery after wildfire among other factors analysing populations of e giuhs that represent various conditions opens the way to hydro climatological studies of catchment responses finally it could contribute to improving lumped rainfall runoff modelling through transfer function adapted to

nnx16al23g appendix a sensitivity study this sensitivity analysis has focused on the influence of the application conditions on the identified e giuhs more specifically it has concerned the confidence assigned to flow data coefficient of variation α q the confidence assigned to the giuh theoretical model coefficients of variation α e and α v the influence of the a priori value of d e 0 the influence of the a priori value of u e 0 and lastly the influence of this error on the a priori net hyetograph this study has been performed by running the e giuh identification method while varying one of these factors with respect to the reference conditions the influence was then assessed by calculating i the mean nash efficiency criterion between the observed and resulting hydrographs nse q ii the mean nash efficiency criterion between the resulting e giuhs and the reference e giuh nse giuh and iii the mean absolute deviation between the series of reference values of u e and d e respectively the results of this sensitivity analysis are displayed in fig a1 and lead to the following conclusions confidence assigned to flow data fig a1 a the increase in the coefficient of variation α q which reflects a loss of confidence in the measured flow data clearly yields a reduced quality of the resulting hydrographs blue line the value of nse giuh remains above 0 94 which denotes a moderate influence on the identified e giuh with respect to the reference one except for α q 0 3 where the e giuh change is more pronounced nse giuh 0 89 confidence assigned to the giuh model fig a1 b a very strong confidence in giuh theory α e α v 0 02 results in a lower quality of the obtained hydrographs this quality improves and stabilizes quickly at nse q 0 85 0 86 as α e and α v increase the value of nse giuh is higher than 0 95 when α e a n d α e 0 05 which denotes a weak influence on the identified e giuh with respect to the reference one the more noteworthy effect pertains to the mean identified value of d e which rises from 1560 m 2 s 1 to 3700 m 2 s 1 at which point the constraints on giuh theory are relaxed without the quality criteria being significantly modified this finding confirms that the identification of d e is far from being straightforward based on the available observations influence of the a priori value of d e 0 fig a1 c the a priori value of d e 0 has been increased from 0 35 d g 0 to d g 0 the influence of this value appears to be very weak while the values of nse q and nse giuh remain nearly constant at respectively 0 83 0 84 and 0 99 the mean identified value of d e increases from 2110 m 2 s 1 to 2800 m 2 s 1 with respect to d e 0 this influence is less marked than that for α e and α v influence of the a priori value of u e 0 fig a1 d this influence is tested by defining the a priori value u e 0 u e δ u with u e being the solution obtained according to the reference application conditions and δ u 0 5 0 25 0 0 0 25 0 5 m s note that a modification of u e 0 also de facto affects d e 0 the results obtained indicate that i a strong underestimation of u e δ u 0 5 m s cannot be corrected by the identification procedure n s e q 0 66 n s e giuh 0 7 a n d mad u 0 2 m s ii the situation is more satisfactory for a moderate underestimation or overestimation δ u 0 25 m s for which the final giuhs do not differ substantially from the reference solutions n s e giuh 0 92 a n d 0 93 and mad u 0 11 a n d 0 09 m s respectively and iii an initial overestimation of velocity by the a priori value appears to be less detrimental than an underestimation influence of this error covariance on the a priori net hyetograph the e giuh identification has been performed by varying the value of α r from α r 0 03 excellent confidence in the a priori net hyetograph to α r 0 0 30 weak confidence these results are illustrated in fig a2 in its display of the evolution in nse q between the observed hydrographs and the hydrographs simulated using the final set of parameters in offering the following insights the increase of α r results in an increase of nse q which rises from nse q 0 83 for α r 0 03 to nse q 0 88 for α r 0 24 meaning that the set of parameters characterizing basin operations r n e g i u h is globally better determined this improvement is not correlated with significant changes in the identified e giuhs which do not differ significantly from the e giuh reference application conditions indeed the value of nse giuh remains above 0 97 for α r 0 17 and α r 0 24 this improvement is mainly derived from changes in the resulting net hyetographs in comparison with the a priori net hyetographs as confirmed by the value of nse rn calculated between the a priori and identified net hyetographs which decreases from 0 99 to 0 55 as α r increases from 0 05 to 0 3 this sensitivity analysis has confirmed that relaxing the constraint on the a priori net hyetograph yields an overall more efficient functioning of the identification algorithm which leads to a coupled identification of the r n e g i u h couple without modifying the resulting e giuh by considering the a priori net hyetograph to be accurate appendix b

fine sediments deposited in the reservoir was examined soil samples were collected from three types of lithological zones within the catchment namely the granite 205 samples limestone 120 samples and shale 86 samples zones and the elemental composition and grain size of these samples was determined six sediment cores cores 1 6 were collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir to determine the elemental composition grain size chronologies and the source of fine sediments derived from the three types of lithological zones two further cores cores 7 and 8 were collected from the reservoir s upstream floodplain and the grain size distributions and chronologies of these deposits were also determined overall the sources of fine sediment identified in cores 1 6 reflected the changing trends in sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years which was linked to the differing sediment yields from the contrasting lithological zones the granite zone occupies half of the catchment has thicker soils is relatively susceptible to soil erosion and has been subjected to greater disturbance by human activity than the limestone and shale zones but contributed only 25 of the fine sediment in cores 1 6 in contrast the limestone and shale zones occupy 23 and 15 respectively of the catchment but contributed 42 and 33 of the fine sediment in cores 1 6 this result is related to grain size sorting during downstream sediment transportation and deposition in the reservoir system as demonstrated by a comparison of the grain size distributions of the soil samples from the three types of lithological zones cores 7 and 8 and cores 1 6 these findings suggest the sediment source has been strongly influenced by grain size sorting this study provides new insights into the source of sediments deposited in a reservoir system from contrasting lithological zones at the scale of a medium sized catchment over multi decadal timescales keywords sediment source reservoir fine sediment deposits medium sized catchment contrasting lithologies 1 introduction sediment source is defined as the relative contribution of sediment derived from different source areas and is generally determined at spatial scales ranging from a single hillslope to a large 10 000 km2 catchment walling 2005 collins et al 2020 quantifying sediment sources for catchments of various sizes is essential to our understanding of the pattern of sediment yield from differing physical and human environments this will improve our knowledge of soil erosion and sediment delivery processes integrate studies of sediment transportation and deposition at the catchment scale and apply targeted countermeasures to tackle soil erosion within the catchment framework walling 2013 collins et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 nosrati et al 2021 composite fingerprinting techniques are often used to identify the sources of fine sediments including suspended sediments and channel overbank or floodplain deposits in fluvial systems because of their low cost and high efficiency when compared with traditional approaches that involve field monitoring and surveys owens et al 2016 tiecher et al 2019 shi et al 2021 many sediment properties can be used as fingerprints to identify potential sediment source areas commonly used properties include physical characteristics e g grain size color geochemical properties e g metallic elements rare earth elements mineralogy radionuclides e g 7be 137cs 210pbex stable isotopes e g δ 13c δ 15n δ 18o and biomarkers e g n alkanes pollen enzymes martínez carreras et al 2010 collins et al 2012 2017 2019 amorim et al 2021 to quantify the sediment source groups of potential source areas within a catchment need to be categorized in advance these groups are generally defined as source types e g surface soil from various land uses and subsoil from channel banks or spatial sources e g geological zones or sub catchments collins et al 2017 land use based categorization allows the contribution made by sediment derived from areas with different land use types to be quantified provides useful information for management strategies targeted at specific land uses at the catchment scale and improves our understanding of the impacts of human activity on sediment yield therefore many previous studies have applied a land use based classification to analyze sediment sources e g collins et al 2012 zhang and liu 2016 tiecher et al 2017 malhotra et al 2019 hirave et al 2021 however it seems fewer studies have used a classification system based on the geological properties of the source areas collins and walling 2007 wilkinson et al 2013 pulley and collins 2019 this is perhaps because 1 classification by geology often provides indirect information with respect to the management of a catchment subjected to various human activities 2 many catchments are underlain by complicated and variable geology so it can be difficult to classify sediment sources based on geology and 3 some catchments are underlain by homogenous geology due to their small size previous research has been carried out mostly in small catchments lamba et al 2015 chen et al 2016 2019 huang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 geology is a fundamental environmental factor and commonly regulates the spatial patterns of land use and human activity zhang et al 2017 2018 in china approximately 1 3 of the land area is a karst landscape underlain by carbonate rocks and the remainder is underlain largely by igneous or clastic rocks the karst region is generally characterized by shallow surface soils rugged terrain a complex epikarst with a high infiltration capacity and double space structure of surface and underground carbonate rocks are highly soluble and do not produce much soil peng and wang 2012 ford and williams 2013 jiang et al 2014 consequently the supply of sediments from karst regions tends to be relatively limited in contrast the rate of soil formation in non karst regions is much greater than that in karst regions for example in southwest china the formation rate of purple soil is up to 100 times greater than that in the karst regions jiang et al 2014 moreover the capacity of soil and water conservation in karst regions is lower than that in non karst regions because of the complex hydrology associated with the epikarst in the karst regions peng et al 2019 li et al 2020 therefore sedimentary materials are generally more abundant in the non karst than the karst regions because of this the non karst regions can support a larger population have better living conditions and are consequently subject to more intense human activity mostly agriculture than karst regions considering these essential contrasts the relative contribution of sediment derived from different lithological regions should be addressed in catchments underlain by multiple lithologies because this would improve our understanding of the characteristic pattern of sediment yields from contrasting lithological regions within a catchment and facilitate the implementation of a targeted conservation strategy since the 1950s many dams have been constructed in various sized catchments across china and globally and 10 000 dams are currently operational in china wang 2016 these dams inevitably influence the downstream transport of sediment because the sediment can be intercepted and deposited behind the dam consequently deposition patterns differ from those seen in natural fluvial systems maselli et al 2018 nones et al 2019 hindered by a dam the speed of streamflow through the river channel decreases considerably thus reducing the distance over which grain size sorting occurs the reduction in the speed of flow results in most of the sediment being deposited during transportation before reaching the dam verstraeten and poesen 2000 consequently the pattern of grain size sorting differs to that in river systems with no dam the sediment deposited in the reservoir backwater area should be much finer than that deposited upstream this poses a challenge for those attempting to determine the source of sediment deposits laceby et al 2017 it is necessary to apportion the source of fine sediment deposits in a reservoir and consider if grain size sorting influenced the sediment source when investigating the pattern of sediment deposition in a reservoir system moreover sediment deposits record the historical change in sediment yields from a catchment since dam completion and useful information can be obtained regarding temporal pattern of sediment sources influenced by environmental change few previous studies have attempted to apportion the sources of fine sediments deposited in a reservoir let alone assessed the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits or examined patterns of sediment supply over periods of decades therefore using a composite fingerprinting technique the objectives of this study are to 1 understand the sources of fine sediment deposits from contrasting lithological zones in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years and 2 estimate the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits in the reservoir this will help to improve our knowledge of the sediment source in dam reservoir systems at the scale of a medium sized catchment 2 methodology 2 1 study catchment we selected the xujiaya reservoir and its catchment i e the xujiaya catchment located in the rocky mountainous region of northern china fig 1 as the target area for this study the dam was constructed in 1959 the reservoir has a capacity of 292 9 106 m3 and the catchment covers an area of 580 km2 representing a medium sized catchment zhang et al 2019 three types of lithologies underlie the catchment i e granite 50 limestone 23 and purple carbonate rich shale interbedded with argillaceous limestone hereafter referred to as shale 15 cambisols and luvisols are the two main soil types with the former developing from the granite and the latter from the limestone and shale the land use cover across the catchment comprises approximately 77 cropland 15 grain and fruit intercropping and 8 forest zhang et al 2019 two tributaries the wenhe and jiangzhuanghe converge to form the main channel entering the reservoir 2 2 sampling we completed the sampling work in 2017 including the collection of soil from the source areas and sediment cores from the reservoir the potential source areas of the reservoir deposits were classified as belonging to one of the three types of contrasting lithological zones i e granite limestone or shale within the xujiaya catchment to improve the representativeness of the soil samples both topsoil and subsoil were collected from each type of lithological zone the individual topsoil samples comprised a composite of 10 small surface scrapes 0 5 cm deep collected from a plot of around 20 20 m the subsoil samples involved the collection of 5 10 small subsurface scrapes from the full vertical extent of eroding earth bank profiles these soil samples each of which was 500 g were collected using an enameled stainless steel trowel in total 205 soil samples 125 topsoil and 80 subsoil samples were collected from the granite source area 120 samples 101 topsoil and 19 subsoil samples from the limestone source area and 86 samples 64 topsoil and 22 subsoil samples from the shale source area eight sediment cores were extracted from the reservoir cores 1 6 were taken from the perennial backwater area using a floating drilling platform equipped with an automatic corer xy 1 internal diameter 7 cm zhang et al 2019 these samples were used for source determination the material derived from the different source lithologies is fully mixed in this backwater area meaning that these sediments are representative of the fine sediments deposited in the reservoir core 1 was recovered close to the dam core 2 from near the center of the main channel cores 3 and 4 from near the confluence of the two tributaries respectively and cores 5 and 6 from the middle of downstream broad water areas in the two tributaries respectively fig 1 this distribution means the six cores largely cover the area of fine sediment deposition across reservoir backwater area cores 1 6 extended to depths of 210 207 202 242 265 and 271 cm respectively cores 7 and 8 were taken from the exposed floodplain in the upstream section using a manual corer ams internal diameter 5 cm the grain size distributions of these sediments were compared with those obtained from the source area soil samples and cores 1 6 which facilitated our discussion of the influence of grain size sorting on the source of the fine sediments deposited in the reservoir cores 7 and 8 extended to depths of 305 and 300 cm respectively at which point the rocky bottom was encountered the cores were subsampled every 5 cm 2 3 sample preparation and analysis all of the soil and core samples were freeze dried manually disaggregated passed through a 2 mm sieve and weighed prior to grain size analysis we also determined the 137cs and 210pbex profiles of the sediment cores a representative aliquot 10 g was extracted from each subsample of cores 1 6 and all of the source area soil samples and sieved using a 0 15 mm mesh prior to analyzing the elemental concentrations we analyzed 20 elements al ba ce co fe k la li mg mn nb tm v y dy eu mo nd sr and ti in the soil samples and core 1 6 subsamples to use as geochemical fingerprints to apportion the sediment sources as nearly all 99 of the sediment samples from cores 1 6 passed through the 0 15 mm mesh we defined these deposits as being fine sediments 0 15 mm wentworth 1922 we established the core chronologies use a 210pbex based model incorporating the 137cs time markers i e a composite constant rate of supply model assuming a constant rate of 210pbex supply to the sediment appleby 2001 2008 as follows 1 t 1 λ ln i d a d b e λ t a i d a d b e λ t a e λ t b i d a d where t yr is the age of the sediment at depth d cm λ is the 210pbex radioactive decay constant 0 031 yr 1 t a and t b

bq m 2 is the 210pbex inventory in the depth range between d a and d in the core the grain size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 3000 laser particle size analyzer 137cs and 210pbex activities were determined using a high resolution lowbackground low energy p type coaxial germanium detector gmx40p4 ortec elemental contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes for additional details of the xujiaya reservoir and its catchment the extraction of cores 1 6 the grain size analysis 137cs and 210pbex profiles and the chronologies of the six cores see zhang et al 2019 2 4 sediment source apportionment the sediments derived from the three types of source areas i e granite limestone and shale of the xujiaya catchment were identified in the sample cores using the statistical procedure proposed by collins et al 1997a 2017 firstly a range test was performed to ensure the element concentrations of the sediments fall between the range of the maximum and minimum concentrations of the sources i e to assess whether the elements are conservative or non conservative martínez carreras et al 2010 shi et al 2021 secondly the kruskal wallis h test was used to assess the effectiveness of using individual elements that passed the range test to distinguish source area soil samples from the three types of lithological zones next multivariate discriminant function analysis dfa was applied to identify the optimum composite of elements i e fingerprinting properties that passed the kruskal wallis h test walling 2013 we used a numerical mixing model to apportion the relative contribution of each lithological zone to each subsample in cores 1 6 walling 2005 the results represent the sources of the fine sediment deposits in the reservoir derived from the three types of lithological zones within the catchment over the past 60 years this model can be expressed as 2 c ti s 1 m p s c si s 1 m p s 10 p s 1 where cti is the concentration of the i th fingerprinting property in the core samples ppm ps is the percentage contribution of sediment from the s th type of lithological zone csi is the median concentration of the i th fingerprinting property in the source area samples from the s th type of lithological zone ppm and m is the total number of types of classified source area lithological zones i e m 3 the model minimizes the sum of the squares of the weighted relative errors res for the n fingerprinting properties as follows 3 res i 1 n c ti s 1 m p s c si c ti 2 moreover to test the uncertainty associated with the modeled results we used goodness of fit gof walling 2005 collins et al 2010 2017 the results were deemed acceptable if the gof exceeded 80 motha et al 2003 in addition to improve our understanding of the sediment contributions of the three types of lithological zones we determined the deposition rate dr of sediment in the cores derived from each type of source zone 4 d r s t 2 t 1 d 1 d 2 γ d 1 d 2 p s d 1 d 2 t 2 t 1 where d 1 and d 2 are two depth locations in the core cm t 1 and t 2 are the sediment ages at depths d 1 and d 2 respectively yr γ d 1 d 2 is the average bulk density of dry sediment in the depth range between d 1 and d 2 in the core g cm 3 zhang et al 2019 p s d 2 d 1 is the contribution of sediment from the s th type of lithological zone in the depth range between d 1 and d 2 in the core and d r s t 2 t 1 is the mean annual rate of sediment deposition derived from the s th type of lithological zone during the period between t 2 and t 1 in the core g cm 2 yr 1 p s d 2 d 1 was assessed from the weighted mean percentage for subsamples between depths d 1 and d 2 in the core 3 results 3 1 sediment source discrimination table 1 presents the concentration ranges of the 20 elements in the soil samples from the three types of lithological zones and the sediment samples from cores 1 6 as well as their median values considering the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment deposition across the reservoir we applied the range test the kruskal wallis h test table 2 and then dfa to the soil samples with regard to each of the six cores manjoro et al 2017 table 3 presents the optimal composite of the fingerprinting properties the discriminatory power and the mean gof for each core the discrimination results obtained using each element composite are given in fig 2 fig 2a presents the results for source samples grouped by the three types of lithological zones and fig 2b presents the results for source samples grouped by topsoil and subsoil from the three types of lithological zones the results imply that these element composites can be used to reliably discriminate among the three groups of samples collected from the granite limestone and shale zones but are unable to discriminate the two groups of topsoil and subsoil samples collected from each type of lithological zone 3 2 source of fine sediment deposits determined from cores 1 6 fig 3 shows the relative contributions of the granite limestone and shale zones of the catchment to the fine sediment reservoir deposits assessed using cores 1 6 the chronologies determined using the 137cs and 210pbex profiles of the six cores have been reported previously zhang et al 2019 and are labelled as the right axis of each core profile in fig 3 table 4 presents the mean percentage of the contributions from each type of lithological zone in each core since dam construction in 1959 overall the highest contributions from the granite limestone and shale zones occur in cores 1 2 and 6 respectively whereas the lowest values occur in cores 2 1 and 2 respectively the mean contributions from the granite limestone and shale zones to the six cores are 25 42 and 33 respectively in cores 1 2 5 and 6 the contribution from the granite zone decreases with depth and the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones increases whereas cores 3 and 4 show little change with depth the contribution from the limestone zone in cores 3 and 4 shows little change with depth the contribution in core 2 firstly increases then decreases and the contribution in the other cores generally increases the contribution from the shale zone in cores 1 3 and 4 is fairly consistent with depth in cores 2 and 6 appears to increase and in core 5 varies considerably the 137cs and 210pbex chronologies obtained from the cores indicate that these changing inputs of sediment from the three type of lithological zones cover the past 60 years in addition across the perennial reservoir backwater area the contributions from the three types of lithological zones in the six cores show no apparent change in the downstream direction using eq 4 we calculated the mean drs derived from each type of lithological zone in cores 1 6 for seven stages over the past 60 years since dam construction i e 1959 1963 1964 1972 1973 1980 1981 1989 1990 1997 1998 2007 and 2008 2016 zhang et al 2019 these data reflect the drs of the three types of lithological zones in the reservoir perennial backwater area fig 4 the maximum drs of the three types of zones occur in the first stage 1959 1963 and the lowest values in the second stage 1964 1972 thereafter increasing in the following two stages after 1989 the drs of the shale and limestone zones decrease while the drs of granite zone first increase and then slightly decrease in comparison with the drs of other source areas the drs of the limestone zone are highest before 2008 the drs of the granite zone are the lowest among the zones for the period before 1998 then increase to lie behind only the limestone zone during 1998 2007 and finally are highest among the zones in 2008 2016 3 3 grain size analysis of the soil samples and floodplain cores table 5 shows the percentage ranges of clay 0 005 mm silt 0 005 0 050 mm and sand 0 050 2 000 mm in the source area soil samples collected from the three types of lithological zones and also from cores 7 and 8 the grain size profiles of cores 1 6 were presented in our previous paper zhang et al 2019 although a summary of the percentages of clay silt and sand in these six cores is presented in table 5 the soil samples from the granite zone are rich in sand and poor in clay whereas the soil samples from the limestone and shale zones are poor in sand and rich in clay furthermore the samples from the limestone zone have a higher percentage of clay and a lower percentage of sand than samples from the shale zone this result suggests that soils from the granite zone are much coarser than those from the limestone and shale zones and that soils of the limestone zone are finer than those of the shale zone in the granite zone the topsoil samples were richer in silt but lower in sand than the subsoil samples suggesting that the topsoil is finer than the subsoil however in the limestone and shale zones the grain size distribution of the topsoil samples was similar to that of the subsoil samples cores 7 and 8 from the reservoir floodplain had a much lower proportion of clay but were richer in sand than cores 1 6 from the reservoir perennial backwater area and soil samples from the limestone and shale zones moreover cores 7 and 8 had a higher proportion of sand than the soil samples from the granite zone fig 5 shows the grain size fractions as well as the 137cs and 210pbex profiles from cores 7 and 8 the 137cs peaks at depths of 276 and 268 cm in cores 7 and 8 respectively can be recognized as the peaks associated with the intensive 137cs fallout in 1963 zapata 2002 the 137cs and 210pbex activities in cores 7 and 8 are generally lower than seen in cores 1 6 the bases of cores 7 and 8 can be interpreted as the sediment deposited just after dam construction in 1959 because 1 they are below the depth of the 137cs peaks from 1963 and 2 the cores cannot be extended further downwards due to the rocky bottom and below these depths the original river bed can be recognized our conversations with older inhabitants of the area confirmed that the current floodplain is located in the original river bed which was covered by gravel deposits before construction of the dam the chronologies reconstructed from the two cores are shown alongside the grain size profiles in fig 5 the grain size profile shows little variation in core 7 however in core 8 the sand proportion generally decreases with depth while the clay and silt proportions show the opposite pattern which implies that the sediments deposited at this site have become increasingly coarse over the past 60 years fig 6 shows the mean proportions of coarse 0 15 mm and fine 0 15 mm grains in the source area soil samples from each type of lithological zone and also from cores 7 and 8 on average the proportion of coarse grains in cores 7 and 8 is slightly higher than in the soil samples from the granite zone but much higher than in the limestone and shale zones cores 1 6 contain almost no coarse grains the grain sizes in cores 7 and 8 are coarser than those in the soil samples from the granite zone and much coarser than those in cores 1 6 and soil samples from the limestone and shale zones table 5 figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 sediment source from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years the sediment sources identified in cores 1 6 largely reflect the changing trend in the sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years fig 3 the trends reflect the different patterns of sediment yield from the contrasting lithological zones and their characteristic soil types geology and human land interactions overall in cores 1 2 5 and 6 the contribution from the granite zone has increased whereas the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones has decreased over the past 60 years this trend seems more significant since the 1990s and this can be interpreted as follows firstly the cambisols that developed from the weathering of the granite are generally thick sandy loose and susceptible to disturbance and erosion in contrast the luvisols that developed from the limestone and shale are shallow fine sticky and resistant to erosion zhang 1986 this implies that the granite zone would be a stable source of relatively large amounts of sediment whereas the supply of sediment from the limestone and shale zones would be more variable and relatively limited over the past 60 years this region was subjected to intense deforestation at the end of the 1950s expanding cultivation since the 1970s and mechanized farming since the 1990s these human activities greatly stimulated soil erosion and sediment yield zhang et al 2019 as a result of soil erosion and sediment yield the erodible soil in the limestone and shale zones would have been rapidly depleted whereas relatively abundant material would have been available from the granite zone secondly more of underlying rock would be exposed by soil erosion from the limestone zone this would in turn further reduce the area of erodible soil in the limestone zone while the exposed rock would act as a barrier and protect the remnant soils however these limitations on the sediment yield associated with the limestone zone would not generally occur in the granite zone under this scenario sediment yields from the limestone zone would be severely limited even if human disturbance intensified in fact the population in the limestone zone is less than that in the granite zone moreover the intensification of human activity in the karst region is limited by the shallow surface soil and epikarst environment for example mechanized farming has been widely adopted in the granite zone since the end of 1990s but not in limestone zone to some degree the conditions in the shale zone are similar to those in the limestone zone because the shale is rich in carbonates and interbedded with argillaceous limestone consequently the discrimination of soil samples from the limestone and shale zones is not as sharp as the discrimination of samples from the granite zone compared with those from the limestone and shale zones fig 2a in summary the soil in the granite zone is thick and susceptible to erosion and the sediment yield increases substantially following human disturbance in contrast the soils in the limestone and shale zones are thinner and less susceptible to erosion and the sediment supplies are increasingly limited by the sediment yields therefore the sediment contribution from the granite zone seen in cores 1 2 5 and 6 has increased over the past 60 years whereas the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones has decreased this explanation is supported by the temporal pattern of drs derived from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years fig 4 the drs of the limestone source area are highest before 2008 indicating the relative abundance of sediment in the limestone zone over this period the decreasing drs of the limestone and shale zones since 1990 imply an increasingly limited sediment source in these zones and the relatively high drs of the granite zone since 1990 indicate an abundant sediment supply from this zone in particular the dr of the granite zone exceeds that of the limestone zone during 2008 2016 indicating the sediment supply was limited in the limestone zone but not in the granite zone the temporal trend in drs reflects changing sediment yields from the catchment over the past 60 years as discussed by zhang et al 2019 previous studies have fingerprinted the historical source of sediment derived from different lithological zones and deposited in a fluvial system within a catchment for example hughes et al 2009 used geochemical properties and a 137cs 210pbex and optical dating chronology to assess the source of floodplain sediments derived from granite classic metasediment and basalt source areas and deposited in a dry tropical catchment in central queensland australia over the past 250 years the authors concluded that temporal changes in sediment source reflected changes in land use waal et al 2015 used the magnetic signature of sediment and a 137cs and 210pbex chronology to quantify the historical source of sediment derived from igneous and sedimentary zones and deposited in flood benches in the upper thina catchment south africa the authors reported the sediment was derived mainly from the sedimentary zone over the past century these previous studies suggest sediments deposited in fluvial systems can be used to reconstruct the history of change in the sediment source in the case of a reservoir system most of the sediment is deposited behind the dam and detailed information on the historical sediment yield and sediment source can be obtained from the deposited sequence zhang et al 2017 in comparison with previous studies our analysis of the historical source of fine sediment deposited in a reservoir highlights the different patterns of sediment yield from areas of contrasting lithological within the catchment in addition classification of the source groups by lithology has advantages in reconstructing temporal trends in the sediment source firstly soils developed from different types of parent rock generally have distinct properties e g elemental geochemistry and magnetism that allow the soils of different parent rock to be identified secondly these properties are usually stable through time and can be used to trace the sediments derived from different lithological zones within a catchment at different time stages in contrast it might be challenging to trace the source of historical sediments derived from different source groups categorized by land use as opposed to lithology because the fingerprinting properties of soils related to a given land use type might vary over time with changes in land management and fertilizer application consequently the present day properties of soils for a given land use type might differ from the properties in the past for this reason the classification of source groups by land use has generally been employed to quantify only contemporary sources of fluvial suspended sediment or surface sediment deposits collins et al 1997a 2012 walling 2005 collins and walling 2007 rather than historical sources tracing the historical sediment source throughout a depth profile of a sediment deposit usually requires the classification of source groups by lithology collins et al 1997b owens et al 1999 therefore we are confident in the reliability of our assessment of the sources of fine sediment reservoir deposits from three types of lithological zones in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years 4 2 influence of grain size sorting on the sediment source as mentioned above the granite limestone and shale zones underlie approximately 50 23 and 15 of the catchment respectively the granite zone generally has thicker soils that are more susceptible to erosion than those in the limestone and shale zones and the granite zone is subjected to more intense human disturbance than the limestone and shale zones this suggests that the granite zone should contribute more than 50 of the reservoir sediments and the limestone and shale zones should contribute no more than 23 and 15 respectively however the mean contributions of the granite limestone and shale zones found in cores 1 6 were 25 42 and 33 respectively among the three types of source areas the drs of limestone zone were highest before 2008 and the drs of the granite zone were lowest before 1998 fig 4 we can define the ratio between the percentage of the mean contribution from each type of lithological zone determined from the six cores and the percentage of the area of the catchment covered by the equivalent type of lithological zone as the contribution rate as the soil in the granite zone is both thicker and more easily eroded than that in the other two zones we would expect that the contribution rate of the granite zone should be 1 whereas that of the limestone and shale zones should both be 1 however the contribution rates of the granite limestone and shale zones were calculated to be 0 5 1 8 and 2 2 respectively these results seem to contradict what we had expected but this apparent anomaly can be explained by considering the influence of grain size sorting during the processes of sediment transportation and subsequent deposition in the reservoir the grain size of sediments in cores 7 and 8 is coarser than that of sediment samples from cores 1 6 and soil samples from the three types of lithological zones table 5 figs 5 and 6 this reflects the pattern of grain size sorting within the reservoir system in general the sediment grain size decreases rapidly with transport distance upstream of the dam cores 7 and 8 were recovered from the upstream floodplain where coarse sediments were more likely to be deposited cores 1 6 were collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir where fine sediments are commonly deposited also because of this the 137cs and 210pbex activities in cores 7 and 8 are lower than those recorded in cores 1 6 as the nuclides are relatively easily absorbed by fine sediments zhang et al 2019 soils of the source area have not been subjected to grain size sorting so the soil samples are generally finer than the grains in cores 7 and 8 during the field sampling of cores 7 and 8 we could clearly see that the floodplain sediments are composed mainly of quartz sand we concluded that these sands were derived mostly from the granite zone because 1 the grain size of the soil samples from the granite zone is much more similar to that of sediments in cores 7 and 8 than is the grain size of soil samples from the limestone and shale zones and 2 the quartz sands are rich in the weathering crust and cambisols of the granite zone but are very limited in the luvisol of the limestone and shale zones zhang 1986 the quartz sands were widely used as building materials in this region and many sand quarries occur upstream of the reservoir in addition it is worth noting that some of the weathering crust and sandy cambisols on the granite hill slopes were also mined to obtain the quartz sands therefore we believe that the quartz sands on the floodplain were derived mainly from the granite zone because of this we did not apply the sediment source fingerprinting to cores 7 and 8 which helped to reduce costs in core 8 the proportion of sand increases toward the present day which might reflect the increasingly sandy soil in the source area as a result of soil erosion moreover considering the sediment contributions from the granite zone were lowest in cores 1 6 we suspect that the majority of the sediments derived from the granite zone were deposited in the upstream section the soils of the limestone and shale zones were much finer grained than the soil from the granite zone which implies that the sediments derived from the limestone and shale would be more easily transported longer distances downstream and into the perennial backwater area than those derived from granite to some extent this could explain why the sediment contributions determined for the limestone and shale zones were both greater than that from the granite zone in cores 1 6 moreover the contribution rate from the shale zone was greater than that from the limestone zone because the soil formation rate in the former is greater than in the latter and so per unit area the former contributes more fine sediment to the reservoir zhang 1986 the grain sizes in cores 1 6 imply that grain size sorting is not marked across the reservoir perennial backwater area and to a degree this explains why the sediment sources identified in the six cores demonstrate insignificant patterns of change downstream the reservoir perennial backwater area receives sediment inputs from the upstream area and the sediments deposited in this area experience almost the longest transportation distance within the catchment these deposits can be considered to be well mixed sediments from various source zones in the catchment usually we would perhaps tend to assume that these mixtures reliably represent the sediment yield from the various source zones within the catchment and can be sampled to determine the source of reservoir sediment deposits at the catchment scale however our analysis of cores 1 6 indicates that the sediment sources identified generally reflect the changing trend of the sediment contributed from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years but are unable to represent the overall sediment source at the scale of the whole catchment because of grain size sorting during sediment transportation to determine sediment sources at the scale of the whole catchment more cores would be required from different locations along the reservoir stream and the coarser grained sediments should be considered as well nevertheless the six cores extracted from the reservoir perennial backwater area do reflect the fine sediment source from the contrasting lithological zones at the scale of a medium sized catchment previous studies have considered the influence of grain size sorting on the fingerprinting properties of soils compared with sediments given the potential effect on these properties of enrichment in the fine grained fraction e g laceby et al 2017 this effect would influence the accuracy of attempts to quantify the sediment source by fingerprinting consequently collins et al 2010 included a grain size correction factor in the mixing model to apportion sediment sources this improved the sediment source fingerprinting technique by reducing the modelling errors related to the influence of grain size in the present study we did not consider this effect and did not apply the grain size correction factor in the mixing model eqs 1 and 2 because 1 we considered only the fine grained fraction of the soil and sediment samples 2 we sought to avoid errors related to over correction zhang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 and 3 the effect of enrichment of the fine grained fraction had a negligible effect on the results tables 1 and 5 fig 6 despite the samples from the granite zone having a much coarser grain size than those from the limestone and shale zones more than half of the analyzed elements occur in greater concentrations in the former samples than in the latter this is consistent with the observation that the elemental geochemistry is controlled mainly by lithology fig 2a rather than grain size nevertheless this study examined the influence of grain size sorting in a reservoir system on the sediment contribution from different lithological zones and provides new insights into the influence of grain size sorting on the sediment source 4 3 limitations and uncertainties some limitations and uncertainties are associated with this investigation firstly cores 1 6 were generally surrounded by the limestone and shale zones of the catchment this might also explain the high sediment contributions of the limestone and shale zones in the six cores in other words both grain size sorting and the location and size of each source zone could influence the source of fine sediment in the reservoir although it is difficult to quantify these influences despite this limitation we believe grain size sorting had a strong influence on the sediment source if grain size sorting had not occurred the contribution of the granite zone would be greater than the combined contributions of the limestone and shale zones as mentioned above even if the dam had not been constructed in considering the channel segment of the perennial backwater area examined in this study we can deduce that the sediments derived from the limestone and shale zones would be more easily transported out of the segment downstream than the sediments derived from granite zones for the sediment deposits in this segment the contribution of the granite zone would be greater and the contributions of the limestone and shale zones smaller than the equivalent contributions determined in cores 1 6 secondly the fine sediment sources identified in cores 1 6 show some disparities fig 3 table 4 this might be the result of some combination of the difference in the area covered by each source zone the distance of the source zones from the reservoir the feeder stream the turbulent flow the random deposition the surrounding landforms the micro terrain of the reservoir bed and the variations in human disturbance in the catchment and other factors for example the mean contribution of the limestone zone is highest in core 2 perhaps because the location is adjacent to a limestone hill the mean contribution of the shale zone is highest in core 6 mainly because the location is surrounded by a large area of shale hillslope the depth trends of the sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones in cores 3 and 4 are not significant which differs from those in cores 1 2 5 and 6 to some degree this might be because cores 3 and 4 are located near the confluence of the two tributaries that supply the reservoir and the sedimentary environments are prone to influence from some site specific factors such as turbulent currents of note the differences in the optimal element composites for cores 1 6 are related to the locations of the cores and reflect spatial heterogeneities in the sediment source and sediment deposition across the reservoir fig 1 table 3 consequently the element composites for cores 3 and 4 are similar to some extent because these cores are located close to each other considering the spatial heterogeneities we use six cores rather than one to represent the sediment deposited in the reservoir thirdly six cores collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir cannot be expected to capture the detailed pattern of fine sediment deposition across the whole reservoir similarly the cores cannot reflect the detailed pattern of grain size sorting across the whole reservoir system for example the upstream margin of the perennial backwater area in the reservoir is temporally variable in the lower reaches of the two tributaries and grain size sorting across these transition segments might be strong and complicated which is not captured by the eight cores nevertheless we believe that our eight cores broadly reflect the source of fine sediment deposits in the reservoir and the influence of grain size sorting on the source finally this research was performed using the xujiaya reservoir as a case study meaning that some of the results might be specific to the region of interest however the topic addressed in this study deserves widespread attention and the results have implications for other manmade reservoirs in different settings because our methodology and interpretations are not limited to this specific case as explained in the following points 1 the composite fingerprinting techniques employed in this study including the sampling work and data processing and analysis have been widely used to determine the sediment source in various environments worldwide 2 the influence of a dam reservoir on downstream sediment transport and deposition and grain size sorting are global issues and 3 the influence of grain size sorting on the source of sediment deposited in a man made reservoir is not limited to this particular case furthermore our classification of sediment source areas into granite limestone and shale zones and the explanations of the different patterns of sediment yield from the three types of lithological zones are specific in detail to the study region but are relevant to other areas in a general sense this is because 1 the geology based classification of source areas is universal collins et al 2017 and 2 the geological setting generally regulates soil properties landforms earth surface processes land use human activity and ultimately the pattern of sediment yield walling 2013 zhang et al 2017 2018 therefore the different patterns of sediment yield from contrasting lithological zones is a universal phenomenon and is not just related to the present study 5 conclusions in this study we have apportioned the sources of the fine sediments derived from three types of contrasting lithological zones that were deposited in a reservoir set in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years and also examined the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits the source of the fine sediments was determined using six cores recovered from the reservoir s perennial backwater area these cores broadly reflected the changes in sediment contribution from the three types of contrasting lithological zones within the catchment over the past 60 years the changes originated from the different patterns of sediment yield from the contrasting lithological environments despite the granite zone having thicker soils being more susceptible to soil erosion and experiencing more intense human disturbance than the limestone and shale zones the contribution rate of the granite zone in the six cores was much lower than that of the limestone or shale zones this was related to grain size sorting during downstream sediment transportation and deposition across the reservoir this result indicates grain size sorting had a strong influence on the sediment source these findings will help to improve our understanding of sediment sources in dam reservoir systems at the scale of a medium sized catchment

3878,reservoirs influence the processes associated with the downstream transportation and deposition of sediments in various sizes of catchments patterns of sediment yield from different lithological zones in a catchment can differ greatly assessing the historical sources of fine sediment deposited in a reservoir derived from contrasting lithological zones aids our understanding of the characteristic pattern of sediment yields from different lithological environments and improves our knowledge of sediment sources in reservoir systems however few previous studies have addressed this issue in this study geochemical fingerprinting was used to identify the sources of the fine sediments derived from contrasting lithological zones and deposited in a reservoir in a medium sized catchment in a rocky mountainous region of northern china over the past 60 years using the chronology determined by 137cs and 210pbex tracers the influence of grain size sorting on the source of the fine sediments deposited in the reservoir was examined soil samples were collected from three types of lithological zones within the catchment namely the granite 205 samples limestone 120 samples and shale 86 samples zones and the elemental composition and grain size of these samples was determined six sediment cores cores 1 6 were collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir to determine the elemental composition grain size chronologies and the source of fine sediments derived from the three types of lithological zones two further cores cores 7 and 8 were collected from the reservoir s upstream floodplain and the grain size distributions and chronologies of these deposits were also determined overall the sources of fine sediment identified in cores 1 6 reflected the changing trends in sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years which was linked to the differing sediment yields from the contrasting lithological zones the granite zone occupies half of the catchment has thicker soils is relatively susceptible to soil erosion and has been subjected to greater disturbance by human activity than the limestone and shale zones but contributed only 25 of the fine sediment in cores 1 6 in contrast the limestone and shale zones occupy 23 and 15 respectively of the catchment but contributed 42 and 33 of the fine sediment in cores 1 6 this result is related to grain size sorting during downstream sediment transportation and deposition in the reservoir system as demonstrated by a comparison of the grain size distributions of the soil samples from the three types of lithological zones cores 7 and 8 and cores 1 6 these findings suggest the sediment source has been strongly influenced by grain size sorting this study provides new insights into the source of sediments deposited in a reservoir system from contrasting lithological zones at the scale of a medium sized catchment over multi decadal timescales keywords sediment source reservoir fine sediment deposits medium sized catchment contrasting lithologies 1 introduction sediment source is defined as the relative contribution of sediment derived from different source areas and is generally determined at spatial scales ranging from a single hillslope to a large 10 000 km2 catchment walling 2005 collins et al 2020 quantifying sediment sources for catchments of various sizes is essential to our understanding of the pattern of sediment yield from differing physical and human environments this will improve our knowledge of soil erosion and sediment delivery processes integrate studies of sediment transportation and deposition at the catchment scale and apply targeted countermeasures to tackle soil erosion within the catchment framework walling 2013 collins et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 nosrati et al 2021 composite fingerprinting techniques are often used to identify the sources of fine sediments including suspended sediments and channel overbank or floodplain deposits in fluvial systems because of their low cost and high efficiency when compared with traditional approaches that involve field monitoring and surveys owens et al 2016 tiecher et al 2019 shi et al 2021 many sediment properties can be used as fingerprints to identify potential sediment source areas commonly used properties include physical characteristics e g grain size color geochemical properties e g metallic elements rare earth elements mineralogy radionuclides e g 7be 137cs 210pbex stable isotopes e g δ 13c δ 15n δ 18o and biomarkers e g n alkanes pollen enzymes martínez carreras et al 2010 collins et al 2012 2017 2019 amorim et al 2021 to quantify the sediment source groups of potential source areas within a catchment need to be categorized in advance these groups are generally defined as source types e g surface soil from various land uses and subsoil from channel banks or spatial sources e g geological zones or sub catchments collins et al 2017 land use based categorization allows the contribution made by sediment derived from areas with different land use types to be quantified provides useful information for management strategies targeted at specific land uses at the catchment scale and improves our understanding of the impacts of human activity on sediment yield therefore many previous studies have applied a land use based classification to analyze sediment sources e g collins et al 2012 zhang and liu 2016 tiecher et al 2017 malhotra et al 2019 hirave et al 2021 however it seems fewer studies have used a classification system based on the geological properties of the source areas collins and walling 2007 wilkinson et al 2013 pulley and collins 2019 this is perhaps because 1 classification by geology often provides indirect information with respect to the management of a catchment subjected to various human activities 2 many catchments are underlain by complicated and variable geology so it can be difficult to classify sediment sources based on geology and 3 some catchments are underlain by homogenous geology due to their small size previous research has been carried out mostly in small catchments lamba et al 2015 chen et al 2016 2019 huang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 geology is a fundamental environmental factor and commonly regulates the spatial patterns of land use and human activity zhang et al 2017 2018 in china approximately 1 3 of the land area is a karst landscape underlain by carbonate rocks and the remainder is underlain largely by igneous or clastic rocks the karst region is generally characterized by shallow surface soils rugged terrain a complex epikarst with a high infiltration capacity and double space structure of surface and underground carbonate rocks are highly soluble and do not produce much soil peng and wang 2012 ford and williams 2013 jiang et al 2014 consequently the supply of sediments from karst regions tends to be relatively limited in contrast the rate of soil formation in non karst regions is much greater than that in karst regions for example in southwest china the formation rate of purple soil is up to 100 times greater than that in the karst regions jiang et al 2014 moreover the capacity of soil and water conservation in karst regions is lower than that in non karst regions because of the complex hydrology associated with the epikarst in the karst regions peng et al 2019 li et al 2020 therefore sedimentary materials are generally more abundant in the non karst than the karst regions because of this the non karst regions can support a larger population have better living conditions and are consequently subject to more intense human activity mostly agriculture than karst regions considering these essential contrasts the relative contribution of sediment derived from different lithological regions should be addressed in catchments underlain by multiple lithologies because this would improve our understanding of the characteristic pattern of sediment yields from contrasting lithological regions within a catchment and facilitate the implementation of a targeted conservation strategy since the 1950s many dams have been constructed in various sized catchments across china and globally and 10 000 dams are currently operational in china wang 2016 these dams inevitably influence the downstream transport of sediment because the sediment can be intercepted and deposited behind the dam consequently deposition patterns differ from those seen in natural fluvial systems maselli et al 2018 nones et al 2019 hindered by a dam the speed of streamflow through the river channel decreases considerably thus reducing the distance over which grain size sorting occurs the reduction in the speed of flow results in most of the sediment being deposited during transportation before reaching the dam verstraeten and poesen 2000 consequently the pattern of grain size sorting differs to that in river systems with no dam the sediment deposited in the reservoir backwater area should be much finer than that deposited upstream this poses a challenge for those attempting to determine the source of sediment deposits laceby et al 2017 it is necessary to apportion the source of fine sediment deposits in a reservoir and consider if grain size sorting influenced the sediment source when investigating the pattern of sediment deposition in a reservoir system moreover sediment deposits record the historical change in sediment yields from a catchment since dam completion and useful information can be obtained regarding temporal pattern of sediment sources influenced by environmental change few previous studies have attempted to apportion the sources of fine sediments deposited in a reservoir let alone assessed the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits or examined patterns of sediment supply over periods of decades therefore using a composite fingerprinting technique the objectives of this study are to 1 understand the sources of fine sediment deposits from contrasting lithological zones in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years and 2 estimate the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits in the reservoir this will help to improve our knowledge of the sediment source in dam reservoir systems at the scale of a medium sized catchment 2 methodology 2 1 study catchment we selected the xujiaya reservoir and its catchment i e the xujiaya catchment located in the rocky mountainous region of northern china fig 1 as the target area for this study the dam was constructed in 1959 the reservoir has a capacity of 292 9 106 m3 and the catchment covers an area of 580 km2 representing a medium sized catchment zhang et al 2019 three types of lithologies underlie the catchment i e granite 50 limestone 23 and purple carbonate rich shale interbedded with argillaceous limestone hereafter referred to as shale 15 cambisols and luvisols are the two main soil types with the former developing from the granite and the latter from the limestone and shale the land use cover across the catchment comprises approximately 77 cropland 15 grain and fruit intercropping and 8 forest zhang et al 2019 two tributaries the wenhe and jiangzhuanghe converge to form the main channel entering the reservoir 2 2 sampling we completed the sampling work in 2017 including the collection of soil from the source areas and sediment cores from the reservoir the potential source areas of the reservoir deposits were classified as belonging to one of the three types of contrasting lithological zones i e granite limestone or shale within the xujiaya catchment to improve the representativeness of the soil samples both topsoil and subsoil were collected from each type of lithological zone the individual topsoil samples comprised a composite of 10 small surface scrapes 0 5 cm deep collected from a plot of around 20 20 m the subsoil samples involved the collection of 5 10 small subsurface scrapes from the full vertical extent of eroding earth bank profiles these soil samples each of which was 500 g were collected using an enameled stainless steel trowel in total 205 soil samples 125 topsoil and 80 subsoil samples were collected from the granite source area 120 samples 101 topsoil and 19 subsoil samples from the limestone source area and 86 samples 64 topsoil and 22 subsoil samples from the shale source area eight sediment cores were extracted from the reservoir cores 1 6 were taken from the perennial backwater area using a floating drilling platform equipped with an automatic corer xy 1 internal diameter 7 cm zhang et al 2019 these samples were used for source determination the material derived from the different source lithologies is fully mixed in this backwater area meaning that these sediments are representative of the fine sediments deposited in the reservoir core 1 was recovered close to the dam core 2 from near the center of the main channel cores 3 and 4 from near the confluence of the two tributaries respectively and cores 5 and 6 from the middle of downstream broad water areas in the two tributaries respectively fig 1 this distribution means the six cores largely cover the area of fine sediment deposition across reservoir backwater area cores 1 6 extended to depths of 210 207 202 242 265 and 271 cm respectively cores 7 and 8 were taken from the exposed floodplain in the upstream section using a manual corer ams internal diameter 5 cm the grain size distributions of these sediments were compared with those obtained from the source area soil samples and cores 1 6 which facilitated our discussion of the influence of grain size sorting on the source of the fine sediments deposited in the reservoir cores 7 and 8 extended to depths of 305 and 300 cm respectively at which point the rocky bottom was encountered the cores were subsampled every 5 cm 2 3 sample preparation and analysis all of the soil and core samples were freeze dried manually disaggregated passed through a 2 mm sieve and weighed prior to grain size analysis we also determined the 137cs and 210pbex profiles of the sediment cores a representative aliquot 10 g was extracted from each subsample of cores 1 6 and all of the source area soil samples and sieved using a 0 15 mm mesh prior to analyzing the elemental concentrations we analyzed 20 elements al ba ce co fe k la li mg mn nb tm v y dy eu mo nd sr and ti in the soil samples and core 1 6 subsamples to use as geochemical fingerprints to apportion the sediment sources as nearly all 99 of the sediment samples from cores 1 6 passed through the 0 15 mm mesh we defined these deposits as being fine sediments 0 15 mm wentworth 1922 we established the core chronologies use a 210pbex based model incorporating the 137cs time markers i e a composite constant rate of supply model assuming a constant rate of 210pbex supply to the sediment appleby 2001 2008 as follows 1 t 1 λ ln i d a d b e λ t a i d a d b e λ t a e λ t b i d a d where t yr is the age of the sediment at depth d cm λ is the 210pbex radioactive decay constant 0 031 yr 1 t a and t b are the known dates yr associated with depths d a and d b cm in the core respectively i d a d b bq m 2 is the 210pbex inventory in the depth range between d a and d b in the sediment core and i d a d bq m 2 is the 210pbex inventory in the depth range between d a and d in the core the grain size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 3000 laser particle size analyzer 137cs and 210pbex activities were determined using a high resolution lowbackground low energy p type coaxial germanium detector gmx40p4 ortec elemental contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes for additional details of the xujiaya reservoir and its catchment the extraction of cores 1 6 the grain size analysis 137cs and 210pbex profiles and the chronologies of the six cores see zhang et al 2019 2 4 sediment source apportionment the sediments derived from the three types of source areas i e granite limestone and shale of the xujiaya catchment were identified in the sample cores using the statistical procedure proposed by collins et al 1997a 2017 firstly a range test was performed to ensure the element concentrations of the sediments fall between the range of the maximum and minimum concentrations of the sources i e to assess whether the elements are conservative or non conservative martínez carreras et al 2010 shi et al 2021 secondly the kruskal wallis h test was used to assess the effectiveness of using individual elements that passed the range test to distinguish source area soil samples from the three types of lithological zones next multivariate discriminant function analysis dfa was applied to identify the optimum composite of elements i e fingerprinting properties that passed the kruskal wallis h test walling 2013 we used a numerical mixing model to apportion the relative contribution of each lithological zone to each subsample in cores 1 6 walling 2005 the results represent the sources of the fine sediment deposits in the reservoir derived from the three types of lithological zones within the catchment over the past 60 years this model can be expressed as 2 c ti s 1 m p s c si s 1 m p s 10 p s 1 where cti is the concentration of the i th fingerprinting property in the core samples ppm ps is the percentage contribution of sediment from the s th type of lithological zone csi is the median concentration of the i th fingerprinting property in the source area samples from the s th type of lithological zone ppm and m is the total number of types of classified source area lithological zones i e m 3 the model minimizes the sum of the squares of the weighted relative errors res for the n fingerprinting properties as follows 3 res i 1 n c ti s 1 m p s c si c ti 2 moreover to test the uncertainty associated with the modeled results we used goodness of fit gof walling 2005 collins et al 2010 2017 the results were deemed acceptable if the gof exceeded 80 motha et al 2003 in addition to improve our understanding of the sediment contributions of the three types of lithological zones we determined the deposition rate dr of sediment in the cores derived from each type of source zone 4 d r s t 2 t 1 d 1 d 2 γ d 1 d 2 p s d 1 d 2 t 2 t 1 where d 1 and d 2 are two depth locations in the core cm t 1 and t 2 are the sediment ages at depths d 1 and d 2 respectively yr γ d 1 d 2 is the average bulk density of dry sediment in the depth range between d 1 and d 2 in the core g cm 3 zhang et al 2019 p s d 2 d 1 is the contribution of sediment from the s th type of lithological zone in the depth range between d 1 and d 2 in the core and d r s t 2 t 1 is the mean annual rate of sediment deposition derived from the s th type of lithological zone during the period between t 2 and t 1 in the core g cm 2 yr 1 p s d 2 d 1 was assessed from the weighted mean percentage for subsamples between depths d 1 and d 2 in the core 3 results 3 1 sediment source discrimination table 1 presents the concentration ranges of the 20 elements in the soil samples from the three types of lithological zones and the sediment samples from cores 1 6 as well as their median values considering the spatial heterogeneity of the sediment deposition across the reservoir we applied the range test the kruskal wallis h test table 2 and then dfa to the soil samples with regard to each of the six cores manjoro et al 2017 table 3 presents the optimal composite of the fingerprinting properties the discriminatory power and the mean gof for each core the discrimination results obtained using each element composite are given in fig 2 fig 2a presents the results for source samples grouped by the three types of lithological zones and fig 2b presents the results for source samples grouped by topsoil and subsoil from the three types of lithological zones the results imply that these element composites can be used to reliably discriminate among the three groups of samples collected from the granite limestone and shale zones but are unable to discriminate the two groups of topsoil and subsoil samples collected from each type of lithological zone 3 2 source of fine sediment deposits determined from cores 1 6 fig 3 shows the relative contributions of the granite limestone and shale zones of the catchment to the fine sediment reservoir deposits assessed using cores 1 6 the chronologies determined using the 137cs and 210pbex profiles of the six cores have been reported previously zhang et al 2019 and are labelled as the right axis of each core profile in fig 3 table 4 presents the mean percentage of the contributions from each type of lithological zone in each core since dam construction in 1959 overall the highest contributions from the granite limestone and shale zones occur in cores 1 2 and 6 respectively whereas the lowest values occur in cores 2 1 and 2 respectively the mean contributions from the granite limestone and shale zones to the six cores are 25 42 and 33 respectively in cores 1 2 5 and 6 the contribution from the granite zone decreases with depth and the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones increases whereas cores 3 and 4 show little change with depth the contribution from the limestone zone in cores 3 and 4 shows little change with depth the contribution in core 2 firstly increases then decreases and the contribution in the other cores generally increases the contribution from the shale zone in cores 1 3 and 4 is fairly consistent with depth in cores 2 and 6 appears to increase and in core 5 varies considerably the 137cs and 210pbex chronologies obtained from the cores indicate that these changing inputs of sediment from the three type of lithological zones cover the past 60 years in addition across the perennial reservoir backwater area the contributions from the three types of lithological zones in the six cores show no apparent change in the downstream direction using eq 4 we calculated the mean drs derived from each type of lithological zone in cores 1 6 for seven stages over the past 60 years since dam construction i e 1959 1963 1964 1972 1973 1980 1981 1989 1990 1997 1998 2007 and 2008 2016 zhang et al 2019 these data reflect the drs of the three types of lithological zones in the reservoir perennial backwater area fig 4 the maximum drs of the three types of zones occur in the first stage 1959 1963 and the lowest values in the second stage 1964 1972 thereafter increasing in the following two stages after 1989 the drs of the shale and limestone zones decrease while the drs of granite zone first increase and then slightly decrease in comparison with the drs of other source areas the drs of the limestone zone are highest before 2008 the drs of the granite zone are the lowest among the zones for the period before 1998 then increase to lie behind only the limestone zone during 1998 2007 and finally are highest among the zones in 2008 2016 3 3 grain size analysis of the soil samples and floodplain cores table 5 shows the percentage ranges of clay 0 005 mm silt 0 005 0 050 mm and sand 0 050 2 000 mm in the source area soil samples collected from the three types of lithological zones and also from cores 7 and 8 the grain size profiles of cores 1 6 were presented in our previous paper zhang et al 2019 although a summary of the percentages of clay silt and sand in these six cores is presented in table 5 the soil samples from the granite zone are rich in sand and poor in clay whereas the soil samples from the limestone and shale zones are poor in sand and rich in clay furthermore the samples from the limestone zone have a higher percentage of clay and a lower percentage of sand than samples from the shale zone this result suggests that soils from the granite zone are much coarser than those from the limestone and shale zones and that soils of the limestone zone are finer than those of the shale zone in the granite zone the topsoil samples were richer in silt but lower in sand than the subsoil samples suggesting that the topsoil is finer than the subsoil however in the limestone and shale zones the grain size distribution of the topsoil samples was similar to that of the subsoil samples cores 7 and 8 from the reservoir floodplain had a much lower proportion of clay but were richer in sand than cores 1 6 from the reservoir perennial backwater area and soil samples from the limestone and shale zones moreover cores 7 and 8 had a higher proportion of sand than the soil samples from the granite zone fig 5 shows the grain size fractions as well as the 137cs and 210pbex profiles from cores 7 and 8 the 137cs peaks at depths of 276 and 268 cm in cores 7 and 8 respectively can be recognized as the peaks associated with the intensive 137cs fallout in 1963 zapata 2002 the 137cs and 210pbex activities in cores 7 and 8 are generally lower than seen in cores 1 6 the bases of cores 7 and 8 can be interpreted as the sediment deposited just after dam construction in 1959 because 1 they are below the depth of the 137cs peaks from 1963 and 2 the cores cannot be extended further downwards due to the rocky bottom and below these depths the original river bed can be recognized our conversations with older inhabitants of the area confirmed that the current floodplain is located in the original river bed which was covered by gravel deposits before construction of the dam the chronologies reconstructed from the two cores are shown alongside the grain size profiles in fig 5 the grain size profile shows little variation in core 7 however in core 8 the sand proportion generally decreases with depth while the clay and silt proportions show the opposite pattern which implies that the sediments deposited at this site have become increasingly coarse over the past 60 years fig 6 shows the mean proportions of coarse 0 15 mm and fine 0 15 mm grains in the source area soil samples from each type of lithological zone and also from cores 7 and 8 on average the proportion of coarse grains in cores 7 and 8 is slightly higher than in the soil samples from the granite zone but much higher than in the limestone and shale zones cores 1 6 contain almost no coarse grains the grain sizes in cores 7 and 8 are coarser than those in the soil samples from the granite zone and much coarser than those in cores 1 6 and soil samples from the limestone and shale zones table 5 figs 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 sediment source from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years the sediment sources identified in cores 1 6 largely reflect the changing trend in the sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years fig 3 the trends reflect the different patterns of sediment yield from the contrasting lithological zones and their characteristic soil types geology and human land interactions overall in cores 1 2 5 and 6 the contribution from the granite zone has increased whereas the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones has decreased over the past 60 years this trend seems more significant since the 1990s and this can be interpreted as follows firstly the cambisols that developed from the weathering of the granite are generally thick sandy loose and susceptible to disturbance and erosion in contrast the luvisols that developed from the limestone and shale are shallow fine sticky and resistant to erosion zhang 1986 this implies that the granite zone would be a stable source of relatively large amounts of sediment whereas the supply of sediment from the limestone and shale zones would be more variable and relatively limited over the past 60 years this region was subjected to intense deforestation at the end of the 1950s expanding cultivation since the 1970s and mechanized farming since the 1990s these human activities greatly stimulated soil erosion and sediment yield zhang et al 2019 as a result of soil erosion and sediment yield the erodible soil in the limestone and shale zones would have been rapidly depleted whereas relatively abundant material would have been available from the granite zone secondly more of underlying rock would be exposed by soil erosion from the limestone zone this would in turn further reduce the area of erodible soil in the limestone zone while the exposed rock would act as a barrier and protect the remnant soils however these limitations on the sediment yield associated with the limestone zone would not generally occur in the granite zone under this scenario sediment yields from the limestone zone would be severely limited even if human disturbance intensified in fact the population in the limestone zone is less than that in the granite zone moreover the intensification of human activity in the karst region is limited by the shallow surface soil and epikarst environment for example mechanized farming has been widely adopted in the granite zone since the end of 1990s but not in limestone zone to some degree the conditions in the shale zone are similar to those in the limestone zone because the shale is rich in carbonates and interbedded with argillaceous limestone consequently the discrimination of soil samples from the limestone and shale zones is not as sharp as the discrimination of samples from the granite zone compared with those from the limestone and shale zones fig 2a in summary the soil in the granite zone is thick and susceptible to erosion and the sediment yield increases substantially following human disturbance in contrast the soils in the limestone and shale zones are thinner and less susceptible to erosion and the sediment supplies are increasingly limited by the sediment yields therefore the sediment contribution from the granite zone seen in cores 1 2 5 and 6 has increased over the past 60 years whereas the combined contribution from the limestone and shale zones has decreased this explanation is supported by the temporal pattern of drs derived from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years fig 4 the drs of the limestone source area are highest before 2008 indicating the relative abundance of sediment in the limestone zone over this period the decreasing drs of the limestone and shale zones since 1990 imply an increasingly limited sediment source in these zones and the relatively high drs of the granite zone since 1990 indicate an abundant sediment supply from this zone in particular the dr of the granite zone exceeds that of the limestone zone during 2008 2016 indicating the sediment supply was limited in the limestone zone but not in the granite zone the temporal trend in drs reflects changing sediment yields from the catchment over the past 60 years as discussed by zhang et al 2019 previous studies have fingerprinted the historical source of sediment derived from different lithological zones and deposited in a fluvial system within a catchment for example hughes et al 2009 used geochemical properties and a 137cs 210pbex and optical dating chronology to assess the source of floodplain sediments derived from granite classic metasediment and basalt source areas and deposited in a dry tropical catchment in central queensland australia over the past 250 years the authors concluded that temporal changes in sediment source reflected changes in land use waal et al 2015 used the magnetic signature of sediment and a 137cs and 210pbex chronology to quantify the historical source of sediment derived from igneous and sedimentary zones and deposited in flood benches in the upper thina catchment south africa the authors reported the sediment was derived mainly from the sedimentary zone over the past century these previous studies suggest sediments deposited in fluvial systems can be used to reconstruct the history of change in the sediment source in the case of a reservoir system most of the sediment is deposited behind the dam and detailed information on the historical sediment yield and sediment source can be obtained from the deposited sequence zhang et al 2017 in comparison with previous studies our analysis of the historical source of fine sediment deposited in a reservoir highlights the different patterns of sediment yield from areas of contrasting lithological within the catchment in addition classification of the source groups by lithology has advantages in reconstructing temporal trends in the sediment source firstly soils developed from different types of parent rock generally have distinct properties e g elemental geochemistry and magnetism that allow the soils of different parent rock to be identified secondly these properties are usually stable through time and can be used to trace the sediments derived from different lithological zones within a catchment at different time stages in contrast it might be challenging to trace the source of historical sediments derived from different source groups categorized by land use as opposed to lithology because the fingerprinting properties of soils related to a given land use type might vary over time with changes in land management and fertilizer application consequently the present day properties of soils for a given land use type might differ from the properties in the past for this reason the classification of source groups by land use has generally been employed to quantify only contemporary sources of fluvial suspended sediment or surface sediment deposits collins et al 1997a 2012 walling 2005 collins and walling 2007 rather than historical sources tracing the historical sediment source throughout a depth profile of a sediment deposit usually requires the classification of source groups by lithology collins et al 1997b owens et al 1999 therefore we are confident in the reliability of our assessment of the sources of fine sediment reservoir deposits from three types of lithological zones in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years 4 2 influence of grain size sorting on the sediment source as mentioned above the granite limestone and shale zones underlie approximately 50 23 and 15 of the catchment respectively the granite zone generally has thicker soils that are more susceptible to erosion than those in the limestone and shale zones and the granite zone is subjected to more intense human disturbance than the limestone and shale zones this suggests that the granite zone should contribute more than 50 of the reservoir sediments and the limestone and shale zones should contribute no more than 23 and 15 respectively however the mean contributions of the granite limestone and shale zones found in cores 1 6 were 25 42 and 33 respectively among the three types of source areas the drs of limestone zone were highest before 2008 and the drs of the granite zone were lowest before 1998 fig 4 we can define the ratio between the percentage of the mean contribution from each type of lithological zone determined from the six cores and the percentage of the area of the catchment covered by the equivalent type of lithological zone as the contribution rate as the soil in the granite zone is both thicker and more easily eroded than that in the other two zones we would expect that the contribution rate of the granite zone should be 1 whereas that of the limestone and shale zones should both be 1 however the contribution rates of the granite limestone and shale zones were calculated to be 0 5 1 8 and 2 2 respectively these results seem to contradict what we had expected but this apparent anomaly can be explained by considering the influence of grain size sorting during the processes of sediment transportation and subsequent deposition in the reservoir the grain size of sediments in cores 7 and 8 is coarser than that of sediment samples from cores 1 6 and soil samples from the three types of lithological zones table 5 figs 5 and 6 this reflects the pattern of grain size sorting within the reservoir system in general the sediment grain size decreases rapidly with transport distance upstream of the dam cores 7 and 8 were recovered from the upstream floodplain where coarse sediments were more likely to be deposited cores 1 6 were collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir where fine sediments are commonly deposited also because of this the 137cs and 210pbex activities in cores 7 and 8 are lower than those recorded in cores 1 6 as the nuclides are relatively easily absorbed by fine sediments zhang et al 2019 soils of the source area have not been subjected to grain size sorting so the soil samples are generally finer than the grains in cores 7 and 8 during the field sampling of cores 7 and 8 we could clearly see that the floodplain sediments are composed mainly of quartz sand we concluded that these sands were derived mostly from the granite zone because 1 the grain size of the soil samples from the granite zone is much more similar to that of sediments in cores 7 and 8 than is the grain size of soil samples from the limestone and shale zones and 2 the quartz sands are rich in the weathering crust and cambisols of the granite zone but are very limited in the luvisol of the limestone and shale zones zhang 1986 the quartz sands were widely used as building materials in this region and many sand quarries occur upstream of the reservoir in addition it is worth noting that some of the weathering crust and sandy cambisols on the granite hill slopes were also mined to obtain the quartz sands therefore we believe that the quartz sands on the floodplain were derived mainly from the granite zone because of this we did not apply the sediment source fingerprinting to cores 7 and 8 which helped to reduce costs in core 8 the proportion of sand increases toward the present day which might reflect the increasingly sandy soil in the source area as a result of soil erosion moreover considering the sediment contributions from the granite zone were lowest in cores 1 6 we suspect that the majority of the sediments derived from the granite zone were deposited in the upstream section the soils of the limestone and shale zones were much finer grained than the soil from the granite zone which implies that the sediments derived from the limestone and shale would be more easily transported longer distances downstream and into the perennial backwater area than those derived from granite to some extent this could explain why the sediment contributions determined for the limestone and shale zones were both greater than that from the granite zone in cores 1 6 moreover the contribution rate from the shale zone was greater than that from the limestone zone because the soil formation rate in the former is greater than in the latter and so per unit area the former contributes more fine sediment to the reservoir zhang 1986 the grain sizes in cores 1 6 imply that grain size sorting is not marked across the reservoir perennial backwater area and to a degree this explains why the sediment sources identified in the six cores demonstrate insignificant patterns of change downstream the reservoir perennial backwater area receives sediment inputs from the upstream area and the sediments deposited in this area experience almost the longest transportation distance within the catchment these deposits can be considered to be well mixed sediments from various source zones in the catchment usually we would perhaps tend to assume that these mixtures reliably represent the sediment yield from the various source zones within the catchment and can be sampled to determine the source of reservoir sediment deposits at the catchment scale however our analysis of cores 1 6 indicates that the sediment sources identified generally reflect the changing trend of the sediment contributed from the three types of lithological zones over the past 60 years but are unable to represent the overall sediment source at the scale of the whole catchment because of grain size sorting during sediment transportation to determine sediment sources at the scale of the whole catchment more cores would be required from different locations along the reservoir stream and the coarser grained sediments should be considered as well nevertheless the six cores extracted from the reservoir perennial backwater area do reflect the fine sediment source from the contrasting lithological zones at the scale of a medium sized catchment previous studies have considered the influence of grain size sorting on the fingerprinting properties of soils compared with sediments given the potential effect on these properties of enrichment in the fine grained fraction e g laceby et al 2017 this effect would influence the accuracy of attempts to quantify the sediment source by fingerprinting consequently collins et al 2010 included a grain size correction factor in the mixing model to apportion sediment sources this improved the sediment source fingerprinting technique by reducing the modelling errors related to the influence of grain size in the present study we did not consider this effect and did not apply the grain size correction factor in the mixing model eqs 1 and 2 because 1 we considered only the fine grained fraction of the soil and sediment samples 2 we sought to avoid errors related to over correction zhang et al 2019 shi et al 2021 and 3 the effect of enrichment of the fine grained fraction had a negligible effect on the results tables 1 and 5 fig 6 despite the samples from the granite zone having a much coarser grain size than those from the limestone and shale zones more than half of the analyzed elements occur in greater concentrations in the former samples than in the latter this is consistent with the observation that the elemental geochemistry is controlled mainly by lithology fig 2a rather than grain size nevertheless this study examined the influence of grain size sorting in a reservoir system on the sediment contribution from different lithological zones and provides new insights into the influence of grain size sorting on the sediment source 4 3 limitations and uncertainties some limitations and uncertainties are associated with this investigation firstly cores 1 6 were generally surrounded by the limestone and shale zones of the catchment this might also explain the high sediment contributions of the limestone and shale zones in the six cores in other words both grain size sorting and the location and size of each source zone could influence the source of fine sediment in the reservoir although it is difficult to quantify these influences despite this limitation we believe grain size sorting had a strong influence on the sediment source if grain size sorting had not occurred the contribution of the granite zone would be greater than the combined contributions of the limestone and shale zones as mentioned above even if the dam had not been constructed in considering the channel segment of the perennial backwater area examined in this study we can deduce that the sediments derived from the limestone and shale zones would be more easily transported out of the segment downstream than the sediments derived from granite zones for the sediment deposits in this segment the contribution of the granite zone would be greater and the contributions of the limestone and shale zones smaller than the equivalent contributions determined in cores 1 6 secondly the fine sediment sources identified in cores 1 6 show some disparities fig 3 table 4 this might be the result of some combination of the difference in the area covered by each source zone the distance of the source zones from the reservoir the feeder stream the turbulent flow the random deposition the surrounding landforms the micro terrain of the reservoir bed and the variations in human disturbance in the catchment and other factors for example the mean contribution of the limestone zone is highest in core 2 perhaps because the location is adjacent to a limestone hill the mean contribution of the shale zone is highest in core 6 mainly because the location is surrounded by a large area of shale hillslope the depth trends of the sediment contribution from the three types of lithological zones in cores 3 and 4 are not significant which differs from those in cores 1 2 5 and 6 to some degree this might be because cores 3 and 4 are located near the confluence of the two tributaries that supply the reservoir and the sedimentary environments are prone to influence from some site specific factors such as turbulent currents of note the differences in the optimal element composites for cores 1 6 are related to the locations of the cores and reflect spatial heterogeneities in the sediment source and sediment deposition across the reservoir fig 1 table 3 consequently the element composites for cores 3 and 4 are similar to some extent because these cores are located close to each other considering the spatial heterogeneities we use six cores rather than one to represent the sediment deposited in the reservoir thirdly six cores collected from the perennial backwater area of the reservoir cannot be expected to capture the detailed pattern of fine sediment deposition across the whole reservoir similarly the cores cannot reflect the detailed pattern of grain size sorting across the whole reservoir system for example the upstream margin of the perennial backwater area in the reservoir is temporally variable in the lower reaches of the two tributaries and grain size sorting across these transition segments might be strong and complicated which is not captured by the eight cores nevertheless we believe that our eight cores broadly reflect the source of fine sediment deposits in the reservoir and the influence of grain size sorting on the source finally this research was performed using the xujiaya reservoir as a case study meaning that some of the results might be specific to the region of interest however the topic addressed in this study deserves widespread attention and the results have implications for other manmade reservoirs in different settings because our methodology and interpretations are not limited to this specific case as explained in the following points 1 the composite fingerprinting techniques employed in this study including the sampling work and data processing and analysis have been widely used to determine the sediment source in various environments worldwide 2 the influence of a dam reservoir on downstream sediment transport and deposition and grain size sorting are global issues and 3 the influence of grain size sorting on the source of sediment deposited in a man made reservoir is not limited to this particular case furthermore our classification of sediment source areas into granite limestone and shale zones and the explanations of the different patterns of sediment yield from the three types of lithological zones are specific in detail to the study region but are relevant to other areas in a general sense this is because 1 the geology based classification of source areas is universal collins et al 2017 and 2 the geological setting generally regulates soil properties landforms earth surface processes land use human activity and ultimately the pattern of sediment yield walling 2013 zhang et al 2017 2018 therefore the different patterns of sediment yield from contrasting lithological zones is a universal phenomenon and is not just related to the present study 5 conclusions in this study we have apportioned the sources of the fine sediments derived from three types of contrasting lithological zones that were deposited in a reservoir set in a medium sized catchment over the past 60 years and also examined the influence of grain size sorting on the source of fine sediment deposits the source of the fine sediments was determined using six cores recovered from the reservoir s perennial backwater area these cores broadly reflected the changes in sediment contribution from the three types of contrasting lithological zones within the catchment over the past 60 years the changes originated from the different patterns of sediment yield from the contrasting lithological environments despite the granite zone having thicker soils being more susceptible to soil erosion and experiencing more intense human disturbance than the limestone and shale zones the contribution rate of the granite zone in the six cores was much lower than that of the limestone or shale zones this was related to grain size sorting during downstream sediment transportation and deposition across the reservoir this result indicates grain size sorting had a strong influence on the sediment source these findings will help to improve our understanding of sediment sources in dam reservoir systems at the scale of a medium sized catchment

usgs eros customer services n d 2 1 3 independent variables independent variables landscape attributes are extracted at each ssebop pixel including burn severity climatological descriptors pre fire vegetation type topographical and positional descriptors and soils and geology data for each ssebop pixel extracted data are retained and stored as columns in a data frame one row per pixel dependent

the 1 km ssebop pixels are disaggregated or upscaled by area weighted averaging using the raster package in the r programming environment hijmans et al 2021 details of each fire event e g incident type wildfire or prescribed fire ignition date and burn severity data are obtained from 30 m mtbs rasters eidenshink et al 2007 we calculate the percentage of each burn severity class unburned unburned to low low moderate high increased greenness comprising 1 km ssebop pixels and retain the fractional data for each pixel similarly we calculate the percentage of each pre fire national land

the fire event wickham et al 2014 monthly air temperature data are extracted at each ssebop pixel from 4 km prism rasters and the maximum monthly temperature averaged over all days in the month for all years 2000 through 2015 is calculated oregon state university northwest alliance for computational science and engineering 2019 the area weighted average is used when a 1 km ssebop pixel intersects more than one 4 km prism pixel daily snow data assimilation snodas 1 km swe rasters national operational hydrologic remote sensing center 2004 are filtered to the last day of each of the winter months december through february and the mean of the final monthly swe is calculated for each pixel swe and air temperature data are not normalized in the current study and are therefore dependent on climate and location to account for pre fire antecedent soil moisture the average palmer drought severity index pdi score for the 12 months preceding the fire is calculated from 2 5

service usdi n d to upscale aspect we use a procedure to account for the discontinuity at zero 360 degrees pewsey 2014 measures of eastness and westness are generated at each pixel by converting degrees to radians and taking the difference of the sine and cosine of each radian from its arctangent potential direct incident solar radiation is calculated from aspect slope and latitude using an

than one prism cell oregon state university northwest alliance for computational science and engineering 2019 percent and magnitude eta and et p change between each post fire year and the pre fire five year average eta and et p are calculated pre fire average annual eta and et p are the average annual eta depth and evaporation ratio for the five years preceding the month of fire ignition post fire year one eta and et p are the total eta and et p for the 12 months following the fire event starting one month after the fire ignition month according to the date of fire ignition as recorded in the mtbs database post fire year two is the next 12 month interval and so on for example if a fire ignited on july 15 2010 post fire year one is september 1 2010 through august 31 2011 using a burn time between one to two months aligns with westerling s 2016 finding that from 2003 to 2012 the mean burn time in the western us was 52 days westerling 2016 ssebop may overestimate eta from unvegetated areas because algorithms used to process reflectivity data can underestimate the lsts of high albedo surfaces mcshane et al 2017 areas of higher and lower precipitation and eta may also be underrepresented in the lower resolution prism precipitation data compared to the finer resolution ssebop eta data using relative pre and post fire differences allows even the pixels with unusually high et p ratios to provide meaningful information for example even the pixel with the highest pre fire average et p included in the analysis a shrubby area in arizona has a post fire year one percent change of only 15 because the post fire year one et p ratio is as similarly inflated as the pre fire average et p ratio 2 3 eta recovery metrics metrics to assess et p recovery over time are calculated following pickell et al 2016 and frazier et al 2018 for each pixel the relative recovery indicator rri the ratio of 80 pre disturbance r80p and the year on year average yryr are computed using the magnitude change in et p rri takes the maximum et p value from post fire year four or five and compares it to the initial post fire year one et p value equation 1 negative values indicate reductions in et p over time relative to initial disturbance zero indicates no recovery a value of one indicates an equal amount of recovery relative to initial disturbance and positive values indicate gains in et p over time 1 rri max etp p o s t 4 e t p p o s t 5 e t p p o s t 1 p r e av e etp e t p p o s t 1 r80p is the percent recovered back to 80 of the pre fire average et p by year four or five equation 2 interpretation is similar to rri s negative values indicate et ps smaller than 80 of pre fire et p by post fire year four or five one indicates recovery equivalent to 80 of pre disturbance values and values greater than one exceed 80 of pre disturbance et p 2 r 80 p max etp p o s t 4 e t p p o s t 5 p r e av e etp 0 8 yryr is the average annual post disturbance change in the first five post fire years equation 3 negative values indicate an average loss in et p each year zero indicates no recovery and positive values indicate an average gain or recovery in et p each year

according to the direction and magnitude of et p response in post fire year one fig 2 fig 3 eta is not included in the clustering analysis because it does not normalize for the climatic variability present in the conus k means clustering is a heuristic unsupervised ml algorithm that separates n observations into k clusters where k is pre specified by the analyst observations pixels are grouped such that cluster members are as similar cohesive to each other and as dissimilar separated to the other clusters as possible according to their sum of squared error lee et al 2011 macqueen 1967 the k means base r function is used with an nstart of 25 and no limit on the maximum number of iterations allowed the silhouette score is calculated with the base r silhouette function to determine the appropriate number of clusters k silhouette values indicate the aggregate similarity of data points within the same cluster relative to the members of other clusters rousseeuw 1987 explanatory variables are excluded from the clustering algorithm to reduce spatial biases inherent to topographic geologic and climatic characteristics parametric one way analysis of variance anovas t tests and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd single step multiple comparison tests are run on cluster groups to ensure response metrics are significantly different α 0 05 between the resultant clusters rouder et al 2016 unsupervised partitioning can yield less predictable results than supervised learning methods and precise information about the algorithm s data sorting methods is not provided battaglia et al 2016 this makes it difficult to understand the underlying relationships differentiating the resulting cluster groups and limits the knowledge gained from the analysis about post fire processes to address these limitations clusters are separated further into pre defined environmental protection agency epa level i ecoregions omernik and griffith 2014 relationships between et p response and independent variables are explored within each unique cluster epa ecoregion group discussed in the following section 2 5 evaluation of controlling factors and their spatial patterns distributions of independent variables between clusters are visualized with boxplots sm figure b however due to the high ecologic topographic and climatic variability present in the conus we hypothesize that relationships between post fire et p response and independent variables may be regionally unique if so this would limit our ability to identify controlling relationships from conus scale data summaries or analyses to gain insight after pixels are grouped into clusters pixels are further separated into epa level i ecoregions epa ecoregion fig 4 the epa uses physical and biological spatial correlation patterns to divide north america into regions that are generally similar in terms of the type quality and quantity of environmental resources although regions mapped at coarser resolution have greater underlying variability within each ecoregion we use the level i delineation because of the broad spatial extent of our study the average of each independent variable is calculated for each unique epa ecoregion cluster data subset sm table b the resultant data summary is a geophysical description of each epa ecoregions burned areas and provides a qualitative snapshot of regional patterns between potentially explanatory variables and post fire et p response using cluster assignment as a proxy for response patterns are indeed spatially variable forming the basis for conducting quantitative statistical testing on both conus and regional scale datasets to test for overarching trends summaries of incident type prescribed versus wildfire post fire et p response and location can now be generated at different spatial scales pearson s r correlation is evaluated between independent variables and the percent change in et p in post fire year one in r the analysis is repeated on various data subsets including a all 140 509 conus pixels b pixels in each cluster e g all pixels in the conus assigned to cluster 2 c pixels in each epa level i ecoregion e g all pixels within the eastern temperate forests epa ecoregion regardless of cluster assignment and d pixels in each unique combination of cluster assignment and epa level i ecoregion e g pixels assigned to cluster 2 within the eastern temperate forests epa ecoregion statistical significance of correlation measures is evaluated with pearson s method from the kendall r package α 0 05 mcleod 2011 a multiple linear regression mlr least squares model is constructed for each data subset to evaluate the relative importance of explanatory variables on post fire year one et p percent change the absolute value of an explanatory variable s regression coefficient describes how much response variance is accounted for by the dependent variable farmer et al 2019 the mlr model r2 describes the degree to which response variance is accounted for by all of the independent variables included in the model collectively davis 2002 only independent variables that are significantly correlated with et p response p 0 05 r 0 20 are included in each data subset s mlr model and only the variable with the higher r value is retained when explanatory variables are collinear regression models are constructed in r and regression coefficients are standardized with the quantpsyc package s lm beta function fletcher 2012 2 5 1 burn scar scale assessment to further test the effect of scale on the explanatory power of independent variables correlation is evaluated and mlr models constructed for pixels within three individual fires 2007 zaca fire in southern california fig 5 2012 high park fire

calculated and compared to the magnitude change in post fire year one et p a difference in difference did regression is also used to compare pre and post fire et p time series from pairs of burned and unburned pixels from a selection of fires in the western us did is frequently used in econometrics to determine the effect of a treatment on outcome response one group is exposed to the treatment one is not and the difference in the outcome variable is tracked before and after exposure the untreated group controls for confounding factors that simultaneously influence response müller and levy 2019 in the did analysis burned pixels assigned to cluster 1 are the treatment group and pixels from adjacent unburned areas are the control cluster 1 pixels are used because their relatively large post fire year one et p reductions make them more likely to exhibit behavior that can be differentiated from signals in the climate data hallema et al 2018 lau and weng 1995 2 6 1 pixel selection due to computational limits only a subset of the 140 509 burned ssebop pixels included in the greater study are evaluated with the did analysis to test a range of conditions one fire is randomly selected

sm table c both fires from the burn scar scale analysis with pixels assigned to cluster 1 rim fire zaca fire are also included in the did analysis for continuity at each of the six fires ten pixels from adjacent unburned areas are randomly selected from nearby locations with similar pre fire vegetation and topography to the burned areas we evaluate ten pixels from each fire so that a range of local conditions and proximities distance from the burned area can be tested all pixels are located at least 1 km away from the burn perimeter but do not exceed a distance greater than the length of the burned area s longest radius the majority are within 4 km of the burn perimeter the length of a 4 km prism cell and within a 12 digit hydrologic unit https water usgs gov gis huc html that intersects the burn scar following ma et al 2020 the annual pre and post fire et p ratio is calculated for each unburned pixel unburned pixels are paired with the cluster 1 pixel from the adjacent burned area with the most similar pre fire et p behavior according to the root mean square error rmse of their annual et p time series for the five years preceding the fire 2 6 2 did and change point analyses did linear regression models are constructed for each pixel pair in r using pre and post fire annual et p as the response variable and dummy variables to represent pre and post fire periods

behavioral shifts mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 pettitt s is based on the mann whitney two sample rank based test and detects a single change at an unknown point in time it is among the most widely used change point detection methods in hydroclimatological studies mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 pettitt s is applied with the pettitt test function from the trend package in r pohlert 2020 due to the small sample size p values 0 10 are considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal et p response 3 1 1 initial post fire et p response conus scale maps indicate that the dominant response of eta and et p to fire is a reduction in the first post fire year fig 1c through f the largest magnitude reductions occur in the southwest while pixels in the northwest have the lowest pre fire average et ps fig 1b which makes them susceptible to large percent changes from comparatively small magnitude shifts in et p pre fire annual eta is highest in the southeast us and portions of northern california and the pacific northwest that receive high annual precipitation fig 1a post fire eta changes mimic post fire et p changes spatially fig 1c and e to identify super regional to conus scale response patterns pixels are grouped into five clusters following results from the silhouette score analysis et p is reduced in 82 of all pixels analyzed during the first post fire year fig 2 fig 3 including in all pixels assigned to clusters 1 2 and 3 cluster 1 comprises 9 of the pixels evaluated fig 2 fig 3 its members are characterized by the largest percent change fig 2a and magnitude fig 2b et p reductions and largest pre fire average et ps fig 2c the majority of cluster 1 pixels are located in the southwestern us within the mediterranean california great plains north american deserts and northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregions sm table c of all epa ecoregions the biggest average reductions in percent and magnitude post fire year one et p and eta occur in the mediterranean california epa ecoregion table 2 cluster 2 comprises 30 of pixels relative to pixels in cluster 1 cluster 2 pixels exhibit similarly large percent change et p reductions but smaller magnitude et p reductions possibly due to their smaller pre fire average et ps the majority of cluster 2 pixels are located in the western us within the north american deserts great plains northwestern forested mountains and mediterranean california epa ecoregions sm table c cluster 3 comprises 43 of pixels members are characterized by moderate to negligible post fire year one percent and magnitude change et p reductions and are well distributed across the conus cluster 4 comprises 18 of pixels and is characterized by negligible to moderate increases in et p in post fire year one like cluster 3 cluster 4 pixels are well distributed across the conus but are most prevalent in the east and southeastern us nearly all pixels in the eastern us are assigned to cluster 3 or 4 cluster 5 comprises 0 1 of pixels all 158 members are in the north american deserts epa ecoregion and have small pre fire average et ps which renders them susceptible to large percent changes they have large percent but small magnitude increases in et p in post fire year one tukey hsd pairwise comparisons of anova tests indicate that pre fire average et p ratios and percent and magnitude et p changes are statistically different p 0 05 between all clusters in the first post fire year except the magnitude change between clusters 4 and 5 a greater percentage of cluster 4 s pixels are in prescribed burn areas 15 than any other cluster cluster 3 7 cluster 2 1 cluster 1 1 cluster 5 0 within cluster 4 pixels in epa ecoregions located in the eastern conus have the highest percentage of pixels in prescribed burns highest percentage in the eastern temperate forests 63 followed by tropical forests 39 sm table c results are similar for pixels in cluster 3 highest percentage of prescribed burn pixels are in tropical forests 51 followed by eastern temperate forests 42 of the cluster 1 and 2 pixels the only epa ecoregion cluster combination with prescribed burn pixels comprising 1 of total pixel counts are cluster 2 eastern temperate forest pixels 16 thus as a percentage of total fire activity in each ecoregion fires are prescribed more frequently in the eastern conus than in the west in addition cluster 4 pixels have the highest percentage of low burn severity area except for the 158 pixels in cluster 5 sm figure b sm table b these results suggest that prescribed fire tends to yield lower burn severities and smaller et p reductions than wildfire 3 1 2 inter and intra fire et p response variability statistical summaries of initial et p response and short term recovery are provided by epa ecoregion table 2 and us state sm table a according to standard deviations of cluster assignment and the percent and magnitude et p change in the first post fire year some states and epa ecoregions have higher inter and potentially intra fire variability than others possibly owing to its greater topographic and climatologic complexity hallema et al 2018 et p response is more variable in the western conus where pixels are assigned to all five clusters than in the east where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 3 or 4 fig 3 fig 8 the eastern epa ecoregions tropical wet forest and eastern temperature forest also have the smallest post fire year one percent et p change standard deviations table 2 et p response is fairly consistent in some parts of the west at both the burn scar and regional scale such as in southern california where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 1 or 2 fig 5 fig 8a and in the wetter northern california coast ranges where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 3 or 4 fig 8f but where landforms are complex and climatologic and topographic gradients steep even intra fire variability can be high e g pixels in the sierra nevada s rim fire are assigned to clusters 1 2 3 and 4 fig 7 3 1 3 et p recovery over time post fire et p approaches pre fire et p with increasing time since fire fig 9 however in pixels with the greatest initial reductions clusters 1 and 2 et p ratios are still only approximately 50 of their pre fire values by post fire year five the r80p recovery metric substantiates this finding fig 10 a by post fire year five the median et p of cluster 1 pixels remain below 80 of their pre disturbance ratios cluster 2 pixels are at nearly 80 and clusters 3 4 and 5 have recovered back to and in some cases exceeded pre fire et p the greater the initial departure from pre fire et p the steeper the recovery trajectory slope during the first five post fire years e g cluster 1 in fig 9a and b cluster 1 in fig 10b boxplots of the yryr recovery metric follow this trend the greater the initial disturbance the greater the magnitude of recovery towards pre fire et p occurs at each annual time step fig 10b clusters with elevated et p in post fire year one relative to the pre fire condition clusters 4 and 5 approach pre fire et p through time from the opposite direction fig 10b tukey hsd pairwise comparisons of anova tests show that the r80p and yryr recovery metrics significantly differ between all clusters p 0 05 in contrast the rri is not significantly different for any pairwise cluster comparison data not shown 3 2 drivers of et p response many independent variables lack explanatory power at the conus scale this is illustrated by the few significant correlations and low r2 of conus scale mlr models table 3 e g all pixels scenario mlr r2 0 09 cluster 3 scenario mlr r2 0 12 and is expected given the substantial overlap in independent variable distribution when data are subset by cluster only not further into regions sm figure b the only overarching conus scale trends identified are loose and include greater reductions

coefficient 0 12 mlr model performance is improved in many of the sub conus scale models table 3 unique relationships emerge at smaller scales that are masked by contradictory relationships in conus scale datasets variable relationships between et p response and pre fire vegetation type provide good examples in the great plains epa ecoregion more pre fire shrub scrub cover correlates with greater et p reduction r 0 32 while the opposite is true in the southern semi arid highlands r 0 23 table 3 more evergreen forest correlates with bigger et p reductions in the southern semi arid highlands r 0 26 and northern forests r 0 48 while the opposite is true in the northwestern forested mountains r 0 23 marine west coast forests r 0 33 and tropical wet forests r 0 26 grassland herbaceous cover only exhibits control over et p response in the great plains r 0 28 in some epa ecoregions we can better account for the high variability in the et p response by further subsetting ecoregions into cluster groups for example mlr r2 increased from 0 12 to 0 58 when only cluster 3 pixels located in the northern forests epa ecoregion were analyzed sm table c no significant correlations are identified among cluster 2 or 3 pixels in mediterranean california or cluster 4 pixels in the great plains and southern semi arid highlands ecoregions sm table c more detailed studies are needed in these areas the direction of correlations between post fire et p response and burn severity classification is consistent among the sub conus scale datasets where burn severity and et p response are significantly correlated all pixels cluster 1 cluster 3 every epa ecoregion except north american deserts and tropical wet forests table 3 low burn severity area is consistently associated with smaller et p reductions and high burn severity with larger reductions standardized mlr model coefficients show that burn severity is one of the most powerful explanatory variables for some datasets mediterranean california and southern semi arid highlands epa ecoregions table 3 prior work suggests that landscape response to burn severity depends on vegetation type lentile et al 2007 minnich 1983 to test this we select pure pixels 1 km pixel underlain by at least 75 of the same 30 m nlcd pre fire vegetation type of each of the conus s dominant fire prone vegetation types evergreen forest shrub scrub grassland herbaceous emergent wetland and break out by epa ecoregion table 4 high burn severity is ubiquitously negatively correlated with more evergreen forest however there are no significant correlations between shrub scrub cover and high burn severity in any of the epa ecoregions among the grassland herbaceous pixels correlation direction is inconsistent high severity burns may promote increased post fire et p in the northern forests and great plains positively correlated but reduced post fire et p in the temperate sierras negatively correlated for most epa ecoregions although the biggest post fire year one percent et p reductions often occur in shrub scrub pixels the magnitude change in eta is greatest in evergreen forest table 4 3 2 1 burn scar scale assessment the explanatory power of independent variables at the burn scar scale is evaluated the zaca fire fig 5 occurred in the mediterranean california epa ecoregion table 3 mediterranean california r2 0 12 and the high park fig 6 and rim fires fig 7 in the northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregion table 3 northwestern forested mountains r2 0 23 mlr model performance is slightly improved when data are broken out by individual fire table 3 zaca fire r2 0 33 high park fire r2 0 26 rim fire r2 0 36 the fact that swe and et p response are not significantly correlated at the epa ecoregion scale table 3 but are at the burn scar scale zaca fire r 0 25 high park fire r 0 30 rim fire r 0 20 is further evidence that some relationships are so site specific sub regional scale analysis is required to identify them note that despite significant correlations the swe variables mlr coefficients are small or insignificant in all three mlr models lithology accounts for a portion of the post fire et p response variability at both the high park table 3 percent unconsolidated mlr coefficient 0 24 and rim fire areas percent metamorphic mlr coefficient 0 28 pre fire pdi mlr coefficient 0 21 and the amount of evergreen forest mlr coefficient 0 28 are drivers of post fire et p response at the zaca fire interestingly correlation direction between pre fire vegetation types and post fire et p response are opposite between the high park fire percent evergreen forest r 0 30 percent shrub scrub r 0 34 and the greater northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregion percent evergreen forest r 0 23 percent shrub scrub r 0 24 neither variable is significant in the high park fire s mlr model this indicates that even within the same epa level i ecoregion some trends do not apply to all locations universally burn severity is the most influential variable in the mlr models of all three fires largest mlr coefficients table 3 at the zaca fire high burn severity correlates with annual average precipitation r 0 35 pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 29 and pre fire grassland herbaceous cover r 0 43 at the high park fire high burn severity correlates with average annual precipitation r 0 44 average maximum annual temperature r 0 49 swe r 0 59 awc r 0 35 elevation r 0 57 pre fire evergreen forest r 0 57 pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 56 and pre fire grassland herbaceous cover r 0 37 at the rim fire high burn severity correlates with slope r 0 21 pre fire evergreen cover r 0 23 and pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 21 these correlations are performed separately to illustrate the interconnectedness of variables and are not provided in the current publication full correlation matrices are available upon request although many of the variables correlated with burn severity are not also significantly correlated with post fire et p response it may be possible to forecast post fire et p in unburned areas given the consistent relationship between burn severity and post fire et p response burn severity could be predicted from the correlated landscape attributes and post fire et p response inferred from the burn severity prediction 3 3 attribution of et p shift to fire in post fire year one the majority of cluster 1 2 and 5 pixels exhibit et p shifts outside one standard deviation of pre fire et p fig 2d conversely et p changes in approximately half of cluster 3 pixels and most cluster 4 pixels are within one standard deviation or the historical observed et p range this suggests that the et p reductions observed in clusters 1 2 and 5 are more likely a result of fire disturbance and less likely a result of natural interannual et p variability did regressions are used to further evaluate the role of fire in post fire et p shifts on pairs of burned and unburned pixels from six different locations in the western us results from all 60 pairs ten pairs of pixels per fire are provided in sm table d results from one randomly selected pair of pixels from each fire are plotted in fig 11 the regression coefficients for the did variable are negatively correlated with annual et p in every pixel pair and are statistically significant p 0 10 for at least one pixel pair from each fire however did coefficients for numerous pixel pairs from the pk complex and zaca fire are not significant sm table d probability density functions pdfs of the percent difference in pre and post fire annual et p for the same pixel pairs plotted in fig 11 show that post fire et p differences increased substantially relative to pre fire differences in the post fire period et ps of the unburned pixels are consistently higher than et ps of their burned counterparts fig 12 at each burned pixel pettitt s test identifies a change in et p at the year preceding the fire data distributions changed starting at post fire year one fig 11 sm table d possibly owing to the short length of the datasets and high annual et p variability results for pettitt s test are only significant for pixels in three of the six fires labrea moonlight zaca pettitt s test also identifies significant shifts in pre fire year one et p data for unburned pixels adjacent to the pk complex and zaca fire areas overall results support the hypothesis that fires are a primary driver of post fire et p shifts results from the pk complex are the least definitive although et p is initially reduced in burned pixels relative to unburned pixels et p recovered quickly and closely matched the unburned pixels behavior after post fire year one fig 11 behavior is similar for the other nine pairs the pk complex s ten burned pixels are in areas mapped at low to moderate burn severity and were comprised of varying fractional areas of evergreen forest and grassland herbaceous cover before the fire vegetation recovery may have been rapid in the low burn severity areas and the grasslands results from the zaca fire pixel pairs were also irresolute given its large percentage of high severity burn area and big post fire year one et p reductions fig 5 the lack of significant did regression coefficients at the zaca fire is unexpected 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal et p response this is the first study to evaluate wildfire induced eta and et p modification at the conus extent we identify locations where the direction and magnitude of post fire et p shifts may be more easily inferred regions with low inter and intra fire response variability and less easily inferred high inter and or intra fire response variability where variability is high predicting the potential hydrologic response of an unburned area to fire may be difficult our data indicate high intra fire et p response variability at the rim fire burn area western slope of sierra nevada fig 7 it is notable that the fire s burn severity patterns were also variable middle panel of fig 7 and that the current study and previous work blount et al 2020 link post fire eta response to burn severity insets of other burned areas in northern california fig 8f and the sierra nevada specifically fig 8b show qualitatively that other burns in the fire s vicinity have also had variable intra fire et p response pixels assigned to clusters 1 2 3 and 4 this contrasts with areas where inter and intra fire response variabilities are low such as in southern california or the eastern us fig 8a and c respectively work conducted by lydersen et al 2014 identified several landscape attributes that correlated with burn severity class at the rim fire e g elevation vegetation composition many of which had steep gradients in the burned area this may explain the patchy burn severity patterns lydersen et al 2014 see also goulden and bales 2014 lydersen et al 2014 also noted that highly unstable weather conditions occurred shortly after ignition and likely contributed to the fire s dynamic behavior and resultant patchy burn severity thus because the area is ecologically topographically and climatically diverse and based on evidence from surrounding areas it may have been foreseeable that a fire on the western slope of the sierra nevada would result in variable burn severity patterns and consequently variable et p response the current work identifies statistical relationships between burn severity and various landscape attributes corroborated by prior research lentile et al 2007 stevens rumann et al 2016 suggesting that it may be possible to predict post fire et p response from a burn severity prediction analysis of cluster assignment and incident type suggests that wildfire tends to reduce et p more than prescribed fire prescribed fires are also more commonly associated with lower burn severity than are wildfires these results agree with previous findings that prescribed burns often correspond with lower burn severities smaller fire sizes and are less likely to increase post fire average annual discharge hallema et al 2018 numerous studies summarized by goeking and tarboton 2020 also show that non stand replacing drought beetle kill and fire disturbance can increase eta this further corroborates our work and may be relevant to land managers prescribing fire to reduce fuel load where eta increases within a year of prescribed burn treatment i e cluster 4 pixels vegetation may be regrowing rapidly and repeated treatment may be required to maintain low fuel stock elliot et al 2010 in areas managed for water supply the effect of prescribed burns on water yield might also be considered an actively debated nuanced topic that seems to be highly site specific bart et al 2021 relative to pixels in clusters 1 and 2 a larger percentage of cluster 3 and 4 pixels are characterized by post fire year one et p ratios within one standard deviation of their pre fire average et p fig 2d in other words prescribed burns are more likely to cause et p shifts within the range of background variability than wildfires there is a pattern in numerous burned areas where pixels with smaller post fire et p modifications are located at the burn perimeter and greater et p reductions are located in the interior e g rim fire fig 7 additional burned areas shown in fig 8f this may occur because fires naturally burn out or are successfully extinguished where conditions promote milder fire behavior such as where there is a shift in the density and or condition of the fuel inventory e g where natural or artificial fire breaks are located or where topography and or weather patterns promote lower intensity burning conditions calkin et al 2014 hansen 2018 usda forest service 2003 whitman et al 2018 furthermore at the perimeter fire may be less likely to fully consume vegetation and plant recovery rates may be faster due to greater abundance of onsite and proximity to off site seed sources lentile et al 2007 minnich 1983 the pattern may be further evidence that where land management promotes milder fire behavior and smaller patches of high burn severity area the risk of post fire water budget modification may be diminished 4 2 relationships between et p response and landscape attributes we establish that the influence of certain landscape attributes on post fire et p response is not uniform across the conus such as pre fire vegetation type table 3 sm table b as such only results from our sub conus scale models can be used to meaningfully inform the potential eta or et p response of a particular location or landscape condition to fire and provides a basis for further work at finer spatial scales some regions of the conus are so diverse that et p response did not correlate with any variables even when broken out by both cluster assignment and epa ecoregion elsewhere breaking out epa regions by cluster increased explanatory power all pixels in the great plains r2 0 17 only cluster 1 pixels in the great plains r2 0 45 the relatively small r2 of even our burn scar scale mlr models suggests that relationships between post fire et p response and certain landscape attributes may be non linear or that one or more potentially relevant independent variables have been omitted we do not include myriad static and dynamic variables previously shown to influence post fire watershed hydrology pre fire vegetation management tactics are not represented in the nlcd land cover dataset e g thinning ladder fuel removal hankins n d lake et al 2017 roche et al 2018 nor are explicit measures of vegetation density pyne 2016 2012 2011 van wagtendonk et al 2018 time since last burned lydersen et al 2014 post fire climatic conditions save annual precipitation in evaporation ratios frazier et al 2018 roche et al 2020 2018 insect infestation vanderhoof and williams 2015 and long term vegetation conversion keeley and keeley 1984 landesmann et al 2021 rodman et al 2020 rother and veblen 2016 are also not accounted for these and the potential for ml approaches to tease out non linear relationships could be considered in future work we do establish spatially and directionally consistent relationships between et p response and burn severity classification we also identify patterns between burn severity et p response and pre fire vegetation type table 4 and show that the magnitude change in post fire et p is often greatest in evergreen forest this is sensical as pre fire eta and et p are also highest in the evergreen forest pixels in the majority of epa ecoregions and because it is well established that forests have higher eta rates than other vegetation types zhang et al 2001 we also show that the rate of et p recovery is inconsistent across vegetation types and regions table 4 per the yryr recovery metric et p recovery in emergent wetland is twice as fast as recovery in evergreen forest and three times as fast as in shrub scrub and grassland in the north american deserts epa ecoregion in the great plains et p recovery is fastest in shrub scrub ecosystems in the southern semi arid highlands recovery is fastest in evergreen forest this has important management implications and may help land managers set appropriate expectations about the potential duration of fire induced hydromodification past work shows that in some locations forested areas exposed to high burn severity are more likely to convert to a different type of cover i e grassland or shrub scrub than other vegetation types barton and poulos 2018 this will likely affect energy budgets and therefore post fire eta as evergreen forests have lower albedos than their deciduous shrubby and herbaceous alternatives jin et al 2012 van wagtendonk et al 2018 burn severity may also impact post fire soil moisture and therefore watershed recovery in their modeling study atchley et al 2018 observed reduced eta in both low and high burn severity areas which should have increased soil moisture however in the high burn severity areas only the increases elicited by the eta response were eclipsed by larger magnitude reductions in infiltration which increased the runoff response the high burn severity areas had comparatively drier soils as a result it has also been shown that post fire eta modification is linked to the geology that controls subsurface water availability maina and siirila woodburn 2020 the current study also identifies loose relationships between geologically driven awc and et p response at the epa ecoregion scale and lithology at multiple scales table 3 sm tables b and c land management decisions may account for these nuances by considering which can be managed e g actively treating fuel loads to reduce the risk of high burn severity and which cannot e g lithology 4 3 limitations correlations between solar radiation slope and et p response are low table 3 despite literature indicating that higher burn severities tend to occur in drier and warmer landscape positions often aspect driven alexander et al 2006 bigler et al 2005 pereira et al 2016 and our finding that burn severity and et p response are related summaries of our data support the literature in north facing cluster 1 pixels aspects between 350 and 10 degrees the mean percent change in post fire year one et p is 77 versus 97 in entirely south facing cluster 1 pixels aspects between 170 and 190 degrees the ssebop product s moderate spatial resolution may mute the sub grid heterogeneity in the native slope and aspect 30 m data and mask the significance of these relationships with post fire et p response dillon et al 2011 similarly quantifying solar irradiance at the annual timestep may mute any explanatory power of the seasonal energy balance buffo et al 1972 sellers 1965 aggregating to the annum also reduces insight into the shape of the et p response while the moderate spatial and temporal resolution of the input data limits our ability to detect smaller scale effects of topography climate and land surface cover the computational requirements of a conus scale analysis using higher resolution data would be prohibitive the 1 km ssebop product is a well established dataset with numerous use cases in the literature and well documented validations chen et al 2016 savoca et al 2013 senkondo et al 2019 singh and senay 2015 tobin and bennett 2019 the 30 m landsat based model is not yet established as a primary data product and is still being developed and revised senay 2018 usgs eros customer services n d the coarser resolution 1 km product is also less likely to contain error prone outliers because values are averaged over a larger spatial extent the current study uses burn severity mapping generated from dnbr we acknowledge that the ability of satellite derived metrics to accurately capture soil burn severity has been questioned keeley 2009 kolden et al 2015 satellite derived measurements aggregate fire effects at the spatial grain of the sensor which can introduce uncertainty and smooth out underlying heterogeneity and because nbr is based on spectral properties of ground or above ground cover it does not sample the subsurface and therefore misses aspects of fire induced soil modification cansler and mckenzie 2012 key and benson 2006 while our use of mtbs burn severity data may increase result uncertainty dnbr and relative differenced nbr rdnbr are widely used indices for assessing burn severity cansler and mckenzie 2012 furthermore field verified burn severity assessments that include subsurface observations are not currently available at the conus scale 4 4 effect of fire versus background climate variability due to the overarching influence of climate on hydrologic processes establishing cause and effect relationships between suspected forcings and shifts in hydrologic data can be challenging beyene et al 2021 goulden and bales 2014 hallema et al 2018 it has been shown that in some parts of the conus post fire streamflow may be primarily controlled by interannual climate variability and only secondarily by the landscape modifications conferred by fire hallema et al 2018 inferring causality from statistical correlations alone can be misleading due to feedbacks and data limitations müller and levy 2019 analysis of burned and unburned pixel pairs indicates fire disturbance played a role in post fire et p reductions fig 11 however results from two of the six fires tested are insignificant high variability in the eta data the short temporal length of the datasets and post fire vegetation recovery could be reducing the signal detection capabilities of the statistical tests applied alternatively overarching climate patterns may be strong enough to overwhelm any fire induced signals at the 2011 pk complex fire in texas cumulative precipitation during the water year the fire occurred was low relative to the long term average drought conditions wrought by a la niña in the southern us in 2011 fernando et al 2016 were a likely driver of the widespread fire activity in texas that year debano et al 1998 van wagtendonk et al 2018 but evaporation ratios were reduced both inside and outside the pk complex s burn perimeter during post fire year one fig 11 regional rainfall was above average in 2012 and may have contributed to smaller et p ratios in burned and unburned areas alike although reductions were larger in the burned pk complex pixels the strong super imposed climate signal may have muted the significance of those reductions 5 conclusions this is the first study to evaluate post fire eta response at the conus extent results can help inform land managers of potential post fire water budget shifts and provide the basis for future work at finer spatial scales et p is reduced in 82 of pixels during post fire year one the largest occurring in the arid southwest moderate reductions also occur throughout western states and small to negligible decreases occur throughout the conus especially in the eastern us eighteen percent of pixels observe negligible to moderate et p increases including numerous pixels in the eastern conus around burn perimeters in the mid to lower western states within prescribed fires and in wet regions west of the 100th meridian the longitudinal line at 100 degrees west of the prime meridian five years after fires evaporation ratios recover to only approximately 50 of their pre fire value in pixels with the largest initial reductions pixels assigned to cluster 1 a comparison of burned and unburned pixel pairs indicates fire is the primary driver of the shifts but also that there is high background interannual variability in the eta and precipitation data owing to its high topographic climatologic and ecologic variability the influence of some landscape attributes on the post fire et p response is not uniform across the entire conus e g pre fire vegetation type if interested in the vulnerability of a particular location or landscape condition to fire induced et p modification results from only our finest scale mlr models should be used further work may help to refine relationships within more homogeneous sub regions and non linear relationships should be considered conversely high burn severity is consistently correlated with greater post fire et p reduction because previous studies establish statistical relationships between burn severity and landscape attributes we posit that an unburned area s post fire et p response may be predictable if a burn severity estimate can be generated first we also demonstrate that although the biggest percent et p reductions often occur in shrub scrub landscapes the biggest magnitude eta changes occur in evergreen forests et p recovery rates vary by both location and pre fire vegetation type and we identify relationships between geologically driven awc lithology and post fire et p response land management decisions should account for these nuances by considering which can be managed e g forest composition and structure and which cannot e g lithology because fire activity is increasing in the western conus parks and abatzoglou 2020 pyne 2011 robichaud et al 2014 van wagtendonk et al 2018 our findings highlight the importance of representing the inter annual processes that control post fire et p change in process based and statistical hydrological models accounting for fire induced et p shifts may be less critical in the eastern conus where post fire et p shifts are typically within

3879,evapotranspiration et accounts for a substantial portion of regional water budgets in much of the southeast and fire prone western united states us even small changes in et rates can translate to

surface energy balance ssebop product for the conterminous us conus to evaluate post fire et and evaporation ratio et p shifts in the first five post fire years in approximately 5500 unique fires pixels with similar et p responses to fire are grouped through k means clustering and the resultant cluster distribution is explored over space and time the largest changes in post fire et p are observed in the southwestern conus where first year ratios are reduced by 50 to 90 and pre fire ratios are rarely recovered by post fire year five regional and intra fire et p response variability is also highest in the western conus where climatic topographic and ecologic gradients are steep post fire et p modifications are small to negligible in the east southeast conus and 18 of all pixels

martin 2016 moritz et al 2014 the conterminous united states conus is particularly vulnerable to water supply disruptions from forest fires because forested areas supply approximately one half of its

drought beetle kill and fire on water yield in western us forests and attribute the bulk of observed changes to et shifts goeking and tarboton 2020 however the vulnerability of a particular system or resource to fire induced et shifts depends on the context of the fire if et is reduced within a source water collection area downstream water supply and quality may be compromised if surface runoff

decreased latent heat flux from the canopy häusler et al 2018 nolan et al 2014 these findings align with observations from others that post fire et shifts are often accompanied by fire induced alterations to the variables that control surface energy partitioning such as the reflective properties of a body emissivity and albedo or the amount of shortwave radiation delivered to objects and the ground surface dragosics et al 2016 häusler et al 2018 jin et al 2012 sexstone et al 2018 a portion of the post fire et response variability recorded in the conus may be explained by varying fire

corroborate previous research hawbaker et al 2013 hawbaker et al 2013 show that conducive fire weather conditions forest densification and abundant opportunities for human caused ignitions due to extensive urban and suburban development were the primary drivers of the southwestern us s large fire sizes as more work shows that common disturbances can alter the components of water and energy balances that control et rates including mountain bark beetle kill livneh et al 2015 and climatic forcing fowler et al 2018 in addition to fire the importance of accounting for such perturbances in hydrologic modeling is becoming clearer over the last two decades remotely sensed data have helped hydrologists study disturbance events by facilitating estimations of hydrologic fluxes at varying

despite the substantial effort spent quantifying fire s effect on basin to regional scale et no studies identify super regional scale trends or evaluate the full range of conditions present in the conus the current work aims to fill that gap by characterizing spatial and temporal post fire et response at the conus scale and numerous finer spatial extents our primary research questions include i how have historical wildfires modified the direction and magnitude of et across the conus ii can we identify spatial or temporal trends that can help land managers plan for potential future post fire water budget modifications and iii what controls the response these inquiries are relevant to natural resource managers in fire prone areas who need to understand the potential hydrologic response of their landscape to wildfire identifying drivers of post fire et response can also inform process based and statistical hydrologic modeling efforts 2 material and methods we investigate the response of

time between one to two months aligns with westerling s 2016 finding that from 2003 to 2012 the mean burn time in the western us was 52 days westerling 2016 ssebop may overestimate eta from unvegetated areas because algorithms used to process reflectivity data can underestimate the lsts of high albedo surfaces mcshane et al 2017 areas of higher and lower precipitation and eta may also be underrepresented in the lower resolution prism precipitation data compared to the finer resolution ssebop eta data using relative pre and post fire differences allows even the pixels with unusually high et p ratios to provide meaningful information for example even the pixel with the highest pre fire average et p included in the analysis a shrubby area in arizona has a post fire year one percent change of only 15 because the post fire year one et p ratio is as similarly inflated as the pre fire average et p ratio 2 3 eta recovery metrics metrics to assess et p recovery over time are calculated following pickell et al 2016 and frazier et al 2018 for each pixel the relative recovery indicator rri the ratio of 80 pre disturbance r80p and the year on year average yryr are computed using the magnitude change in et p rri takes the maximum et p value from post fire year four or five and compares it to the initial post fire year one et p value equation 1 negative values indicate reductions in et p over time relative to initial disturbance zero indicates no recovery a value of one indicates an equal amount of recovery relative to initial disturbance and positive values indicate gains in et p over time 1 rri max etp p o s t 4 e t p p o s t 5 e t p p o s t 1 p r e av e etp e t p p o s t 1 r80p is the percent recovered back to 80 of the pre fire average et p by year four or five equation 2 interpretation is similar to rri s negative values indicate et ps smaller than 80 of pre fire et p by post fire year four or five one indicates recovery equivalent to 80 of pre disturbance values and values greater than one exceed 80 of pre disturbance et p 2 r 80 p max etp p o s t 4 e t p p o s t 5 p r e av e etp 0 8 yryr is the average annual post disturbance change in the first five post fire years equation 3 negative values indicate an average loss in et p each year zero indicates no recovery and positive values indicate an average gain or recovery in et p each year

according to the direction and magnitude of et p response in post fire year one fig 2 fig 3 eta is not included in the clustering analysis because it does not normalize for the climatic variability present in the conus k means clustering is a heuristic unsupervised ml algorithm that separates n observations into k clusters where k is pre specified by the analyst observations pixels are grouped such that cluster members are as similar cohesive to each other and as dissimilar separated to the other clusters as possible according to their sum of squared error lee et al 2011 macqueen 1967 the k means base r function is used with an nstart of 25 and no limit on the maximum number of iterations allowed the silhouette score is calculated with the base r silhouette function to determine the appropriate number of clusters k silhouette values indicate the aggregate similarity of data points within the same cluster relative to the members of other clusters rousseeuw 1987 explanatory variables are excluded from the clustering algorithm to reduce spatial biases inherent to topographic geologic and climatic characteristics parametric one way analysis of variance anovas t tests and tukey s honestly significant difference hsd single step multiple comparison tests are run on cluster groups to ensure response metrics are significantly different α 0 05 between the resultant clusters rouder et al 2016 unsupervised partitioning can yield less predictable results than supervised learning methods and precise information about the algorithm s data sorting methods is not provided battaglia et al 2016 this makes it difficult to understand the underlying relationships differentiating the resulting cluster groups and limits the knowledge gained from the analysis about post fire processes to address these limitations clusters are separated further into pre defined environmental protection agency epa level i ecoregions omernik and griffith 2014 relationships between et p response and independent variables are explored within each unique cluster epa ecoregion group discussed in the following section 2 5 evaluation of controlling factors and their spatial patterns distributions of independent variables between clusters are visualized with boxplots sm figure b however due to the high ecologic topographic and climatic variability present in the conus we hypothesize that relationships between post fire et p response and independent variables may be regionally unique if so this would limit our ability to identify controlling relationships from conus scale data summaries or analyses to gain insight after pixels are grouped into clusters pixels are further separated into epa level i ecoregions epa ecoregion fig 4 the epa uses physical and biological spatial correlation patterns to divide north america into regions that are generally similar in terms of the type quality and quantity of environmental resources although regions mapped at coarser resolution have greater underlying variability within each ecoregion we use the level i delineation because of the broad spatial extent of our study the average of each independent variable is calculated for each unique epa ecoregion cluster data subset sm table b the resultant data summary is a geophysical description of each epa ecoregions burned areas and provides a qualitative snapshot of regional patterns between potentially explanatory variables and post fire et p response using cluster assignment as a proxy for response patterns are indeed spatially variable forming the basis for conducting quantitative statistical testing on both conus and regional scale datasets to test for overarching trends summaries of incident type prescribed versus wildfire post fire et p response and location can now be generated at different spatial scales pearson s r correlation is evaluated between independent variables and the percent change in et p in post fire year one in r the analysis is repeated on various data subsets including a all 140 509 conus pixels b pixels in each cluster e g all pixels in the conus assigned to cluster 2 c pixels in each epa level i ecoregion e g all pixels

cluster 2 within the eastern temperate forests epa ecoregion statistical significance of correlation measures is evaluated with pearson s method from the kendall r package α 0 05 mcleod 2011 a multiple linear regression mlr least squares model is constructed for each data subset to evaluate the relative importance of explanatory variables on post fire year one et p percent change the absolute value of an explanatory variable s regression coefficient describes how much response variance is accounted for by the dependent variable farmer et al 2019 the mlr model r2 describes the degree to which response variance is accounted for by all of the independent variables included in the model collectively davis 2002 only independent variables that are significantly correlated with et p response p 0 05 r 0 20 are included in each data subset s mlr model and only the variable with the higher r value is retained when explanatory variables are collinear regression models are constructed in r and regression coefficients are standardized with the quantpsyc package s lm beta function fletcher 2012 2 5 1 burn scar scale assessment to further test the effect of scale on the explanatory power of independent variables correlation is evaluated and mlr models constructed for pixels within three individual fires 2007 zaca fire in southern california fig 5 2012 high park fire

is not and the difference in the outcome variable is tracked before and after exposure the untreated group controls for confounding factors that simultaneously influence response müller and levy 2019 in the did analysis burned pixels assigned to cluster 1 are the treatment group and pixels from adjacent unburned areas are the control cluster 1 pixels are used because their relatively large post fire year one et p reductions make them more likely to exhibit behavior that can be differentiated from signals in the climate data hallema et al 2018 lau and weng 1995 2 6 1 pixel selection due to computational limits only a subset of the 140 509 burned ssebop pixels included in the greater study are evaluated with the did analysis to test a range of conditions one fire is randomly selected

sm table c both fires from the burn scar scale analysis with pixels assigned to cluster 1 rim fire zaca fire are also included in the did analysis for continuity at each of the six fires ten pixels from adjacent unburned areas are randomly selected from nearby locations with similar pre fire vegetation and topography to the burned areas we evaluate ten pixels from each fire so that a range of local conditions and proximities distance from the burned area can be tested all pixels are located at least 1 km away from the burn perimeter but do not exceed a distance greater than the length of the burned area s longest radius the majority are within 4 km of the burn perimeter the length of a 4 km prism cell and within a 12 digit hydrologic unit https water usgs gov gis huc html that intersects the burn scar following ma et al 2020 the annual pre and post fire et p ratio is calculated for each unburned pixel unburned pixels are paired with the cluster 1 pixel from the adjacent burned area with the most similar pre fire et p behavior according to the root mean square error rmse of their annual et p time series for the five years preceding the fire 2 6 2 did and change point analyses did linear regression models are constructed for each pixel pair in r using pre and post fire annual et p as the response variable and dummy variables to represent pre and post fire periods

behavioral shifts mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 pettitt s is based on the mann whitney two sample rank based test and detects a single change at an unknown point in time it is among the most widely used change point detection methods in hydroclimatological studies mallakpour and villarini 2016 zhou et al 2019 pettitt s is applied with the pettitt test function from the trend package in r pohlert 2020 due to the small sample size p values 0 10 are considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal et p response 3 1 1 initial post fire et p response conus scale maps indicate that the dominant response of eta and et p to fire is a reduction in the first post fire year fig 1c through f the largest magnitude reductions occur in the southwest while pixels in the northwest have the lowest pre fire average et ps fig 1b which makes them susceptible to large percent changes from comparatively small magnitude shifts in et p pre fire annual eta is highest in the southeast us and portions of northern california and the pacific northwest that receive high annual precipitation fig 1a post fire eta changes mimic post fire et p changes spatially fig 1c and e to identify super regional to conus scale response patterns pixels are grouped into five clusters following results from the silhouette score analysis et p is reduced in 82 of all pixels analyzed during the first post fire year fig 2 fig 3 including in all pixels assigned to clusters 1 2 and 3 cluster 1 comprises 9 of the pixels evaluated fig 2 fig 3 its members are characterized by the largest percent change fig 2a and magnitude fig 2b et p reductions and largest pre fire average et ps fig 2c the majority of cluster 1 pixels are located in the southwestern us within the mediterranean california great plains north american deserts and northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregions sm table c of all epa ecoregions the biggest average reductions in percent and magnitude post fire year one et p and eta occur in the mediterranean california epa ecoregion table 2 cluster 2 comprises 30 of pixels relative to pixels in cluster 1 cluster 2 pixels exhibit similarly large percent change et p reductions but smaller magnitude et p reductions possibly due to their smaller pre fire average et ps the majority of cluster 2 pixels are located in the western us within the north american deserts great plains northwestern forested mountains and mediterranean california epa ecoregions sm table c cluster 3 comprises 43 of pixels members are characterized by moderate to negligible post fire year one percent and magnitude change et p reductions and are well distributed across the conus cluster 4 comprises 18 of pixels and is characterized by negligible to moderate increases in et p in post fire year one like cluster 3 cluster 4 pixels are well distributed across the conus but are most prevalent in the east and southeastern us nearly all pixels in the eastern us are assigned to cluster 3 or 4 cluster 5 comprises 0 1 of pixels all 158 members are in the north american deserts epa ecoregion and have small pre fire average et ps which renders them susceptible to large percent changes they have large percent but small magnitude increases in et p in post fire year one tukey hsd pairwise comparisons of anova tests indicate that pre fire average et p ratios and percent and magnitude et p changes are statistically different p 0 05 between all clusters in the first post fire year except the magnitude change between clusters 4 and 5 a greater percentage of cluster 4 s pixels are in prescribed burn areas 15 than any other cluster cluster 3 7 cluster 2 1 cluster 1 1 cluster 5 0 within cluster 4 pixels in epa ecoregions located in the eastern conus have the highest percentage of pixels in prescribed burns highest percentage in the eastern temperate forests 63 followed by tropical forests 39 sm table c results are similar for pixels in cluster 3 highest percentage of prescribed burn pixels are in tropical forests 51 followed by eastern temperate forests 42 of the cluster 1 and 2 pixels the only epa ecoregion cluster combination with prescribed burn pixels comprising 1 of total pixel counts are cluster 2 eastern temperate forest pixels 16 thus as a percentage of total fire activity in each ecoregion fires are prescribed more frequently in the eastern conus than in the west in addition cluster 4 pixels have the highest percentage of low burn severity area except for the 158 pixels in cluster 5 sm figure b sm table b these results suggest that prescribed fire tends to yield lower burn severities and smaller et p reductions than wildfire 3 1 2 inter and intra fire et p response variability statistical summaries of initial et p response and short term recovery are provided by epa ecoregion table 2 and us state sm table a according to standard deviations of cluster assignment and the percent and magnitude et p change in the first post fire year some states and epa ecoregions have higher inter and potentially intra fire variability than others possibly owing to its greater topographic and climatologic complexity hallema et al 2018 et p response is more variable in the western conus where pixels are assigned to all five clusters than in the east where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 3 or 4 fig 3 fig 8 the eastern epa ecoregions tropical wet forest and eastern temperature forest also have the smallest post fire year one percent et p change standard deviations table 2 et p response is fairly consistent in some parts of the west at both the burn scar and regional scale such as in southern california where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 1 or 2 fig 5 fig 8a and in the wetter northern california coast ranges where nearly every pixel is assigned to clusters 3 or 4 fig 8f but where landforms are complex and climatologic and topographic gradients steep even intra fire variability can be high e g pixels in the sierra nevada s rim fire are assigned to clusters 1 2 3 and 4 fig 7 3 1 3 et p recovery over time post fire et p approaches pre fire et p with increasing time since fire fig 9 however in pixels with the greatest initial reductions clusters 1 and 2 et p ratios are still only approximately 50 of their pre fire values by post fire year five the r80p recovery metric substantiates this finding fig 10 a by post fire year five the median et p of cluster 1 pixels remain below 80 of their pre disturbance ratios cluster 2 pixels are at nearly 80 and clusters 3 4 and 5 have recovered back to and in some cases exceeded pre fire et p the greater the initial departure from pre fire et p the steeper the recovery trajectory slope during the first five post fire years e g cluster 1 in fig 9a and b cluster 1 in fig 10b boxplots of the yryr recovery metric follow this trend the greater the initial disturbance the greater the magnitude of recovery towards pre fire et p occurs at each annual time step fig 10b clusters with elevated et p in post fire year one relative to the pre fire condition clusters 4 and 5 approach pre fire et p through time from the opposite direction fig 10b tukey hsd pairwise comparisons of anova tests show that the r80p and yryr recovery metrics significantly differ between all clusters p 0 05 in contrast the rri is not significantly different for any pairwise cluster comparison data not shown 3 2 drivers of et p response many independent variables lack explanatory power at the conus scale this is illustrated by the few significant correlations and low r2 of conus scale mlr models table 3 e g all pixels scenario mlr r2 0 09 cluster 3 scenario mlr r2 0 12 and is expected given the substantial overlap in independent variable distribution when data are subset by cluster only not further into regions sm figure b the only overarching conus scale trends identified are loose and include greater reductions in post fire et p at more westerly longitudes all pixels longitude r 0 23 mlr coefficient 0 27 table 3 and with larger percentages of high burn severity area all pixels high burn severity r 0 30 mlr coefficient 0 12 mlr model performance is improved in many of the sub conus scale models table 3 unique relationships emerge at smaller scales that are masked by contradictory relationships in conus scale datasets variable relationships between et p response and pre fire vegetation type provide good examples in the great plains epa ecoregion more pre fire shrub scrub cover correlates with greater et p reduction r 0 32 while the opposite is true in the southern semi arid highlands r 0 23 table 3 more evergreen forest correlates with bigger et p reductions in the southern semi arid highlands r 0 26 and northern forests r 0 48 while the opposite is true in the northwestern forested mountains r 0 23 marine west coast forests r 0 33 and tropical wet forests r 0 26 grassland herbaceous cover only exhibits control over et p response in the great plains r 0 28 in some epa ecoregions we can better account for the high variability in the et p response by further subsetting ecoregions into cluster groups for example mlr r2 increased from 0 12 to 0 58 when only cluster 3 pixels located in the northern forests epa ecoregion were analyzed sm table c no significant correlations are identified among cluster 2 or 3 pixels in mediterranean california or cluster 4 pixels in the great plains and southern semi arid highlands ecoregions sm table c more detailed studies are needed in these areas the direction of correlations between post fire et p response and burn severity classification is consistent among the sub conus scale datasets where burn severity and et p response are significantly correlated all pixels cluster 1 cluster 3 every epa ecoregion except north american deserts and tropical wet forests table 3 low burn severity area is consistently associated with smaller et p reductions and high burn severity with larger reductions standardized mlr model coefficients show that burn severity is one of the most powerful explanatory variables for some datasets mediterranean california and southern semi arid highlands epa ecoregions table 3 prior work suggests that landscape response to burn severity depends on vegetation type lentile et al 2007 minnich 1983 to test this we select pure pixels 1 km pixel underlain by at least 75 of the same 30 m nlcd pre fire vegetation type of each of the conus s dominant fire prone vegetation types evergreen forest shrub scrub grassland herbaceous emergent wetland and break out by epa ecoregion table 4 high burn severity is ubiquitously negatively correlated with more evergreen forest however there are no significant correlations between shrub scrub cover and high burn severity in any of the epa ecoregions among the grassland herbaceous pixels correlation direction is inconsistent high severity burns may promote increased post fire et p in the northern forests and great plains positively correlated but reduced post fire et p in the temperate sierras negatively correlated for most epa ecoregions although the biggest post fire year one percent et p reductions often occur in shrub scrub pixels the magnitude change in eta is greatest in evergreen forest table 4 3 2 1 burn scar scale assessment the explanatory power of independent variables at the burn scar scale is evaluated the zaca fire fig 5 occurred in the mediterranean california epa ecoregion table 3 mediterranean california r2 0 12 and the high park fig 6 and rim fires fig 7 in the northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregion table 3 northwestern forested mountains r2 0 23 mlr model performance is slightly improved when data are broken out by individual fire table 3 zaca fire r2 0 33 high park fire r2 0 26 rim fire r2 0 36 the fact that swe and et p response are not significantly correlated at the epa ecoregion scale table 3 but are at the burn scar scale zaca fire r 0 25 high park fire r 0 30 rim fire r 0 20 is further evidence that some relationships are so site specific sub regional scale analysis is required to identify them note that despite significant correlations the swe variables mlr coefficients are small or insignificant in all three mlr models lithology accounts for a portion of the post fire et p response variability at both the high park table 3 percent unconsolidated mlr coefficient 0 24 and rim fire areas percent metamorphic mlr coefficient 0 28 pre fire pdi mlr coefficient 0 21 and the amount of evergreen forest mlr coefficient 0 28 are drivers of post fire et p response at the zaca fire interestingly correlation direction between pre fire vegetation types and post fire et p response are opposite between the high park fire percent evergreen forest r 0 30 percent shrub scrub r 0 34 and the greater northwestern forested mountains epa ecoregion percent evergreen forest r 0 23 percent shrub scrub r 0 24 neither variable is significant in the high park fire s mlr model this indicates that even within the same epa level i ecoregion some trends do not apply to all locations universally burn severity is the most influential variable in the mlr models of all three fires largest mlr coefficients table 3 at the zaca fire high burn severity correlates with annual average precipitation r 0 35 pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 29 and pre fire grassland herbaceous cover r 0 43 at the high park fire high burn severity correlates with average annual precipitation r 0 44 average maximum annual temperature r 0 49 swe r 0 59 awc r 0 35 elevation r 0 57 pre fire evergreen forest r 0 57 pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 56 and pre fire grassland herbaceous cover r 0 37 at the rim fire high burn severity correlates with slope r 0 21 pre fire evergreen cover r 0 23 and pre fire shrub scrub cover r 0 21 these correlations are performed separately to illustrate the interconnectedness of variables and are not provided in the current publication full correlation matrices are available upon request although many of the variables correlated with burn severity are not also significantly correlated with post fire et p response it may be possible to forecast post fire et p in unburned areas given the consistent relationship between burn severity and post fire et p response burn severity could be predicted from the correlated landscape attributes and post fire et p response inferred from the burn severity prediction 3 3 attribution of et p shift to fire in post fire year one the majority of cluster 1 2 and 5 pixels exhibit et p shifts outside one standard deviation of pre fire et p fig 2d conversely et p changes in approximately half of cluster 3 pixels and most cluster 4 pixels are within one standard deviation or the historical observed et p range this suggests that the et p reductions observed in clusters 1 2 and 5 are more likely a result of fire disturbance and less likely a result of natural interannual et p variability did regressions are used to further evaluate the role of fire in post fire et p shifts on pairs of burned and unburned pixels from six different locations in the western us results from all 60 pairs ten pairs of pixels per fire are provided in sm table d results from one randomly selected pair of pixels from each fire are plotted in fig 11 the regression coefficients for the did variable are negatively correlated with annual et p in every pixel pair and are statistically significant p 0 10 for at least one pixel pair from each fire however did coefficients for numerous pixel pairs from the pk complex and zaca fire are not significant sm table d probability density functions pdfs of the percent difference in pre and post fire annual et p for the same pixel pairs plotted in fig 11 show that post fire et p differences increased substantially relative to pre fire differences in the post fire period et ps of the unburned pixels are consistently higher than et ps of their burned counterparts fig 12 at each burned pixel pettitt s test identifies a change in et p at the year preceding the fire data distributions changed starting at post fire year one fig 11 sm table d possibly owing to the short length of the datasets and high annual et p variability results for pettitt s test are only significant for pixels in three of the six fires labrea moonlight zaca pettitt s test also identifies significant shifts in pre fire year one et p data for unburned pixels adjacent to the pk complex and zaca fire areas overall results support the hypothesis that fires are a primary driver of post fire et p shifts results from the pk complex are the least definitive although et p is initially reduced in burned pixels relative to unburned pixels et p recovered quickly and closely matched the unburned pixels behavior after post fire year one fig 11 behavior is similar for the other nine pairs the pk complex s ten burned pixels are in areas mapped at low to moderate burn severity and were comprised of varying fractional areas of evergreen forest and grassland herbaceous cover before the fire vegetation recovery may have been rapid in the low burn severity areas and the grasslands results from the zaca fire pixel pairs were also irresolute given its large percentage of high severity burn area and big post fire year one et p reductions fig 5 the lack of significant did regression coefficients at the zaca fire is unexpected 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal et p response this is the first study to evaluate wildfire induced eta and et p modification at the conus extent we identify locations where the direction and magnitude of post fire et p shifts may be more easily inferred regions with low inter and intra fire response variability and less easily inferred high inter and or intra fire response variability where variability is high predicting the potential hydrologic response of an unburned area to fire may be difficult our data indicate high intra fire et p response variability at the rim fire burn area western slope of sierra nevada fig 7 it is notable that the fire s burn severity patterns were also variable middle panel of fig 7 and that the current study and previous work blount et al 2020 link post fire eta response to burn severity insets of other burned areas in northern california fig 8f and the sierra nevada specifically fig 8b show qualitatively that other burns in the fire s vicinity have also had variable intra fire et p response pixels assigned to clusters 1 2 3 and 4 this contrasts with areas where inter and intra fire response variabilities are low such as in southern california or the eastern us fig 8a and c respectively work conducted by lydersen et al 2014 identified several landscape attributes that correlated with burn severity class at the rim fire e g elevation vegetation composition many of which had steep gradients in the burned area this may explain the patchy burn severity patterns lydersen et al 2014 see also goulden and bales 2014 lydersen et al 2014 also noted that highly unstable weather conditions occurred shortly after ignition and likely contributed to the fire s dynamic behavior and resultant patchy burn severity thus because the area is ecologically topographically and climatically diverse and based on evidence from surrounding areas it may have been foreseeable that a fire on the western slope of the sierra nevada would result in variable burn severity patterns and consequently variable et p response the current work identifies statistical relationships between burn severity and various landscape attributes corroborated by prior research lentile et al 2007 stevens rumann et al 2016 suggesting that it may be possible to predict post fire et p response from a burn severity prediction analysis of cluster assignment and incident type suggests that wildfire tends to reduce et p more than prescribed fire prescribed fires are also more commonly associated with lower burn severity than are wildfires these results agree with previous findings that prescribed burns often correspond with lower burn severities smaller fire sizes and are less likely to increase post fire average annual discharge hallema et al 2018 numerous studies summarized by goeking and tarboton 2020 also show that non stand replacing drought beetle kill and fire disturbance can increase eta this further corroborates our work and may be relevant to land managers prescribing fire to reduce fuel load where eta increases within a year of prescribed burn treatment i e cluster 4 pixels vegetation may be regrowing rapidly and repeated treatment may be required to maintain low fuel stock elliot et al 2010 in areas managed for water supply the effect of prescribed burns on water yield might also be considered an actively debated nuanced topic that seems to be highly site specific bart et al 2021 relative to pixels in clusters 1 and 2 a larger percentage of cluster 3 and 4 pixels are characterized by post fire year one et p ratios within one standard deviation of their pre fire average et p fig 2d in other words prescribed burns are more likely to cause et p shifts within the range of background variability than wildfires there is a pattern in numerous burned areas where pixels with smaller post fire et p modifications are located at the burn perimeter and greater et p reductions are located in the interior e g rim fire fig 7 additional burned areas shown in fig 8f this may occur because fires naturally burn out or are successfully extinguished where conditions promote milder fire behavior such as where there is a shift in the density and or condition of the fuel inventory e g where natural or artificial fire breaks are located or where topography and or weather patterns promote lower intensity burning conditions calkin et al 2014 hansen 2018 usda forest service 2003 whitman et al 2018 furthermore at the perimeter fire may be less likely to fully consume vegetation and plant recovery rates may be faster due to greater abundance of onsite and proximity to off site seed sources lentile et al 2007 minnich 1983 the pattern may be further evidence that where land management promotes milder fire behavior and smaller patches of high burn severity area the risk of post fire water budget modification may be diminished 4 2 relationships between et p response and landscape attributes we establish that the influence of certain landscape attributes on post fire et p response is not uniform across the conus such as pre fire vegetation type table 3 sm table b as such only results from our sub conus scale models can be used to meaningfully inform the potential eta or et p response of a particular location or landscape condition to fire and provides a basis for further work at finer spatial scales some regions of the conus are so diverse that et p response did not correlate with any variables even when broken out by both cluster assignment and epa ecoregion elsewhere breaking out epa regions by cluster increased explanatory power all pixels in the great plains r2 0 17 only cluster 1 pixels in the great plains r2 0 45 the relatively small r2 of even our burn scar scale mlr models suggests that relationships between post fire et p response and certain landscape attributes may be non linear or that one or more potentially relevant independent variables have been omitted we do not include myriad static and dynamic variables previously shown to influence post fire watershed hydrology pre fire vegetation management tactics are not represented in the nlcd land cover dataset e g thinning ladder fuel removal hankins n d lake et al 2017 roche et al 2018 nor are explicit measures of vegetation density pyne 2016 2012 2011 van wagtendonk et al 2018 time since last burned lydersen et al 2014 post fire climatic conditions save annual precipitation in evaporation ratios frazier et al 2018 roche et al 2020 2018 insect infestation vanderhoof and williams 2015 and long term vegetation conversion keeley and keeley 1984 landesmann et al 2021 rodman et al 2020 rother and veblen 2016 are also not accounted for these and the potential for ml approaches to tease out non linear relationships could be considered in future work we do establish spatially and directionally consistent relationships between et p response and burn severity classification we also identify patterns between burn severity et p response and pre fire vegetation type table 4 and show that the magnitude change in post fire et p is often greatest in evergreen forest this is sensical as pre fire eta and et p are also highest in the evergreen forest pixels in the majority of epa ecoregions and because it is well established that forests have higher eta rates than other vegetation types zhang et al 2001 we also show that the rate of et p recovery is inconsistent across vegetation types and regions table 4 per the yryr recovery metric et p recovery in emergent wetland is twice as fast as recovery in evergreen forest and three times as fast as in shrub scrub and grassland in the north american deserts epa ecoregion in the great plains et p recovery is fastest in shrub scrub ecosystems in the southern semi arid highlands recovery is fastest in evergreen forest this has important management implications and may help land managers set appropriate expectations about the potential duration of fire induced hydromodification past work shows that in some locations forested areas exposed to high burn severity are more likely to convert to a different type of cover i e grassland or shrub scrub than other vegetation types barton and poulos 2018 this will likely affect energy budgets and therefore post fire eta as evergreen forests have lower albedos than their deciduous shrubby and herbaceous alternatives jin et al 2012 van wagtendonk et al 2018 burn severity may also impact post fire soil moisture and therefore watershed recovery in their modeling study atchley et al 2018 observed reduced eta in both low and high burn severity areas which should have increased soil moisture however in the high burn severity areas only the increases elicited by the eta response were eclipsed by larger magnitude reductions in infiltration which increased the runoff response the high burn severity areas had comparatively drier soils as a result it has also been shown that post fire eta modification is linked to the geology that controls subsurface water availability maina and siirila woodburn 2020 the current study also identifies loose relationships between geologically driven awc and et p response at the epa ecoregion scale and lithology at multiple scales table 3 sm tables b and c land management decisions may account for these nuances by considering which can be managed e g actively treating fuel loads to reduce the risk of high burn severity and which cannot e g lithology 4 3 limitations correlations between solar radiation slope and et p response are low table 3 despite literature indicating that higher burn severities tend to occur in drier and warmer landscape positions often aspect driven alexander et al 2006 bigler et al 2005 pereira et al 2016 and our finding that burn severity and et p response are related summaries of our data support the literature in north facing cluster 1 pixels aspects between 350 and 10 degrees the mean percent change in post fire year one et p is 77 versus 97 in entirely south facing cluster 1 pixels aspects between 170 and 190 degrees the ssebop product s moderate spatial resolution may mute the sub grid heterogeneity in the native slope and aspect 30 m data and mask the significance of these relationships with post fire et p response dillon et al 2011 similarly quantifying solar irradiance at the annual timestep may mute any explanatory power of the seasonal energy balance buffo et al 1972 sellers 1965 aggregating to the annum also reduces insight into the shape of the et p response while the moderate spatial and temporal resolution of the input data limits our ability to detect smaller scale effects of topography climate and land surface cover the computational requirements of a conus scale analysis using higher resolution data would be prohibitive the 1 km ssebop product is a well established dataset with numerous use cases in the literature and well documented validations chen et al 2016 savoca et al 2013 senkondo et al 2019 singh and senay 2015 tobin and bennett 2019 the 30 m landsat based model is not yet established as a primary data product and is still being developed and revised senay 2018 usgs eros customer services n d the coarser resolution 1 km product is also less likely to contain error prone outliers because values are averaged over a larger spatial extent the current study uses burn severity mapping generated from dnbr we acknowledge that the ability of satellite derived metrics to accurately capture soil burn severity has been questioned keeley 2009 kolden et al 2015 satellite derived measurements aggregate fire effects at the spatial grain of the sensor which can introduce uncertainty and smooth out underlying heterogeneity and because nbr is based on spectral properties of ground or above ground cover it does not sample the subsurface and therefore misses aspects of fire induced soil modification cansler and mckenzie 2012 key and benson 2006 while our use of mtbs burn severity data may increase result uncertainty dnbr and relative differenced nbr rdnbr are widely used indices for assessing burn severity cansler and mckenzie 2012 furthermore field verified burn severity assessments that include subsurface observations are not currently available at the conus scale 4 4 effect of fire versus background climate variability due to the overarching influence of climate on hydrologic processes establishing cause and effect relationships between suspected forcings and shifts in hydrologic data can be challenging beyene et al 2021 goulden and bales 2014 hallema et al 2018 it has been shown that in some parts of the conus post fire streamflow may be primarily controlled by interannual climate variability and only secondarily by the landscape modifications conferred by fire hallema et al 2018 inferring causality from statistical correlations alone can be misleading due to feedbacks and data limitations müller and levy 2019 analysis of burned and unburned pixel pairs indicates fire disturbance played a role in post fire et p reductions fig 11 however results from two of the six fires tested are insignificant high variability in the eta data the short temporal length of the datasets and post fire vegetation recovery could be reducing the signal detection capabilities of the statistical tests applied alternatively overarching climate patterns may be strong enough to overwhelm any fire induced signals at the 2011 pk complex fire in texas cumulative precipitation during the water year the fire occurred was low relative to the long term average drought conditions wrought by a la niña in the southern us in 2011 fernando et al 2016 were a likely driver of the widespread fire activity in texas that year debano et al 1998 van wagtendonk et al 2018 but evaporation ratios were reduced both inside and outside the pk complex s burn perimeter during post fire year one fig 11 regional rainfall was above average in 2012 and may have contributed to smaller et p ratios in burned and unburned areas alike although reductions were larger in the burned pk complex pixels the strong super imposed climate signal may have muted the significance of those reductions 5 conclusions this is the first study to evaluate post fire eta response at the conus extent results can help inform land managers of potential post fire water budget shifts and provide the basis for future work at finer spatial scales et p is reduced in 82 of pixels during post fire year one the largest occurring in the arid southwest moderate reductions also occur throughout western states and small to negligible decreases occur throughout the conus especially in the eastern us eighteen percent of pixels observe negligible to moderate et p increases including numerous pixels in the eastern conus around burn perimeters in the mid to lower western states within prescribed fires and in wet regions west of the 100th meridian the longitudinal line at 100 degrees west of the prime meridian five years after fires evaporation ratios recover to only approximately 50 of their pre fire value in pixels with the largest initial reductions pixels assigned to cluster 1 a comparison of burned and unburned pixel pairs indicates fire is the primary driver of the shifts but also that there is high background interannual variability in the eta and precipitation data owing to its high topographic climatologic and ecologic variability the influence of some landscape attributes on the post fire et p response is not uniform across the entire conus e g pre fire vegetation type if interested in the vulnerability of a particular location or landscape condition to fire induced et p modification results from only our finest scale mlr models should be used further work may help to refine relationships within more homogeneous sub regions and non linear relationships should be considered conversely high burn severity is consistently correlated with greater post fire et p reduction because previous studies establish statistical relationships between burn severity and landscape attributes we posit that an unburned area s post fire et p response may be predictable if a burn severity estimate can be generated first we also demonstrate that although the biggest percent et p reductions often occur in shrub scrub landscapes the biggest magnitude eta changes occur in evergreen forests et p recovery rates vary by both location and pre fire vegetation type and we identify relationships between geologically driven awc lithology and post fire et p response land management decisions should account for these nuances by considering which can be managed e g forest composition and structure and which cannot e g lithology because fire activity is increasing in the western conus parks and abatzoglou 2020 pyne 2011 robichaud et al 2014 van wagtendonk et al 2018 our findings highlight the importance of representing the inter annual processes that control post fire et p change in process based and statistical hydrological models accounting for fire induced et p shifts may be less critical in the eastern conus where post fire et p shifts are typically within
