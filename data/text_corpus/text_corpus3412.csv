17060,various technologies are used for the treatment of arsenic as contaminated water but only a few seem to be suitable for small scale applications these are mostly used in rural communities where the access to potable water is the most vulnerable in this review paper the salient advantages and most notable challenges of membrane based technologies for the removal of arsenate as v and arsenite as iii are evaluated and systematically compared to alternative technologies such as e g adsorption a comparison of different scientific papers case studies and pilot trials is used to discuss the most important aspects when evaluating as mitigation technologies including the ability to comply with the stringent who drinking water guideline limit value of 10 µg l as and the safe disposal of produced as laden waste the use of renewable energies such as solar power in small scale 10 m³ day membrane applications is evaluated finally a conceptual approach for holistic as mitigation is proposed as an important approach to prevent exposure to as by providing a safe water supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic removal membrane technologies arsenate arsenite concentrate disposal 1 introduction arsenic as is a known human contaminant that poses potential serious cancerous and non cancerous health risks the most visible of which are skin diseases who 2018 arsenic uptake occurs predominantly from as rich groundwater sources used for drinking water supply and irrigation of crops entering the human food chain who 2018 it is currently estimated that as contaminated drinking water has affected the lives of over 200 million people in 105 countries worldwide shakoor et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2012 arsenic pollution is of great concern particularly in developing countries where resources for mitigation are limited making low cost and easy to use technologies an urgent necessity kabir and chowdhury 2017 litter et al 2010 however the low cost technologies available are not always capable of reducing as below the recommended value of 10 µg l for drinking water who 2017 ghosh nath et al 2019 and populations often consume water containing high amounts of as in addition most commonly used technologies need frequent cleaning and or replacement require the use of chemicals and may generate toxic sludge that requires further treatment and most importantly safe disposal these maintenance and operational efforts are usually not completed properly or not carried out at all which makes safeguarding operations mostly in rural areas and development countries very difficult jain and singh 2012 for the treatment of as questions therefore remain regarding the efficiency and applicability of these technologies technological and environmental aspects as well as the economic viability and social acceptance mostly in developing countries litter et al 2019 vanhalem et al 2009 jain and singh 2012 the objective of this paper is to summarize recent developments in as mitigation and to discuss the benefits and challenges of different membrane technologies the emphasis here is on the findings of pilot scale studies using natural water 2 arsenic occurrence in groundwater arsenic concentrations in natural waters depend on a variety of parameters and the local geochemical conditions such as redox potential eh and ph campbell and nordstrom 2014 chakrabarti et al 2019 figoli et al 2020 the occurrence of as in groundwater is mostly naturally driven as a result of mobilization in natural environments ph 6 5 8 5 under both oxidizing and reducing conditions smedley et al 2002 inorganic as in the environment mainly occurs as pentavalent arsenate as v and trivalent arsenite as iii sharma and sohn 2008 hughes et al 2011 under oxidizing aerobic conditions at ph 4 10 the typical as v species are the monovalent and divalent oxyanionic forms h2aso4 and haso4 2 respectively while the uncharged as iii species h3aso3 occurs in anaerobic groundwater at a ph lower than 9 0 camacho et al 2011 herath et al 2016 furthermore there are more than 20 different species of organic as that can be released by biological activities especially in surface waters or through industrial pollution which can cause the highest exposure to as in the environment chakrabarti et al 2019 sarkar and paul 2016 smedley et al 2002 in general inorganic as shows more human toxicity than organic as which is usually found in lower concentrations both as iii and as v show also different toxicity and removability from water arsenite is considered to have higher toxicity and is generally more difficult to remove from water than as v usepa 2001 hughes et al 2011 the who recommended guideline value for total as in drinking water is set at 10 µg l who 2018 the main mechanisms involved in the release of inorganic as in groundwater are oxidative and reductive dissolution from as rich fe oxy hydroxides which is greatly influenced by the mineralogical characteristics of the aquifer and the physicochemical properties of the groundwater chakrabarti et al 2019 smedley et al 2002 as an example the groundwater in many parts of latin america is characterized by high as v concentrations which can be explained by as desorption under oxidizing conditions and high ph in the groundwater of extended areas of e g the chaco pampean plain in argentina and the adjacent plains of uruguay bundschuh et al 2010 2020 litter 2019 on the other hand the groundwater in west bengal india and bangladesh down to south east asia cambodia vietnam is typically anoxic and as iii is prevalent kar et al 2010 stopelli et al 2020 under these conditions high as iii concentration is typically associated with high dissolved fe2 and mn2 kar et al 2010 cañas kurz et al 2020a stopelli et al 2020 3 arsenic mitigation technologies various treatment technologies have been developed in the past decades that comprise different methods through precipitation adsorption membrane filtration oxidation and bioremediation however the magnitude of the global as problem has yet not changed merton and ahmad 2018 this is mostly a problem in developing countries and rural areas where it is difficult to ensure long term self sustaining and effective small scaled decentralized removal technologies generally the investment costs of the plants are too high making the specific costs for small scale applications price per unit product water unaffordable this is of particular interest in rural areas where a specific unit might be unaffordable at small scale e g for a single household but it could be a practical solution for semi centralized systems at community scale level and upwards to large scale plants bundschuh et al 2019 litter et al 2019 vanhalem et al 2009 2010 berg et al 2006 in order to successfully mitigate as in rural areas at semi centralized scale household water treatment and other water treatment at point of use pou such as in schools hospitals and other facilities should predominantly be simple low cost need low maintenance and use locally available materials when possible who 2011 treacy 2019 bitton 2014 today small scale as removal units based on filtration or adsorption mechanisms are widely used in affected countries like bangladesh and west bengal mostly because of its ease of use accessibility commercially available and low costs chatterjee et al 2017 these include bio sand filters bsf filter kanchan filter composite filters based on iron sono filter kolshi filter shapla and surokka filter coagulation flocculation processes in bucket treatment units btu and adsorption based principles which includes various types of adsorbent materials such as activated alumina media nirmal filter magc alcan filter nanomaterials e g iron oxides clay minerals zeolites activated carbon ac and biomass asere et al 2019 anastopoulos et al 2017 berg et al 2006 chatterjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 litter et al 2019 nowadays adsorption based on the use of natural locally available adsorbents has been accepted as a suitable removal technology particularly for developing regions because of its simple operation and lower investment costs one obstacle that adsorption processes face is that some of these materials show low adsorption rates and are highly dependent on the particular water quality so that they cannot always comply with the recommended who guideline value the major drawback in adsorption technologies is management of the exhausted adsorption media which either has to be disposed of safely or regenerated for safe disposal at landfill sites leaching tests e g toxicity characteristic leaching procedure have to be conducted to examine whether solid waste is hazardous or nonhazardous however these tests poorly simulate long term retention time of mature landfills where conditions are likely to favor mobilization of as ghosh et al 2004 this is of major concern in rural areas in developing countries particularly many regeneration processes of exhausted adsorption media employ hazardous chemicals such as acid and caustic solutions the most preferable adsorption technique today is the adsorption with iron oxides and its modified forms as it has shown good results in the removal of both as iii and as v however the presence of other competitive ions in water can affect the adsorption rate and needs further evaluation along with safe disposal of sludge produced mohan and pittman 2007 siddiqui and chaudhry 2017 asere et al 2019 4 overview of membrane separation in drinking water treatment membrane processes are becoming increasingly attractive due to their salient features which include i high removal efficiency ii operation stability reliability iii ease of up scaling and iv separation carried out under mild environmental conditions which makes them particularly interesting for small scale application including in rural areas voutchkov 2018 qasim et al 2019 up to now advanced technologies such as membrane filtration were generally associated with high costs and lack of robustness however significant progress has been made in recent years to develop low cost and durable membranes and desalination units ghaffour et al 2013 lee et al 2011 goh et al 2016 hailemariam et al 2020 membrane processes have been extensively studied for desalination but also for as removal from groundwater shih 2005 figoli et al 2010a figoli et al 2016 litter et al 2019 studies have focused most commonly on pressure driven processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in different set ups combinations and conditions shih 2005 uddin et al 2007 geucke et al 2009 figoli et al 2010a figoli et al 2010b sen et al 2010 akin et al 2011 trina dutta et al 2012 figoli et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 cricuoli and figoli 2019 yet membrane processes still suffer from some disadvantages such as i membrane fouling and scaling ii specific costs including membrane lifetime and iii safe disposal of concentrates particularly when handling as laden brines qasim et al 2019 the latter also applies to other technologies e g adsorbent based and all ex situ techniques the separation process in membranes is based on different principles from pore size exclusion to solubility diffusivity and charge and will depend on the membrane type used in pressure driven membrane processes a pressure gradient forces the treated water through the membrane while retaining particulates down to solutes depending on the permeability of the membrane material mulder 1996 since ro employs the densest membranes of all pressure driven technologies it shows the highest removal efficiency for as v and as iii of 95 and 50 90 respectively the mechanisms for salt rejection are based on the solution diffusion model that describes the retention of solutes by non porous membranes and the charge exclusion mechanisms for ionic solutes in thermally driven md phase change is used as rejection mechanism since the retention of non ionic as iii is highly dependent on environmental conditions ro permeate is able to comply with the who recommended maximum value of 10 µg l only in somecases while md shows the highest rejection figoli et al 2010a however mf and uf membranes that have pore sizes between 0 01 and 0 5 µm are not able to remove dissolved species velizarov et al 2004 shih 2005 therefore only combined processes of uf mf with e g coagulation flocculation adsorption or modified membrane materials e g micellar enhanced uf meuf allow removal of as species wickramasinghe et al 2004 beolchini et al 2007 gecol et al 2004 curko et al 2011 elcik et al 2013 hao et al 2018b for this reason uf mf processes for as removal are not further considered in this paper an overview of membrane based technologies used for as mitigation are listed in table 1 showing the type of membrane the removal mechanisms on which the as mitigation is based and the suitability for as iii and as v rejection in general membrane applications showcase several benefits over alternative mitigation technologies to overcome the following drawbacks i lower removal efficiency ii requirements for more multiple chemical treatments pre treatments and or post treatments iii higher complexity and more importantly iv use of media that needs to be regenerated and or disposed of safely some research on membrane processes for as removal has also focused on newer or alternative techniques to improve separation performance these include the modification of membrane surfaces and use of composite materials such as intercalated biofuntionalized nf membranes the use of ceramic membranes with iron oxides and the removal with hydrophobic kaolin membranes for md hubadillah et al 2019 sabbatini et al 2010 zeeshan et al 2020 another field of research has focused on combining membrane technologies with other processes such as adsorption to enhance removal performance for example by modification of the support layer with iron and aluminum oxides or ion exchange resins çermikli et al 2020 maghsodi and adlnasab 2019 zhang et al 2018 using new adsorptive materials or modifying existing ones and applying them to membrane surfaces has shown excellent ability to remove as v from aqueous media however the synthesis of these nanocomposite membranes and their application need further development these techniques are not considered further in this review 5 membrane processes for as removal based on synthetic water geucke et al 2009 studied the performance of the ro xle tw30 and sw30 in a small scale ro desalination unit the as iii values in permeate below the guideline value of 10 µg l were only achieved for a feed concentration of up to 350 µg l as v was rejected to a high level up to feed concentrations higher than 2000 µg l below10 µg l in permeate akin et al 2011 investigated the removal of as v and as iii 200 µg l respectively by using a ro unit with two different membranes swhr and bw 3 filmtectm they showed that rejection increased with higher operating pressure with a maximum at ph above 4 0 and 9 1 for as v and as iii respectively swhr membrane showed the highest removal with the lowest permeate concentrations achieved of 2 86 µg l total as when treating natural groundwater containing 50 μg l of as v and 12 μg l of as iii respectively key findings in the studies with denser ro membrane units proved the feasibility to reduce as both as v and as iii to safe levels many experimental studies revealed that nf membranes cannot significantly reject arsenite at neutral ph however denser nf membranes are able to largely retain arsenate sato et al 2002 saitua et al 2005 xia et al 2007 uddin et al 2007 tanne et al 2019 this is because the nf process is strongly dependent on charge exclusion effects or electrostatic repulsion caused by the interaction of the charged membrane and charged species such as as v whereas as iii is neutral in charge see section 2 also the use of pre oxidation steps with e g mno4 in combination to the nf membranes show promising results by enhancing the total as removal as well as serving as mitigation control against fouling sen et al 2010 depending on the ph value typical removal efficiency of nf membranes is in the range of 20 80 for as iii and 80 95 for as v figoli et al 2010a b for example uddin et al 2007 compared the performance of the loose dow nf200 mwco 200 da with the dense dow nf90 mwc 90 da in the range of 100 1000 µg l by use of synthetic water total as rejection for the nf90 was always significantly higher than for the nf200 the nf90 achieved highest rejection for arsenate 98 and was able to comply with the who guideline value of 10 µg l up to 1000 µg l feed concentration 10 bar ph 7 3 25 c however the removal of as iii under the same conditions was only 53 59 and hence the limit of 10 µg l could not be achieved in the entire feed range another way to enhance as removal is by using composite materials or coated membranes song et al 2015 studied a new composite hollow fiber nf membrane with a thin sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek active layer for as removal as v rejection of 98 to 95 were achieved for concentrations between 0 1 and 9 0 mg l respectively with a water permeability of 11 l m2h bar the authors also showed that increasing ph 9 and the operation pressure from 3 to 8 bar could increase overall rejection up to 99 6 for removal of 360 µg l feed treatment cost using the speek hollow fiber membranes were calculated to 0 15 us m³ in a preliminary techno economic assessment of a plant with 1000 m³ h besides pressure driven membrane processes thermally and electrically driven membrane processes are also used for drinking water production on a small scale naidu et al 2014 ma et al 2020 membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process based on vapor pressure difference maintained across a microporous hydrophobic membrane the diffusing vapor then condenses at the permeate membrane interface the salient advantage of md is the fact that solar heat can be used directly without employing high pressure pumps manna and pal 2016 due to the phase change liquid vapor md is able to reject as v as well as as iii to almost 100 qu et al 2009 yarlagadda et al 2011 figoli et al 2010a criscuoli and figoli 2019 criscuoli et al 2013 studied as removal by use of vacuum membrane distillation vmd with synthetic aqueous solutions up to 500 µg l as iii and as v respectively arsenic in the produced permeate was always below the detection limit of 10 µg l however permeate water flux was typically lower compared to nf or ro criscuoli et al 2013 in order to optimize the treatment system and achieve higher removals a system combining ro has been suggested for achieving process intensification in which only part of the ro permeate has to be treated by md to achieve as levels 10 µg l macedonio and drioli 2008 with a bench scale vmd unit dao et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii rejection was always stable at high level 98 5 without pre oxidation even when using synthetic brackish water solutions nacl concentration 10 g l in the electrodialysis ed process the electrical potential difference is used as the driving force to transport the ions through ion exchange membranes hereby cation and anion exchange membranes are placed alternately between the anode and cathode finally when a salt containing feed solution is fed to the electrodialysis unit one cell of the pair becomes depleted of ions while the adjacent cell becomes enriched in ions ed has many advantages for example it can tolerate feed waters with high chloride and sulfate concentrations it does not need additional chemicals when treating arsenate as v as in the treatment of as iii where a pre oxidation step is necessary and less applied potential is required for the system when turbulent flows are achieved within the stack through recirculation the salient feature of ed is that it only needs low pressure pumps compared to the high pressure pumps required for ro ed has therefore been employed for small scale drinking water production with renewable energies xu et al 2020 although most of these plants are mainly used for r d with water prices ranging from 5 8 to 16 us m³ garg 2019 mendoza et al 2014 studied the removal of as iii and as v from synthetic aqueous solutions by electrodialysis ed in batch experiments they used a commercial ed system supplied by shell kwong sir enterprise co ltd tainan city taiwan made of a single hydraulic and a single electrical stack with 20 cell pairs the cationic sks c and anionic sks a membranes had a dimension of 40 cm 20 cm and an effective area of 11 200 cm2 since ed can only remove charged ions samples were pre oxidized with naclo to transform as iii to as v they optimized the experimental conditions and were able to reduce 662 μg l as feed concentration in 45 minutes operating time to 4 µg l total as in the diluate stream corresponding to a 99 4 removal therefore they concluded that ed operated under recirculated batch conditions is an efficient process in removing as from contaminated water achieving as concentrations below the who recommended value of 10 μg l in general ed is a mature technology in brackish water desalination and has continuously showed its adaptability in numerous applications in a variety of arrangements including non conventional applications and coupled with other technologies in hybrid systems for the removal of as scarazzato et al 2020 ortega et al 2017 gonzalez et al 2017 lee et al 2011 furthermore the ed process can be reversed in electrodialysis reversal edr or reversed electrodialysis red here saline water seawater and the salinity gradient difference is used as the driving force to transport the ions through the stack resulting in an electric potential build up and the production of electrical current cañas kurz et al 2020b edr is a promising technology for extracting energy from salinity gradient but can be also used in as desalination technology and water treatment to minimize the influence of brine discharge from desalination technologies on the environment however there are still barriers to the realization of its commercial application and no applications have been reported for as removal to date tian et al 2020 a similar process to ed is membrane capacitive deionisation mcdi a novel electrosorptive process that uses porous carbon electrodes and ion exchange membranes iem to desalinate water by applying low voltages mcdi has been tested in as removal at laboratory and pilot scale with model water garrido et al 2008 fan et al 2016 cañas kurz et al 2020c showing removals of up to 90 for feeds of 50 200 µg l as v though the driving force here is the electric potential between the porous electrodes the use of iems in front of the electrodes enhances the desalination efficiency by avoiding co ion transportation to the electrodes thereby increasing its desalination capacity zhao et al 2013 another recent membrane technology for water treatment process that has been studied at laboratory scale for as removal is forward osmosis fo the principle of fo process relies on using the natural osmotic process to draw water across a semi permeable membrane from a saline feed water to a higher concentrated solution namely the draw solution ds qasim et al 2015 the driving force is naturally created by the difference in osmotic pressure between the ds and the feed solution fs this offers several advantages over conventional hydraulic pressure driven membrane processes e g ro such as lower energy requirements and reduced membrane fouling potential mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 in terms of drinking water production however it should be noted that since water is always drawn into a saline ds an additional separation step to recover the water from the ds is needed arsenic removal at laboratory scale with a commercial fo membrane supplier hti by use of artificial water solutions and two draw solutions glucose mgso4 was studied by mondal et al 2014 for an initial as v concentration of 500 μg l in a neutral ph range the removal efficiency was more than 98 mondal et al 2014 with increasing ph of the feed solution rejection increased and as in ds was below the who guideline value under optimized conditions a considerably lower rejection was observed for as iii 20 at ph 7 and only oxidation of as iii at neutral ph improved the rejection to 95 7 laboratory trials with a commercial fo membrane supplier porifera and as iii as well as as v model solutions as feed concentration up to 400 µg l were conducted by hoinkis et al 2016 the trials demonstrated that rejection of as v is distinctly better than of as iii however for feed concentrations above 50 µg l as iii the as level in the draw solution exceeded the guideline value of 10 µg l in such cases additional as separation will be necessary it should be noted that fo has to be operated as a combined process with e g ro or md to regenerate the draw solution that serves as a second barrier and further reduces as by improving the fo by use of a ph responsive charge switchable draw solution wu et al 2019 were able to achieve high removal efficiency for as v as well as as iii of 100 and 96 respectively overall there are a great number of published studies on as removal but only some include membrane technologies showing the potential for as mitigation the key findings on arsenate and arsenite removal by membrane applications are summarized in table 2 showing the advantages and disadvantages of different membrane technologies 6 pilot scale trials with natural water membrane processes have been successfully applied for the removal of as but as described in the previous section see section 5 mainly from model solutions in order to investigate the efficiency of these technologies in real contaminated sources where the removal efficiency can be evaluated under real conditions and with different water compositions where other species are also present pilot scale trials with natural water are still urgently required this section provides an extensive summary of pilot plants used for the treatment of as laden groundwater and surface water river 6 1 reverse osmosis walker et al 2008 studied the efficiency of single household ro units in lahontan valley nevada usa which is an area with high concentrations of as in this region groundwater is highly variable in composition and quality and ranges from a calcium bicarbonate type to saline sodium chloride type with low to high ec 251 8260 µs cm walker et al 2008 as a consequence of high as concentrations 4 4100 µg l as many residents of the area have installed household ro systems to produce drinking water the study indicated that on average 80 28 of the as was rejected in 30 of the households the ro units did not achieve the guideline value even after removals higher than 95 with a maximum as concentration measured of 180 µg l the reduced treatment efficiency was attributed to high as iii concentration in the feed water since in all sites where more than 50 was as iii as removal efficiency was less than 60 despite achieving high conductance removal the authors therefore emphasized the importance of as measurements in the treated water pilot trials at two sites near patna bihar india with a small scale ro desalination unit max capacity 70 and 105 l h permeate respectively were carried out over several months schmidt et al 2016 the total as concentration in feed in groundwater reductive aquifers amounted to 480 and 67 µg l for the two locations of bind toli and ramnagar respectively in order to avoid clogging of the membrane these authors applied up front oxidation by air passing through shower heads and a granular media filtration sand anthracite step fig 1 hereby the majority of dissolved iron 8 6 and 1 2 mg l was precipitated and separated as iron oxy hydroxide fe o oh in doing so a significant part of as could also be removed by co precipitation and filtration consequently the ro spiral wound filmtec sw 2540 unit served only as polisher to comply with the stringent guideline value of 10 µg l schmidt et al 2016 the total as removal efficiency in both locations achieved 99 and in most of the cases the as concentration in permeate was in compliance with the national indian standard of 10 µg l the ro unit made use of an energy recovery system in order to keep the energy consumption low 3 4 kwh m³ the recovery rate was kept at 10 and permeate flux ranged from 60 70 l h at 9 12 bar no significant membrane fouling occurred during the entire pilot period schmidt et al 2016 also conducted trials without upfront oxidation keeping the groundwater under anoxic conditions however the pilot trials under non aerated conditions could not comply with the national indian standard of 10 µg l which could be attributed to the lower rejection of as iii over as v moreover it was demonstrated that the use of a discharge well might be an option for safe disposal of the ro concentrate however schmidt et al 2016 concluded that this required further study in order to ensure safe disposal in the long term without causing subsurface as accumulation 6 2 nanofiltration oh et al 2000 studied a low pressure nf membrane process for treating as contaminated tube well water two wells with 410 µg l and 1100 µg l respectively in a rural area of bangladesh the system was coupled with a bicycle pumping system to supply water capacity up to 60 l h permeate even without domestic electricity supply two nf membrane types were employed es10 nitto denko spiral wound and hs5110 toyobo hollow fiber the well water was pre filtered by mf in advance of nf the permeate water flow of es10 was between 24 l h 3 bar and 49 l h 7 bar at recovery rates of 16 26 whereas hs5110 was run at 8 l h 3 bar and 20 l h 7 bar at recovery rates of 2 8 5 despite relatively high removal of total as between 86 and 95 the permeate water quality could not comply with the who guideline value although the as iii ratio was only ca 25 of the total as rejection with the es10 was 55 for arsenite and 99 for arsenate therefore the authors concluded that as rejection could be improved by oxidative pre treatment of the groundwater in order to increase the as v as iii ratio although the authors gave no cost estimation this study shows the feasibility of low cost simple nf units to separate as in rural areas sato et al 2002 compared as removal efficiency between as v and as iii spiked natural river water ec 415 µs cm in japan and synthetic water the natural total as and as iii concentration ranged from 5 to 50 µg l and from 1 to 10 µg l respectively in laboratory experiments 50 µg l as v 50 µg las iii was added to the feed water concentrations the study showed that the removal efficiency by all the membranes es 10 nitto japan ntr 7250 and ntr 729hf nitto japan was almost the same in both synthetic and natural groundwater all nf membranes could remove over 95 of as v with applied pressure of 3 11 bar furthermore more than 75 of as iii could be removed without any chemical additives using es 10 sato et al 2002 saitua et al 2011 conducted nf pilot trials on as removal from naturally contaminated groundwater in a city in la pampa province argentina the groundwater was characterized by alkalinity ph 8 5 high salt level total dissolved solids tds 1 29 g l and as v concentrations of 0 428 mg l in advance of nf treatment the groundwater was passed through a chlorination process and subsequently a spiral wound nf membrane with 1 5 m2 membrane area 192 nf 300 osmonics inc usa at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 7 bar the process showed an as rejection 95 and a total tds reduction of 53 the permeate flux increased from 10 l m2h at 2 bar to 76 l m2 h at 10 bar a nf pilot plant powered by solar pv was set up and operated with geothermal influenced groundwater total as 43 50 µg l as v 40 µg l by gonzalez et al 2019a in a rural community north of the active telica volcano in nicaragua the experiments were conducted with a dow nf270 2540 dow filmtec module with a total membrane area of 2 6 m2 the feedwater was pumped into the nf system using a submersible solar pump powered by three solar panels 3 260 w the findings showed that it was possible to achieve high as v rejection of 87 90 at higher temperature 43 c than previously demonstrated by the authors in tests with multi component solutions gonzalez et al 2019b a permeate flux of 16 30 l h m2 was obtained at low operating pressures of 1 2 1 8 bar and a recovery rate of 10 the permeate concentration around 5 µg l complied with the who guideline value at lower temperature 31 35 c permeate quality slightly improved to ca 3 µg l due to the low pressure applied the authors suggested that the nf filtration could also be conducted by a gravity driven system with a 12 m overhead tank gonzales et al 2019a the results of these authors show the feasibility of nf units for efficient treatment of as v for decentralized rural drinking water production with low energy consumption due to higher temperatures furthermore figoli et al 2020 studied the treatment of as laden groundwater from sila massif calabria italy with as concentrations of 59 435 µg l using two nf membranes from ge osmonics type hl and dk in a flat sheet pilot unit in the studied groundwater as v represented about 90 of total as total as concentration in permeate could be lowered with both membranes to below the guideline value of 10 µg l for groundwater with 59 118 µg l for groundwater containing higher as concentrations 435 µg l as the permeate achieved was close to 10 µg l ge osmonics hl showed the highest flux about 30 l m2 h at 3 bar and 110 130 l m2h at 15 bar in general literature results can be used as a database to identify possible suitable nf membranes to be applied in real contaminated sites but the authors emphasize the need to verify the performance of the nf membrane type with the specific water before implementation 6 3 membrane distillation pal and manna 2010 studied a solar driven membrane distillation direct contact membrane distillation dcmd unit for removal of as from a contaminated well in west bengal total as 0 3 0 6 mg l and with simulated as containing solutions fig 2 they used three different types of hydrophobic microporous flat sheet membranes ms3220 ptfe ms3020 ptfe and ms7020 pp all with nominal pore size of 0 22 µm supplied by membrane solutions shanghai china the experiments were run with feed temperatures between 30 and 61 c and distillate temperature of 21 23 c they concluded that dcmd had the potential of removing almost 100 as and ptfe membranes showed highest permeate water flux up to 50 kg m2 h a pilot scale flash vaporization membrane distillation fvmd unit was used by manna and pal 2016 to treat an as laden groundwater with 396 µg l total as from a well in west bengal india the flat sheet fvmd module consisted of ptfe membranes membrane solutions shanghai china nominal pore size 0 22 µm and was operated in dcmd configuration the temperature was raised by passing feed through a solar collector by a centrifugal pump the unit was operated with feed temperature between 40 and 71 c resulting in water flux of 7 37 kg m2h at distillate temperature of 21 c finally the unit was run for 40 h 5 days 8 h operation each and the permeate flux remained almost constant at around 36 kg m2 h while as removal of more than 99 was achieved in the distillate sample tomaszewska et al 2020 conducted a theoretical study on using low enthalpy geothermal energy sources for three water sources such as condensate of geothermal fluid after a power plant condenser cerro prieto mexico and shallow groundwater in momotombo area nicaragua and at lake poopó bolivia to drive the md process to obtain potable water and or water for crop irrigation the analysis was based on a mathematical model the modeling was based on dcmd and the use of ptfe membranes manufactured by membrane solutions shanghai it was concluded that md could be considered as a solution for obtaining water of good quality with high rejection of toxic solutes such as as permeate as 10 µg l 6 4 electrodialysis a solar powered ed pilot unit was used by gonzalez et al 2017 to treat brackish water tds 5482 mg l in northern chile with high concentration of as 2 04 mg l the ed unit was designed as a batch system using 20 pairs of cells and 200 cm2 membrane area each pca gmbh anionic pc sa and cationic pc sk membranes see fig 3 the ed unit was partially combined with upstream ion exchange and adsorption column filtration systems the ion exchanger granular ferric hydroxide was designed to remove hardness and partially remove as by adsorption arsenic species were not specified adsorption mechanisms for as v were proposed overall salt removal above 95 was achieved the plant was able to remove ca 94 as from the untreated feed and achieved removals of 99 9 as for the combined process energy was supplied by 4 pv panels total 1 kwp and energy was stored in two lifepo4 batteries connected in series capacity 1 15 kwh each the specific energy consumption sec varied from 2 16 to 2 86 kwh m3 for the ed process and 5 46 6 98 kwh m3 for the overall process fig 4 choi et al 2017 studied performance of an ed pilot using natural groundwater ec 317 531 µs cm 7 µg l as in south korea that was spiked up to 50 µg las v and 500 µg l mn ii they employed 14 21 and 42 cell pairs of cation and anion exchange membranes type cmx sb and amx sb neosepta astom with 528 cm2 area each the system with 14 cell pairs was able to achieve as and manganese removal efficiency in batch mode 85 min of 85 9 and 91 5 respectively using 42 cell pairs 2 22 m2 membrane area the treatment time was reduced to 26 min the total capacity of the pilot unit was 2 m3 d and sec of the system ranged between 1 07 and 1 20 kwh m3 an overview of the pilot scale trials for as removal with natural water is given in table 3 7 conceptual approach for membrane based groundwater treatment 7 1 arsenic treatment a schematic approach for the treatment of as in reducing and oxidizing environments is presented in figure 4 since the majority of the membrane processes studied showed low removal efficiency for as iii a pre oxidation to as v e g by h2o2 o3 mno2 is required in reducing aquatic environments this is the case when treating groundwater in regions like india bangladesh and southeast asia additionally anoxic water found in this regions is commonly associated with high fe2 and mn2 concentrations that can also be mitigated with an oxidation process luong et al 2018 palit et al 2019 stopelli et al 2020 natasha et al 2020 when dissolved fe2 is oxidized it forms sparingly soluble fe o oh which can be separated by filtration e g gmf due to co precipitation the fe o oh sludge also contains high as levels and must be disposed of safely consequently an interesting option for waste free pre oxidation is offered by subsurface as remediation sar by aeration rott and friedle 2000 luong et al 2018 the principle of sar is based on the adsorption and immobilization of as onto fe o oh by repeatedly infiltrating oxygen into the anoxic aquifer in contrast to most as remediation technologies sar appears to be a long term sustainable option for the removal of as from anoxic groundwater with the salient advantage of negligible toxic waste production van halem et al 2010 luong et al 2018 cañas kurz et al 2020a in order to comply with the stringent drinking water guideline value of 10 µg l ro or md can be employed for the removal of as iii residues for oxidizing environments dense nf or md can be employed directly after a conventional prefiltration step e g cartridge filter nf is a simple and robust treatment which can be operated at lower pressure compared to ro and md can make direct use of solar or geothermal heat nf and md also have the ability to remove other water contaminants such as fluoride nitrate or some micropollutants bouhadjar et al 2019 plattner et al 2017 hoinkis et al 2011 boubakri et al 2015 silva et al 2018 lipp et al 2010 7 2 techno economical assessment research has shown that the cost of desalination can be minimized by using solar and wind energy as an energy supply voutchkov 2018 desalination powered by renewable energies is attracting increased interest particularly for seawater and brackish groundwater desalination in remote areas including in developing countries subiela et al 2012 ali et al 2018 aminfard et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b caldera et al 2016 solar energy is abundant in many of these countries and costs for photovoltaics pv have dropped significantly in recent years worldwide however the current contribution of solar energy in desalination is still less than 0 02 ali et al 2018 to date as removal by small scale membrane units powered by renewable energy has not reached the market and is still a field of research and development r d schmidt et al 2016 therefore cost estimates for small membrane based desalination units for as removal are difficult since most publications on pilot scale trials do not include any cost evaluation however numerous solar powered pilot scale plants treating brackish water have been studied on a techno economic basis over the past three decades most of these studies were conducted on pv ro systems studies show that pv ro has the largest share of solar powered membrane based desalination at 40 followed by md and ed at16 and 9 respectively ali et al 2011 subiela et al 2012 they concluded that ro and ed are currently the most competitive solar desalination technologies in terms of water costs a summary of studies with techno economic including data on capacity of the plant in m³ d and of pv in kwp as well as sec or water costs is listed in table 4 efficient hybridization of membrane based water desalination systems can decrease the cost of water production and energy consumption garg 2019 garg and joshi 2014 operated nf and ro as well as a combined nf ro plant for brackish water treatment tds 0 5 4 5 g l and conducted a techno economic analysis they also compared their estimated costs with other membrane based desalination plants estimated costs of different small scale membrane based solar powered brackish water desalination plants are listed in table 5 they concluded that the major share of cost was the pv system which contributed more than 50 of overall cost garg and joshi 2014 pimentel da silva and sharqawy 2020 conducted a techno economic analysis of a low impact solar brackish water ro desalination system for remote communities in the brazilian semi arid region the model predicts that a 10 m3 day proposed system capacity can produce enough water for the basic water needs of 250 people at sec of 2 8 kwh m3 and costs ranging from 1 44 to 1 65 us m3 these costs depended on the particular region in semi arid brazil the land required for the solar pv panels 15 19 units of 320 wp panels ranges from 26 to 33 m2 a variety of pv powered ed desalination plants with capacities of 1 200 m3 d were studied from 1986 2013 fernandez gonzales et al 2015 summarized that sec of these plants varied between 0 4 and 4 kwh m3 at feed tds 0 6 to 5 g l with resulting water cost between 0 14 to 11 90 euro m3 the required pv power supply ranged between 0 103 and 65 kwp they concluded that ed presents lower sec values than ro for brackish water in its low salinity range that is below tds 5 g l therefore ed pv appears as a more sustainable alternative than ro pv because of the lower sec in that salinity range fernandez gonzalez et al 2015 there is a very large variation in the cost data given in the literature for md and only a few studies address commercial modules or even md at pilot scale the scarce implementation of md technology hampers a proper comparative economic analysis the thermal energy cost for an md system of gained output ratio gor gor 8 producing 10 m3 d is estimated from 4 40 to 5 20 us m3 gor is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the latent heat of evaporation of the produced water to the total heat supplied to the system however the construction and operation of desalination plants implies not only technical and economic considerations but also social and institutional issues which is of particular importance in rural areas of developing countries merton and ahmed 2018 give the following recommendations regarding the viability of decentralized as removal systems international aid and ngos should not only support investment in hardware but also focus more on transferring responsibilities to local stakeholders and increasing locally financed operation management maintenance and budget training this can be achieved by adapting and involving local stakeholders and the private sector hardware needed for the services should be as much as possible produced delivered maintained and replaced by local organizations with local staff governments should take more responsibility by explicitly integrating safe water service delivery in national policy authorities should be clear about their roles and tasks at all levels support systems of governments and development partners should include the issue of as in national policy the focus should be on determining social acceptance stimulating behavioral change and finding solutions to enhance the empowerment of local people since understanding behavior can contribute to the decision making and design of proper technological solutions 7 3 concentrate treatment and disposal since all membrane treatment processes generate liquid concentrate streams safe disposal is a major concern this is particularly challenging for small scale systems several options have been studied i iron precipitation with ferric salts ii adsorption media iii waste subsurface injection iv bioremediation nguyen et al 2014 reported that more than 90 of as could be removed from membrane concentrates through iron precipitation coagulation with ferric salts at fe as ratios of more than 10 high ionic strengths in membrane concentrate reduce the effect of as removal by the in situ formed hydrous ferric oxide hfo i e as removal does not increase considerably when ph drops from 8 to less than 6 5 which is only the case at low ionic strengths mondal et al 2013 suggested treating concentrates with zerovalent iron zvi in order to reduce the soluble as to metalloid as and thereby prevent secondary environmental pollution hao et al 2018a concluded that low cost iron based adsorbents which are nontoxic and easily accessible in large quantities offer promising results for as removal from water in this regard solid waste could also be used as adsorption media as a waste treat waste approach xu et al 2013 studied three different coagulants as sorbents for 29 µg l as v in a brackish water ro concentrate tds 10 86 g l ferric chloride ferric sulfate and iron sludge from a surface water treatment plant ferric chloride required less material and is therefore regarded as a potentially more cost effective method ferric sludge from water treatment plant was also efficient at removing as functioning as an adsorbent during column testing xu et al 2018 used filter backwash collected from the sand drying beds of a groundwater treatment plant as sorbent the solids were formed by addition of ferric chloride as coagulant the sludge was used to treat a ro concentrate from a brackish water treatment plant with tds 10 2 3 g l and as concentration of 63 11 µg l they summarized that such filter backwash is effective in removing as from desalination concentrate and has promising potential for as removal as a low cost sorbent the adsorption process can be also combined with membrane filtration such as uf or mf a pilot scale adsorption uf process equipped with submerged flat membranes and an aerated system for as removal from as spiked songhua river water china was studied by hao et al 2018b also a newly synthesized amino functionalized coffee cellulose adsorbent pei coffee which was derived from spent coffee powder was used for as removal the saturated adsorbent was regenerated by using an eluting agent of 10 wt nacl and 10 wt naoh the regenerated adsorbent still sustained a very high adsorption capacity after 6 cycles of adsorption regeneration process schmidt et al 2016 studied ro concentrate injection in an abandoned well in bihar india over a period of 42 days and noticed no significant accumulation of iron and as however they concluded that long term studies would have to be conducted in order to ensure safe long term disposal subsurface membrane technologies can overcome concentrate waste problems by in situ treatment and concentrate reinjection c2water 2019 however it is important to mention that a critical assessment of concentrate management should be carried out individually at each location a case study showcasing a subsurface ro with an additional discharge well for concentrate reinjection was demonstrated for the desalination of shallow groundwater 40 m³ day with tds 15 g l at the gidgelbarup farm at badgebup near katanni australia an evaluation was carried out to assess the local impact of the reinjection of residual fluids on the use of groundwater by local farms and the environment the subsurface technology ssd plant reported a water cost of up to 2 20 us m³ which was lower than the local water tariff 2 40 us m³ and the average cost of conventional ro desalination plants of 3 70 us m³ c2water 2019 hubadillah et al 2020 conducted integrated dcmd microalgae bioremediation for as removal from river water the as rich retentate of the dcmd process was bioremediated using botryococcus sp under outdoor conditions the findings show that botryococcus sp successfully grow in the retentate with a common microalgae growth pattern during the 20 days test period which indicates the potential and feasibility of this integrated system for the as retentate management hubadillah et al 2020 the advantages and disadvantages of concentrate treatment and disposal are summarized in table 6 the best option for concentrate disposal must be selected on a site specific basis depending on economic and environmental considerations nap 2004 however this issue should be further addressed in future research 8 conclusions finally it can be concluded membrane technologies particularly nf ro and md offer promising opportunities to treat as laden groundwater to obtain safe drinking water the salient advantages rely on the simplicity of the technology and the scalability down to very small modules for single household scale water treatment in general groundwater containing as v and as iii requires different treatment concepts according to hydrogeological conditions such as ph and redox potential eh as iii typically shows significant lower rejection and occurs together with dissolved iron in many anoxic groundwater sources in order to avoid membrane clogging by fe o oh advanced iron removal is recommended md has high removal for as iii in comparison to other membrane technologies for nf ro and ed an advance oxidation step to as v is necessary in order to comply with the stringent who recommended as limit of 10 µg l the safe disposal of occurring as rich sludge and liquid concentrates is still a main concern post treatment of concentrates aims for the reduction of waste quantity and or as concentration by e g adsorption techniques so that treated water is safe for non potable purposes e g washing processes treatment and reuse of concentrates are still important fields of research that should be further addressed in the future technologies like subsurface re injection and subsurface as removal offer solutions without the production of a brine declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
17060,various technologies are used for the treatment of arsenic as contaminated water but only a few seem to be suitable for small scale applications these are mostly used in rural communities where the access to potable water is the most vulnerable in this review paper the salient advantages and most notable challenges of membrane based technologies for the removal of arsenate as v and arsenite as iii are evaluated and systematically compared to alternative technologies such as e g adsorption a comparison of different scientific papers case studies and pilot trials is used to discuss the most important aspects when evaluating as mitigation technologies including the ability to comply with the stringent who drinking water guideline limit value of 10 µg l as and the safe disposal of produced as laden waste the use of renewable energies such as solar power in small scale 10 m³ day membrane applications is evaluated finally a conceptual approach for holistic as mitigation is proposed as an important approach to prevent exposure to as by providing a safe water supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic removal membrane technologies arsenate arsenite concentrate disposal 1 introduction arsenic as is a known human contaminant that poses potential serious cancerous and non cancerous health risks the most visible of which are skin diseases who 2018 arsenic uptake occurs predominantly from as rich groundwater sources used for drinking water supply and irrigation of crops entering the human food chain who 2018 it is currently estimated that as contaminated drinking water has affected the lives of over 200 million people in 105 countries worldwide shakoor et al 2017 bundschuh et al 2012 arsenic pollution is of great concern particularly in developing countries where resources for mitigation are limited making low cost and easy to use technologies an urgent necessity kabir and chowdhury 2017 litter et al 2010 however the low cost technologies available are not always capable of reducing as below the recommended value of 10 µg l for drinking water who 2017 ghosh nath et al 2019 and populations often consume water containing high amounts of as in addition most commonly used technologies need frequent cleaning and or replacement require the use of chemicals and may generate toxic sludge that requires further treatment and most importantly safe disposal these maintenance and operational efforts are usually not completed properly or not carried out at all which makes safeguarding operations mostly in rural areas and development countries very difficult jain and singh 2012 for the treatment of as questions therefore remain regarding the efficiency and applicability of these technologies technological and environmental aspects as well as the economic viability and social acceptance mostly in developing countries litter et al 2019 vanhalem et al 2009 jain and singh 2012 the objective of this paper is to summarize recent developments in as mitigation and to discuss the benefits and challenges of different membrane technologies the emphasis here is on the findings of pilot scale studies using natural water 2 arsenic occurrence in groundwater arsenic concentrations in natural waters depend on a variety of parameters and the local geochemical conditions such as redox potential eh and ph campbell and nordstrom 2014 chakrabarti et al 2019 figoli et al 2020 the occurrence of as in groundwater is mostly naturally driven as a result of mobilization in natural environments ph 6 5 8 5 under both oxidizing and reducing conditions smedley et al 2002 inorganic as in the environment mainly occurs as pentavalent arsenate as v and trivalent arsenite as iii sharma and sohn 2008 hughes et al 2011 under oxidizing aerobic conditions at ph 4 10 the typical as v species are the monovalent and divalent oxyanionic forms h2aso4 and haso4 2 respectively while the uncharged as iii species h3aso3 occurs in anaerobic groundwater at a ph lower than 9 0 camacho et al 2011 herath et al 2016 furthermore there are more than 20 different species of organic as that can be released by biological activities especially in surface waters or through industrial pollution which can cause the highest exposure to as in the environment chakrabarti et al 2019 sarkar and paul 2016 smedley et al 2002 in general inorganic as shows more human toxicity than organic as which is usually found in lower concentrations both as iii and as v show also different toxicity and removability from water arsenite is considered to have higher toxicity and is generally more difficult to remove from water than as v usepa 2001 hughes et al 2011 the who recommended guideline value for total as in drinking water is set at 10 µg l who 2018 the main mechanisms involved in the release of inorganic as in groundwater are oxidative and reductive dissolution from as rich fe oxy hydroxides which is greatly influenced by the mineralogical characteristics of the aquifer and the physicochemical properties of the groundwater chakrabarti et al 2019 smedley et al 2002 as an example the groundwater in many parts of latin america is characterized by high as v concentrations which can be explained by as desorption under oxidizing conditions and high ph in the groundwater of extended areas of e g the chaco pampean plain in argentina and the adjacent plains of uruguay bundschuh et al 2010 2020 litter 2019 on the other hand the groundwater in west bengal india and bangladesh down to south east asia cambodia vietnam is typically anoxic and as iii is prevalent kar et al 2010 stopelli et al 2020 under these conditions high as iii concentration is typically associated with high dissolved fe2 and mn2 kar et al 2010 cañas kurz et al 2020a stopelli et al 2020 3 arsenic mitigation technologies various treatment technologies have been developed in the past decades that comprise different methods through precipitation adsorption membrane filtration oxidation and bioremediation however the magnitude of the global as problem has yet not changed merton and ahmad 2018 this is mostly a problem in developing countries and rural areas where it is difficult to ensure long term self sustaining and effective small scaled decentralized removal technologies generally the investment costs of the plants are too high making the specific costs for small scale applications price per unit product water unaffordable this is of particular interest in rural areas where a specific unit might be unaffordable at small scale e g for a single household but it could be a practical solution for semi centralized systems at community scale level and upwards to large scale plants bundschuh et al 2019 litter et al 2019 vanhalem et al 2009 2010 berg et al 2006 in order to successfully mitigate as in rural areas at semi centralized scale household water treatment and other water treatment at point of use pou such as in schools hospitals and other facilities should predominantly be simple low cost need low maintenance and use locally available materials when possible who 2011 treacy 2019 bitton 2014 today small scale as removal units based on filtration or adsorption mechanisms are widely used in affected countries like bangladesh and west bengal mostly because of its ease of use accessibility commercially available and low costs chatterjee et al 2017 these include bio sand filters bsf filter kanchan filter composite filters based on iron sono filter kolshi filter shapla and surokka filter coagulation flocculation processes in bucket treatment units btu and adsorption based principles which includes various types of adsorbent materials such as activated alumina media nirmal filter magc alcan filter nanomaterials e g iron oxides clay minerals zeolites activated carbon ac and biomass asere et al 2019 anastopoulos et al 2017 berg et al 2006 chatterjee et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 litter et al 2019 nowadays adsorption based on the use of natural locally available adsorbents has been accepted as a suitable removal technology particularly for developing regions because of its simple operation and lower investment costs one obstacle that adsorption processes face is that some of these materials show low adsorption rates and are highly dependent on the particular water quality so that they cannot always comply with the recommended who guideline value the major drawback in adsorption technologies is management of the exhausted adsorption media which either has to be disposed of safely or regenerated for safe disposal at landfill sites leaching tests e g toxicity characteristic leaching procedure have to be conducted to examine whether solid waste is hazardous or nonhazardous however these tests poorly simulate long term retention time of mature landfills where conditions are likely to favor mobilization of as ghosh et al 2004 this is of major concern in rural areas in developing countries particularly many regeneration processes of exhausted adsorption media employ hazardous chemicals such as acid and caustic solutions the most preferable adsorption technique today is the adsorption with iron oxides and its modified forms as it has shown good results in the removal of both as iii and as v however the presence of other competitive ions in water can affect the adsorption rate and needs further evaluation along with safe disposal of sludge produced mohan and pittman 2007 siddiqui and chaudhry 2017 asere et al 2019 4 overview of membrane separation in drinking water treatment membrane processes are becoming increasingly attractive due to their salient features which include i high removal efficiency ii operation stability reliability iii ease of up scaling and iv separation carried out under mild environmental conditions which makes them particularly interesting for small scale application including in rural areas voutchkov 2018 qasim et al 2019 up to now advanced technologies such as membrane filtration were generally associated with high costs and lack of robustness however significant progress has been made in recent years to develop low cost and durable membranes and desalination units ghaffour et al 2013 lee et al 2011 goh et al 2016 hailemariam et al 2020 membrane processes have been extensively studied for desalination but also for as removal from groundwater shih 2005 figoli et al 2010a figoli et al 2016 litter et al 2019 studies have focused most commonly on pressure driven processes such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro in different set ups combinations and conditions shih 2005 uddin et al 2007 geucke et al 2009 figoli et al 2010a figoli et al 2010b sen et al 2010 akin et al 2011 trina dutta et al 2012 figoli et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 cricuoli and figoli 2019 yet membrane processes still suffer from some disadvantages such as i membrane fouling and scaling ii specific costs including membrane lifetime and iii safe disposal of concentrates particularly when handling as laden brines qasim et al 2019 the latter also applies to other technologies e g adsorbent based and all ex situ techniques the separation process in membranes is based on different principles from pore size exclusion to solubility diffusivity and charge and will depend on the membrane type used in pressure driven membrane processes a pressure gradient forces the treated water through the membrane while retaining particulates down to solutes depending on the permeability of the membrane material mulder 1996 since ro employs the densest membranes of all pressure driven technologies it shows the highest removal efficiency for as v and as iii of 95 and 50 90 respectively the mechanisms for salt rejection are based on the solution diffusion model that describes the retention of solutes by non porous membranes and the charge exclusion mechanisms for ionic solutes in thermally driven md phase change is used as rejection mechanism since the retention of non ionic as iii is highly dependent on environmental conditions ro permeate is able to comply with the who recommended maximum value of 10 µg l only in somecases while md shows the highest rejection figoli et al 2010a however mf and uf membranes that have pore sizes between 0 01 and 0 5 µm are not able to remove dissolved species velizarov et al 2004 shih 2005 therefore only combined processes of uf mf with e g coagulation flocculation adsorption or modified membrane materials e g micellar enhanced uf meuf allow removal of as species wickramasinghe et al 2004 beolchini et al 2007 gecol et al 2004 curko et al 2011 elcik et al 2013 hao et al 2018b for this reason uf mf processes for as removal are not further considered in this paper an overview of membrane based technologies used for as mitigation are listed in table 1 showing the type of membrane the removal mechanisms on which the as mitigation is based and the suitability for as iii and as v rejection in general membrane applications showcase several benefits over alternative mitigation technologies to overcome the following drawbacks i lower removal efficiency ii requirements for more multiple chemical treatments pre treatments and or post treatments iii higher complexity and more importantly iv use of media that needs to be regenerated and or disposed of safely some research on membrane processes for as removal has also focused on newer or alternative techniques to improve separation performance these include the modification of membrane surfaces and use of composite materials such as intercalated biofuntionalized nf membranes the use of ceramic membranes with iron oxides and the removal with hydrophobic kaolin membranes for md hubadillah et al 2019 sabbatini et al 2010 zeeshan et al 2020 another field of research has focused on combining membrane technologies with other processes such as adsorption to enhance removal performance for example by modification of the support layer with iron and aluminum oxides or ion exchange resins çermikli et al 2020 maghsodi and adlnasab 2019 zhang et al 2018 using new adsorptive materials or modifying existing ones and applying them to membrane surfaces has shown excellent ability to remove as v from aqueous media however the synthesis of these nanocomposite membranes and their application need further development these techniques are not considered further in this review 5 membrane processes for as removal based on synthetic water geucke et al 2009 studied the performance of the ro xle tw30 and sw30 in a small scale ro desalination unit the as iii values in permeate below the guideline value of 10 µg l were only achieved for a feed concentration of up to 350 µg l as v was rejected to a high level up to feed concentrations higher than 2000 µg l below10 µg l in permeate akin et al 2011 investigated the removal of as v and as iii 200 µg l respectively by using a ro unit with two different membranes swhr and bw 3 filmtectm they showed that rejection increased with higher operating pressure with a maximum at ph above 4 0 and 9 1 for as v and as iii respectively swhr membrane showed the highest removal with the lowest permeate concentrations achieved of 2 86 µg l total as when treating natural groundwater containing 50 μg l of as v and 12 μg l of as iii respectively key findings in the studies with denser ro membrane units proved the feasibility to reduce as both as v and as iii to safe levels many experimental studies revealed that nf membranes cannot significantly reject arsenite at neutral ph however denser nf membranes are able to largely retain arsenate sato et al 2002 saitua et al 2005 xia et al 2007 uddin et al 2007 tanne et al 2019 this is because the nf process is strongly dependent on charge exclusion effects or electrostatic repulsion caused by the interaction of the charged membrane and charged species such as as v whereas as iii is neutral in charge see section 2 also the use of pre oxidation steps with e g mno4 in combination to the nf membranes show promising results by enhancing the total as removal as well as serving as mitigation control against fouling sen et al 2010 depending on the ph value typical removal efficiency of nf membranes is in the range of 20 80 for as iii and 80 95 for as v figoli et al 2010a b for example uddin et al 2007 compared the performance of the loose dow nf200 mwco 200 da with the dense dow nf90 mwc 90 da in the range of 100 1000 µg l by use of synthetic water total as rejection for the nf90 was always significantly higher than for the nf200 the nf90 achieved highest rejection for arsenate 98 and was able to comply with the who guideline value of 10 µg l up to 1000 µg l feed concentration 10 bar ph 7 3 25 c however the removal of as iii under the same conditions was only 53 59 and hence the limit of 10 µg l could not be achieved in the entire feed range another way to enhance as removal is by using composite materials or coated membranes song et al 2015 studied a new composite hollow fiber nf membrane with a thin sulfonated poly ether ether ketone speek active layer for as removal as v rejection of 98 to 95 were achieved for concentrations between 0 1 and 9 0 mg l respectively with a water permeability of 11 l m2h bar the authors also showed that increasing ph 9 and the operation pressure from 3 to 8 bar could increase overall rejection up to 99 6 for removal of 360 µg l feed treatment cost using the speek hollow fiber membranes were calculated to 0 15 us m³ in a preliminary techno economic assessment of a plant with 1000 m³ h besides pressure driven membrane processes thermally and electrically driven membrane processes are also used for drinking water production on a small scale naidu et al 2014 ma et al 2020 membrane distillation md is a thermally driven process based on vapor pressure difference maintained across a microporous hydrophobic membrane the diffusing vapor then condenses at the permeate membrane interface the salient advantage of md is the fact that solar heat can be used directly without employing high pressure pumps manna and pal 2016 due to the phase change liquid vapor md is able to reject as v as well as as iii to almost 100 qu et al 2009 yarlagadda et al 2011 figoli et al 2010a criscuoli and figoli 2019 criscuoli et al 2013 studied as removal by use of vacuum membrane distillation vmd with synthetic aqueous solutions up to 500 µg l as iii and as v respectively arsenic in the produced permeate was always below the detection limit of 10 µg l however permeate water flux was typically lower compared to nf or ro criscuoli et al 2013 in order to optimize the treatment system and achieve higher removals a system combining ro has been suggested for achieving process intensification in which only part of the ro permeate has to be treated by md to achieve as levels 10 µg l macedonio and drioli 2008 with a bench scale vmd unit dao et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii rejection was always stable at high level 98 5 without pre oxidation even when using synthetic brackish water solutions nacl concentration 10 g l in the electrodialysis ed process the electrical potential difference is used as the driving force to transport the ions through ion exchange membranes hereby cation and anion exchange membranes are placed alternately between the anode and cathode finally when a salt containing feed solution is fed to the electrodialysis unit one cell of the pair becomes depleted of ions while the adjacent cell becomes enriched in ions ed has many advantages for example it can tolerate feed waters with high chloride and sulfate concentrations it does not need additional chemicals when treating arsenate as v as in the treatment of as iii where a pre oxidation step is necessary and less applied potential is required for the system when turbulent flows are achieved within the stack through recirculation the salient feature of ed is that it only needs low pressure pumps compared to the high pressure pumps required for ro ed has therefore been employed for small scale drinking water production with renewable energies xu et al 2020 although most of these plants are mainly used for r d with water prices ranging from 5 8 to 16 us m³ garg 2019 mendoza et al 2014 studied the removal of as iii and as v from synthetic aqueous solutions by electrodialysis ed in batch experiments they used a commercial ed system supplied by shell kwong sir enterprise co ltd tainan city taiwan made of a single hydraulic and a single electrical stack with 20 cell pairs the cationic sks c and anionic sks a membranes had a dimension of 40 cm 20 cm and an effective area of 11 200 cm2 since ed can only remove charged ions samples were pre oxidized with naclo to transform as iii to as v they optimized the experimental conditions and were able to reduce 662 μg l as feed concentration in 45 minutes operating time to 4 µg l total as in the diluate stream corresponding to a 99 4 removal therefore they concluded that ed operated under recirculated batch conditions is an efficient process in removing as from contaminated water achieving as concentrations below the who recommended value of 10 μg l in general ed is a mature technology in brackish water desalination and has continuously showed its adaptability in numerous applications in a variety of arrangements including non conventional applications and coupled with other technologies in hybrid systems for the removal of as scarazzato et al 2020 ortega et al 2017 gonzalez et al 2017 lee et al 2011 furthermore the ed process can be reversed in electrodialysis reversal edr or reversed electrodialysis red here saline water seawater and the salinity gradient difference is used as the driving force to transport the ions through the stack resulting in an electric potential build up and the production of electrical current cañas kurz et al 2020b edr is a promising technology for extracting energy from salinity gradient but can be also used in as desalination technology and water treatment to minimize the influence of brine discharge from desalination technologies on the environment however there are still barriers to the realization of its commercial application and no applications have been reported for as removal to date tian et al 2020 a similar process to ed is membrane capacitive deionisation mcdi a novel electrosorptive process that uses porous carbon electrodes and ion exchange membranes iem to desalinate water by applying low voltages mcdi has been tested in as removal at laboratory and pilot scale with model water garrido et al 2008 fan et al 2016 cañas kurz et al 2020c showing removals of up to 90 for feeds of 50 200 µg l as v though the driving force here is the electric potential between the porous electrodes the use of iems in front of the electrodes enhances the desalination efficiency by avoiding co ion transportation to the electrodes thereby increasing its desalination capacity zhao et al 2013 another recent membrane technology for water treatment process that has been studied at laboratory scale for as removal is forward osmosis fo the principle of fo process relies on using the natural osmotic process to draw water across a semi permeable membrane from a saline feed water to a higher concentrated solution namely the draw solution ds qasim et al 2015 the driving force is naturally created by the difference in osmotic pressure between the ds and the feed solution fs this offers several advantages over conventional hydraulic pressure driven membrane processes e g ro such as lower energy requirements and reduced membrane fouling potential mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 in terms of drinking water production however it should be noted that since water is always drawn into a saline ds an additional separation step to recover the water from the ds is needed arsenic removal at laboratory scale with a commercial fo membrane supplier hti by use of artificial water solutions and two draw solutions glucose mgso4 was studied by mondal et al 2014 for an initial as v concentration of 500 μg l in a neutral ph range the removal efficiency was more than 98 mondal et al 2014 with increasing ph of the feed solution rejection increased and as in ds was below the who guideline value under optimized conditions a considerably lower rejection was observed for as iii 20 at ph 7 and only oxidation of as iii at neutral ph improved the rejection to 95 7 laboratory trials with a commercial fo membrane supplier porifera and as iii as well as as v model solutions as feed concentration up to 400 µg l were conducted by hoinkis et al 2016 the trials demonstrated that rejection of as v is distinctly better than of as iii however for feed concentrations above 50 µg l as iii the as level in the draw solution exceeded the guideline value of 10 µg l in such cases additional as separation will be necessary it should be noted that fo has to be operated as a combined process with e g ro or md to regenerate the draw solution that serves as a second barrier and further reduces as by improving the fo by use of a ph responsive charge switchable draw solution wu et al 2019 were able to achieve high removal efficiency for as v as well as as iii of 100 and 96 respectively overall there are a great number of published studies on as removal but only some include membrane technologies showing the potential for as mitigation the key findings on arsenate and arsenite removal by membrane applications are summarized in table 2 showing the advantages and disadvantages of different membrane technologies 6 pilot scale trials with natural water membrane processes have been successfully applied for the removal of as but as described in the previous section see section 5 mainly from model solutions in order to investigate the efficiency of these technologies in real contaminated sources where the removal efficiency can be evaluated under real conditions and with different water compositions where other species are also present pilot scale trials with natural water are still urgently required this section provides an extensive summary of pilot plants used for the treatment of as laden groundwater and surface water river 6 1 reverse osmosis walker et al 2008 studied the efficiency of single household ro units in lahontan valley nevada usa which is an area with high concentrations of as in this region groundwater is highly variable in composition and quality and ranges from a calcium bicarbonate type to saline sodium chloride type with low to high ec 251 8260 µs cm walker et al 2008 as a consequence of high as concentrations 4 4100 µg l as many residents of the area have installed household ro systems to produce drinking water the study indicated that on average 80 28 of the as was rejected in 30 of the households the ro units did not achieve the guideline value even after removals higher than 95 with a maximum as concentration measured of 180 µg l the reduced treatment efficiency was attributed to high as iii concentration in the feed water since in all sites where more than 50 was as iii as removal efficiency was less than 60 despite achieving high conductance removal the authors therefore emphasized the importance of as measurements in the treated water pilot trials at two sites near patna bihar india with a small scale ro desalination unit max capacity 70 and 105 l h permeate respectively were carried out over several months schmidt et al 2016 the total as concentration in feed in groundwater reductive aquifers amounted to 480 and 67 µg l for the two locations of bind toli and ramnagar respectively in order to avoid clogging of the membrane these authors applied up front oxidation by air passing through shower heads and a granular media filtration sand anthracite step fig 1 hereby the majority of dissolved iron 8 6 and 1 2 mg l was precipitated and separated as iron oxy hydroxide fe o oh in doing so a significant part of as could also be removed by co precipitation and filtration consequently the ro spiral wound filmtec sw 2540 unit served only as polisher to comply with the stringent guideline value of 10 µg l schmidt et al 2016 the total as removal efficiency in both locations achieved 99 and in most of the cases the as concentration in permeate was in compliance with the national indian standard of 10 µg l the ro unit made use of an energy recovery system in order to keep the energy consumption low 3 4 kwh m³ the recovery rate was kept at 10 and permeate flux ranged from 60 70 l h at 9 12 bar no significant membrane fouling occurred during the entire pilot period schmidt et al 2016 also conducted trials without upfront oxidation keeping the groundwater under anoxic conditions however the pilot trials under non aerated conditions could not comply with the national indian standard of 10 µg l which could be attributed to the lower rejection of as iii over as v moreover it was demonstrated that the use of a discharge well might be an option for safe disposal of the ro concentrate however schmidt et al 2016 concluded that this required further study in order to ensure safe disposal in the long term without causing subsurface as accumulation 6 2 nanofiltration oh et al 2000 studied a low pressure nf membrane process for treating as contaminated tube well water two wells with 410 µg l and 1100 µg l respectively in a rural area of bangladesh the system was coupled with a bicycle pumping system to supply water capacity up to 60 l h permeate even without domestic electricity supply two nf membrane types were employed es10 nitto denko spiral wound and hs5110 toyobo hollow fiber the well water was pre filtered by mf in advance of nf the permeate water flow of es10 was between 24 l h 3 bar and 49 l h 7 bar at recovery rates of 16 26 whereas hs5110 was run at 8 l h 3 bar and 20 l h 7 bar at recovery rates of 2 8 5 despite relatively high removal of total as between 86 and 95 the permeate water quality could not comply with the who guideline value although the as iii ratio was only ca 25 of the total as rejection with the es10 was 55 for arsenite and 99 for arsenate therefore the authors concluded that as rejection could be improved by oxidative pre treatment of the groundwater in order to increase the as v as iii ratio although the authors gave no cost estimation this study shows the feasibility of low cost simple nf units to separate as in rural areas sato et al 2002 compared as removal efficiency between as v and as iii spiked natural river water ec 415 µs cm in japan and synthetic water the natural total as and as iii concentration ranged from 5 to 50 µg l and from 1 to 10 µg l respectively in laboratory experiments 50 µg l as v 50 µg las iii was added to the feed water concentrations the study showed that the removal efficiency by all the membranes es 10 nitto japan ntr 7250 and ntr 729hf nitto japan was almost the same in both synthetic and natural groundwater all nf membranes could remove over 95 of as v with applied pressure of 3 11 bar furthermore more than 75 of as iii could be removed without any chemical additives using es 10 sato et al 2002 saitua et al 2011 conducted nf pilot trials on as removal from naturally contaminated groundwater in a city in la pampa province argentina the groundwater was characterized by alkalinity ph 8 5 high salt level total dissolved solids tds 1 29 g l and as v concentrations of 0 428 mg l in advance of nf treatment the groundwater was passed through a chlorination process and subsequently a spiral wound nf membrane with 1 5 m2 membrane area 192 nf 300 osmonics inc usa at a transmembrane pressure tmp of 7 bar the process showed an as rejection 95 and a total tds reduction of 53 the permeate flux increased from 10 l m2h at 2 bar to 76 l m2 h at 10 bar a nf pilot plant powered by solar pv was set up and operated with geothermal influenced groundwater total as 43 50 µg l as v 40 µg l by gonzalez et al 2019a in a rural community north of the active telica volcano in nicaragua the experiments were conducted with a dow nf270 2540 dow filmtec module with a total membrane area of 2 6 m2 the feedwater was pumped into the nf system using a submersible solar pump powered by three solar panels 3 260 w the findings showed that it was possible to achieve high as v rejection of 87 90 at higher temperature 43 c than previously demonstrated by the authors in tests with multi component solutions gonzalez et al 2019b a permeate flux of 16 30 l h m2 was obtained at low operating pressures of 1 2 1 8 bar and a recovery rate of 10 the permeate concentration around 5 µg l complied with the who guideline value at lower temperature 31 35 c permeate quality slightly improved to ca 3 µg l due to the low pressure applied the authors suggested that the nf filtration could also be conducted by a gravity driven system with a 12 m overhead tank gonzales et al 2019a the results of these authors show the feasibility of nf units for efficient treatment of as v for decentralized rural drinking water production with low energy consumption due to higher temperatures furthermore figoli et al 2020 studied the treatment of as laden groundwater from sila massif calabria italy with as concentrations of 59 435 µg l using two nf membranes from ge osmonics type hl and dk in a flat sheet pilot unit in the studied groundwater as v represented about 90 of total as total as concentration in permeate could be lowered with both membranes to below the guideline value of 10 µg l for groundwater with 59 118 µg l for groundwater containing higher as concentrations 435 µg l as the permeate achieved was close to 10 µg l ge osmonics hl showed the highest flux about 30 l m2 h at 3 bar and 110 130 l m2h at 15 bar in general literature results can be used as a database to identify possible suitable nf membranes to be applied in real contaminated sites but the authors emphasize the need to verify the performance of the nf membrane type with the specific water before implementation 6 3 membrane distillation pal and manna 2010 studied a solar driven membrane distillation direct contact membrane distillation dcmd unit for removal of as from a contaminated well in west bengal total as 0 3 0 6 mg l and with simulated as containing solutions fig 2 they used three different types of hydrophobic microporous flat sheet membranes ms3220 ptfe ms3020 ptfe and ms7020 pp all with nominal pore size of 0 22 µm supplied by membrane solutions shanghai china the experiments were run with feed temperatures between 30 and 61 c and distillate temperature of 21 23 c they concluded that dcmd had the potential of removing almost 100 as and ptfe membranes showed highest permeate water flux up to 50 kg m2 h a pilot scale flash vaporization membrane distillation fvmd unit was used by manna and pal 2016 to treat an as laden groundwater with 396 µg l total as from a well in west bengal india the flat sheet fvmd module consisted of ptfe membranes membrane solutions shanghai china nominal pore size 0 22 µm and was operated in dcmd configuration the temperature was raised by passing feed through a solar collector by a centrifugal pump the unit was operated with feed temperature between 40 and 71 c resulting in water flux of 7 37 kg m2h at distillate temperature of 21 c finally the unit was run for 40 h 5 days 8 h operation each and the permeate flux remained almost constant at around 36 kg m2 h while as removal of more than 99 was achieved in the distillate sample tomaszewska et al 2020 conducted a theoretical study on using low enthalpy geothermal energy sources for three water sources such as condensate of geothermal fluid after a power plant condenser cerro prieto mexico and shallow groundwater in momotombo area nicaragua and at lake poopó bolivia to drive the md process to obtain potable water and or water for crop irrigation the analysis was based on a mathematical model the modeling was based on dcmd and the use of ptfe membranes manufactured by membrane solutions shanghai it was concluded that md could be considered as a solution for obtaining water of good quality with high rejection of toxic solutes such as as permeate as 10 µg l 6 4 electrodialysis a solar powered ed pilot unit was used by gonzalez et al 2017 to treat brackish water tds 5482 mg l in northern chile with high concentration of as 2 04 mg l the ed unit was designed as a batch system using 20 pairs of cells and 200 cm2 membrane area each pca gmbh anionic pc sa and cationic pc sk membranes see fig 3 the ed unit was partially combined with upstream ion exchange and adsorption column filtration systems the ion exchanger granular ferric hydroxide was designed to remove hardness and partially remove as by adsorption arsenic species were not specified adsorption mechanisms for as v were proposed overall salt removal above 95 was achieved the plant was able to remove ca 94 as from the untreated feed and achieved removals of 99 9 as for the combined process energy was supplied by 4 pv panels total 1 kwp and energy was stored in two lifepo4 batteries connected in series capacity 1 15 kwh each the specific energy consumption sec varied from 2 16 to 2 86 kwh m3 for the ed process and 5 46 6 98 kwh m3 for the overall process fig 4 choi et al 2017 studied performance of an ed pilot using natural groundwater ec 317 531 µs cm 7 µg l as in south korea that was spiked up to 50 µg las v and 500 µg l mn ii they employed 14 21 and 42 cell pairs of cation and anion exchange membranes type cmx sb and amx sb neosepta astom with 528 cm2 area each the system with 14 cell pairs was able to achieve as and manganese removal efficiency in batch mode 85 min of 85 9 and 91 5 respectively using 42 cell pairs 2 22 m2 membrane area the treatment time was reduced to 26 min the total capacity of the pilot unit was 2 m3 d and sec of the system ranged between 1 07 and 1 20 kwh m3 an overview of the pilot scale trials for as removal with natural water is given in table 3 7 conceptual approach for membrane based groundwater treatment 7 1 arsenic treatment a schematic approach for the treatment of as in reducing and oxidizing environments is presented in figure 4 since the majority of the membrane processes studied showed low removal efficiency for as iii a pre oxidation to as v e g by h2o2 o3 mno2 is required in reducing aquatic environments this is the case when treating groundwater in regions like india bangladesh and southeast asia additionally anoxic water found in this regions is commonly associated with high fe2 and mn2 concentrations that can also be mitigated with an oxidation process luong et al 2018 palit et al 2019 stopelli et al 2020 natasha et al 2020 when dissolved fe2 is oxidized it forms sparingly soluble fe o oh which can be separated by filtration e g gmf due to co precipitation the fe o oh sludge also contains high as levels and must be disposed of safely consequently an interesting option for waste free pre oxidation is offered by subsurface as remediation sar by aeration rott and friedle 2000 luong et al 2018 the principle of sar is based on the adsorption and immobilization of as onto fe o oh by repeatedly infiltrating oxygen into the anoxic aquifer in contrast to most as remediation technologies sar appears to be a long term sustainable option for the removal of as from anoxic groundwater with the salient advantage of negligible toxic waste production van halem et al 2010 luong et al 2018 cañas kurz et al 2020a in order to comply with the stringent drinking water guideline value of 10 µg l ro or md can be employed for the removal of as iii residues for oxidizing environments dense nf or md can be employed directly after a conventional prefiltration step e g cartridge filter nf is a simple and robust treatment which can be operated at lower pressure compared to ro and md can make direct use of solar or geothermal heat nf and md also have the ability to remove other water contaminants such as fluoride nitrate or some micropollutants bouhadjar et al 2019 plattner et al 2017 hoinkis et al 2011 boubakri et al 2015 silva et al 2018 lipp et al 2010 7 2 techno economical assessment research has shown that the cost of desalination can be minimized by using solar and wind energy as an energy supply voutchkov 2018 desalination powered by renewable energies is attracting increased interest particularly for seawater and brackish groundwater desalination in remote areas including in developing countries subiela et al 2012 ali et al 2018 aminfard et al 2019 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b caldera et al 2016 solar energy is abundant in many of these countries and costs for photovoltaics pv have dropped significantly in recent years worldwide however the current contribution of solar energy in desalination is still less than 0 02 ali et al 2018 to date as removal by small scale membrane units powered by renewable energy has not reached the market and is still a field of research and development r d schmidt et al 2016 therefore cost estimates for small membrane based desalination units for as removal are difficult since most publications on pilot scale trials do not include any cost evaluation however numerous solar powered pilot scale plants treating brackish water have been studied on a techno economic basis over the past three decades most of these studies were conducted on pv ro systems studies show that pv ro has the largest share of solar powered membrane based desalination at 40 followed by md and ed at16 and 9 respectively ali et al 2011 subiela et al 2012 they concluded that ro and ed are currently the most competitive solar desalination technologies in terms of water costs a summary of studies with techno economic including data on capacity of the plant in m³ d and of pv in kwp as well as sec or water costs is listed in table 4 efficient hybridization of membrane based water desalination systems can decrease the cost of water production and energy consumption garg 2019 garg and joshi 2014 operated nf and ro as well as a combined nf ro plant for brackish water treatment tds 0 5 4 5 g l and conducted a techno economic analysis they also compared their estimated costs with other membrane based desalination plants estimated costs of different small scale membrane based solar powered brackish water desalination plants are listed in table 5 they concluded that the major share of cost was the pv system which contributed more than 50 of overall cost garg and joshi 2014 pimentel da silva and sharqawy 2020 conducted a techno economic analysis of a low impact solar brackish water ro desalination system for remote communities in the brazilian semi arid region the model predicts that a 10 m3 day proposed system capacity can produce enough water for the basic water needs of 250 people at sec of 2 8 kwh m3 and costs ranging from 1 44 to 1 65 us m3 these costs depended on the particular region in semi arid brazil the land required for the solar pv panels 15 19 units of 320 wp panels ranges from 26 to 33 m2 a variety of pv powered ed desalination plants with capacities of 1 200 m3 d were studied from 1986 2013 fernandez gonzales et al 2015 summarized that sec of these plants varied between 0 4 and 4 kwh m3 at feed tds 0 6 to 5 g l with resulting water cost between 0 14 to 11 90 euro m3 the required pv power supply ranged between 0 103 and 65 kwp they concluded that ed presents lower sec values than ro for brackish water in its low salinity range that is below tds 5 g l therefore ed pv appears as a more sustainable alternative than ro pv because of the lower sec in that salinity range fernandez gonzalez et al 2015 there is a very large variation in the cost data given in the literature for md and only a few studies address commercial modules or even md at pilot scale the scarce implementation of md technology hampers a proper comparative economic analysis the thermal energy cost for an md system of gained output ratio gor gor 8 producing 10 m3 d is estimated from 4 40 to 5 20 us m3 gor is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the latent heat of evaporation of the produced water to the total heat supplied to the system however the construction and operation of desalination plants implies not only technical and economic considerations but also social and institutional issues which is of particular importance in rural areas of developing countries merton and ahmed 2018 give the following recommendations regarding the viability of decentralized as removal systems international aid and ngos should not only support investment in hardware but also focus more on transferring responsibilities to local stakeholders and increasing locally financed operation management maintenance and budget training this can be achieved by adapting and involving local stakeholders and the private sector hardware needed for the services should be as much as possible produced delivered maintained and replaced by local organizations with local staff governments should take more responsibility by explicitly integrating safe water service delivery in national policy authorities should be clear about their roles and tasks at all levels support systems of governments and development partners should include the issue of as in national policy the focus should be on determining social acceptance stimulating behavioral change and finding solutions to enhance the empowerment of local people since understanding behavior can contribute to the decision making and design of proper technological solutions 7 3 concentrate treatment and disposal since all membrane treatment processes generate liquid concentrate streams safe disposal is a major concern this is particularly challenging for small scale systems several options have been studied i iron precipitation with ferric salts ii adsorption media iii waste subsurface injection iv bioremediation nguyen et al 2014 reported that more than 90 of as could be removed from membrane concentrates through iron precipitation coagulation with ferric salts at fe as ratios of more than 10 high ionic strengths in membrane concentrate reduce the effect of as removal by the in situ formed hydrous ferric oxide hfo i e as removal does not increase considerably when ph drops from 8 to less than 6 5 which is only the case at low ionic strengths mondal et al 2013 suggested treating concentrates with zerovalent iron zvi in order to reduce the soluble as to metalloid as and thereby prevent secondary environmental pollution hao et al 2018a concluded that low cost iron based adsorbents which are nontoxic and easily accessible in large quantities offer promising results for as removal from water in this regard solid waste could also be used as adsorption media as a waste treat waste approach xu et al 2013 studied three different coagulants as sorbents for 29 µg l as v in a brackish water ro concentrate tds 10 86 g l ferric chloride ferric sulfate and iron sludge from a surface water treatment plant ferric chloride required less material and is therefore regarded as a potentially more cost effective method ferric sludge from water treatment plant was also efficient at removing as functioning as an adsorbent during column testing xu et al 2018 used filter backwash collected from the sand drying beds of a groundwater treatment plant as sorbent the solids were formed by addition of ferric chloride as coagulant the sludge was used to treat a ro concentrate from a brackish water treatment plant with tds 10 2 3 g l and as concentration of 63 11 µg l they summarized that such filter backwash is effective in removing as from desalination concentrate and has promising potential for as removal as a low cost sorbent the adsorption process can be also combined with membrane filtration such as uf or mf a pilot scale adsorption uf process equipped with submerged flat membranes and an aerated system for as removal from as spiked songhua river water china was studied by hao et al 2018b also a newly synthesized amino functionalized coffee cellulose adsorbent pei coffee which was derived from spent coffee powder was used for as removal the saturated adsorbent was regenerated by using an eluting agent of 10 wt nacl and 10 wt naoh the regenerated adsorbent still sustained a very high adsorption capacity after 6 cycles of adsorption regeneration process schmidt et al 2016 studied ro concentrate injection in an abandoned well in bihar india over a period of 42 days and noticed no significant accumulation of iron and as however they concluded that long term studies would have to be conducted in order to ensure safe long term disposal subsurface membrane technologies can overcome concentrate waste problems by in situ treatment and concentrate reinjection c2water 2019 however it is important to mention that a critical assessment of concentrate management should be carried out individually at each location a case study showcasing a subsurface ro with an additional discharge well for concentrate reinjection was demonstrated for the desalination of shallow groundwater 40 m³ day with tds 15 g l at the gidgelbarup farm at badgebup near katanni australia an evaluation was carried out to assess the local impact of the reinjection of residual fluids on the use of groundwater by local farms and the environment the subsurface technology ssd plant reported a water cost of up to 2 20 us m³ which was lower than the local water tariff 2 40 us m³ and the average cost of conventional ro desalination plants of 3 70 us m³ c2water 2019 hubadillah et al 2020 conducted integrated dcmd microalgae bioremediation for as removal from river water the as rich retentate of the dcmd process was bioremediated using botryococcus sp under outdoor conditions the findings show that botryococcus sp successfully grow in the retentate with a common microalgae growth pattern during the 20 days test period which indicates the potential and feasibility of this integrated system for the as retentate management hubadillah et al 2020 the advantages and disadvantages of concentrate treatment and disposal are summarized in table 6 the best option for concentrate disposal must be selected on a site specific basis depending on economic and environmental considerations nap 2004 however this issue should be further addressed in future research 8 conclusions finally it can be concluded membrane technologies particularly nf ro and md offer promising opportunities to treat as laden groundwater to obtain safe drinking water the salient advantages rely on the simplicity of the technology and the scalability down to very small modules for single household scale water treatment in general groundwater containing as v and as iii requires different treatment concepts according to hydrogeological conditions such as ph and redox potential eh as iii typically shows significant lower rejection and occurs together with dissolved iron in many anoxic groundwater sources in order to avoid membrane clogging by fe o oh advanced iron removal is recommended md has high removal for as iii in comparison to other membrane technologies for nf ro and ed an advance oxidation step to as v is necessary in order to comply with the stringent who recommended as limit of 10 µg l the safe disposal of occurring as rich sludge and liquid concentrates is still a main concern post treatment of concentrates aims for the reduction of waste quantity and or as concentration by e g adsorption techniques so that treated water is safe for non potable purposes e g washing processes treatment and reuse of concentrates are still important fields of research that should be further addressed in the future technologies like subsurface re injection and subsurface as removal offer solutions without the production of a brine declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

of mps including refuse in landfills biowastes plastic films and wastewater discharge once mps enter water and soil they undergo different weathering processes mps can be converted into small molecules e g oligomers and monomers and may be completely mineralized under the action of free radicals or microorganisms the rate and extent of weathering of mps depend on their physicochemical properties and environmental conditions of the media to which they are exposed in general water dissipates heat better and has a lower temperature than land thus the weathering rate of mps in the aquatic environment is slower than in the terrestrial environment these weathering processes increase oxygen containing functional groups and the specific surface area of mps which influence the sorption and aggregation that occur between weathered mps and their co existing constituents more studies are needed to investigate the various weathering processes of diverse mps under natural field

factors physicochemical property aggregation sorption 1 introduction with the wide application of polymer more and more particulate plastics have been detected in the environment due to the degradation of bulk plastic polymers and discharge from plastic products chen et al 2019b dawson et al 2018 it has been estimated that the mass of plastics released to land annually 4 73 108 9 1 108 kg may be 4 to 23 times higher than that released to oceans in the european union horton et al 2017 particulate plastics with sizes smaller than 5 mm are defined as microplastics mps arthur et al 2009 by 2100 it is speculated that 2 5 107 to 1 3 108 tonnes of mps float on the ocean surface everaert et al 2018 sediments are a long term sink for mps in deep sea areas and river estuary regions xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b some mps were found to pose negative impact on organisms because they may induce oxidative stress and adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals or organic matters ho et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the weathering processes of mps mainly include mechanical fragmentation photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation chen et al 2019b resmeriță et al 2018 tu et al 2020 these abiotic and biotic processes for mp degradation can take hundreds and even thousands of years iñiguez et al 2018 depending on the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions chen et al 2020 mei et al 2020 tian et al 2019 turgay et al 2019 wang et al 2020a however the combined effects of these factors on various mp weathering processes are complex under natural environmental conditions which results in unpredictable lifetimes of mps in the environment meanwhile weathering of mps influences their interactions with coexisting pollutants liu et al 2019b 2019d wang et al 2020b and these interactions need to be summarized to understand the distribution of mps in the environment and the transport of constituents associated with the mps in order to systematically summarize the related research on mp transport and transformation the web of science database was used to retrieve the relevant publications up to february 2021 with the following keywords microplastics weathering source toxicity adsorption aggregation and deposition the number of publications that investigated transport and transformation of mps was 5311 as shown in fig 1 46 8 of the research focused on the weathering of mps which was more than the research in other areas currently most reviews of mps have concentrated on the environmental behavior of pristine mps in water mei et al 2020 wang et al 2021a but have ignored the interaction between weathered mps and their coexisting constituents in aquatic and terrestrial environments additionally most of these reviews only have summarized a single weathering process yuan et al 2020 without focusing on the influence of multiple weathering processes that affect the fate of mps this review provides an overview of recent progress in studying weathering of mps in terrestrial and aquatic environments to understand fully the weathering processes of mps and associated factors influencing the weathering in natural environments the sources of mps are first described to provide their types concentrations and particle sizes in natural waters or soil next the mechanisms of the weathering processes and the main factors that influence them including the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions are summarized then how the physicochemical properties are changed during the weathering process is discussed the section also reviews the interaction between weathered mps and other coexisting constituents in natural waters or soil finally the knowledge gaps and future recommendations regarding the weathering of mps are discussed 2 sources of particulate plastics enter the environment the sources of mps in natural waters or soil are reviewed ahead of the description of their weathering processes to give their types concentrations and particle sizes in natural environments this provides fundamental information for researchers to investigate the weathering processes of mps under environmentally relevant conditions table 1 shows that most mps are linked to anthropogenic activities the common types of mps consist of polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa and polystyrene ps 2 1 terrestrial environments major sources of terrestrial plastic fragments are from refuse landfills sewage sludge and plastic films solid waste landfills accumulate 21 42 of global plastic wastes nizzetto et al 2016 landfill leachate from a municipal solid waste landfill in china had concentrations of mps with 235 4 17 1 item l 1 and the percentage of tiny mps smaller than 50 μm was over 50 in landfill leachate sun et al 2021 the sewage sludge retains more than 90 of the mps that are in the influent wastewater zhang et al 2020a the recurrent application of the biosolids to agricultural lands e g compost results in small particles that tend to form secondary mps and nanoplastics nps especially from pe due to mixing abrasion and milling kumar et al 2020 plastic films have been extensively utilized in agriculture and the covered agricultural area worldwide is estimated to be around 180 000 km2 and 13 000 km2 for plastic mulches and greenhouses respectively xu et al 2020a plastic mulches left on the ground are prone to weathering due to uv light microbes and tillage and they become brittle enough to fall into fragments astner et al 2019 the concentration left in 60 of the agricultural areas in china has exceeded the national film residual standard 75 kg ha 1 2 2 aquatic environments drainage from domestic and industrial wastes is received by wastewater treatment plants wwtps becoming an essential source of mps in aquatic environments da costa et al 2018 li et al 2020 household wastewater contains heavy loads of mps from cosmetics personal hygiene products and synthetic fibers from garments cosmetic exfoliants release about 4500 to 94 500 microbeads in a single rinse of which 90 consist of pe napper et al 2015 primary and secondary treatment of wastewater at wwtps can eliminate 70 to 99 of the mps prata 2018 at a treatment plant in scotland even at 98 4 removal efficiency 65 million particles were discharged into the river clyde per day with 0 25 items l 1 in the final effluent murphy et al 2016 pedrotti et al 2021 estimated that 4 3 billion synthetic microfibers were released daily into the marine environment from the haliotis treatment plant despite its high removal efficiency 87 5 to 98 5 in several wastewater treatment facilities across the u s the daily number of microplastics discharged into freshwater was estimated to be in the range of 50 000 15 000 000 mason et al 2016 usually ps pe pet pa and pp polymer types dominate in the wastewaters murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 2 3 particulate plastics transfer between the terrestrial and aquatic environment vertical transfer of mps leads to their distribution at various depths in the soil a greater abundance of mps has been reported in shallow soil than in deeper soil liu et al 2018 ploughing soil cracking and bioturbation caused by earthworms can incorporate mps in topsoil layers to the 25 cm depth in the soil matrix bläsing and amelung 2018 rillig et al 2017 soil pores filter out relatively large particles that remain in the surface or near surface soil whereas smaller particles 0 1 6 0 µm presumably pass through the pore channels and possess greater mobility downwards rillig et al 2017 however even larger particles 1 5 mm have been found to reach groundwater aquifers due to migration along fractures and crevices in the ground the occurrence of 12 particles l 1 in groundwater has confirmed the vertical transfer in soil panno et al 2019 erosion can translocate mps incorporated in the surface or subsurface soil over the ground towards surface water bodies in particular arable lands are often vulnerable to the movement of mps by erosion due to high soil permeability intensive drainage loss of vegetative cover and heavy applications of biosolids and compost bläsing and amelung 2018 in northeast china the translocation of mps was claimed to be 96 due to surface soil water loss zhang et al 2020e during floods high tides and extreme wind conditions mps in water can move landwards and become deposited on terrestrial soils suspended mps in rivers and lakes tend to become deposited on floodplains shorelines and even remote mountainous areas due to aeolian transport scheurer and bigalke 2018 3 weathering of particulate plastics in terrestrial and aquatic environments in terrestrial and aquatic environments mps will undergo different weathering processes auta et al 2018 he et al 2018 iñiguez et al 2018 the weathering mechanisms based on physical chemical and biological reactions have been systematically summarized for the first time in section 3 2 additionally these weathering processes are affected by physicochemical properties of the mps e g size structure and crystallinity and environmental conditions e g oxygen water temperature and biofilms chen et al 2020 mei et al 2020 tian et al 2019 turgay et al 2019 wang et al 2020a and they are rarely considered in previous reviews we compared the effect of physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions on different weathering processes as discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 respectively recent studies regarding mp weathering processes are summarized in table 2 which shows that most experiments have been conducted under laboratory conditions and are mainly focused on the aquatic environment 3 1 weathering processes 3 1 1 mechanical fragmentation mechanical breakdown originates from abrasion and disintegration forces that are a result of the interaction of mps with sediments pebbles waves and tide action in aquatic environments in the terrestrial environment it can result from human activities e g soil cultivation and crop rotation he et al 2018 as shown in table 2 mechanical fragmentation of mps has a great possibility of producing more small sized mps even nps 10 nm by simulated sand or wave action however the potential disintegration processes such as freeze thaw cycles and rainstorm events are rarely researched furthermore the rate of mechanical fragmentation was promoted by uv irradiation song et al 2017 reported that pristine pp mps only produced 10 7 0 7 particles pellet 1 under 2 months of mechanical abrasion while uv aged mps for 12 months after 2 month mechanical abrasion formed significant amounts of pp fragments 6084 1061 particles pellet 1 therefore mp accumulation in natural environments will be accelerated under prolonged uv exposure and frequent mechanical wear 3 1 2 photo degradation photo degradation is the major weathering process for most mps table 2 summarizes recent research about photo degradation of mps the uv fraction of light irradiation plays a key role in mp weathering uv radiation with a wavelength of 290 400 nm in sunlight has enough energy 299 412 kj mol 1 to break the cc bond 284 368 kj mol 1 and the ch bond 381 410 kj mol 1 for most plastics kholodovych and welsh 2007 usually the photo weathering process mainly occurs on the outer layer of mps with a µm range depth because the high crystallinity of mps results in light scattering and reflection which reduces the light penetration distance ter halle et al 2017 to be further oxidized the weathering layer needs to be removed via mechanical force and a new non oxidized layer needs to be formed ter halle et al 2017 moreover the weathering layer increases surface hydrophily which enhances microbial adhesion and mineralization rate chamas et al 2020 3 1 3 thermal degradation thermal degradation of mps leads to bond breakage as a result of overcoming the bond dissociation energy pielichowski and njuguna 2005 the theoretical maximum temperature of darkish and dry soils has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 c in natural ground surfaces mildrexler et al 2011 tang et al 2019 therefore mps may undergo thermal degradation process on land due to the extreme maximal surface ground temperatures on the contrary water dissipates heat better and has a lower temperature than dark and dry soils thus thermal degradation seems to be more important in land than in aquatic environments it has been demonstrated that thermal weathering 80 c 3 months of the pe strips was equal to approximately 270 days of uv irradiation at 43 45 c in terrestrial environments erni cassola et al 2020 most studies about mp thermal degradation kinetics have been conducted at temperatures higher than 300 c in a nitrogen atmosphere luo et al 2020d the testing environment is greatly inconsistent with the natural environment e g oxygen and temperature further studies are needed to explore long term mp thermal degradation in natural aquatic or terrestrial systems with environmental temperatures 3 1 4 biodegradation microbial degradation and biological ingestion and digestion are main pathways of mp biological weathering many plastic degrading microbial strains have been identified chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c as shown in table 2 the degradation efficiency of mps has ranged from 3 9 to 60 depending on the species and the diversity of the microbial community in natural environments symbiotic and synergistic interactions among microorganisms in bacterial consortia play a major role in mp biodegradation yuan et al 2020 for example toxic metabolites produced by one microorganism may be used as substrate by another microorganism thus reducing the influence of the toxic metabolites on mp degrading bacteria yuan et al 2020 huerta lwanga et al 2018 found that biodegradation of low density polyethylene ldpe mps by bacterial consortia phylum actinobacteria and firmicutes separated from the earthworm gut caused a weight loss of 60 and formation of nps after 21 days in soil compared with bacterial consortia a single bacterium has low biodegradation efficiency of mps 15 after 28 40 days auta et al 2018 indicating bacterial consortia may provide potential solutions for improving biodegradation efficiency of mps even though the role of each bacterium in the consortia is unclear in addition to microbial degradation pe mps could rapidly be broken into smaller particles by freshwater amphipod gammarus duebeni and the fragments accounted for 65 7 of all observed mps in digestive tracts mateos cárdenas et al 2020 3 2 weathering mechanisms 3 2 1 physical mechanisms physical weathering of mps results in their fragmentation by crack propagation and crack failure under localized shear forces enfrin et al 2020 julienne et al 2019a the defective structures such as microcracks are responsible for the initiation of mp fragmentation enfrin et al 2020 enfrin et al 2020 used grady s model regarding the theory of solid failure through crack propagation and fracture to demonstrate that the existing cracks played a determinant role in breaking of mps into nps in freshwater they revealed that longer cracks reduced the minimum stress of crack propagation thereby resulting in crack failure under further shear forces which produced a planar exfoliation and np fragments therefore the generated cracks of mps during manufacturing or other weathering processes enhance the probability for further fragmentation enfrin et al 2020 particularly the destructive effect by crack propagation and failure is more obvious in brittle materials e g ps in comparison to materials with toughness e g ldpe it has been demonstrated that 99 8 of ps debris was fragmented into mps and nps within 24 h by simulating the breaking of waves irina et al 2018 on land the continuous frictional stresses between tire treads and road surface are mainly responsible for mp generation when the stress achieves the limiting strength of the rubber material the tire will be cut or scratched slightly producing smaller size particles zhang et al 2021 3 2 2 chemical mechanisms the chemical weathering processes including photo degradation and thermal degradation can lead to mp chain scission branching and generation of oxygenated intermediates via similar radical based weathering mechanisms gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2020c as shown in scheme 1 the radical based chemical weathering process is generally divided into three steps including initiation propagation and termination reactions yousif and haddad 2013 the difference for the two chemical weathering processes is the initiator species and weathering products due to the different oxidation efficiencies gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2020c in the initial step alkyl radicals r are considered as important initiating species yousif and haddad 2013 for the thermal degradation process high temperature overcomes the energy barrier and causes r generation via random chain scission at weak sites or chain end scission of cc bonds singh and sharma 2008 for the photo degradation process the chromophore of mps absorbs the energy of uv irradiation to become an excited singlet state which then is transformed into an excited triplet state by intersystem crossing yousif and haddad 2013 the energy of triplet state of mps is transferred to the nearest cc ch bonds by intramolecular energy transfer processes subsequently resulting in chain scission and formation of r for example the excited state of the benzene ring on ps 443 kj mol 1 has enough energy to cause cc ch bond 410 kj mol 1 rupture waldman and de paoli 2008 recent research proved reactive oxide species ros involving the hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 generated by ps mps played a vital role in their photo aging zhu et al 2020a they might promote r generation via h abstraction from plastic molecule rh cc scission or phenyl ring opening to accelerate weathering process of mps cho and choi 2001 in the propagation step high activity radicals such as oh r alkoxyl ro and peroxyl roo can promote self catalyzed reactions first r react with o2 and form roo then roo abstract the hydrogen atom from another rh or the media e g h2o to form hydroperoxide rooh which will be decomposed into oh and ro by absorption of light and heat energy tian et al 2019 yousif and haddad 2013 subsequently oh attack rooh and rh to form roo and r respectively zweifel 1999 moreover the combination of roo and rh can form charge transfer ct complexes which through photolysis change into the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and r the radical ho2 could subsequently form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 gugumus 1990 these reactions provide high activity radicals to keep chain propagation going the alkoxyl radical is a key intermediate in the reaction and undergoes several reaction pathways including hydrogen atom abstraction from rh to produce alcohol and β scission to form ketones or aldehydes gewert et al 2015 under uv irradiation ketones undergo successive reactions to produce r and acyl radicals r co by the norrish ⅰ reaction and to produce the end carbonyl group r coch3 by the norrish ⅱ reaction gardette et al 2013 the termination step mainly results in recombination between bimolecular or low molecular radicals with the main products of ketones olefins and aldehydes gewert et al 2015 additionally a recent study demonstrated that photo degradation could result in ps mps to be completely mineralized into co2 under simulated solar irradiation with light intensities of 3 and 10 fold higher than those of natural solar at 0 and 50 north latitude respectively ward et al 2019 however the mineralization mechanism of mps during the photo aging process needs to be further verified 3 2 3 biological mechanisms for microorganisms mainly bacteria and fungi the degradation process of mps is divided into four steps as shown in fig 2 first the microbes adhere and subsequently colonize onto the mp surface the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms provide a sticky matrix for colonization ganesh kumar et al 2020 michels et al 2018 second biodeterioration occurs on the mp surface resulting in physical disintegration of mps lucas et al 2008 third enzymes secreted by microorganisms facilitate the depolymerization process of mps which transform mps into intermediates with smaller molecules e g dipolymers and monomers and release additives yuan et al 2020 finally these small molecular substances and additives which are used as carbon and energy sources by microorganisms undergo assimilation subsequent mineralization and generation of metabolites e g co2 ch4 and h2o jacquin et al 2019 for crustaceans and omnivores biological ingestion and digestion are considered to be potential biodegradation mechanisms dawson et al 2018 mateos cárdenas et al 2020 mps were cut and ground into nps by mandibles for mastication and then they were transported into the stomach and gastric mill which resulted in the fragmentation of plastic particles dawson et al 2018 mateos cárdenas et al 2020 the digestive enzymes in the stomach might catalyze hydrolytic cleavage of mps and participate in mp degradation mateos cárdenas et al 2020 it is speculated that several enzymes e g amylase cellulose esterase protease and lipase from intestinal tracts might be responsible for mp degradation song et al 2020 the contribution of the enzymes to breakdown of mps and the mechanism of action of the enzymes remain elusive furthermore the interaction between ingested mps and sharp edges such as triturated algae have been shown to accelerate the fragmentation of mps dawson et al 2018 3 3 factors affecting weathering processes 3 3 1 physicochemical properties of microplastics 3 3 1 1 size smaller sized mps have a higher specific surface area and thus provide larger reaction areas for accelerating the fragmentation rate of mps and leaching rate of chemicals luo et al 2020b wang et al 2020a in a photo aging experiment of pvc mps the dechlorination efficiency of pvc mps had a negative correlation with particle size wang et al 2020a the concentrations of released cl from 2 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mps in water were 21 4 13 2 10 6 and 7 2 μm after 96 h xenon lamp exposure respectively wang et al 2020a however for semi crystalline pe particulate plastics with sizes 500 nm smaller particles have higher crystallinity and more compactness of polymer chains thus exhibiting lower thermal degradation rates paik and kar 2009 for this reason the weathering rate of mps not only depends on the specific surface area but also crystallinity and chain compactness resulting from smaller sizes 3 3 1 2 chemical structure the chemical structure of mps is one of the most essential factors determining the weathering rate gewert et al 2015 chromophore induced light absorption is the prerequisite for the plastic photo aging reaction ter halle et al 2017 thus the dissolved organic carbon doc production and carbon mass loss of ps mps were faster than other mps without a chromophore pp and pe in seawater zhu et al 2020b polyethylene terephthalate mps are difficult to be biodegraded directly compared to other polyesters and the main reason for the difficulty is that the aromatic terephthalate units limit the chain mobility resulting in a low hydrolysis rate of the backbone ester linkages by enzymes webb et al 2012 in addition the weathering degree is limited by the rate of hydrogen abstraction from plastic molecules or the media e g h2o by r and ro as shown in scheme 1 which is related to the stability of ch bonds hujuri et al 2008 song et al 2017 the dissociation energy of ch bonds decrease in the order of primary 418 kj mol 1 secondary 402 kj mol 1 tertiary 389 kj mol 1 hydrogen wang and brown 2004 thus mps with tertiary hydrogen e g ps pp and pvc have lower weathering resistance but mps without tertiary hydrogen e g pe are highly stable for example the oxidation degree of pp film was approximately 1 75 times faster than that of pe under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019b the temperature required for 100 weight loss of pe mps 495 c was found to be higher than that of pp mps 471 c hujuri et al 2008 to reduce the accumulation of polymer with high stability such as pe in environments it is necessary to investigate their fates to provide an effective remediation strategy 3 3 1 3 crystallinity crystallinity of mps reflects the order degree of the chain structure andrady 2017 the crystalline region has a more tightly and ordered structure than the amorphous region mei et al 2020 therefore mps with high crystallinity have a limited crushing area compared to those with amorphous regions in which crack propagation chain scission and mechanical breakdown occur preferentially julienne et al 2019a in addition the direction of crystallite alignment of pristine plastics is in the direction of crack propagation thereby affecting the shape and number of formed fragments in water under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019a both ldpe and pp mps had linear crystallite structures perpendicular to the direction of extrusion lines which caused the direction of crack propagation also to be perpendicular to the extrusion direction and elongated shapes were formed besides pp had a spherulite structure to allow the propagation of cracks along the radial direction eventually the cracks caused by the linear crystallite and spherulite structures coalesced together producing fewer elongated and smaller pp fragments than ldpe julienne et al 2019a 3 3 2 environmental conditions 3 3 2 1 oxygen oxygen plays a dominant role in the photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation of mps in water and soil wang et al 2020a confirmed that oxygen might contribute to the photo dechlorination of pvc mps they found that the dechlorination rates of pvc mps 2 μm under oxic conditions were 2 8 and 1 8 times higher than those under anaerobic conditions in oxalate and citrate aqueous solutions respectively wang et al 2020a additionally oxygen can change the metabolic pathway of microorganisms under aerobic conditions microorganisms use oxygen as an electron acceptor while under anaerobic conditions they use sulfates nitrates carbon dioxide or metals as electron acceptors priyanka and archana 2011 thermodynamically oxygen is a more effective electron acceptor than other substances gu 2003 and thus anaerobic conditions may not be conducive to biodegradation 3 3 2 2 water water can either promote or inhibit the weathering process of mps on the one hand water could limit oxygen content and prevent uv penetration consequently the photo aging rate of mps in pure water is lower than that in air cai et al 2018 mao et al 2020 resmeriță et al 2018 on the other hand water plays a prominent role in light scattering and crack propagation the light scattering of water in a suspension of ps mps 250 88 nm increased the light exposure area of the mps which promoted the generation of roo or r they can abstract hydrogen atoms from h2o to generate rooh subsequently decomposing into ro and oh and providing more free radicals for the oxidation process tian et al 2019 in addition water is an essential substance for metabolism growth and reproduction of microorganisms thus suitable moisture could accelerate the rate of mp biodegradation especially in the terrestrial environment by promoting biofilm formation grima et al 2000 3 3 2 3 temperature temperature strongly affects mechanical weathering of mps and the biodegradation rate due to the change of microbial community structure and metabolic activities high temperature could destroy surface mechanical properties and accelerate the movement of molecules inside mps and promote the release of additives and monomers zhou et al 2018 meanwhile high temperature improved enzymatic activity chen et al 2020 found the mass loss of mps in sewage sludge was 43 7 after 45 days of composting it using hyperthermophilic composting technology htc 70 c whereas the mass loss was only 4 5 with conventional thermophilic composting ctc 40 c the predominant genera during the biodegradation of mps during the htc process were thermus 54 2 bacillus 24 8 and geobacillus 19 6 chen et al 2020 it should be noted that higher temperature 85 c might result in inactivation of most enzymes and decrease the bacterial abundance and diversity and thus it may inhibit the biodegradation of mps chen et al 2020 3 3 2 4 organic matter dissolved organic matter dom in the aquatic environment and soil organic matter som in the terrestrial environment play important roles in mp photo degradation and biodegradation cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020c due to their abundant chromophores e g aromatic rings and carboxyl groups dom and som serve as photosensitizers and produce hydrated electron excited triplet states o2 oh and 1o2 li et al 2015 which promote the mp photo aging process liu et al 2019c suggested that dom in the taihu lake and yangtze river might be an important factor leading to different photo aging rates of pp and ps mps furthermore dom and som are considered as some of the most important carbon sources for microorganisms in water and soil environments xue et al 2012 however blöcker et al 2020 found that pp and ldpe mps were barely biodegradable in soil the results might be attributed to the short incubation time 28 days and low mobility of dom and som in soil future work should determine the relationship between dom som and mp biodegradation at long term research sites 3 3 2 5 salinity and ion species salinity and ion species affect the photo degradation rate of mps in the aquatic ecosystem by influencing depth of uv penetration and radical reaction increasing salinity results in a high refractive index of water and the formation of attached salt crystals on the mp surface which thus protect mps from photo degradation by decreasing the absorption efficiency of light cai et al 2018 ranjan and goel 2019 hco3 and cl are considered as the main ions in freshwater and seawater respectively chen et al 2019a hansard et al 2011 which can scavenge oh with reaction constants of 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively liao et al 2001 therefore cl and hco3 in natural water might weaken the promotion effect of oh on photo aging however the common trace metal ions e g iron and manganese in natural water act as catalysts to oxidize and break mp chains under light irradiation leonas 1993 3 3 2 6 biofilm formation the surfaces of mps with various chemical compositions roughness and densities can serve as substrates for biofilm formation especially in aquatic environments turgay et al 2019 biofilms can either promote the deterioration of the structure of mps by secreting enzymes and slime matter or inhibit photo aging and the mechanical breakdown process because the formed dense layer can shield the surface from light irradiation and shear forces yuan et al 2020 at the same time biofilms can increase the density of mps such as pe mps and result in their sinking to the bottom of the water column bråte et al 2018 settlement further leads to the exposure of mps to low temperatures and weak light which may consequently inhibit the photo aging process or thermal degradation 4 impact of weathering on properties of microplastics 4 1 surface functional groups in general weathering promotes the generation of different oxygen containing functional groups mainly c o oh and co on the surface of mps ding et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c most studies have used the carbonyl index ci and the hydroxyl index hi determined by ftir to evaluate the weathering degree of mps wu et al 2020a the types and generation order of oxygen containing functional groups depend on the weathering process and environmental conditions in an aqueous environment the phenolic hydroxyl group was preferentially formed on the surface of ps mps because of excessive hydrogen atoms while in a dry environment the c o group was more likely to be formed under uv irradiation mao et al 2020 moreover under uvb irradiation for 12 months the surface of pp mps evolved into oh and c o groups but only the oh group was observed after thermal weathering at 50 c for 12 months or at 100 c for 6 months tang et al 2019 4 2 color change most mps can undergo visible color changes which is considered as an intuitive indicator of weathering behavior luo et al 2020d a colorimeter is applied to measure the color intensity of pristine and weathered mps based on the cie 1976 l a b color system robertson 1977 an increase in the value of l indicates that the color of mps is lightening robertson 1977 the color coordinates a and b represent the red green coordinate and the yellow blue coordinate respectively robertson 1977 the total color change δe of mps is calculated and considered as an index of color change according to eq 1 robertson 1977 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where l a and b are the differences between pristine and weathered values of l a and b respectively a laboratory study demonstrated that the δe value of pristine pe mps increased drastically from 0 to 8 4 after a 6 week exposure to a xenon lamp luo et al 2020d this phenomenon indicated that the chromaticity of mps was primarily correlated with the oxidation reaction luo et al 2020d during the chemical weathering process yellow discoloration is a common aging result for most of the white off white or translucent mps which is attributed to the formation of chromophores during the aging process battulga et al 2020 for example phenolic antioxidants in mps are oxidized into by products with quinoidal structures that result in a yellow discoloration of mps battulga et al 2020 4 3 size and surface morphology the decrease in particle size and increase in surface roughness are frequently observed for weathered mps liu et al 2019c song et al 2017 the mechanical forces from wave wind and sand abrasion lead to the loss of mechanical stability in which the tensile strength of mps is an important factor liu et al 2019c song et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 a c the photo aging process causes the formation of a brittle surface and cracks on the mp surface which can accelerate the fragmentation rate after the action of physical forces after exposure to uv 12 months and subsequent mechanical abrasion 2 months the fragment number of ldpe pp and expanded ps was 699 569 and 2 times more than those with only mechanical abrasion for 2 months respectively moreover sem images of aged pp mps showed obvious pits microcracks grooves or broken edges on their surfaces as shown in fig 3d song et al 2017 correspondingly the mean particle size of mps decreased along with the increase in the number of fragments zhu et al 2020a 4 4 crystallinity an increase in crystallinity can be considered as an index of the weathering of mps wu et al 2020a weathering preferentially degrades the amorphous portion of plastics thus increasing the percentage of the crystallization region mcgivney et al 2020 the shorter chains from chain scission can crystallize more readily than longer chains due to their higher mobility and this accelerates the re crystallization process in later stages of the weathering process andrady 2017 julienne et al 2019a the degree of crystallinity of mps is measured by an x ray diffractometer xrd and differential scanning calorimetry dsc mcgivney et al 2020 wu et al 2020a the xrd patterns shown in fig 4 indicated that the weathering process improved the crystallinity of ps mps which increased in the order of pristine ps 62 5 seawater aged ps 63 9 uv aged ps in seawater 65 0 uv aged ps 66 8 wu et al 2020a moreover the dsc exotherms revealed that the presence of biofilms increased the crystallinity of pe mps by 3 2 mcgivney et al 2020 4 5 leaching of chemicals weathering of mps can leach chemicals such as additives monomers and oxygenated intermediates as shown in table 3 luo et al 2020b zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b the released additives mainly include endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs e g phthalate and bisphenols and metal ions e g cr6 and pb2 in the aqueous environment dissolved organic carbon and co2 were major by products of mps through chain scission and oxidation reactions in an aquatic environment under uv irradiation ward et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b in addition light irradiation promotes chemical leaching because the formation of cracks and fragments in the weathered mps provides a larger contact area for chemicals with oxygen or for the aqueous solution luo et al 2020b for mps sampled from the north pacific gyre the leaching rate of doc in light 0 235 0 003 mg g 1 d 1 was 10 times faster than that in the dark zhu et al 2020b by contrast other studies reported that uv irradiation decreased the concentrations of some released chemicals such as organotin and doc because of their photodegradation volatilization and reabsorption onto the mp surface chen et al 2019a romera castillo et al 2018 5 interactions between weathered microplastics and coexisting constituents the increased surface area and hydrophilicity of weathered mps are of great importance for the interaction between weathered mps and other coexisting constituents which includes adsorption of inorganic organic contaminants and homo hetero aggregation with other coexisting solid constituents liu et al 2019b 2020b wang et al 2020b these weathering induced environmental behaviors further affect transport and bioavailability to organisms of mps liu et al 2019b 5 1 sorption of inorganic contaminants weathered microplastics can promote the absorption of potentially toxic elements including heavy metals and metalloids via ion complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction forces as shown in fig 5 dong et al 2020 wang et al 2020b weathered mps have a positive correlation between their adsorption capacities for the inorganic contaminants and ci values in aqueous solution indicating that the degree of weathering of mps influences the adsorption ability of heavy metal ions and metalloid ions mao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2019 a 1 6 fold increase of equilibrium zn2 adsorption capacity was observed by 300 h uv aged pet mps 86 8 μg g 1 over the pristine mps 54 7 μg g 1 in aqueous solution wang et al 2020b the higher adsorption capacities of weathered mps are principally due to the following three reasons 1 increased chapped wrinkled and rough surfaces of weathered mps provide more active sites than pristine mps for contaminants fu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b 2 oxygen containing functional groups strengthen the interaction forces between mps and metal cations by ion complexation and hydrogen bonding brennecke et al 2016 mao et al 2020 and 3 increased electronegativity on aged mp surfaces enables greater electrostatic attraction between metal cations and mps yang et al 2019 in addition biofilms on weathered mps have been shown to act as vectors of metal cations the eps in biofilms include oh and c o groups promoting cu2 adsorption onto the surface of pe mps via complexation wang et al 2020d which highlights the probable effect of biofilms on migration and transformation of inorganic contaminants in the environment biofilm coverage can change the mechanism of cu2 diffusion from intra particle diffusion of pristine mps into film diffusion of aged mps which facilitates cu2 adsorption wang et al 2020d 5 2 sorption of organic contaminants as shown in fig 5 hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction play dominant roles for sorption of hydrophilic organic contaminants e g tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on weathered surfaces of mps due to increased oxygen containing functional groups high hydrophilicity and electronegativity liu et al 2019a wu et al 2020b compared to pristine mps the maximum adsorption capacity of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on uv aged pla mps increased by 2 2 from 2 5 to 5 5 mg g 1 and 1 2 from 3 2 to 3 8 mg g 1 fold respectively fan et al 2021 on the contrary a decrease of hydrophobic interaction forces is the primary reason for lower adsorption capacity for hydrophobic organic contaminants hoc on weathered mps for example the equilibrium sorption capacity of 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether bde 47 on uv aged ps mps 3 75 ng g 1 decreased to half of that for the pristine ps 6 16 ng g 1 wu et al 2020a in addition π π interaction was shown to be the key interaction mechanism between pristine ps mps and aromatic compounds although the π π interaction might be weakened due to the opening of phenyl rings of ps mps during the uv aging process liu et al 2020b 2020c the interaction seems to play a minor role compared with the above interaction forces on weathered mps 5 3 homo aggregation or hetero aggregation with other solid particles 5 3 1 homo aggregation of weathered mps weathered mps can influence their aggregation behavior mainly by changing hydrophilic interaction electrostatic interaction van der waals interaction and biofilm formation fig 6 ultraviolet irradiation inhibited the homo aggregation of ps nps 50 100 nm in nacl solutions which was primarily because the formed oxygen containing functional groups on the ps np surface improved the electrostatic repulsion between two approaching particles liu et al 2019d similar phenomena were observed in the soil environment liu et al 2019b under uv irradiation the surface oxidation of ps nps increased their negative charges and hydrophilicity in saturated loamy sand thus decreasing the aggregation of mps liu et al 2019b by contrast uv light promoted the aggregation of aged ps nps in cacl2 solutions which resulted from the bridging effect between the formed oxygen containing functional groups and ca2 liu et al 2019d in water environments most of the mp surfaces were covered by biofilms which secreted sticky eps served as tackiness agents which subsequently accelerating homo aggregation of mps michels et al 2018 additionally nps formed by mp fragmentation via mechanical weathering e g shear forces were prone to homo aggregation which was attributed to the increased surface energy nanoplastics with high surface energy tended to aggregate to minimize their gibbs free energy and reached a stable state enfrin et al 2020 however the aggregates were readily dispersed by repeated shear forces due to their low cohesion forces low van der waals force enfrin et al 2020 5 3 2 hetero aggregation of weathered mps with other particles weathering of mps has a greater impact on hetero aggregation of mps with other solid particles than homo aggregation due to the abundance of coexisting solid constituents in the natural environment alimi et al 2018 michels et al 2018 investigated the effect of biofilms on the hetero aggregation between pe mps and biogenic particles phytoplankton in the aquatic environment with the naked eye they were able to observe hetero aggregate formation by pristine ps mps in seawater with phytoplankton after one day while biofilm covered ps mps hetero aggregates with biogenic particles were obvious just after a few hours however the interaction of weathered mps with other solid particles e g suspended sediments and microalgae in water has yet to be elucidated 6 knowledge gaps and future recommendations 6 1 evaluate the weathering process under actual environmental conditions most published studies have concentrated on investigating the weathering of mps under laboratory simulated environments chen et al 2019a enfrin et al 2020 luo et al 2020c and only a few studies have focused on the weathering of mps under natural environmental conditions chen et al 2020 tu et al 2020 even though weathering phenomena and mechanisms have been concluded from these studies it is controversial whether the laboratory simulated conditions represent environmentally relevant systems for example photo weathering experiments with mps commonly use a xenon lamp to simulate sunlight however the latitude longitude solar elevation angle and meteorological conditions determine the intensity and spectral distribution of sunlight casado et al 2019 which cause the difference between mp weathering with a xenon lamp and natural sunlight some potential influencing factors e g ions natural organic matter and plant secretions might exert an influence on the mp weathering furthermore most mps undergo various weathering processes at the same time in natural environments which results in complexity and uncertainty of the weathering behavior and mechanisms considering the complexity of natural systems and the weathering processes future studies should explore multiple weathering behaviors and mechanisms of mps under actual aquatic or terrestrial environmental conditions 6 2 consider the effect of microplastic diversity on weathering most weathering studies of mps have used traditional and spherical plastic particles such as pp ps pe pvc and pet recently mps with irregular shape and new plastics including biodegradable mps e g polyhydroxy butyrate and functional mps e g carboxyl modified ps are being released into natural environments gonzalez pleiter et al 2019 wang et al 2020c and they have been rarely considered in weathering studies meanwhile different types of mps co exist in the field however only a single type of mps is used in weathering experiments which ignores the mutual influence or competition among mps for instance the excited state of the benzene ring 4 59 ev on ps could transfer energy to the excited state of the carbonyl 4 09 ev on pp by an intramolecular energy transfer process then the energy can break the ch bond of pp generating more high activity tertiary carbon radicals under uv irradiation waldman and de paoli 2008 more research should be carried out using new synthetic irregularly shaped and mixed mps as model particles to provide a more reasonable understanding of mp weathering 6 3 improve the understanding of the weathering process in soils or sediments factors influencing the weathering processes of mps have been mainly studied in aquatic environments with little attention paid to terrestrial environments in addition to biological phenomena mechanical degradation photo degradation and thermal degradation may also influence the distribution and fate of mps in soils research investigating the influence of soil conditions e g moisture content mineral materials microbial species and soil physico chemical parameters on the mp weathering processes is urgently needed previous studies have suggested that sediments in the ocean and river estuaries accumulate mps and become long term sinks for mps xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b the anaerobic environment and special microbial habitat of sediments may result in mps undergoing anaerobic biodegradation and mechanical fragmentation it is of great importance to focus on the weathering processes of mps in soils or sediments where the low oxygen content and weak light intensity may limit the extent of photo weathering reactions 6 4 strengthen research on the interaction between weathered mps and coexisting constituents in water environments the stability and mobility of mps change during the aging process because of altered zeta potentials surface areas roughness and hydrophobicity wang et al 2020b wu et al 2020a these altered physicochemical properties may also influence the interaction of mps with other solid particles hetero aggregation of weathered mps in water remains elusive how and whether the aging process interferes with homo aggregation and hetero aggregation of weathered mps with other particles in terrestrial environments are unknown due to the lack of separation identification and quantification methods for particle size of mp aggregates research regarding the interaction of weathered mps with other pollutants has mainly concentrated on the sorption of a single heavy metal or organic matter dong et al 2020 wang et al 2020b competitive adsorption of weathered mps for mixed pollutants needs to be studied because many heavy metals and organic pollutants co exist in natural environments weathered mps can release additives monomers or oxygenated intermediates which may be reabsorbed onto the surfaces of mps liu et al 2020b further work is needed to better understand the effect of the reabsorption process on heavy metals and organic pollutants 6 5 concern mp weathering process in waste water most previous research has concentrated on the weathering of mps in natural water and sporadically research has considered the soil but ignored the weathering process in waste water e g landfill leachates which is also a major source of mps large amounts of plastic waste disposed in landfills or dumpsites are subjected to multiple weathering processes which depend upon leachate ph 4 5 9 salinity concentration of heavy metals and organic pollutants and bacterial communities he et al 2019 sun et al 2021 for example the transition metals in landfills or leachates e g fe and cu might promote the decomposition of organic molecules e g rooh and thus accelerate polymer weathering hou et al 2021 further research is needed to investigate the weathering processes in waste water under the influence of complex field conditions that are different from those in the natural ambient environment e g surface water 7 conclusions the weathering of mps is an important process determining their transport transformation and interactions with contaminants and microorganisms in water and soil sources of mps are usually linked to anthropogenic activities including refuse in landfills biowaste application plastic film utilization and wastewater discharge microplastics undergo various weathering processes including mechanical fragmentation photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions affect the degree of their weathering generally mps which have a small size and large specific surface area provide many reaction sites mps with a low degree of crystallinity facilitate the diffusion of oxygen water molecules and radicals which accelerate the weathering rate however some factors have opposing effects on the weathering of mps for example biofilm formation on mp surfaces promotes plastic biodegradation but inhibits photo degradation the surface property modification of mps resulting from weathering strongly affects the sorption or aggregation of weathered mps and other coexisting constituents by influencing interactive forces such as hydrogen bond interaction hydrophilic interaction electrostatic interaction and van der waals interaction to predict fully the fate and environmental interactions of mps more knowledge is needed concerning the in situ weathering behavior of different types of mps that co exist in natural aquatic and terrestrial environments

of mps including refuse in landfills biowastes plastic films and wastewater discharge once mps enter water and soil they undergo different weathering processes mps can be converted into small molecules e g oligomers and monomers and may be completely mineralized under the action of free radicals or microorganisms the rate and extent of weathering of mps depend on their physicochemical properties and environmental conditions of the media to which they are exposed in general water dissipates heat better and has a lower temperature than land thus the weathering rate of mps in the aquatic environment is slower than in the terrestrial environment these weathering processes increase oxygen containing functional groups and the specific surface area of mps which influence the sorption and aggregation that occur between weathered mps and their co existing constituents more studies are needed to investigate the various weathering processes of diverse mps under natural field conditions in soils sediments and aquatic environments to understand the impact of weathered mps in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging influence factors physicochemical property aggregation sorption 1 introduction with the wide application of polymer more and more particulate plastics have been detected in the environment due to the degradation of bulk plastic polymers and discharge from plastic products chen et al 2019b dawson et al 2018 it has been estimated that the mass of plastics released to land annually 4 73 108 9 1 108 kg may be 4 to 23 times higher than that released to oceans in the european union horton et al 2017 particulate plastics with sizes smaller than 5 mm are defined as microplastics mps arthur et al 2009 by 2100 it is speculated that 2 5 107 to 1 3 108 tonnes of mps float on the ocean surface everaert et al 2018 sediments are a long term sink for mps in deep sea areas and river estuary regions xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b some mps were found to pose negative impact on organisms because they may induce oxidative stress and adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals or organic matters ho et al 2020 wang et al 2021b the weathering processes of mps mainly include mechanical fragmentation photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation chen et al 2019b resmeriță et al 2018 tu et al 2020 these abiotic and biotic processes for mp degradation can take hundreds and even thousands of years iñiguez et al 2018 depending on the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions chen et al 2020 mei et al 2020 tian et al 2019 turgay et al 2019 wang et al 2020a however the combined effects of these factors on various mp weathering processes are complex under natural environmental conditions which results in unpredictable lifetimes of mps in the environment meanwhile weathering of mps influences their interactions with coexisting pollutants liu et al 2019b 2019d wang et al 2020b and these interactions need to be summarized to understand the distribution of mps in the environment and the transport of constituents associated with the mps in order to systematically summarize the related research on mp transport and transformation the web of science database was used to retrieve the relevant publications up to february 2021 with the following keywords microplastics weathering source toxicity adsorption aggregation and deposition the number of publications that investigated transport and transformation of mps was 5311 as shown in fig 1 46 8 of the research focused on the weathering of mps which was more than the research in other areas currently most reviews of mps have concentrated on the environmental behavior of pristine mps in water mei et al 2020 wang et al 2021a but have ignored the interaction between weathered mps and their coexisting constituents in aquatic and terrestrial environments additionally most of these reviews only have summarized a single weathering process yuan et al 2020 without focusing on the influence of multiple weathering processes that affect the fate of mps this review provides an overview of recent progress in studying weathering of mps in terrestrial and aquatic environments to understand fully the weathering processes of mps and associated factors influencing the weathering in natural environments the sources of mps are first described to provide their types concentrations and particle sizes in natural waters or soil next the mechanisms of the weathering processes and the main factors that influence them including the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions are summarized then how the physicochemical properties are changed during the weathering process is discussed the section also reviews the interaction between weathered mps and other coexisting constituents in natural waters or soil finally the knowledge gaps and future recommendations regarding the weathering of mps are discussed 2 sources of particulate plastics enter the environment the sources of mps in natural waters or soil are reviewed ahead of the description of their weathering processes to give their types concentrations and particle sizes in natural environments this provides fundamental information for researchers to investigate the weathering processes of mps under environmentally relevant conditions table 1 shows that most mps are linked to anthropogenic activities the common types of mps consist of polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa and polystyrene ps 2 1 terrestrial environments major sources of terrestrial plastic fragments are from refuse landfills sewage sludge and plastic films solid waste landfills accumulate 21 42 of global plastic wastes nizzetto et al 2016 landfill leachate from a municipal solid waste landfill in china had concentrations of mps with 235 4 17 1 item l 1 and the percentage of tiny mps smaller than 50 μm was over 50 in landfill leachate sun et al 2021 the sewage sludge retains more than 90 of the mps that are in the influent wastewater zhang et al 2020a the recurrent application of the biosolids to agricultural lands e g compost results in small particles that tend to form secondary mps and nanoplastics nps especially from pe due to mixing abrasion and milling kumar et al 2020 plastic films have been extensively utilized in agriculture and the covered agricultural area worldwide is estimated to be around 180 000 km2 and 13 000 km2 for plastic mulches and greenhouses respectively xu et al 2020a plastic mulches left on the ground are prone to weathering due to uv light microbes and tillage and they become brittle enough to fall into fragments astner et al 2019 the concentration left in 60 of the agricultural areas in china has exceeded the national film residual standard 75 kg ha 1 2 2 aquatic environments drainage from domestic and industrial wastes is received by wastewater treatment plants wwtps becoming an essential source of mps in aquatic environments da costa et al 2018 li et al 2020 household wastewater contains heavy loads of mps from cosmetics personal hygiene products and synthetic fibers from garments cosmetic exfoliants release about 4500 to 94 500 microbeads in a single rinse of which 90 consist of pe napper et al 2015 primary and secondary treatment of wastewater at wwtps can eliminate 70 to 99 of the mps prata 2018 at a treatment plant in scotland even at 98 4 removal efficiency 65 million particles were discharged into the river clyde per day with 0 25 items l 1 in the final effluent murphy et al 2016 pedrotti et al 2021 estimated that 4 3 billion synthetic microfibers were released daily into the marine environment from the haliotis treatment plant despite its high removal efficiency 87 5 to 98 5 in several wastewater treatment facilities across the u s the daily number of microplastics discharged into freshwater was estimated to be in the range of 50 000 15 000 000 mason et al 2016 usually ps pe pet pa and pp polymer types dominate in the wastewaters murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 2 3 particulate plastics transfer between the terrestrial and aquatic environment vertical transfer of mps leads to their distribution at various depths in the soil a greater abundance of mps has been reported in shallow soil than in deeper soil liu et al 2018 ploughing soil cracking and bioturbation caused by earthworms can incorporate mps in topsoil layers to the 25 cm depth in the soil matrix bläsing and amelung 2018 rillig et al 2017 soil pores filter out relatively large particles that remain in the surface or near surface soil whereas smaller particles 0 1 6 0 µm presumably pass through the pore channels and possess greater mobility downwards rillig et al 2017 however even larger particles 1 5 mm have been found to reach groundwater aquifers due to migration along fractures and crevices in the ground the occurrence of 12 particles l 1 in groundwater has confirmed the vertical transfer in soil panno et al 2019 erosion can translocate mps incorporated in the surface or subsurface soil over the ground towards surface water bodies in particular arable lands are often vulnerable to the movement of mps by erosion due to high soil permeability intensive drainage loss of vegetative cover and heavy applications of biosolids and compost bläsing and amelung 2018 in northeast china the translocation of mps was claimed to be 96 due to surface soil water loss zhang et al 2020e during floods high tides and extreme wind conditions mps in water can move landwards and become deposited on terrestrial soils suspended mps in rivers and lakes tend to become deposited on floodplains shorelines and even remote mountainous areas due to aeolian transport scheurer and bigalke 2018 3 weathering of particulate plastics in terrestrial and aquatic environments in terrestrial and aquatic environments mps will undergo different weathering processes auta et al 2018 he et al 2018 iñiguez et al 2018 the weathering mechanisms based on physical chemical and biological reactions have been systematically summarized for the first time in section 3 2 additionally these weathering processes are affected by physicochemical properties of the mps e g size structure and crystallinity and environmental conditions e g oxygen water temperature and biofilms chen et al 2020 mei et al 2020 tian et al 2019 turgay et al 2019 wang et al 2020a and they are rarely considered in previous reviews we compared the effect of physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions on different weathering processes as discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 respectively recent studies regarding mp weathering processes are summarized in table 2 which shows that most experiments have been conducted under laboratory conditions and are mainly focused on the aquatic environment 3 1 weathering processes 3 1 1 mechanical fragmentation mechanical breakdown originates from abrasion and disintegration forces that are a result of the interaction of mps with sediments pebbles waves and tide action in aquatic environments in the terrestrial environment it can result from human activities e g soil cultivation and crop rotation he et al 2018 as shown in table 2 mechanical fragmentation of mps has a great possibility of producing more small sized mps even nps 10 nm by simulated sand or wave action however the potential disintegration processes such as freeze thaw cycles and rainstorm events are rarely researched furthermore the rate of mechanical fragmentation was promoted by uv irradiation song et al 2017 reported that pristine pp mps only produced 10 7 0 7 particles pellet 1 under 2 months of mechanical abrasion while uv aged mps for 12 months after 2 month mechanical abrasion formed significant amounts of pp fragments 6084 1061 particles pellet 1 therefore mp accumulation in natural environments will be accelerated under prolonged uv exposure and frequent mechanical wear 3 1 2 photo degradation photo degradation is the major weathering process for most mps table 2 summarizes recent research about photo degradation of mps the uv fraction of light irradiation plays a key role in mp weathering uv radiation with a wavelength of 290 400 nm in sunlight has enough energy 299 412 kj mol 1 to break the cc bond 284 368 kj mol 1 and the ch bond 381 410 kj mol 1 for most plastics kholodovych and welsh 2007 usually the photo weathering process mainly occurs on the outer layer of mps with a µm range depth because the high crystallinity of mps results in light scattering and reflection which reduces the light penetration distance ter halle et al 2017 to be further oxidized the weathering layer needs to be removed via mechanical force and a new non oxidized layer needs to be formed ter halle et al 2017 moreover the weathering layer increases surface hydrophily which enhances microbial adhesion and mineralization rate chamas et al 2020 3 1 3 thermal degradation thermal degradation of mps leads to bond breakage as a result of overcoming the bond dissociation energy pielichowski and njuguna 2005 the theoretical maximum temperature of darkish and dry soils has been estimated to be between 90 and 100 c in natural ground surfaces mildrexler et al 2011 tang et al 2019 therefore mps may undergo thermal degradation process on land due to the extreme maximal surface ground temperatures on the contrary water dissipates heat better and has a lower temperature than dark and dry soils thus thermal degradation seems to be more important in land than in aquatic environments it has been demonstrated that thermal weathering 80 c 3 months of the pe strips was equal to approximately 270 days of uv irradiation at 43 45 c in terrestrial environments erni cassola et al 2020 most studies about mp thermal degradation kinetics have been conducted at temperatures higher than 300 c in a nitrogen atmosphere luo et al 2020d the testing environment is greatly inconsistent with the natural environment e g oxygen and temperature further studies are needed to explore long term mp thermal degradation in natural aquatic or terrestrial systems with environmental temperatures 3 1 4 biodegradation microbial degradation and biological ingestion and digestion are main pathways of mp biological weathering many plastic degrading microbial strains have been identified chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c as shown in table 2 the degradation efficiency of mps has ranged from 3 9 to 60 depending on the species and the diversity of the microbial community in natural environments symbiotic and synergistic interactions among microorganisms in bacterial consortia play a major role in mp biodegradation yuan et al 2020 for example toxic metabolites produced by one microorganism may be used as substrate by another microorganism thus reducing the influence of the toxic metabolites on mp degrading bacteria yuan et al 2020 huerta lwanga et al 2018 found that biodegradation of low density polyethylene ldpe mps by bacterial consortia phylum actinobacteria and firmicutes separated from the earthworm gut caused a weight loss of 60 and formation of nps after 21 days in soil compared with bacterial consortia a single bacterium has low biodegradation efficiency of mps 15 after 28 40 days auta et al 2018 indicating bacterial consortia may provide potential solutions for improving biodegradation efficiency of mps even though the role of each bacterium in the consortia is unclear in addition to microbial degradation pe mps could rapidly be broken into smaller particles by freshwater amphipod gammarus duebeni and the fragments accounted for 65 7 of all observed mps in digestive tracts mateos cárdenas et al 2020 3 2 weathering mechanisms 3 2 1 physical mechanisms physical weathering of mps results in their fragmentation by crack propagation and crack failure under localized shear forces enfrin et al 2020 julienne et al 2019a the defective structures such as microcracks are responsible for the initiation of mp fragmentation enfrin et al 2020 enfrin et al 2020 used grady s model regarding the theory of solid failure through crack propagation and fracture to demonstrate that the existing cracks played a determinant role in breaking of mps into nps in freshwater they revealed that longer cracks reduced the minimum stress of crack propagation thereby resulting in crack failure under further shear forces which produced a planar exfoliation and np fragments therefore the generated cracks of mps during manufacturing or other weathering processes enhance the probability for further fragmentation enfrin et al 2020 particularly the destructive effect by crack propagation and failure is more obvious in brittle materials e g ps in comparison to materials with toughness e g ldpe it has been demonstrated that 99 8 of ps debris was fragmented into mps and nps within 24 h by simulating the breaking of waves irina et al 2018 on land the continuous frictional stresses between tire treads and road surface are mainly responsible for mp generation when the stress achieves the limiting strength of the rubber material the tire will be cut or scratched slightly producing smaller size particles zhang et al 2021 3 2 2 chemical mechanisms the chemical weathering processes including photo degradation and thermal degradation can lead to mp chain scission branching and generation of oxygenated intermediates via similar radical based weathering mechanisms gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2020c as shown in scheme 1 the radical based chemical weathering process is generally divided into three steps including initiation propagation and termination reactions yousif and haddad 2013 the difference for the two chemical weathering processes is the initiator species and weathering products due to the different oxidation efficiencies gardette et al 2013 liu et al 2020c in the initial step alkyl radicals r are considered as important initiating species yousif and haddad 2013 for the thermal degradation process high temperature overcomes the energy barrier and causes r generation via random chain scission at weak sites or chain end scission of cc bonds singh and sharma 2008 for the photo degradation process the chromophore of mps absorbs the energy of uv irradiation to become an excited singlet state which then is transformed into an excited triplet state by intersystem crossing yousif and haddad 2013 the energy of triplet state of mps is transferred to the nearest cc ch bonds by intramolecular energy transfer processes subsequently resulting in chain scission and formation of r for example the excited state of the benzene ring on ps 443 kj mol 1 has enough energy to cause cc ch bond 410 kj mol 1 rupture waldman and de paoli 2008 recent research proved reactive oxide species ros involving the hydroxyl radical oh superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 generated by ps mps played a vital role in their photo aging zhu et al 2020a they might promote r generation via h abstraction from plastic molecule rh cc scission or phenyl ring opening to accelerate weathering process of mps cho and choi 2001 in the propagation step high activity radicals such as oh r alkoxyl ro and peroxyl roo can promote self catalyzed reactions first r react with o2 and form roo then roo abstract the hydrogen atom from another rh or the media e g h2o to form hydroperoxide rooh which will be decomposed into oh and ro by absorption of light and heat energy tian et al 2019 yousif and haddad 2013 subsequently oh attack rooh and rh to form roo and r respectively zweifel 1999 moreover the combination of roo and rh can form charge transfer ct complexes which through photolysis change into the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and r the radical ho2 could subsequently form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 gugumus 1990 these reactions provide high activity radicals to keep chain propagation going the alkoxyl radical is a key intermediate in the reaction and undergoes several reaction pathways including hydrogen atom abstraction from rh to produce alcohol and β scission to form ketones or aldehydes gewert et al 2015 under uv irradiation ketones undergo successive reactions to produce r and acyl radicals r co by the norrish ⅰ reaction and to produce the end carbonyl group r coch3 by the norrish ⅱ reaction gardette et al 2013 the termination step mainly results in recombination between bimolecular or low molecular radicals with the main products of ketones olefins and aldehydes gewert et al 2015 additionally a recent study demonstrated that photo degradation could result in ps mps to be completely mineralized into co2 under simulated solar irradiation with light intensities of 3 and 10 fold higher than those of natural solar at 0 and 50 north latitude respectively ward et al 2019 however the mineralization mechanism of mps during the photo aging process needs to be further verified 3 2 3 biological mechanisms for microorganisms mainly bacteria and fungi the degradation process of mps is divided into four steps as shown in fig 2 first the microbes adhere and subsequently colonize onto the mp surface the extracellular polymeric substances eps secreted by microorganisms provide a sticky matrix for colonization ganesh kumar et al 2020 michels et al 2018 second biodeterioration occurs on the mp surface resulting in physical disintegration of mps lucas et al 2008 third enzymes secreted by microorganisms facilitate the depolymerization process of mps which transform mps into intermediates with smaller molecules e g dipolymers and monomers and release additives yuan et al 2020 finally these small molecular substances and additives which are used as carbon and energy sources by microorganisms undergo assimilation subsequent mineralization and generation of metabolites e g co2 ch4 and h2o jacquin et al 2019 for crustaceans and omnivores biological ingestion and digestion are considered to be potential biodegradation mechanisms dawson et al 2018 mateos cárdenas et al 2020 mps were cut and ground into nps by mandibles for mastication and then they were transported into the stomach and gastric mill which resulted in the fragmentation of plastic particles dawson et al 2018 mateos cárdenas et al 2020 the digestive enzymes in the stomach might catalyze hydrolytic cleavage of mps and participate in mp degradation mateos cárdenas et al 2020 it is speculated that several enzymes e g amylase cellulose esterase protease and lipase from intestinal tracts might be responsible for mp degradation song et al 2020 the contribution of the enzymes to breakdown of mps and the mechanism of action of the enzymes remain elusive furthermore the interaction between ingested mps and sharp edges such as triturated algae have been shown to accelerate the fragmentation of mps dawson et al 2018 3 3 factors affecting weathering processes 3 3 1 physicochemical properties of microplastics 3 3 1 1 size smaller sized mps have a higher specific surface area and thus provide larger reaction areas for accelerating the fragmentation rate of mps and leaching rate of chemicals luo et al 2020b wang et al 2020a in a photo aging experiment of pvc mps the dechlorination efficiency of pvc mps had a negative correlation with particle size wang et al 2020a the concentrations of released cl from 2 10 25 and 150 μm pvc mps in water were 21 4 13 2 10 6 and 7 2 μm after 96 h xenon lamp exposure respectively wang et al 2020a however for semi crystalline pe particulate plastics with sizes 500 nm smaller particles have higher crystallinity and more compactness of polymer chains thus exhibiting lower thermal degradation rates paik and kar 2009 for this reason the weathering rate of mps not only depends on the specific surface area but also crystallinity and chain compactness resulting from smaller sizes 3 3 1 2 chemical structure the chemical structure of mps is one of the most essential factors determining the weathering rate gewert et al 2015 chromophore induced light absorption is the prerequisite for the plastic photo aging reaction ter halle et al 2017 thus the dissolved organic carbon doc production and carbon mass loss of ps mps were faster than other mps without a chromophore pp and pe in seawater zhu et al 2020b polyethylene terephthalate mps are difficult to be biodegraded directly compared to other polyesters and the main reason for the difficulty is that the aromatic terephthalate units limit the chain mobility resulting in a low hydrolysis rate of the backbone ester linkages by enzymes webb et al 2012 in addition the weathering degree is limited by the rate of hydrogen abstraction from plastic molecules or the media e g h2o by r and ro as shown in scheme 1 which is related to the stability of ch bonds hujuri et al 2008 song et al 2017 the dissociation energy of ch bonds decrease in the order of primary 418 kj mol 1 secondary 402 kj mol 1 tertiary 389 kj mol 1 hydrogen wang and brown 2004 thus mps with tertiary hydrogen e g ps pp and pvc have lower weathering resistance but mps without tertiary hydrogen e g pe are highly stable for example the oxidation degree of pp film was approximately 1 75 times faster than that of pe under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019b the temperature required for 100 weight loss of pe mps 495 c was found to be higher than that of pp mps 471 c hujuri et al 2008 to reduce the accumulation of polymer with high stability such as pe in environments it is necessary to investigate their fates to provide an effective remediation strategy 3 3 1 3 crystallinity crystallinity of mps reflects the order degree of the chain structure andrady 2017 the crystalline region has a more tightly and ordered structure than the amorphous region mei et al 2020 therefore mps with high crystallinity have a limited crushing area compared to those with amorphous regions in which crack propagation chain scission and mechanical breakdown occur preferentially julienne et al 2019a in addition the direction of crystallite alignment of pristine plastics is in the direction of crack propagation thereby affecting the shape and number of formed fragments in water under xenon lamp irradiation julienne et al 2019a both ldpe and pp mps had linear crystallite structures perpendicular to the direction of extrusion lines which caused the direction of crack propagation also to be perpendicular to the extrusion direction and elongated shapes were formed besides pp had a spherulite structure to allow the propagation of cracks along the radial direction eventually the cracks caused by the linear crystallite and spherulite structures coalesced together producing fewer elongated and smaller pp fragments than ldpe julienne et al 2019a 3 3 2 environmental conditions 3 3 2 1 oxygen oxygen plays a dominant role in the photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation of mps in water and soil wang et al 2020a confirmed that oxygen might contribute to the photo dechlorination of pvc mps they found that the dechlorination rates of pvc mps 2 μm under oxic conditions were 2 8 and 1 8 times higher than those under anaerobic conditions in oxalate and citrate aqueous solutions respectively wang et al 2020a additionally oxygen can change the metabolic pathway of microorganisms under aerobic conditions microorganisms use oxygen as an electron acceptor while under anaerobic conditions they use sulfates nitrates carbon dioxide or metals as electron acceptors priyanka and archana 2011 thermodynamically oxygen is a more effective electron acceptor than other substances gu 2003 and thus anaerobic conditions may not be conducive to biodegradation 3 3 2 2 water water can either promote or inhibit the weathering process of mps on the one hand water could limit oxygen content and prevent uv penetration consequently the photo aging rate of mps in pure water is lower than that in air cai et al 2018 mao et al 2020 resmeriță et al 2018 on the other hand water plays a prominent role in light scattering and crack propagation the light scattering of water in a suspension of ps mps 250 88 nm increased the light exposure area of the mps which promoted the generation of roo or r they can abstract hydrogen atoms from h2o to generate rooh subsequently decomposing into ro and oh and providing more free radicals for the oxidation process tian et al 2019 in addition water is an essential substance for metabolism growth and reproduction of microorganisms thus suitable moisture could accelerate the rate of mp biodegradation especially in the terrestrial environment by promoting biofilm formation grima et al 2000 3 3 2 3 temperature temperature strongly affects mechanical weathering of mps and the biodegradation rate due to the change of microbial community structure and metabolic activities high temperature could destroy surface mechanical properties and accelerate the movement of molecules inside mps and promote the release of additives and monomers zhou et al 2018 meanwhile high temperature improved enzymatic activity chen et al 2020 found the mass loss of mps in sewage sludge was 43 7 after 45 days of composting it using hyperthermophilic composting technology htc 70 c whereas the mass loss was only 4 5 with conventional thermophilic composting ctc 40 c the predominant genera during the biodegradation of mps during the htc process were thermus 54 2 bacillus 24 8 and geobacillus 19 6 chen et al 2020 it should be noted that higher temperature 85 c might result in inactivation of most enzymes and decrease the bacterial abundance and diversity and thus it may inhibit the biodegradation of mps chen et al 2020 3 3 2 4 organic matter dissolved organic matter dom in the aquatic environment and soil organic matter som in the terrestrial environment play important roles in mp photo degradation and biodegradation cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020c due to their abundant chromophores e g aromatic rings and carboxyl groups dom and som serve as photosensitizers and produce hydrated electron excited triplet states o2 oh and 1o2 li et al 2015 which promote the mp photo aging process liu et al 2019c suggested that dom in the taihu lake and yangtze river might be an important factor leading to different photo aging rates of pp and ps mps furthermore dom and som are considered as some of the most important carbon sources for microorganisms in water and soil environments xue et al 2012 however blöcker et al 2020 found that pp and ldpe mps were barely biodegradable in soil the results might be attributed to the short incubation time 28 days and low mobility of dom and som in soil future work should determine the relationship between dom som and mp biodegradation at long term research sites 3 3 2 5 salinity and ion species salinity and ion species affect the photo degradation rate of mps in the aquatic ecosystem by influencing depth of uv penetration and radical reaction increasing salinity results in a high refractive index of water and the formation of attached salt crystals on the mp surface which thus protect mps from photo degradation by decreasing the absorption efficiency of light cai et al 2018 ranjan and goel 2019 hco3 and cl are considered as the main ions in freshwater and seawater respectively chen et al 2019a hansard et al 2011 which can scavenge oh with reaction constants of 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively liao et al 2001 therefore cl and hco3 in natural water might weaken the promotion effect of oh on photo aging however the common trace metal ions e g iron and manganese in natural water act as catalysts to oxidize and break mp chains under light irradiation leonas 1993 3 3 2 6 biofilm formation the surfaces of mps with various chemical compositions roughness and densities can serve as substrates for biofilm formation especially in aquatic environments turgay et al 2019 biofilms can either promote the deterioration of the structure of mps by secreting enzymes and slime matter or inhibit photo aging and the mechanical breakdown process because the formed dense layer can shield the surface from light irradiation and shear forces yuan et al 2020 at the same time biofilms can increase the density of mps such as pe mps and result in their sinking to the bottom of the water column bråte et al 2018 settlement further leads to the exposure of mps to low temperatures and weak light which may consequently inhibit the photo aging process or thermal degradation 4 impact of weathering on properties of microplastics 4 1 surface functional groups in general weathering promotes the generation of different oxygen containing functional groups mainly c o oh and co on the surface of mps ding et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c most studies have used the carbonyl index ci and the hydroxyl index hi determined by ftir to evaluate the weathering degree of mps wu et al 2020a the types and generation order of oxygen containing functional groups depend on the weathering process and environmental conditions in an aqueous environment the phenolic hydroxyl group was preferentially formed on the surface of ps mps because of excessive hydrogen atoms while in a dry environment the c o group was more likely to be formed under uv irradiation mao et al 2020 moreover under uvb irradiation for 12 months the surface of pp mps evolved into oh and c o groups but only the oh group was observed after thermal weathering at 50 c for 12 months or at 100 c for 6 months tang et al 2019 4 2 color change most mps can undergo visible color changes which is considered as an intuitive indicator of weathering behavior luo et al 2020d a colorimeter is applied to measure the color intensity of pristine and weathered mps based on the cie 1976 l a b color system robertson 1977 an increase in the value of l indicates that the color of mps is lightening robertson 1977 the color coordinates a and b represent the red green coordinate and the yellow blue coordinate respectively robertson 1977 the total color change δe of mps is calculated and considered as an index of color change according to eq 1 robertson 1977 1 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where l a and b are the differences between pristine and weathered values of l a and b respectively a laboratory study demonstrated that the δe value of pristine pe mps increased drastically from 0 to 8 4 after a 6 week exposure to a xenon lamp luo et al 2020d this phenomenon indicated that the chromaticity of mps was primarily correlated with the oxidation reaction luo et al 2020d during the chemical weathering process yellow discoloration is a common aging result for most of the white off white or translucent mps which is attributed to the formation of chromophores during the aging process battulga et al 2020 for example phenolic antioxidants in mps are oxidized into by products with quinoidal structures that result in a yellow discoloration of mps battulga et al 2020 4 3 size and surface morphology the decrease in particle size and increase in surface roughness are frequently observed for weathered mps liu et al 2019c song et al 2017 the mechanical forces from wave wind and sand abrasion lead to the loss of mechanical stability in which the tensile strength of mps is an important factor liu et al 2019c song et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 a c the photo aging process causes the formation of a brittle surface and cracks on the mp surface which can accelerate the fragmentation rate after the action of physical forces after exposure to uv 12 months and subsequent mechanical abrasion 2 months the fragment number of ldpe pp and expanded ps was 699 569 and 2 times more than those with only mechanical abrasion for 2 months respectively moreover sem images of aged pp mps showed obvious pits microcracks grooves or broken edges on their surfaces as shown in fig 3d song et al 2017 correspondingly the mean particle size of mps decreased along with the increase in the number of fragments zhu et al 2020a 4 4 crystallinity an increase in crystallinity can be considered as an index of the weathering of mps wu et al 2020a weathering preferentially degrades the amorphous portion of plastics thus increasing the percentage of the crystallization region mcgivney et al 2020 the shorter chains from chain scission can crystallize more readily than longer chains due to their higher mobility and this accelerates the re crystallization process in later stages of the weathering process andrady 2017 julienne et al 2019a the degree of crystallinity of mps is measured by an x ray diffractometer xrd and differential scanning calorimetry dsc mcgivney et al 2020 wu et al 2020a the xrd patterns shown in fig 4 indicated that the weathering process improved the crystallinity of ps mps which increased in the order of pristine ps 62 5 seawater aged ps 63 9 uv aged ps in seawater 65 0 uv aged ps 66 8 wu et al 2020a moreover the dsc exotherms revealed that the presence of biofilms increased the crystallinity of pe mps by 3 2 mcgivney et al 2020 4 5 leaching of chemicals weathering of mps can leach chemicals such as additives monomers and oxygenated intermediates as shown in table 3 luo et al 2020b zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b the released additives mainly include endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs e g phthalate and bisphenols and metal ions e g cr6 and pb2 in the aqueous environment dissolved organic carbon and co2 were major by products of mps through chain scission and oxidation reactions in an aquatic environment under uv irradiation ward et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b in addition light irradiation promotes chemical leaching because the formation of cracks and fragments in the weathered mps provides a larger contact area for chemicals with oxygen or for the aqueous solution luo et al 2020b for mps sampled from the north pacific gyre the leaching rate of doc in light 0 235 0 003 mg g 1 d 1 was 10 times faster than that in the dark zhu et al 2020b by contrast other studies reported that uv irradiation decreased the concentrations of some released chemicals such as organotin and doc because of their photodegradation volatilization and reabsorption onto the mp surface chen et al 2019a romera castillo et al 2018 5 interactions between weathered microplastics and coexisting constituents the increased surface area and hydrophilicity of weathered mps are of great importance for the interaction between weathered mps and other coexisting constituents which includes adsorption of inorganic organic contaminants and homo hetero aggregation with other coexisting solid constituents liu et al 2019b 2020b wang et al 2020b these weathering induced environmental behaviors further affect transport and bioavailability to organisms of mps liu et al 2019b 5 1 sorption of inorganic contaminants weathered microplastics can promote the absorption of potentially toxic elements including heavy metals and metalloids via ion complexation hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction forces as shown in fig 5 dong et al 2020 wang et al 2020b weathered mps have a positive correlation between their adsorption capacities for the inorganic contaminants and ci values in aqueous solution indicating that the degree of weathering of mps influences the adsorption ability of heavy metal ions and metalloid ions mao et al 2020 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2019 a 1 6 fold increase of equilibrium zn2 adsorption capacity was observed by 300 h uv aged pet mps 86 8 μg g 1 over the pristine mps 54 7 μg g 1 in aqueous solution wang et al 2020b the higher adsorption capacities of weathered mps are principally due to the following three reasons 1 increased chapped wrinkled and rough surfaces of weathered mps provide more active sites than pristine mps for contaminants fu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b 2 oxygen containing functional groups strengthen the interaction forces between mps and metal cations by ion complexation and hydrogen bonding brennecke et al 2016 mao et al 2020 and 3 increased electronegativity on aged mp surfaces enables greater electrostatic attraction between metal cations and mps yang et al 2019 in addition biofilms on weathered mps have been shown to act as vectors of metal cations the eps in biofilms include oh and c o groups promoting cu2 adsorption onto the surface of pe mps via complexation wang et al 2020d which highlights the probable effect of biofilms on migration and transformation of inorganic contaminants in the environment biofilm coverage can change the mechanism of cu2 diffusion from intra particle diffusion of pristine mps into film diffusion of aged mps which facilitates cu2 adsorption wang et al 2020d 5 2 sorption of organic contaminants as shown in fig 5 hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction play dominant roles for sorption of hydrophilic organic contaminants e g tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on weathered surfaces of mps due to increased oxygen containing functional groups high hydrophilicity and electronegativity liu et al 2019a wu et al 2020b compared to pristine mps the maximum adsorption capacity of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin on uv aged pla mps increased by 2 2 from 2 5 to 5 5 mg g 1 and 1 2 from 3 2 to 3 8 mg g 1 fold respectively fan et al 2021 on the contrary a decrease of hydrophobic interaction forces is the primary reason for lower adsorption capacity for hydrophobic organic contaminants hoc on weathered mps for example the equilibrium sorption capacity of 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether bde 47 on uv aged ps mps 3 75 ng g 1 decreased to half of that for the pristine ps 6 16 ng g 1 wu et al 2020a in addition π π interaction was shown to be the key interaction mechanism between pristine ps mps and aromatic compounds although the π π interaction might be weakened due to the opening of phenyl rings of ps mps during the uv aging process liu et al 2020b 2020c the interaction seems to play a minor role compared with the above interaction forces on weathered mps 5 3 homo aggregation or hetero aggregation with other solid particles 5 3 1 homo aggregation of weathered mps weathered mps can influence their aggregation behavior mainly by changing hydrophilic interaction electrostatic interaction van der waals interaction and biofilm formation fig 6 ultraviolet irradiation inhibited the homo aggregation of ps nps 50 100 nm in nacl solutions which was primarily because the formed oxygen containing functional groups on the ps np surface improved the electrostatic repulsion between two approaching particles liu et al 2019d similar phenomena were observed in the soil environment liu et al 2019b under uv irradiation the surface oxidation of ps nps increased their negative charges and hydrophilicity in saturated loamy sand thus decreasing the aggregation of mps liu et al 2019b by contrast uv light promoted the aggregation of aged ps nps in cacl2 solutions which resulted from the bridging effect between the formed oxygen containing functional groups and ca2 liu et al 2019d in water environments most of the mp surfaces were covered by biofilms which secreted sticky eps served as tackiness agents which subsequently accelerating homo aggregation of mps michels et al 2018 additionally nps formed by mp fragmentation via mechanical weathering e g shear forces were prone to homo aggregation which was attributed to the increased surface energy nanoplastics with high surface energy tended to aggregate to minimize their gibbs free energy and reached a stable state enfrin et al 2020 however the aggregates were readily dispersed by repeated shear forces due to their low cohesion forces low van der waals force enfrin et al 2020 5 3 2 hetero aggregation of weathered mps with other particles weathering of mps has a greater impact on hetero aggregation of mps with other solid particles than homo aggregation due to the abundance of coexisting solid constituents in the natural environment alimi et al 2018 michels et al 2018 investigated the effect of biofilms on the hetero aggregation between pe mps and biogenic particles phytoplankton in the aquatic environment with the naked eye they were able to observe hetero aggregate formation by pristine ps mps in seawater with phytoplankton after one day while biofilm covered ps mps hetero aggregates with biogenic particles were obvious just after a few hours however the interaction of weathered mps with other solid particles e g suspended sediments and microalgae in water has yet to be elucidated 6 knowledge gaps and future recommendations 6 1 evaluate the weathering process under actual environmental conditions most published studies have concentrated on investigating the weathering of mps under laboratory simulated environments chen et al 2019a enfrin et al 2020 luo et al 2020c and only a few studies have focused on the weathering of mps under natural environmental conditions chen et al 2020 tu et al 2020 even though weathering phenomena and mechanisms have been concluded from these studies it is controversial whether the laboratory simulated conditions represent environmentally relevant systems for example photo weathering experiments with mps commonly use a xenon lamp to simulate sunlight however the latitude longitude solar elevation angle and meteorological conditions determine the intensity and spectral distribution of sunlight casado et al 2019 which cause the difference between mp weathering with a xenon lamp and natural sunlight some potential influencing factors e g ions natural organic matter and plant secretions might exert an influence on the mp weathering furthermore most mps undergo various weathering processes at the same time in natural environments which results in complexity and uncertainty of the weathering behavior and mechanisms considering the complexity of natural systems and the weathering processes future studies should explore multiple weathering behaviors and mechanisms of mps under actual aquatic or terrestrial environmental conditions 6 2 consider the effect of microplastic diversity on weathering most weathering studies of mps have used traditional and spherical plastic particles such as pp ps pe pvc and pet recently mps with irregular shape and new plastics including biodegradable mps e g polyhydroxy butyrate and functional mps e g carboxyl modified ps are being released into natural environments gonzalez pleiter et al 2019 wang et al 2020c and they have been rarely considered in weathering studies meanwhile different types of mps co exist in the field however only a single type of mps is used in weathering experiments which ignores the mutual influence or competition among mps for instance the excited state of the benzene ring 4 59 ev on ps could transfer energy to the excited state of the carbonyl 4 09 ev on pp by an intramolecular energy transfer process then the energy can break the ch bond of pp generating more high activity tertiary carbon radicals under uv irradiation waldman and de paoli 2008 more research should be carried out using new synthetic irregularly shaped and mixed mps as model particles to provide a more reasonable understanding of mp weathering 6 3 improve the understanding of the weathering process in soils or sediments factors influencing the weathering processes of mps have been mainly studied in aquatic environments with little attention paid to terrestrial environments in addition to biological phenomena mechanical degradation photo degradation and thermal degradation may also influence the distribution and fate of mps in soils research investigating the influence of soil conditions e g moisture content mineral materials microbial species and soil physico chemical parameters on the mp weathering processes is urgently needed previous studies have suggested that sediments in the ocean and river estuaries accumulate mps and become long term sinks for mps xu et al 2020b zhang et al 2020b the anaerobic environment and special microbial habitat of sediments may result in mps undergoing anaerobic biodegradation and mechanical fragmentation it is of great importance to focus on the weathering processes of mps in soils or sediments where the low oxygen content and weak light intensity may limit the extent of photo weathering reactions 6 4 strengthen research on the interaction between weathered mps and coexisting constituents in water environments the stability and mobility of mps change during the aging process because of altered zeta potentials surface areas roughness and hydrophobicity wang et al 2020b wu et al 2020a these altered physicochemical properties may also influence the interaction of mps with other solid particles hetero aggregation of weathered mps in water remains elusive how and whether the aging process interferes with homo aggregation and hetero aggregation of weathered mps with other particles in terrestrial environments are unknown due to the lack of separation identification and quantification methods for particle size of mp aggregates research regarding the interaction of weathered mps with other pollutants has mainly concentrated on the sorption of a single heavy metal or organic matter dong et al 2020 wang et al 2020b competitive adsorption of weathered mps for mixed pollutants needs to be studied because many heavy metals and organic pollutants co exist in natural environments weathered mps can release additives monomers or oxygenated intermediates which may be reabsorbed onto the surfaces of mps liu et al 2020b further work is needed to better understand the effect of the reabsorption process on heavy metals and organic pollutants 6 5 concern mp weathering process in waste water most previous research has concentrated on the weathering of mps in natural water and sporadically research has considered the soil but ignored the weathering process in waste water e g landfill leachates which is also a major source of mps large amounts of plastic waste disposed in landfills or dumpsites are subjected to multiple weathering processes which depend upon leachate ph 4 5 9 salinity concentration of heavy metals and organic pollutants and bacterial communities he et al 2019 sun et al 2021 for example the transition metals in landfills or leachates e g fe and cu might promote the decomposition of organic molecules e g rooh and thus accelerate polymer weathering hou et al 2021 further research is needed to investigate the weathering processes in waste water under the influence of complex field conditions that are different from those in the natural ambient environment e g surface water 7 conclusions the weathering of mps is an important process determining their transport transformation and interactions with contaminants and microorganisms in water and soil sources of mps are usually linked to anthropogenic activities including refuse in landfills biowaste application plastic film utilization and wastewater discharge microplastics undergo various weathering processes including mechanical fragmentation photo degradation thermal degradation and biodegradation the physicochemical properties of mps and environmental conditions affect the degree of their weathering generally mps which have a small size and large specific surface area provide many reaction sites mps with a low degree of crystallinity facilitate the diffusion of oxygen water molecules and radicals which accelerate the weathering rate however some factors have opposing effects on the weathering of mps for example biofilm formation on mp surfaces promotes plastic biodegradation but inhibits photo degradation the surface property modification of mps resulting from weathering strongly affects the sorption or aggregation of weathered mps and other coexisting constituents by influencing interactive forces such as hydrogen bond interaction hydrophilic interaction electrostatic interaction and van der waals interaction to predict fully the fate and environmental interactions of mps more knowledge is needed concerning the in situ weathering behavior of different types of mps that co exist in natural aquatic and terrestrial environments

17062,despite advances in conceptual understanding single stressor abatement approaches remain common in the management of fresh waters even though they can produce unexpected ecological responses when multiple stressors interact here we identify limitations restricting the development of multiple stressor management strategies and address these bridging theory and practice within a novel empirical framework those critical limitations include that i monitoring schemes fall short of accounting for theory on relationships between multiple stressor interactions and ecological responses ii current empirical modelling approaches neglect the prevalence and intensity of multiple stressor interactions and iii mechanisms of stressor interactions are often poorly understood we offer practical recommendations for the use of empirical models and experiments to predict the effects of freshwater degradation in response to changes in multiple stressors demonstrating this approach in a case study drawing on our framework we offer practical recommendations to support the development of effective management strategies in three general multiple stressor scenarios graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords antagonism synergism interactions lakes rivers restoration management 1 introduction 1 1 freshwater ecosystems under stress freshwater ecosystems are commonly exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors which can interact and produce ecological surprises ormerod et al 2010 while conceptual understanding and experimental demonstration of these interactions are now well established schäfer and piggott 2018 a major challenge remains to develop approaches to detect quantify and manage stressor interactions in the real world feld et al 2016 to inform this development various attempts have been made to assess the frequency of stressor interactions across a broad range of freshwater ecosystems birk 2019 these endeavours have identified issues that limit our capacity to generalise and predict undesirable ecological responses to single stressor reduction strategies more conspicuously very few published studies have demonstrated the successful management of single or multiple stressors where interactions and hierarchies have first been quantified this inability to generalise poses a problem for ecosystem management which has historically focussed on abating individual stressors schindler et al 2016 well informed multiple stressor management could offer opportunities to offset effects of large scale stressors that are hard to manage locally including anthropogenic warming and changes in precipitation patterns associated with climate change moss et al 2011 or the widespread proliferation of synthetic chemicals bernhardt et al 2017 and toxic substances from industrial and domestic sources walters et al 2020 there is an urgent need to develop methods to diagnose multiple stressor interactions and assess responses of ecological indicators to them across both degradation and recovery pathways these methods must be applicable to data gathered at different scales and resolutions blair et al 2019 here we demonstrate how empirical data on fresh waters can underpin effective management of ecosystems subject to multiple stressors specifically we explore how theory on multiple stressor interactions and ecological responses is relevant to empirical data particularly from national monitoring schemes such as those stipulated by the eu water framework directive wfd european commission 2000 or the usa federal water pollution control act 2002 the clean water act we argue however for greater integration of understanding from such monitoring data with outcomes of experiments and modelling finally we build on this understanding to develop practical recommendations for integrating the assessment and management of multiple stressors into future freshwater management and biodiversity protection strategies highlighting limitations that remain to be addressed 1 2 the conceptual basis of stressor interactions conceptual models describing forms and directions of stressor interactions have predominantly focused on quantifying and classifying deviations from additive effects models piggott et al 2015a effects are defined as additive when an ecological response is equal to the sum of the effects of the individual stressors synergistic interactions occur when ecological responses are greater than the sum of the additive effects and antagonistic interactions where ecological responses are less than the sum of the additive effects fig 1 additive effects indicate that stressors act independently of one another and so control of any one stressor should result in exactly proportional ecological responses under such a scenario gradual changes in ecological response should be detected in monitoring data hillebrand et al 2020 such data may reveal ecological improvements that are greater than expected when stressors producing synergistic interactions are mitigated in contrast reduction of an antagonistic stressor could result counter intuitively in the detection of further ecological degradation through monitoring piggott et al 2015b extended this basic model by considering the cumulative magnitude and direction of effects this revealed cross over interactions where combined stressor effects cancel each other and can lead to effects opposite to those of the individual effects this phenomenon has been called mitigating synergism piggott et al 2015b or reversal jackson et al 2016 2 moving from theory to practice detection prediction management the prevalence of interactions across scales and ecosystem types is increasingly recognised an assessment of more than 100 000 water bodies across europe reported under the 2nd wfd river basin management cycle 2009 2015 showed that 50 of them were affected by two or more stressors most commonly hydromorphological modifications and nutrient pollution eea 2018 likewise based on 174 pairwise stressor combinations from experiments and surveys across europe birk et al 2020 report that one third exhibited detectable interactions and confirmed nutrient pollution as the most common and dominant stressor i e explained the greatest variation in the response variables in the empirical models although its effects may be moderated by warming and increasing humic content across lakes with alterations of flow and channel morphology being widespread stressors in rivers similar data syntheses across other regions rigosi et al 2014 and ecosystem types can inform large scale adaptive and mitigative interventions in response to climate change however these endeavours must be based on a methodology providing robust comparisons across ecosystem types and geographical regions 2 1 detection of multiple stressor interactions the application of quantitative methodologies to detect multiple stressor interactions involves a number of key challenges firstly current conceptual frameworks disagree on the null model for expected responses to non interacting stressors at least three null models feature in current frameworks additive multiplicative and dominance and the choice affects the classification of interaction type côté et al 2016 schäfer and piggott 2018 current ecological analyses often employ generalised linear models glms and their extensions however it is not widely appreciated that the null model for the interaction is set by the glm link function or any transformation of the dependant response variable e g gaussian additive null model poisson or logarithmic multiplicative null model binomial unspecified null model thus in many cases interactions are statistically tested without reference to current interaction frameworks while one component of the interaction dominance is not captured by any statistical framework greater awareness of how model design influences testing for interactions is needed to avoid statistical pitfalls in informing environmental management secondly stressors may vary in their intensity of effect and stressor gradient lengths differ amongst studies and data collections both factors can markedly influence the outcome of multiple stressor analyses where interactions may lurk outside the data range notably large datasets covering wide spatial or temporal scales tend to encompass longer gradients and reveal stronger interactions feld et al 2016 schinegger et al 2016 thirdly paired stressor interactions may not capture the full complexity of outcomes yet are most commonly applied gessner and tlili 2016 constraining the scope for detection of higher order interactions feld et al 2016 in addition stressors can affect multiple ecosystem components with the predominant types of interactions varying amongst levels of ecological organisation individuals populations communities and the specific response variables considered côté et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 gieswein et al 2017 including functional traits schinegger et al 2016 finally a key factor in determining the detection of stressor interactions is sample size which will co vary positively with the statistical power of the interaction term thus more emphasis should be given to identifying interaction forms e g antagonism synergism and mutualism and effect sizes and to estimating their importance using information theoretic approaches rather than reporting significance levels e g p 0 05 when interpreting model outputs wasserstein et al 2019 2 2 increasing confidence in prediction there are promising ways forward here specifically to improve understanding of the processes underlying ecosystem responses to stressor interactions we advocate novel analyses that combine large scale observations and controlled experiments to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches controlled experiments unravel cause and effect relationships by allowing unequivocal comparisons of ecosystem state amongst levels of anthropogenic stress and the attribution of ecological responses to theoretically defined interactions richardson et al 2019 however experimental settings necessarily simplify real world situations moreover complex higher order interactions can be difficult to assess in controlled experiments where the number of experimental units is limited even in outdoor mesocosms piggott et al 2015b richardson et al 2019 in contrast assessments based on large scale datasets are commonly statistically unbalanced suffer from a multitude of confounding factors that cannot be teased apart and rarely include controls bull et al 2020 the key strength of this approach however is that the assessments reflect real world responses to stressor gradients encompassing complex responses of networks of species interacting in natural communities across scales bruder et al 2019 clearly an integrated experimental and observational approach is beneficial birk et al 2020 but also potentially expensive and time consuming however where complex interactions are detected and likely to confound recovery this approach is likely a worthwhile investment to inform costly management interventions 2 3 towards a novel multiple stressor management framework a general framework for predicting ecological responses to multiple stressor management is overdue côté et al 2016 in particular there is a pressing need to move from conceptual diagrams towards real world context to underpin management decisions fig 1 given the volume and heterogeneity of available data such a framework needs to be flexible it should draw on data collected across various scales both spatial and temporal from small mesocosm experiments to large river basins and from hours to millennia practically it is essential to understand when controlling stressors at local scales e g reducing local nutrient pollution can mitigate effects of global stressors not locally manageable e g climate warming brown et al 2013 we propose a unifying approach that is underpinned by empirical linear models that quantify and visualise multiple stressor interactions in the context of ecological targets the first step is to develop a theoretically justified and well fitting statistical model to describe multiple stressor interactions in the given ecosystem box 1 the exact model design will depend on both the expertise of the analyst and the data structure therefore we focus here on a generalised linear mixed modelling gl m m framework gl m ms are widely used and flexible enough to accommodate different data types and implicit grouping structures e g year or site random effects and have established model selection procedures for optimising the quantification of stressor fixed effects box 1 once a model has been developed it can be used to examine stressor change scenarios relevant to potential management actions fig 1 using the gl m m we can investigate both i the expected value of the ecological indicator in response to stressor change calculated using the fixed effect coefficients and link function and ii the probability of exceeding a critical threshold or meeting a management target calculated from the fixed effect coefficients and distributions of residual errors and random effect variances we have developed this multiple stressor mitigation approach within a series of conceptual models fig 1 box 1 assuming for simplicity similar individual stressor effect sizes within the interactions in the additive stressor scenario the most effective strategy for ecosystem management would be dual stressor control with the extent of management intervention depending on the distance between the current ecosystem state and the ecological target on a plane defined by the stressor gradients the path to recovery can require that longer distances are covered when synergistic interactions occur between stressors meaning that the stressor abatement required to reach a given ecological target is greater than under the assumption of an additive relationship in the case of an antagonistic interaction for example the romanian rivers case study in fig 1 single stressor control e g reduction of no3 n at high concentrations of toxic substances could even be counterproductive as dampening stressor effects are removed 3 practical recommendations for multiple stressor management the current shortcomings of multiple stressor management outlined above are global in scope this represents a clear weakness in ecological assessments underpinning for example the european wfd carvalho et al 2019 indeed nearly all wfd assessment methods have been developed to be responsive to single stressors birk et al 2012 this raises the question to what extent the currently limited success in restoring water bodies in europe is the result of targeting only single stressors drawing on our framework we offer practical recommendations for three general scenarios to support the development of novel multiple stressor management strategies for fresh waters 1 additive stressors additive stressors represent the simplest case where a dominant stressor does not notably interact with other stressors it is evident that priority must be given here to mitigating impacts of the dominant stressor to achieve improvements kath et al 2018 where two or more stressors act additively and with equal strength either stressor can be controlled to achieve the same effect prioritisation of abatement of one stressor or the other can be guided by evaluating cost effectiveness and expected treatment efficacy as well as opportunities to achieve added benefits e g habitat creation through wetland management to reduce nutrient loading to lakes beyond the direct abatement effects 2 two interacting stressors where two stressors interact the type of interaction and the underlying mechanisms need to be considered when selecting measures if the interaction is antagonistic the most complex case facing managers the combined stressor effect can be less than expected for example a nutrient enrichment effect on lake phytoplankton biomass caused by land use change might be dampened by an increase in flushing rate associated with increased rainfall caused by climate change especially in lakes with short retention times for lakes with long retention times an increase in precipitation may have the opposite effect as it can increase nutrient loading thus it is important to understand the lake and catchment context to assess vulnerability in relation to predicted changes in nutrient loading non antagonist and nutrient losses from the lake due to changes in flushing rate antagonist conversely when stressors interact synergistically as observed for phytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance in relation to nutrient enrichment and warming richardson et al 2019 nutrient control may need to be reinforced to achieve ecological improvements or warming be restricted for example through hydrological control or both 3 more than two interacting stressors where three or more stressors act to produce higher order interactions stressor hierarchies need to be identified to enable prioritisation of mitigation measures knowledge on individual effects and two way interactions can help inform the potential for higher order interactions however it must be recognised that conclusions derived from such analyses can be misleading especially where higher order interactions are important for example ryo et al 2018 report on higher order interactions driving macroinvertebrate diversity in swiss rivers diversity increased with terrestrial forest cover dominant stressor but this effect was moderated by interactions with both elevation gradient and climatic conditions where biotic relationships are complex and dominant stressors are absent uncertainties in model predictions are likely to be high bruder et al 2019 in this case experimentation will be vital to managing the risk of undesirable mitigation effects if the control of three or more stressors is deemed practically impossible to achieve experimentally managers may have little option but to consider phased mitigation approaches dyste and valett 2019 coupled with adaptive management responses spears et al 2016 4 final considerations three final points need brief mention first in a very recent broad synthesis hillebrand et al 2020 found ecological responses to stressors along the degradation pathway are generally gradual this finding is highly relevant to water management where notable system changes are expected only when thresholds at times arbitrary or operational thresholds are surpassed secondly our current understanding of multiple stressor effects essentially comes from assessing impacts of increasing stress that is the ecosystem degradation pathway birk et al 2020 spears et al 2021 whereas there is still much to learn about the processes governing recovery especially where multiple stressor interactions are operating for example it remains unknown whether multiple stressor interactions increase the likelihood that recovery trajectories depart from degradation pathways a phenomenon known as hysteresis which requires further conceptual experimental and empirical attention finally no study has yet demonstrated the successful management of a freshwater ecosystem in which multiple stressor interactions have been identified and quantified and used to inform interventions nevertheless the freshwater scientific community has an impressive historical resource in long term monitoring data covering past restoration case studies with which to address this issue it is important that this resource be utilised to produce systematic evidence bernhardt et al 2005 across a large number of fresh waters for which both ecosystem degradation and recovery data are available elosegi et al 2017 where recovery has been incomplete following single stressor management or has occurred slowly e g jeppesen et al 2005 mccrackin et al 2016 and for which multiple stressor interactions are operating but have not yet been tested verdonschot et al 2013 we propose building this evidence base using the approach presented here to retrospectively analyse and report on data from past degradation and restoration case studies 5 conclusions 1 the lack of consideration of interactions between multiple stressors represent a potential major limitation in achieving ecological restoration of freshwater ecosystems 2 conceptual models for multiple stressor interactions can be developed to inform novel management approaches helping practitioners avoid the many pitfalls associated with the detection of interactions 3 outputs from empirical analyses of monitoring data and controlled experiments in realistic settings should be systematically combined to guide multiple stressor management strategies for example to support climate change resilience planning 4 empirical models can be constructed based on past data covering both stressor increase and decrease to provide novel insights into the effects of interactions on both ecosystem degradation

17062,despite advances in conceptual understanding single stressor abatement approaches remain common in the management of fresh waters even though they can produce unexpected ecological responses when multiple stressors interact here we identify limitations restricting the development of multiple stressor management strategies and address these bridging theory and practice within a novel empirical framework those critical limitations include that i monitoring schemes fall short of accounting for theory on relationships between multiple stressor interactions and ecological responses ii current empirical modelling approaches neglect the prevalence and intensity of multiple stressor interactions and iii mechanisms of stressor interactions are often poorly understood we offer practical recommendations for the use of empirical models and experiments to predict the effects of freshwater degradation in response to changes in multiple stressors demonstrating this approach in a case

graphical abstract keywords antagonism synergism interactions lakes rivers restoration management 1 introduction 1 1 freshwater ecosystems under stress freshwater ecosystems are commonly exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors which can interact and produce ecological surprises ormerod et al 2010 while conceptual understanding and experimental demonstration of these interactions are now well established schäfer and piggott 2018 a major challenge remains to develop approaches to detect quantify and manage stressor interactions in the real world feld et al 2016 to inform this development various attempts have been made to assess the frequency of stressor interactions across a broad range of freshwater ecosystems birk 2019 these endeavours have identified issues that limit our capacity to generalise and predict undesirable ecological responses to single stressor reduction strategies more conspicuously very few published studies have demonstrated the successful management of single or multiple stressors where interactions and hierarchies have first been quantified this inability to generalise poses a problem for ecosystem management which has historically focussed on abating individual stressors schindler et al 2016 well informed multiple stressor management could offer opportunities to offset effects of large scale stressors that are hard to manage locally including anthropogenic warming and changes in precipitation patterns associated with climate change moss et al 2011 or the widespread proliferation of synthetic chemicals bernhardt et al 2017 and toxic substances from industrial and domestic sources walters et al 2020 there is an urgent need to develop methods to diagnose multiple stressor interactions and assess responses of ecological indicators to them across both degradation and recovery pathways these methods must be applicable to data gathered at different scales and resolutions blair et al 2019 here we demonstrate how empirical data on fresh waters can underpin effective management of ecosystems subject to multiple stressors specifically we explore how theory on multiple stressor interactions and ecological responses is relevant to

station network also dwm systems are often the only option in rural areas where there are no sewage transport networks this paper aims at addressing the question of the degree to which dwm systems can be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view using the life cycle assessment lca methodology first the environmental sustainability is investigated to identify environmental hotspots in two nature based and engineered onsite dwm systems second dwm scenarios are compared against centralised wastewater management cwm scenarios using a whole systems approach finally the boundary conditions under which a given dwm scenario performs better than a cwm scenario are discussed results show cwm scenarios were less sustainable than dwm scenarios on the resources endpoint due to their sewer infrastructures however cwm scenarios performed better than dwm scenarios on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges while on human health no clear conclusion could be drawn finally for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios did not score superior performances compared to dwm scenarios on all three endpoint indicators yet for a greater number of households it was impossible to decide in favour of decentralisation because of a lack of favourable consensus on all three endpoint

domestic wastewater at or near its point of generation crites and tchobanoglous 1998 wilderer and schreff 2000 dwm handles relatively small volumes of wastewater originating from single households or groups of dwellings located in relatively close proximity indicatively less than 3 km maximum or in peri urban development clusters not yet served by a central sewer system connecting them to a regional wastewater treatment plant wwtp in dwm a local collection system is still necessary yet this will be much smaller and less expensive and require less extensive excavation works than those used for conventional centralized wastewater management cwm in literature the maximum size of dwm systems can range from 50 person equivalents pe to 10 000 pe or 1000 m3 van afferden et al 2015 this great variability can be explained by the fact that decentralisation in wastewater treatment can consist of from one to several dwm systems from individual onsite systems to a series of larger clusters or semi centralised plants capodaglio et al 2016 libralato et al 2012 in this study dwm systems refer solely to onsite treatment systems designed for individual households presently urban

climatic change pressures and ii closed water loops with a greater proximity of point of use reuse of water resources instead of classical linear uses disposal capodaglio et al 2016 despite the increasing attention focused on decentralised approaches in uwm however it remains unclear to what degree centralised or decentralised wastewater management systems should be installed in a particular region to provide uwm services with the best environmental efficiency currently the choice between cwm and dwm is mostly driven by purely economic criteria associated with linking sewer pipes and maximising the cwm treatment capacity however we can now consider dwm and cwm systems as functionally equivalent from a technological point of view capodaglio et al 2017 libralato et al 2012 lca can

potential trade offs burden shifting within those systems can be highlighted lca can be applied at four levels corominas et al 2020 however this paper focussed on lca application of uwm at a planning level e g to compare alternative uwm scenarios and at a design level e g to identify environmental hotspots the main aim of the present paper is to further analyse in the context of municipal wastewater management under normal operating conditions dwm and cwm systems on their whole life cycle and using the full breadth of environmental impact categories offered in multi criteria lca specific objectives are to identify principal environmental hotspots for different uwm strategies to consider these strategies in relation to one another and finally to determine whether the dwm systems can achieve better environmental performances than cwm systems 2 materials and methods the steps leading to the environmental assessment of two types of wastewater management systems using the life cycle assessment lca method are presented in this section thus we will follow the recommended scheme of a standardized lca iso 2006a 2006b i goal and scope definition section 2 1 ii inventory analysis and uncertainty assessment sections 2 2 and 2 3 iii impact assessment section 2 4 iv interpretation of results section 3 finally the most salient issues when considering dwm in lca will be discussed section 4 2 1 lca goal and scope definition the goal and scope of the present paper was to address the question of the degree to which dwm systems can be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view we identified three sub objectives i first to investigate environmental hot spots in dwm systems e g system elements driving environmental impacts ii second to compare different wastewater management systems using a whole systems approach e g comprising of the two sub subsystems sewers and wastewater treatment wwt systems and iii finally to determine the environmental break even points where the resource and energy consumption in cwm systems would outweigh those incurred in dwm systems despite the economies of scale in cwm systems the scope of the study covers discharges generated under normal operating conditions by uwm systems as well as the infrastructures of the sewer network if centralised and treatment units and operational inputs e g electricity for pumping stormwater discharges and uwm functioning as investigated in risch et al 2014 are out of the scope of this study 2 1 1 basic uwm scenarios among wwt systems designed for cwm this study included a conventional activated sludge wwt1 as and a french vertical flow constructed wetland dotro et al 2017 used as small scale system wwt2 vf cw in a more decentralised approach vertical and horizontal constructed wetlands in series wwt3 v h cw and septic tanks and sand filters in series wwt4 st sf are routinely used these wwt systems are presented in fig 1 below treatment objectives for the different wwt systems are to comply with secondary effluent quality for discharge in receiving waters however the wwt systems have each different performances in terms of secondary effluent quality and ghg emissions during operation which are described in table s1 annex s1 as sewer networks are strongly dependent on the local urban catchment typology with population density we chose to represent two urban contexts i e with a high density sewer sw1 hd and a medium density sewer sw2 md respectively designed for population densities of 4000 inhabitants km² and 1500 inhabitants km² these sewer networks were modelled after actual towns in the south of france grabels sw1 hd and saussan sw2 md represented in table 1 therefore six different scenarios were constructed to investigate wwt process choice with respect to system scale and sewer type associated to population density these scenarios can be grouped in two categories i centralised wastewater management cwm systems and ii decentralised wastewater management dwm systems fig 2 2 1 2 aim of the study and investigated uwm scenarios the aim of the study is to discuss the environmental sustainability of different uwm scenarios using lca with regards to the three sub objectives identified therefore the following table 2 details the different uwm scenarios investigated and deployed approaches to meet these objectives in order to reach the third objective o3 the dwm scenario was compared with a variant of a cwm scenario where a new settlement was connected to an existing wwtp e g with variable linking sewer section length and elevation as illustrated in fig 3 2 1 3 system boundaries the conceptual diagram in fig 4 presents the chosen system boundaries for uwm scenarios which included the treatment of wastewater in a wwt system i e centralised as or cw or decentralised st sf or cw system the collection and transport in a sewer network where applicable in a cwm context including the sewer pipes servicing residential subdivisions the collection systems on private properties were assumed invariant in both uwm scenarios therefore not modelled in the uwm comparisons by the ceteris paribus condition residential buildings and individual housings were not included in the perimeter of this study in both cwm and dwm scenarios treated effluents were assumed to be discharged in receiving surface waters indeed for onsite dwm systems direct soil emissions soil infiltrations which may reach groundwater were not modelled as such due to lack of data or models in lca for inventory and impact modelling it is to be noted that this lca study does not account for the location specific assimilative capacity of the natural environment to accommodate the treated effluent without detrimental effects for example dwm systems can be allowed to meet basic treatment because they return flows to the environment in a more distributed way whereas cwm systems require proper end of pipe treatment with highly concentrated discharges at a single point source indeed in lca methodology generic receiving water environments are defined at best at country scale sometimes at continent scale depending on the availability of regionalized characterization factors bulle et al 2019 2 1 4 functional unit definition in the following different wastewater management systems were compared using a comparative life cycle assessment lca based on a common unit of comparison since these systems were all designed for wastewater treatment some lca studies used a functional unit on assumed per capita loadings such as the population equivalent pe defined in the european directive 91 271 corominas et al 2020 however this pe is better suited to a generic european centralised context and we proposed to use a more specific functional unit based on the study of pollution loads from french decentralised households comprising of 3 5 persons olivier et al 2019a therefore the chosen functional unit was defined as the collection and treatment of the domestic wastewater loading per inhabitant during a day in a rural setting the first assumption in this study was to define this pollution load termed as the onsite domestic only pollution load li which excludes commercial and industrial loads typically entering municipal wwtps in a centralised sanitation context olivier et al 2019a hence in this context the domestic wastewater loading per capita from one inhabitant was characterized as 46g of bod5 in 100l of wastewater volume second we suggested that municipal wastewater only included the pollution load generated by individual housings with negligible urban pollutants from rainwater stormwater lr and other services ls fig 5 this assumption can be hold for small urban towns such as those selected for the sewer models in this study 2 2 life cycle inventories 2 2 1 pollution loads from domestic sources in non collective sanitation context in order to compare wastewater management systems in a centralised and decentralised context the pollution loads from domestic sources were quantified using recent research choubert et al 2011 coquery et al 2011 olivier et al 2019a therefore the typical loading per inhabitant in an onsite sanitation context is detailed in supporting information s1 a 2 2 2 mass balances for wastewater systems pollutants in untreated wastewater loads entering the uwm systems can be transferred into several compartments to air as primary gaseous emissions to water as treated discharges to local soil onsite if infiltrated or offsite as land spreading of sludge etc it is important to establish a proper mass balance at the wwt process level to ensure consistency in the inventoried mass loads of pollutants therefore in this section we describe the transfer of pollutants e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus species and some trace micropollutants using an equilibrated mass balance at the wwt system level on the septic tank followed by a sand filter wwt4 st sf table 3 equilibrated mass balances for the other three wwt systems are provided in datasets described in supporting information s1 d the objective is to determine accurate data for the life cycle inventory lci for this onsite wwt process the mass balance was completed for the raw wastewater load from an inhabitant in a decentralised sanitation context g inhabitant d 1 to this end the completion of the mass balance required i measured data 107 in situ data points collected from 20 locations over several measurement campaigns in olivier et al 2019 and ii assumptions based on literature review e g gaseous emissions from septic tanks bartram et al 2019 diaz valbuena et al 2011 data sources and values are described in insert table 5 and in the lci datasets provided in a newly developed file format with eldam coste et al 2020 2018 to facilitate dataset exchange from to simapro see supporting information 2 2 3 infrastructure materials and operational inputs material inputs e g required for the construction of the systems and operational inputs e g electricity required for pumping wastewater in a linking sewer section were described in the lci compilation of eldam files in supporting information sections s1 b and s1 c in residential subdivisions of 6 and 45 households sewer elements were modelled with 200 mm diameter hence the 200 mm diameter of the linking section pumping electricity was estimated using a pressure drop calculator for different pipe diameters and an estimated flow rate of 30 m3 h 1 indeed in order to pump wastewater in a linking section from the housing development back into the sewer mains it is necessary to calculate the total dynamic head tdh which is the total equivalent height that a fluid is to be pumped for different elevation values pipe diameter did not influence significantly tdh see supporting information s1 b therefore it was assumed that pipe diameter remain invariant in all scenarios 200 mm diameter 2 3 uncertainty assessment in order to ensure transparency and credibility of the lca results obtained in this study it is critical that the uncertainty sources are quantified and their effects on results are communicated gavankar et al 2015 furthermore the treatment of uncertainty will help interpret differences in the studied systems in the comparative lca e g to determine whether the preference for one system can be questionable due to result uncertainties igos et al 2018 uncertainty ranges for unit processes taken from the ecoinvent 3 database wernet et al 2016 were defined by the data pedigree algorithm available in simapro as proposed by weidema and wesnaes 1996 this algorithm relates the datum uncertainty to its source characteristics i e reliability of the source representativeness of the sample currency of the period geographical correlation technological correlation and sample size the uncertainty ranges associated to infrastructure construction and operation e g amount of materials used amount of energy and ancillary chemicals used during wwtp operation etc are described in table 4 uncertainties related to emissions of major contributing pollutants from wwtp operation were obtained from literature and are summarised in insert table 5 based on uncertainty data in the lci uncertainty propagation in the modelled systems was estimated using a random sampling method the available monte carlo routine in simapro with 1500 runs to yield 95 confidence intervals which are shown in the results plots see results in section 3 fig 7 finally the influences of uncertainty in two key parameters e g varying sewer lifespans around 80 years and a french electricity mix with a major share of nuclear instead of the european average electricity mix used in this study were studied using sensitivity analyses for details see supporting information s1 f 2 4 life cycle impact assessment 2 4 1 lcia method selection presently urban water systems are often confronted with complex challenges associated with the water energy nexus risch et al 2014 in these conditions the use of aggregated endpoint indicators can be much more useful in terms of decision support thus the recipe 2016 v1 03 method huijbregts 2016 was chosen for its harmonised impact assessment framework at two levels in the cause effect chain that is an environmental mechanism of an impact category first midpoint indicators quantify the relative importance of emissions or extractions that occur due to human operations in terms of reference substances e g co2 eq for the global warming category kg so2 eq for acidification next endpoint indicators are calculated to reflect differences between stressors further in the cause effect chain and are of direct societal concern e g human health ecosystem quality and resources 3 results and discussion in order to present lca results as clearly as possible the preliminary contribution analyses are presented first on midpoint indicators to assess life cycle impacts of each stage in dwm systems over a range of impact categories section 3 1 indeed presently dwm systems have been little studied or not studied in detail in multi criteria lca machado et al 2007 however for scenario comparison sections 3 2 and 3 3 an endpoint indicator presentation is then used to facilitate interpretation of impact results only on the three areas of protection commonly used in lca human health ecosystems and resources 3 1 midpoint impacts for decentralised wastewater treatment systems life cycle impact assessment of two decentralised wwt systems wwt3 and wwt4 respectively vertical horizontal cw v h cw and septic tank sand filter st sf are presented for eighteen midpoint categories for the chosen functional unit treatment of 46g of bod5 inhabitant d 1 in fig 6 in the following the underlying rationale for presenting results obtained with the full set of midpoint indicators was to provide transparency regarding i the breadth of midpoint indicators before aggregation at endpoint level avoiding the end point black box effect ii the main contributors to impacts at midpoint level among infrastructure operation sludge end of life and emissions discharges in addition aggregated endpoint indicators human health ecosystems and resources will help support decision making see section 3 2 and table 6 presents the respective contributions of midpoint indicators to endpoints to inform on the degree of relevance of midpoint indicators counting towards the endpoint scores as shown in table 6 eight impact categories showed endpoint contributions greater than 1 hence the comparison between wwt3 and wwt4 can be based on these relevant categories overall wwt4 showed greater impacts than wwt3 on eleven impact categories for both systems the built infrastructure blue dominated the impacts on nine impact categories while discharges to the environment yellow contributed markedly on categories dealing with aquatic ecosystems due to discharges of residual pollutants after wastewater treatment or land spreading sludge application in the end of life regarding global warming greenhouse gasses ghg produced during wwt operation varied in emitted quantities for the two systems for wwt3 co2 was the leading ghg contributor 73 followed by n2o 22 however for wwt4 ch4 was the most important ghg 72 followed by co2 16 and n2o 12 n2o emissions were driving the ozone depletion impact for both systems in the case of wwt4 air emissions of ammonia caused fine particulate formation while wwt3 produced only gaseous dinitrogen and no ammonia regarding non carcinogenic human toxicity the large difference in impact was caused by zinc discharged in effluents in wwt3 while it remained trapped in wwt4 the main differences between these two dwm systems were summarised in insert table 7 in this study the ch4 emissions for a septic tank system were based on the recently updated emission factor defined in the 2019 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories bartram et al 2019 which is slightly greater than the measurements based methane emission factor of 10 7 gch4 pe d 1 diaz et al 2011 research literature is quite scarce on these greenhouse gas emissions hence this advocates for more in situ studies on septic tanks operating in a range of conditions 3 2 uwm system comparison decentralised vs centralised the primary purpose of a uwm system is to mitigate human exposure to harmful pollutants including pathogens as well as to protect the environment from unwanted consequences arising from eutrophication ecotoxicity climate change and finite resources depletion now to address the second study objective which was to investigate how environmentally efficient are cwm systems compared to dwm systems and to provide insight in the impacts incurred by either the wwt or sewer sub systems cwm and dwm systems were compared on the basis of the same functional unit defined in the previous section fig 7 shows the impacts of compared systems on the three endpoints e g human health ecosystems quality and resources with quantified uncertainty for each system represented graphically as error bars impacts from wwt and the sewer sub systems are represented respectively with orange and grey colors overall results showed that cwm systems performed better than dwm systems on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges on resources it was clear that the dwm systems had fewer impacts without the sewer infrastructure regarding human health the best centralised scenario cwm2 cw performed similarly to the best decentralised scenario dwm1 cw but otherwise no clear conclusion can be drawn population density associated with a sewer system size in cwm did not affect significantly on all endpoints but on resources although dwm2 st provided comparable wastewater treatment in terms of effluent quality this scenario had the greatest impacts on human health and ecosystems endpoints mainly due to methane and ammonia gaseous emissions 80 contribution to human health endpoint and 56 contribution to the ecosystems quality endpoint which were highlighted in table 5 despite the processes used in dwm systems have long proven their efficiency in a context of collective sanitation in reality in an onsite sanitation context these treatment systems suffer from highly variable treated effluent quality due to fluctuating loading rates also despite a maintenance contract for on site systems operating activities are rarely performed which may alter system performances all year long olivier et al 2019b these results at endpoint level can be better interpreted with a proper decision support procedure guérin schneider et al 2018 thus it would be possible to conclude that a scenario is better than other only if there is a significant relative difference greater than 15 20 results from a sensitivity analysis on two selected parameters e g sewer lifespan and electricity mix showed that while the sewer lifespan influenced significantly impacts on the resources endpoint the choice of the electricity mix had an even greater influence on all endpoints for details see supporting information s1 f 3 3 boundary conditions for superior environmental impacts of a dwm scenario as outlined in table 2 with respect to the third objective of the study for an hypothetical situation with a new residential settlement a virtual case study was built to investigate the boundary conditions where a dwm scenario with an onsite wwt e g st sf or a vf cw system may perform better on the three endpoint categories compared to a cwm scenario where wastewater is sent for treatment in a centralised wwtp e g as as described in fig 3 in the latter the existing wwtp treatment capacity can be increased without any structural modification to treat the pollution of the new settlement and a new linking sewer section with a pumping station were included to connect the new settlement to the sewer mains boundary conditions on the three endpoint categories were searched by using a range of varying linking sewer length and elevation in the cwm scenarios then the threshold value of linking section lls in km after which the dwm system has a greater impact on the chosen endpoint category was determined using equation 1 and equation 2 where i c w m i and i d w m i are respectively the impacts of cwm and dwm scenarios with respect to the chosen functional unit operational lifetime for the pumping station ltps was set at 30 years while the average lifetime for the sewer network ltsw was defined at 80 years 1 i c w m i i d w m i i w w t 1 i i p s i i n h l t p s i l s i l i n l ls i s w i i n h l t s w i p s e n i p u m p e n e r g y i d w m i 0 2 l l s i n

impacts e g the pumping station ps with its associated energy consumption psen etc variables used are defined in table 8 elevation changes up to 50m did not influence markedly the threshold values for the linking sewer section for a given settlement size e g for 6 houses the threshold value remained around 0 9 and 0 6 km on the human health endpoint as described in fig 8 for full results see supporting information s1 g two side by side comparisons for the dwm scenarios e g dwm1 cw and dwm2 st against the reference cwm scenario featuring an activated sludge and linking sewer section resulted in the determination of tipping lines for each endpoint representing the boundary conditions where dwm scenario performed better than the reference fig 9 and fig 10 dwm scenarios show superior environmental performances than cwm scenarios within a short length of connection to the sewer mains despite the major impact of septic tanks on climate change due to their estimated ch4 emissions results show that for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios do not appear as the best solution i e no superior performances on all three endpoint indicators arising from their significant impacts on the resources used for the construction of infrastructure and energy consumption the intermediate zones highlighted in blue where there where there is no consensus on all indicators it is impossible to decide in favour of a dwm scenario this is in itself an interesting result which means that in this case the environmental criterion is no longer the determining factor between the two uwm solutions and the decision can be taken on the economic dimension e g which is the cheapest option presently regarding the human exposure to harmful pollutants pathogens and their fate pathways in soil are not yet modelled in lca because of high site dependency e g local geological conditions at point of emission in this context this study aims to provide support for decision making solely for dwm in regulatory compliant situations without any risk of human exposure following soil infiltration or discharges in rivers however human exposure routes via inhalation of airborne particles are accounted for in the human health endpoint as well as the safeguarding of the natural environment and finite resources e g ecosystem quality and resources endpoints 4 conclusions and future prospects the aim of the study was to address the question of the degree to which dwm systems would be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view using lca methodology this was achieved with comparisons of different uwm scenarios including cwm and dwm systems lca can provide a valuable contribution to the development of sustainable uwm strategies by identifying environmental hotspots through a life cycle whole systems and multi criteria perspective and drivers of changes major results are highlighted in the following as well as recommendations and challenges on the way to conduct such a lca hypotheses and explanations on the amounts of pollutants in the mass balances for each wastewater treatment system are required to ensure transparency of flows cwm scenarios were less sustainable than dwm scenarios on resources due to their sewer infrastructures however cwm systems performed better than dwm systems on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges while on human health no clear conclusion can be drawn dwm scenarios show superior environmental performances than cwm scenarios within a short length of connection to the sewer mains despite some having significant impacts on climate change due to their ghg emissions e g septic tanks on one hand for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios do not score superior performances on all three endpoint indicators due to their significant impacts on resources used for infrastructure building and energy consumption on the other hand in the intermediate zones highlighted in blue it is impossible to decide in favour of decentralisation because of a lack of favourable consensus on all three endpoint indicators this is in itself an interesting result which means that in this case the environmental criterion is no longer the determining factor between the two uwm solutions and the decision can be taken on the economic dimension e g which is the cheapest option all these results are of course only valid if dwm systems are appropriate regarding local geological conditions to avoid any groundwater contamination which specific case was not modelled in this study the results show that the answers to the question may differ depending on the context local electricity mix housing density and sewer networks though one of the primary purposes of a uwm system is to mitigate human exposure to harmful pollutants including pathogens this study was limited to human exposure to airborne pollutants however this study considered how uwm systems provide protection of the natural environment from unwanted consequences arising from eutrophication ecotoxicity climate change and finite resources depletion benefits stemming from on site water reuse and groundwater recharge in dwm systems were not assessed as well as their resiliency e g failures of single units do not cause the collapse of the whole system or the inclusion of less than optimal performance degraded mode of operation these aspects would be interesting to include in future lcas

17063,decentralised wastewater management dwm systems are deployed in areas where the topography does not allow for gravity flow to a centralised system or requires a complex and expensive pumping station network also dwm systems are often the only option in rural areas where there are no sewage transport networks this paper aims at addressing the question of the degree to which dwm systems can be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view using the life cycle assessment lca methodology first the environmental sustainability is investigated to identify environmental hotspots in two nature based and engineered onsite dwm systems second dwm scenarios are compared against centralised wastewater management cwm scenarios using a whole systems approach finally the boundary conditions under which a given dwm scenario performs better than a cwm scenario are discussed results show cwm scenarios were less sustainable than dwm scenarios on the resources endpoint due to their sewer infrastructures however cwm scenarios performed better than dwm scenarios on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges while on human health no clear conclusion could be drawn finally for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios did not score superior performances compared to dwm scenarios on

wwtp wastewater treatment plants wwt wastewater treatment 1 introduction decentralized wastewater management dwm is commonly defined as the collection transport treatment and reuse or disposal of domestic wastewater at or near its point of generation crites and tchobanoglous 1998 wilderer and schreff 2000 dwm handles relatively small volumes of wastewater originating from single households or groups of dwellings located in relatively close proximity indicatively less than 3 km maximum or in peri urban development clusters not yet served by a central sewer system connecting them to a regional wastewater treatment plant wwtp in dwm a local collection system is still necessary yet this will be much smaller and less expensive and require less extensive excavation works than those used for conventional centralized wastewater management cwm in literature the maximum size of dwm systems can range from 50 person equivalents pe to 10 000 pe or 1000 m3 van afferden et al 2015 this great variability can be explained by the fact that decentralisation in wastewater treatment can consist of from one to several dwm systems from individual onsite systems to a series of larger clusters or semi centralised plants capodaglio et al 2016 libralato et al 2012 in this study dwm systems refer solely to onsite treatment systems designed for individual households presently urban wastewater management uwm is incurring increasing economic social and environmental costs as a consequence of aging built infrastructures increasing urbanisation emerging contaminants competitive water uses and measures to mitigate the effects of climate change e g water efficient systems larsen et al 2016 romano and akhmouch 2019 in order to improve integrated uwm in urban basins new planning paradigms are proposed which feature i increased resilience and flexibility to withstand internal e g changing inhabitants needs and external e g socio economic context environmental conditions and climatic change pressures and ii closed water loops with a greater proximity of point of use reuse of water resources instead of classical linear uses disposal capodaglio et al 2016 despite the increasing attention focused on decentralised approaches in uwm however it remains unclear to what degree centralised or decentralised wastewater management systems should be installed in a particular region to provide uwm services with the best environmental efficiency currently the choice between cwm and dwm is mostly driven by purely economic criteria associated with linking sewer pipes and maximising the cwm treatment capacity however we can now consider dwm and cwm systems as functionally equivalent from a technological point of view capodaglio et al 2017 libralato et al 2012 lca can provide decision makers with environmental performance information of wastewater systems using a standardized whole systems transparent approach that is based on the best available science hence potential trade offs burden shifting within those systems can be highlighted lca can be applied at four levels corominas et al 2020 however this paper focussed on lca application of uwm at a planning level e g to compare alternative uwm scenarios and at a design level e g to identify environmental hotspots the main aim of the present paper is to further analyse in the context of municipal wastewater management under normal operating conditions dwm and cwm systems on their whole life cycle and using the full breadth of environmental impact categories offered in multi criteria lca specific objectives are to identify principal environmental hotspots for different uwm strategies to consider these strategies in relation to one another and finally to determine whether the dwm systems can achieve better environmental performances than cwm systems 2 materials and methods the steps leading to the environmental assessment of two types of wastewater management systems using the life cycle assessment lca method are presented in this section thus we will follow the recommended scheme of a standardized lca iso 2006a 2006b i goal and scope definition section 2 1 ii inventory analysis and uncertainty assessment sections 2 2 and 2 3 iii impact assessment section 2 4 iv interpretation of results section 3 finally the most salient issues when considering dwm in lca will be discussed section 4 2 1 lca goal and scope definition the goal and scope of the present paper was to address the question of the degree to which dwm systems can be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view we identified three sub objectives i first to investigate environmental hot spots in dwm systems e g system elements driving environmental impacts ii second to compare different wastewater management systems using a whole systems approach e g comprising of the two sub subsystems sewers and wastewater treatment wwt systems and iii finally to determine the environmental break even points where the resource and energy consumption in cwm systems would outweigh those incurred in dwm systems despite the economies of scale in cwm systems the scope of the study covers discharges generated under normal operating conditions by uwm systems as well as the infrastructures of the sewer network if centralised and treatment units and operational inputs e g electricity for pumping stormwater discharges and uwm functioning as investigated in risch et al 2014 are out of the scope of this study 2 1 1 basic uwm scenarios among wwt systems designed for cwm this study included a conventional activated sludge wwt1 as and a french vertical flow constructed wetland dotro et al 2017 used as small scale system wwt2 vf cw in a more decentralised approach vertical and horizontal constructed wetlands in series wwt3 v h cw and septic tanks and sand filters in series wwt4 st sf are routinely used these wwt systems are presented in fig 1 below treatment objectives for the different wwt systems are to comply with secondary effluent quality for discharge in receiving waters however the wwt systems have each different performances in terms of secondary effluent quality and ghg emissions during operation which are described in table s1 annex s1 as sewer networks are strongly dependent on the local urban catchment typology with population density we chose to represent two urban contexts i e with a high density sewer sw1 hd and a medium density sewer sw2 md respectively designed for population densities of 4000 inhabitants km² and 1500 inhabitants km² these sewer networks were modelled after actual towns in the south of france grabels sw1 hd and saussan sw2 md represented in table 1 therefore six different scenarios were constructed to investigate wwt process choice with respect to system scale and sewer type associated to population density these scenarios can be grouped in two categories i centralised wastewater management cwm systems and ii decentralised wastewater management dwm systems fig 2 2 1 2 aim of the study and investigated uwm scenarios the aim of the study is to discuss the environmental sustainability of different uwm scenarios using lca with regards to the three sub objectives identified therefore the following table 2 details the different uwm scenarios investigated and deployed approaches to meet these objectives in order to reach the third objective o3 the dwm scenario was compared with a variant of a cwm scenario where a new settlement was connected to an existing wwtp e g with variable linking sewer section length and elevation as illustrated in fig 3 2 1 3 system boundaries the conceptual diagram in fig 4 presents the chosen system boundaries for uwm scenarios which included the treatment of wastewater in a wwt system i e centralised as or cw or decentralised st sf or cw system the collection and transport in a sewer network where applicable in a cwm context including the sewer pipes servicing residential subdivisions the collection systems on private properties were assumed invariant in both uwm scenarios therefore not modelled in the uwm comparisons by the ceteris paribus condition residential buildings and individual housings were not included in the perimeter of this study in both cwm and dwm scenarios treated effluents were assumed to be discharged in receiving surface waters indeed for onsite dwm systems direct soil emissions soil infiltrations which may reach groundwater were not modelled as such due to lack of data or models in lca for inventory and impact modelling it is to be noted that this lca study does not account for the location specific assimilative capacity of the natural environment to accommodate the treated effluent without detrimental effects for example dwm systems can be allowed to meet basic treatment because they return flows to the environment in a more distributed way whereas cwm systems require proper end of pipe treatment with highly concentrated discharges at a single point source indeed in lca methodology generic receiving water environments are defined at best at country scale sometimes at continent scale depending on the availability of regionalized characterization factors bulle et al 2019 2 1 4 functional unit definition in the following different wastewater management systems were compared using a comparative life cycle assessment lca based on a common unit of comparison since these systems were all designed for wastewater treatment some lca studies used a functional unit on assumed per capita loadings such as the population equivalent pe defined in the european directive 91 271 corominas et al 2020 however this pe is better suited to a generic european centralised context and we proposed to use a more specific functional unit based on the study of pollution loads from french decentralised households comprising of 3 5 persons olivier et al 2019a therefore the chosen functional unit was defined as the collection and treatment of the domestic wastewater loading per inhabitant during a day in a rural setting the first assumption in this study was to define this pollution load termed as the onsite domestic only pollution load li which excludes commercial and industrial loads typically entering municipal wwtps in a centralised sanitation context olivier et al 2019a hence in this context the domestic wastewater loading per capita from one inhabitant was characterized as 46g of bod5 in 100l of wastewater volume second we suggested that municipal wastewater only included the pollution load generated by individual housings with negligible urban pollutants from rainwater stormwater lr and other services ls fig 5 this assumption can be hold for small urban towns such as those selected for the sewer models in this study 2 2 life cycle inventories 2 2 1 pollution loads from domestic sources in non collective sanitation context in order to compare wastewater management systems in a centralised and decentralised context the pollution loads from domestic sources were quantified using recent research choubert et al 2011 coquery et al 2011 olivier et al 2019a therefore the typical loading per inhabitant in an onsite sanitation context is detailed in supporting information s1 a 2 2 2 mass balances for wastewater systems pollutants in untreated wastewater loads entering the uwm systems can be transferred into several compartments to air as primary gaseous emissions to water as treated discharges to local soil onsite if infiltrated or offsite as land spreading of sludge etc it is important to establish a proper mass balance at the wwt process level to ensure consistency in the inventoried mass loads of pollutants therefore in this section we describe the transfer of pollutants e g carbon nitrogen phosphorus species and some trace micropollutants using an equilibrated mass balance at the wwt system level on the septic tank followed by a sand filter wwt4 st sf table 3 equilibrated mass balances for the other three wwt systems are provided in datasets described in supporting information s1 d the objective is to determine accurate data for the life cycle inventory lci for this onsite wwt process the mass balance was completed for the raw wastewater load from an inhabitant in a decentralised sanitation context g inhabitant d 1 to this end the completion of the mass balance required i measured data 107 in situ data points collected from 20 locations over several measurement campaigns in olivier et al 2019 and ii assumptions based on literature review e g gaseous emissions from septic tanks bartram et al 2019 diaz valbuena et al 2011 data sources and values are described in insert table 5 and in the lci datasets provided in a newly developed file format with eldam coste et al 2020 2018 to facilitate dataset exchange from to simapro see supporting information 2 2 3 infrastructure materials and operational inputs material inputs e g required for the construction of the systems and operational inputs e g electricity required for pumping wastewater in a linking sewer section were described in the lci compilation of eldam files in supporting information sections s1 b and s1 c in residential subdivisions of 6 and 45 households sewer elements were modelled with 200 mm diameter hence the 200 mm diameter of the linking section pumping electricity was estimated using a pressure drop calculator for different pipe diameters and an estimated flow rate of 30 m3 h 1 indeed in order to pump wastewater in a linking section from the housing development back into the sewer mains it is necessary to calculate the total dynamic head tdh which is the total equivalent height that a fluid is to be pumped for different elevation values pipe diameter did not influence significantly tdh see supporting information s1 b therefore it was assumed that pipe diameter remain invariant in all scenarios 200 mm diameter 2 3 uncertainty assessment in order to ensure transparency and credibility of the lca results obtained in this study it is critical that the uncertainty sources are quantified and their effects on results are communicated gavankar et al 2015 furthermore the treatment of uncertainty will help interpret differences in the studied systems in the comparative lca e g to determine whether the preference for one system can be questionable due to result uncertainties igos et al 2018 uncertainty ranges for unit processes taken from the ecoinvent 3 database wernet et al 2016 were defined by the data pedigree algorithm available in simapro as proposed by weidema and wesnaes 1996 this algorithm relates the datum uncertainty to its source characteristics i e reliability of the source representativeness of the sample currency of the period geographical correlation technological correlation and sample size the uncertainty ranges associated to infrastructure construction and operation e g amount of materials used amount of energy and ancillary chemicals used during wwtp operation etc are described in table 4 uncertainties related to emissions of major contributing pollutants from wwtp operation were obtained from literature and are summarised in insert table 5 based on uncertainty data in the lci uncertainty propagation in the modelled systems was estimated using a random sampling method the available monte carlo routine in simapro with 1500 runs to yield 95 confidence intervals which are shown in the results plots see results in section 3 fig 7 finally the influences of uncertainty in two key parameters e g varying sewer lifespans around 80 years and a french electricity mix with a major share of nuclear instead of the european average electricity mix used in this study were studied using sensitivity analyses for details see supporting information s1 f 2 4 life cycle impact assessment 2 4 1 lcia method selection presently urban water systems are often confronted with complex challenges associated with the water energy nexus risch et al 2014 in these conditions the use of aggregated endpoint indicators can be much more useful in terms of decision support thus the recipe 2016 v1 03 method huijbregts 2016 was chosen for its harmonised impact assessment framework at two levels in the cause effect chain that is an environmental mechanism of an impact category first midpoint indicators quantify the relative importance of emissions or extractions that occur due to human operations in terms of reference substances e g co2 eq for the global warming category kg so2 eq for acidification next endpoint indicators are calculated to reflect differences between stressors further in the cause effect chain and are of direct societal concern e g human health ecosystem quality and resources 3 results and discussion in order to present lca results as clearly as possible the preliminary contribution analyses are presented first on midpoint indicators to assess life cycle impacts of each stage in dwm systems over a range of impact categories section 3 1 indeed presently dwm systems have been little studied or not studied in detail in multi criteria lca machado et al 2007 however for scenario comparison sections 3 2 and 3 3 an endpoint indicator presentation is then used to facilitate interpretation of impact results only on the three areas of protection commonly used in lca human health ecosystems and resources 3 1 midpoint impacts for decentralised wastewater treatment systems life cycle impact assessment of two decentralised wwt systems wwt3 and wwt4 respectively vertical horizontal cw v h cw and septic tank sand filter st sf are presented for eighteen midpoint categories for the chosen functional unit treatment of 46g of bod5 inhabitant d 1 in fig 6 in the following the underlying rationale for presenting results obtained with the full set of midpoint indicators was to provide transparency regarding i the breadth of midpoint indicators before aggregation at endpoint level avoiding the end point black box effect ii the main contributors to impacts at midpoint level among infrastructure operation sludge end of life and emissions discharges in addition aggregated endpoint indicators human health ecosystems and resources will help support decision making see section 3 2 and table 6 presents the respective contributions of midpoint indicators to endpoints to inform on the degree of relevance of midpoint indicators counting towards the endpoint scores as shown in table 6 eight impact categories showed endpoint contributions greater than 1 hence the comparison between wwt3 and wwt4 can be based on these relevant categories overall wwt4 showed greater impacts than wwt3 on eleven impact categories for both systems the built infrastructure blue dominated the impacts on nine impact categories while discharges to the environment yellow contributed markedly on categories dealing with aquatic ecosystems due to discharges of residual pollutants after wastewater treatment or land spreading sludge application in the end of life regarding global warming greenhouse gasses ghg produced during wwt operation varied in emitted quantities for the two systems for wwt3 co2 was the leading ghg contributor 73 followed by n2o 22 however for wwt4 ch4 was the most important ghg 72 followed by co2 16 and n2o 12 n2o emissions were driving the ozone depletion impact for both systems in the case of wwt4 air emissions of ammonia caused fine particulate formation while wwt3 produced only gaseous dinitrogen and no ammonia regarding non carcinogenic human toxicity the large difference in impact was caused by zinc discharged in effluents in wwt3 while it remained trapped in wwt4 the main differences between these two dwm systems were summarised in insert table 7 in this study the ch4 emissions for a septic tank system were based on the recently updated emission factor defined in the 2019 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories bartram et al 2019 which is slightly greater than the measurements based methane emission factor of 10 7 gch4 pe d 1 diaz et al 2011 research literature is quite scarce on these greenhouse gas emissions hence this advocates for more in situ studies on septic tanks operating in a range of conditions 3 2 uwm system comparison decentralised vs centralised the primary purpose of a uwm system is to mitigate human exposure to harmful pollutants including pathogens as well as to protect the environment from unwanted consequences arising from eutrophication ecotoxicity climate change and finite resources depletion now to address the second study objective which was to investigate how environmentally efficient are cwm systems compared to dwm systems and to provide insight in the impacts incurred by either the wwt or sewer sub systems cwm and dwm systems were compared on the basis of the same functional unit defined in the previous section fig 7 shows the impacts of compared systems on the three endpoints e g human health ecosystems quality and resources with quantified uncertainty for each system represented graphically as error bars impacts from wwt and the sewer sub systems are represented respectively with orange and grey colors overall results showed that cwm systems performed better than dwm systems on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges on resources it was clear that the dwm systems had fewer impacts without the sewer infrastructure regarding human health the best centralised scenario cwm2 cw performed similarly to the best decentralised scenario dwm1 cw but otherwise no clear conclusion can be drawn population density associated with a sewer system size in cwm did not affect significantly on all endpoints but on resources although dwm2 st provided comparable wastewater treatment in terms of effluent quality this scenario had the greatest impacts on human health and ecosystems endpoints mainly due to methane and ammonia gaseous emissions 80 contribution to human health endpoint and 56 contribution to the ecosystems quality endpoint which were highlighted in table 5 despite the processes used in dwm systems have long proven their efficiency in a context of collective sanitation in reality in an onsite sanitation context these treatment systems suffer from highly variable treated effluent quality due to fluctuating loading rates also despite a maintenance contract for on site systems operating activities are rarely performed which may alter system performances all year long olivier et al 2019b these results at endpoint level can be better interpreted with a proper decision support procedure guérin schneider et al 2018 thus it would be possible to conclude that a scenario is better than other only if there is a significant relative difference greater than 15 20 results from a sensitivity analysis on two selected parameters e g sewer lifespan and electricity mix showed that while the sewer lifespan influenced significantly impacts on the resources endpoint the choice of the electricity mix had an even greater influence on all endpoints for details see supporting information s1 f 3 3 boundary conditions for superior environmental impacts of a dwm scenario as outlined in table 2 with respect to the third objective of the study for an hypothetical situation with a new residential settlement a virtual case study was built to investigate the boundary conditions where a dwm scenario with an onsite wwt e g st sf or a vf cw system may perform better on the three endpoint categories compared to a cwm scenario where wastewater is sent for treatment in a centralised wwtp e g as as described in fig 3 in the latter the existing wwtp treatment capacity can be increased without any structural modification to treat the pollution of the new settlement and a new linking sewer section with a pumping station were included to connect the new settlement to the sewer mains boundary conditions on the three endpoint categories were searched by using a range of varying linking sewer length and elevation in the cwm scenarios then the threshold value of linking section lls in km after which the dwm system has a greater impact on the chosen endpoint category was determined using equation 1 and equation 2 where i c w m i and i d w m i are respectively the impacts of cwm and dwm scenarios with respect to the chosen functional unit operational lifetime for the pumping station ltps was set at 30 years while the average lifetime for the sewer network ltsw was defined at 80 years 1 i c w m i i d w m i i w w t 1 i i p s i i n h l t p s i l s i l i n l ls i s w i i n h l t s w i p s e n i p u m p e n e r g y i d w m i 0 2 l l s i n

impacts e g the pumping station ps with its associated energy consumption psen etc variables used are defined in table 8 elevation changes up to 50m did not influence markedly the threshold values for the linking sewer section for a given settlement size e g for 6 houses the threshold value remained around 0 9 and 0 6 km on the human health endpoint as described in fig 8 for full results see supporting information s1 g two side by side comparisons for the dwm scenarios e g dwm1 cw and dwm2 st against the reference cwm scenario featuring an activated sludge and linking sewer section resulted in the determination of tipping lines for each endpoint representing the boundary conditions where dwm scenario performed better than the reference fig 9 and fig 10 dwm scenarios show superior environmental performances than cwm scenarios within a short length of connection to the sewer mains despite the major impact of septic tanks on climate change due to their estimated ch4 emissions results show that for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios do not appear as the best solution i e no superior performances on all three endpoint indicators arising from their significant impacts on the resources used for the construction of infrastructure and energy consumption the intermediate zones highlighted in blue where there where there is no consensus on all indicators it is impossible to decide in favour of a dwm scenario this is in itself an interesting result which means that in this case the environmental criterion is no longer the determining factor between the two uwm solutions and the decision can be taken on the economic dimension e g which is the cheapest option presently regarding the human exposure to harmful pollutants pathogens and their fate pathways in soil are not yet modelled in lca because of high site dependency e g local geological conditions at point of emission in this context this study aims to provide support for decision making solely for dwm in regulatory compliant situations without any risk of human exposure following soil infiltration or discharges in rivers however human exposure routes via inhalation of airborne particles are accounted for in the human health endpoint as well as the safeguarding of the natural environment and finite resources e g ecosystem quality and resources endpoints 4 conclusions and future prospects the aim of the study was to address the question of the degree to which dwm systems would be considered as viable alternatives from an environmental point of view using lca methodology this was achieved with comparisons of different uwm scenarios including cwm and dwm systems lca can provide a valuable contribution to the development of sustainable uwm strategies by identifying environmental hotspots through a life cycle whole systems and multi criteria perspective and drivers of changes major results are highlighted in the following as well as recommendations and challenges on the way to conduct such a lca hypotheses and explanations on the amounts of pollutants in the mass balances for each wastewater treatment system are required to ensure transparency of flows cwm scenarios were less sustainable than dwm scenarios on resources due to their sewer infrastructures however cwm systems performed better than dwm systems on the ecosystems quality endpoint due to their well managed air emissions and discharges while on human health no clear conclusion can be drawn dwm scenarios show superior environmental performances than cwm scenarios within a short length of connection to the sewer mains despite some having significant impacts on climate change due to their ghg emissions e g septic tanks on one hand for relatively few households subject of the study in rural areas cwm scenarios do not score superior performances on all three endpoint indicators due to their significant impacts on resources used for infrastructure building and energy consumption on the other hand in the intermediate zones highlighted in blue it is impossible to decide in favour of decentralisation because of a lack of favourable consensus on all three endpoint indicators this is in itself an interesting result which means that in this case the environmental criterion is no longer the determining factor between the two uwm solutions and the decision can be taken on the economic dimension e g which is the cheapest option all these results are of course only valid if dwm systems are appropriate regarding local geological conditions to avoid any groundwater contamination which specific case was not modelled in this study the results show that the answers to the question may differ depending on the context local electricity mix housing density and sewer networks though one of the primary purposes of a uwm system is to mitigate human exposure to harmful pollutants including pathogens this study was limited to human exposure to airborne pollutants however this study considered how uwm systems provide protection of the natural environment from unwanted consequences arising from eutrophication ecotoxicity climate change and finite resources depletion benefits stemming from on site water reuse and groundwater recharge in dwm systems were not assessed as well as their resiliency e g failures of single units do not cause the collapse of the whole system or the inclusion of less than optimal performance degraded mode of operation these aspects would be interesting to include in future lcas

17064,nonylphenol np is widely known for its estrogenic activity on organisms but its influence on biochemical processes executed by complex microbiota is still unclear the dose specific effects of np on sludge anaerobic digestion by shaping acidification and methanogenesis were reported both low 50 mg kg and high 1000 mg kg np doses were beneficial to acidification and aceticlastic methanogenesis am and high np dose further stimulated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm stable isotope probing analysis indicated that the predominant methanogenic pathway was shifted from am to a combination of am and hm as np dose increased acidogenic and methanogenic consortia were accumulated and restructured by np in favor of acidification and substrate based methanogenesis acidification related genes for bioconversion of substrates into acetate glycolysis stickland reaction and pyruvate metabolism acetate transportation and microbial robust performance were enriched with both low and high np doses methanogenesis related genes encoding acetyl coa dehydrogenase synthetase codh acs in aceticlastic pathway and transporters for coenzyme synthesis were enhanced by both np doses besides high np dose promoted a majority of genes in co2 reduction pathway and key material transporters for coenzyme f420 and heterodisulfide reductase synthesis this study shed light on complex microbial processes rather than certain organisms affected by np with dose specific pattern at genetic level and had implications in resource utilization of sludge containing refractory organics graphical abstract image

surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ethers oil field demulsifier textile auxiliary antistatic agent and rubber auxiliary production giger et al 1984 is becoming a hot spot in the area of toxicology due to its estrogenic activity diverse adverse effects of np including developmental abnormalities infertility hermaphrodites abnormal vitellogenesis and neurotoxicity on individual organisms cells tissues and organs have been reported kwak et al 2017 mueller et al 2019 in general np disturb the endocrine system by specifically binding to the natural estrogen receptor nuclear protein causing the transcriptional regulation of various genes in target cells bolger et al 1998 it has been proposed that np leads to the common dna effects which might be dna damage and or point mutations or genomic rearrangements wang et al 2018 it should be noted that the estrogenic activity of np was dose dependent and usually emerged when it reached the threshold concentration bunay et al 2018 in uterine tissue high np dose 50 mg kg activated related genes while low np dose 0 5 and 5 mg kg did not watanabe et al 2004 similarly whether low dose of np can cause humans at risk of endocrine disruption has not reached agreement diao et al 2017 osimitz et al 2015 vazquez duhalt et al 2005 at present np still has a huge market demand due to the absence of perfect substitutes even though the adverse effect of np is well known in fact in addition to certain organisms np is widely existed in various environmental media contaminated sludge soil water etc specially sewage sludge has been proved to be a reservoir for np accumulation since most of np manufactures enter into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps and take the sewage sludge as a final receiving place the concentration of np accumulated in sludge varies with time and region diversed in the same order of magnitude mg kg dry sludge paterakis et al 2012 verlicchi and zambello 2015 for example the np content has been researched to be 0 02 2530 mg kg according to the sludge samples collected worldwide and the maximum value has been reported to be 500 0 mg kg dry sludge in china lately mailler et al 2017 therefore treatment and resource utilization of sludge also faces a risk of np till now most of the reported studies on effects of np focused on certain organism exposed to np and the influences of np on complex microbial system i e sludge aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion system have rarely been published anaerobic digestion first introduced in the natural process occurred in biological organisms has been strategically applied for treatment and comprehensive utilization of sewage sludge li et al 2019 martins et al 2018 quantity reduction and stabilization is achieved and valuable end products biogas liquid and biosolid are created simultaneously during sludge anaerobic digestion gonzalez gil et al 2016 whether the feedstock is sludge or any other organics feeding regime the pivotal components of anaerobic digestion involve substrates microorganisms and complex biochemical reactions that is hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis liu and chen 2018 each of which has the potential to be the rate limiting step according to distinct conditions liu and ghosh 1997 palmowski and muller 2000 acidogenic bacteria exert an effect on polymer mainly polysaccharide and protein hydrolysis and monomers acidification yielding short chain fatty acids scfas especially acetic acid for further methanogenesis driven by methanogenic archaea emptage et al 1997 zhou et al 2018 in this regard the variation of any aforementioned components will cause the dissimilarities in anerobic digestion processes for instance a great diversity of contents and compositions of products have been observed

solid and nutrient contents hidaka et al 2013 hinken et al 2008 massanet nicolau et al 2008 as a refractory chemical in sludge however np has the potential to be a possibility affecting sludge anaerobic digestion different from the individual organism in the previous study sludge anaerobic digestion is the biochemical processes characterized by microbial uniquely collaborative way of working exposed to different doses of np according to these points key questions are asked how does np dose in sludge influence its anaerobic digestion i e dose response effect what is the prevailing mechanism of np effect on microbial processes in sludge or the difference similarity in estrogenic effect of np on individual organism cell tissue or organ and integrated microbial consortia sludge the objective of the present study was to explore the dose response relationship between methane production and np especially the changes in methane formation pathways during anaerobic digestion and the mechanisms first np shaped microbial processes such as hydrolysis acidification and substrate based methanogenesis were pinpointed specifically shift of the predominant methanogenic pathway such as aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic pathway in the presence of np was then studied by using stable isotope technology the populations of functional microbes involved in np shaped microbial process including acidogenic bacteria and two types of methanogenic archaea were deciphered by 16s rrna gene sequencing finally the np differentiated microbial function traits responsible for key microbial process were profiled at genetic level based on metagenomic analysis this study uncovered the dose specific effects and mechanisms underlying the complex microbial processes exposed to np and provided clues to resource utilization of np containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the sludge and chemicals the sewage sludge applied in this study was collected from the secondary

on sludge anaerobic digestion more conveniently by adding the external np 4 n np 98 extensively used in various industries was purchase from alfa aesar shanghai china np stock solution 1 g l was obtained by dissolving np into methanol high performance liquid chromatography grade sigma aldrich which was stored in dark place at 4 c 2 2 sludge anaerobic digesters exposed to np the experiments on np affecting anaerobic digestion were conducted in a series of identical serum bottles containing 300 ml of sludge the np concentrations in anaerobic digesters were set to 0 control 50 100 200 1000 mg kg dry sludge respectively the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by adding naoh or hcl and all reactors were purged with nitrogen for 2 minutes to remove oxygen after sealing with a rubber stopper the anaerobic digestion reactors were operated at 150 rpm and 35 1 c in an air bath shaker the srt was maintained at 20 d by discharging 15 ml of digestion mixture from the anaerobic reactors every day and replacing it with the same volume of the fresh corresponding np containing sludge gas mixture in anaerobic reactors was sampled every 2 d to determine the methane production after methane production was relatively stable the digestion liquid was taken to analyze the content of dissolved polysaccharides and proteins microbial community and metagenome and gas mixture was used to measure the stable carbon isotopic value of methane δ13ch4 and carbon dioxide δ13co2 the experiments on np affecting anaerobic digestion processes hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis were performed in a series of identical anaerobic reactors using synthetic wastewater for experiment of np affecting hydrolysis 450 mg of bsa model protein and 90 mg of dextran model polysaccharide were dissolved into 270 ml tap water to form synthetic wastewater and 30 ml of digestion mixture from long term anaerobic reactors was added as the inoculum the operating parameters ph temperature and rotate speed and treatments nitrogen flushing were the same with the real sludge anaerobic digestion system and the operation time was 2 d samples were taken every day and the dissolved protein and polysaccharide contents in mixture were measured to calculate hydrolysis efficiencies supporting information for acidification the substrates were 450 mg of l glutamate model amino acid and 90 mg of glucose model monosaccharide the operation time was 3 d and scfas concentration was analyzed for aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the substrates were 0 9 g acetate and 300 ml h2 co2 mixture gas v v

2 3 analytic methods ts vs tcod and scod were measured by standard methods the scfa and gas content methane hydrogen and carbon dioxide were determined by gas chromatography gc 2014 shimadzu with a flame ionization detector db waxetr column and a thermal conductivity detector nitrogen as carrier gas respectively the relative contribution of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways to total methane production can be estimated by apparent fractionation factor αc which is calculated by the measured stable carbon isotopic signatures of c o 2 δ 13 c o 2 and c h 4 δ 13 c h 4 i e 1 α

digestion reactors fig 1 a shows the apparent yield of methane in anaerobic digesters under different np stresses obviously the presence of np gave a positive influence on methane production during sludge anaerobic digestion however the positive influences varied with np concentration in sludge the average production of methane in anaerobic digesters with np concentration of 0 50 100 200 and 1000 mg kg was 9 42 12 10 11 50 11 85 and 14 42 ml g vss respectively fig 1 b as the np content in sludge increased during anaerobic digestion the trend of methane production was divided into two stages by np at the dose of 200 mg kg in the first stage the methane yields increased first and then remained steady with the np content in the range of 0 200 mg kg in the second stage the methane yields increased with the concentration of np in the range of 200 1000 mg kg and the production of methane achieved the highest when the dose of np was 1000 mg kg in this study the biodegradation efficiency of np in sludge anaerobic digestion was relatively low indicating that the contribution of np biodegradation to methane production could be negligible supporting information and the promotion of methane production came from anaerobic digestion of sludge like the dose response relationship between np and organisms cells tissues or organs the methane production varied with np dose based on the methane production in the np influenced digesters here two doubts to be further disclosed are 1 why could np accelerate the anaerobic digestion of sludge 2 what was the difference in acceleration mechanism between low and high contents of np in order to reveal this uncertainty information more clearly the present study artificially defined the key np concentration nodes which were control 0 mg kg low dose 50 mg kg corresponding to the first peak of methane production and high dose 1000 mg kg corresponding to the second peak of methane production from the side of toxicology this dose specific relationship is neither a monotonic promotion or inhibition trend such as j shaped and s shaped curve nor a common hormesis trend such as u shaped curve it is of great and enlightening significance to explore the mechanisms on anaerobic digestion of sludge under different np stresses 3 2 key processes in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors typically anaerobic digestion of biowastes can be roughly separated into a prerequisite step where hydrolysis acidification and homoacetogenesis take place and a second step where acetate h2 and co2 are transformed into methane methanogenesis non methanogenesis occupies a crucially important niche for the robust performance of anaerobic digestion with a rate limited by hydrolysis of insoluble heterogeneous substrates liu and ghosh 1997 palmowski and muller 2000 it is worth noting that the majority of acetic acid utilized for methane production are generated from acidification which can be a potential rate limiting step under the condition of environmental stress due to the inhibition of microbial growth wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in fact the contribution of homoacetogenesis to acetic acid is almost negligible when other hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as methanogens exist in the system the current results showed that the promotion effect of np on anaerobic digestion was not originating from the influence of np on hydrolysis fig s1 for acidification fig 2 a no significant difference p 0 05 in production of total scfas 6238 6479 mg cod l was observed between the control and np reactors at the end of operation time 3 d the main scfas produced from acidification were acetic and n butyric acid which occupied 90 of the total scfas the productions of acetic acid with low and high np concentration 4454 and 4209 mg cod l were much higher than that in the control 3429 mg cod l which suggested that more acetic acid produced during acidification of sludge usually about one third of the methane is formed from h2 co2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm and acetic acid is the source of the remaining two thirds aceticlastic methanogenesis am in the biowaste digestion system however no information is currently available on substrate based methanogenesis shaped by different np concentrations the accumulation of methane in am reactors with low and high np concentration was 130 2 and 127 9 ml fig 2 b when the operation time was 8 d respectively higher than that in the control 103 0 ml unlike am the methane production increased gradually with np content in the range of 0 1000 mg kg during hm fig 2 c when the operation time was 2 d the high np dose caused a drastic increase in methane accumulation 1 72 times of that in the control compared with the other reactors methane production was governed by methanogenic processes and pathways meaning that the np influenced processes were insufficient to explain the trend of methane production affected by np in the real bioreactors and thus shift of dominant methanogenic pathway was further investigated fig 2 d shows the values of δ13ch4 δ13co2 and αc in anaerobic digestion reactors with different np contents the average value of δ13ch4 in the control was 47 2 while it increased to 45 6 and then decreased to 53 4 respectively with low and high concentration of np in contrast the values of δ13co2 showed the opposite trend in anaerobic digestion systems which were 26 3 16 0 and 13 6 respectively with the increasing of np concentration the values of αc calculated from δ13ch4 and δ13co2 were 1 022 1 031 and 1 042 respectively under no low and high np stresses it was reported that the methane production was dominated by aceticlastic hydrogenotrophic and a combination of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when αc 1 027 αc 1 065 and αc 1 045 lu et al 2013 thus the predominant pathway was am in the control and low np dose reactor and then it shifted to a combination of am and hm with high np dose to date the shift of predominant methanogenic pathway especially the restrained aceticlastic pathway has been reported under the condition of environmental stress eg high acetate and ammonium concentration lu et al 2013 low ph hao et al 2012 and methanogenic inhibitors bes and chloroform xu et al 2010 in this study not only was aceticlastic pathway not being suppressed by np but also hydrogenotrophic pathway was enhanced at high np dose which is different from the reported publications therefore both low and high concentration of np had a positive effect on acidification and am of sludge on this basis the production and proportion of methane from hm was further enhanced by high concentration of np fig 2 e consequently this paper focused on the methanogenesis and acidification of sludge and the influence of np on hydrolysis was not considered 3 3 core microbiota in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors acidogenic bacteria acidification mediated by acidogenic microorganisms can be a potential rate limiting step under the condition of environmental stress due to the shift of bacterial community wang et al 2020 in this sense anaerobic digester with np was characterized by the highest bacterial diversity and evenness fig s2 the higher microbial diversity and evenness is regarded as a reservoir of fermentative bacteria with redundant metabolic pathways which is desirable to ensure a functional stability of microbial communities and often correlated with more stable anaerobic reactor calusinska et al 2018 wittebolle et al 2009 bacterial communities of sludge in this study were mainly dominated by phylum bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes spirochaetae chloroflexi actinobacteria parcubacteria acidobacteria and chlorobi fig s3 a which were usually regarded as the core bacteria during hydrolysis and acidification bacteria associated with acidification enriched in np reactors can be divided into three groups fig 3 a and s3 a the first group was organic substrate degrading bacteria representatives of acidimicrobiales and corynebacteriales which can convert glucose succinate and lactate etc to acetate co2 and h2 as intermediates de rezende et al 2020 detman et al 2018 the second group was the microorganisms i e anaerolineales and chlorobiales responsible for syntrophic metabolism with aceticlastic methanogens by providing acetate products florentino et al 2019 liang et al 2015 the third group was able to adapt to the complex environment by switching substrate types to avoid direct competition with other microbial populations representatives of rhizobiales which might exert a positive effect on the stable operation of anaerobic digestion pang and liu 2007 the relative abundances of all the mentioned bacteria in np reactors were much higher than that in the control indicating that the shift of bacterial community was beneficial to sludge acidification in the presence of np methanogenic archaea methanogenic archaea obtain their energy for growth from the conversion of a limited number of substrates to methane gas likewise methanogenic archaea were more diverse and evenly distributed with np methanobacteriaceae methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae methanoregulaceae and methanospirillaceae were pinpointed as the predominant methanogen at family level in the anaerobic digestion systems fig s3 b as shown in fig 3 b and s3 b the genus methanosaeta affiliated to methanosaetaceae and methanosarcina belonging to methanosarcinaceae carry out an aceticlastic reaction that splits acetate costa and leigh 2014 whose relative abundances with np 11 20 15 43 and 1 65 3 29 respectively were higher than that in the control 9 26 and 1 00 respectively the family methanoregulaceae mainly methanolinea methanospirillaceae mainly methanospirillum methanobacteriaceae and wcha1 57 were hydrogenotrophic that can reduce co2 to methane liu and whitman 2008 the total relative abundance of these hydrogenotrophic methanogen was 15 67 in the control whereas it increased to 23 48 with high np concentration on the other hand due to the accumulation of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen with np the relative abundance of methanogen utilizing other substrates i e methanomethylovorans using c 1 compounds as substrates jiang et al 2005 was suppressed in np reactors thus the methanogenic community in anaerobic digestion systems under np stress was advantageous to methane production from aceticlastic reaction and co2 reduction metagenomic analysis was used to further evaluate all the microorganisms belonging to different domains fig 3 c a higher number of archaea especially methanogen was obtained in np reactors 3 57 and 3 87 with low and high np contents respectively compared with the control 3 35 which could be related with the higher methane production in np reactors 3 4 functional traits of microbiota in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors as is well known almost all the life activities of microorganisms are essentially related with functional genes in order to further unravel the reason why microbial community was shifted to one suitable for acetate and methane productions by the np load the metagenomics analysis based on geneset constructed by acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea was conducted in this study in anaerobic digesters microbial functions harbor fermentation and growth which is associated with fermentative pathway and physiological status of microorganisms acidification related functions the pathways of acidification by acidogenic bacteria mainly consist of glycolysis emp and ed pathway monosaccharide metabolism amino acid metabolism stickland reaction and pyruvate metabolism it is worth noting that the pathways of glycolysis and monosaccharide metabolism fructose mannose galactose and amino nucleotide sugar metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway were enhanced significantly p 0 05 with both low and high doses of np fig 4 a and s4 additionally the functional genes encoding hexokinase hk glucose 6 phosphate isomerase pgi triosephosphate isomerase tpia phosphoglycerate mutase gpmai and apgm glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapn and 2 dehydro 3 deoxy phosphogluconate aldolase eda involved in glycolysis schroder et al 1994 amino acid reductase grdabcde and prd and aminotransferase asda associated with stickland reaction and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por and korab acetate kinase acka and phosphotransacetylase pta bouillaut et al 2013 embodied in pyruvate metabolism increased by 10 275 in np digesters compared with control acetate produced from acidogenic pathway should be transported then for utilization and in this regard acetate transporter genes atoe and smct were enhanced with both np doses for non acidogenic pathway translation ribosome was significantly p 0 05 enhanced by both low and high np concentrations fig 4 a and s4 the ribosome functions to translate mrna during protein biosynthesis to maintain cell homeostasis and survival the genes encoding components of the ribosomal subunit involved in repairing dna damage rps3 early development and a regulator of cell migration and survival in organism rps7 chaperones of the 5s rrna transported between nucleolus and cytosol rpl5 and ribosomal assembly rpl15 park and kwak 2012 yu et al 2006 were improved by np however differentiated pathways were observed with low and high np content fig s4 purine pyrimidine metabolism homologous recombination mismatch repair and dna replication increased significantly p 0 05 at low np dose whereas substrates amino acid and monosaccharide transporter genes livgfhmk rbsac ugpbe aapjm prowv and metq and quorum sensing controlling biofilm formation bapa secy and oppcd increased significantly under high dose of np based on bacteria gene set acidification was enhanced with dose specific mechanisms fig 4 b np positively affected functional genes involved in acidogenic pathway besides low np dose facilitated genetic information processing and high np dose was conductive to membrane transport and signal transduction methanogenesis related functions the pathways of methanogenesis aceticlastic reaction and co2 reduction were profiled based on gene set constructed by methanogenic archaea suggesting that the function methane metabolism ko00680 was enhanced by both low and high np contents fig 4 a and s5 for aceticlastic reaction the relative abundances of genes related with acetyl coa synthetase acs and co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase cdhcde in methanogen under np stress was higher than that in the control for co2 type pathway the abundances of genes corresponded to formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase fwdbcdef formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase ftr methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase mtd and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer and genes included in the synthesis of coenzymes f420 and methanofuran mfr cofcdehg fbic and mfnce with high np stress were 1 2 1 6 times of that in the control for common pathway partial pathway existed in both am and hm genes mtrdgh coenzyme m methyltransferase mtr mcrabcdg methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr and hdrabc heterodisulfide reductase hdr were enriched in the presence of both low and high concentration of np thus both np doses benefited the functional genes involved in aceticlastic and common pathway in addition high concentration of np resulted in the promotion of functional genes involved in not only the metabolic pathway but also the synthesis of coenzymes for co2 reduction based on methanogenic gene set bio membrane mediated functions abc transporters with np were much higher than that in the control fig 4 a and s5 substrate binding atp binding and permease protein of iron complex cobalt nickel and molybdate transport system were accumulated under high np stress iron is the essential insertion into the protoporphyrin macrocycle to yield the haem used for iron supply of methanogen crichton 2019 cobalt and nickel act as the centrally coordinated ion in cyclic tetrapyrroles corrin rings in coenzymes participating in methanogenesis takashima et al 2011 unusual nickel corrin coenzyme f430 cofactor of mcr involved in the final step of methane production and subunit mtra harbors a cobalt corrin derivatives prosthetic group which is methylated and demethylated in the catalytic cycle during methanogenesis the molybdate due to its stereological similarity blocks the first enzyme in the sulfate reduction and thus stimulates the methane production banat et al 1983 substrate binding atp binding and permease protein of zinc only increased under high np concentration zinc is the essential site of formate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the reaction that produces reduced coenzyme f420 from the oxidation of formate in place of h2 the site of heterodisulfide reduction has been found in the zinc protein hdrb a subunit of hdr catalyzing the reduction of the cob com heterodisulfide back to cob and com takashima et al 2011 additionally the functions associated with the growth and proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogen ribosome pyrimidine metabolism rna polymerase and protein export were facilitated with high concentration of np fig 4 a and s5 demonstrating that more daughter cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen were produced with high np content based on the above results sludge methanogenesis was facilitated and shaped with dose specific mechanisms fig 4 b both low and high contents of np promoted functional genes involved in aceticlastic pathway and transporters of essential components for coenzyme synthesis in common pathway besides high dose of np was beneficial to hydrogenotrophic pathway and transporters genes of key material involved in coenzyme synthesis in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis environmental information processing especially membrane transport and signal transduction were critical functions activated by np during sludge anaerobic digestion in fact the disturbed membrane permeability and uptake of substances have also been observed in individual organism np has higher affinity for membrane phospholipids and was found to affect the active transport of calcium to sarcoplasmic reticulum and cause cell death madhu and pooja 2018 under the condition of np inducing hepatotoxicity in the freshwater fish the inter and intracellular membrane transport decreased midhila and chitra 2015 the functions of membrane transport in bacteria and archaea involved in anaerobic digestion increased with np in the range of experimental concentration based on metagenomics analysis fig 4 b which is different from the mechanisms obtained in individual organism on the other hand it has now been understood that np exerted estrogenic effects by elaborating signaling transduction that control the overall physiology of the organism for instance er signalling pathway is targeted by np at the central level during zebrafish early development and long term exposure to np affects insulin signaling in the liver of adult male rates vosges et al 2012 in this study quorum sensing belonging to signal transduction controlling biofilm formation which is conductive to cell survival of bacteria was improved at high np dose fig 4 b by analogy with estrogenic mechanisms of np on organisms the alterations of these functions in sludge can be regarded as the estrogenic mechanisms of np on microbial consortium with regard to genes that were activated by np in previous publications many genes involved in amino acid and glucose metabolism were detected in addition to environmental information processing genes the activities of hexokinase in liver showed a significant decrease while the activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glucose 6 phosphatase increased in animals treated with np in a dose dependent manner when compared to control animals exposure to inappropriate concentrations of np may alter glucose metabolism and enhance the risk of diabetes jubendradass et al 2011 aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase lactate dehydrogenase thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione levels were influenced by np and thus it can induce oxidative stress in the liver of male rats korkmaz et al 2010 sludge anaerobic digestion especially acidification process is a complex system for the degradation of organic matters including amino acid and glucose fig 4 b which is interconnected with the metabolism of these organic matter in organisms this study provided a deep insight into dose specific effects of np on sludge anaerobic digestion at metabolic pathway and genetic level and had important implications in resource utilization of sludge containing refractory organics on the other hand the research was conducted to gain effect of np on all forms of life not only at the level of individual organism but also of the biological group involved in complex microbial processes 4 conclusion methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion exhibited the dose specific enhancement as the np dose increased low and high np doses facilitate anaerobic digestion with dose specific mechanisms both low and high np doses promoted acidification and am and am dominated the methanogenic pathway at low np dose high np dose further stimulated hm and a combination of am and hm dominated the methanogenic pathway at high np dose for acidification functional genes involved in substrate transportation and bioconversion into acetate and acetate transportation were promoted by both np doses for methanogenesis functional genes associated with aceclastic pathway were accumulated by both low and high np doses besides high np dose also stimulated a majority of genes involved in co2 reduction pathway and key material transporters for coenzyme synthesis

17064,nonylphenol np is widely known for its estrogenic activity on organisms but its influence on biochemical processes executed by complex microbiota is still unclear the dose specific effects of np on sludge anaerobic digestion by shaping acidification and methanogenesis were reported both low 50 mg kg and high 1000 mg kg np doses were beneficial to acidification and aceticlastic methanogenesis am and high np dose further stimulated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm stable isotope probing analysis indicated that the predominant methanogenic pathway was shifted from am to a combination of am and hm as np dose increased acidogenic and methanogenic consortia were accumulated and restructured by np in favor of acidification and substrate based methanogenesis acidification related genes for bioconversion of substrates into acetate glycolysis stickland reaction and pyruvate metabolism acetate transportation and microbial robust performance were enriched with both low and high np doses methanogenesis related genes encoding acetyl coa dehydrogenase synthetase codh acs in aceticlastic pathway and transporters for coenzyme synthesis were enhanced by both np doses besides high np dose promoted a majority of genes in co2 reduction pathway and key material transporters for coenzyme f420 and heterodisulfide reductase synthesis this study shed light on complex microbial processes rather than certain organisms affected by np with dose specific pattern at genetic level and had implications in resource utilization of sludge containing refractory organics graphical abstract image

surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ethers oil field demulsifier textile auxiliary antistatic agent and rubber auxiliary production giger et al 1984 is becoming a hot spot in the area of toxicology due to its estrogenic activity diverse adverse effects of np including developmental abnormalities infertility hermaphrodites abnormal vitellogenesis and neurotoxicity on individual organisms cells tissues and organs have been reported kwak et al 2017 mueller et al 2019 in general np disturb the endocrine system by specifically binding to the natural estrogen receptor nuclear protein causing the transcriptional regulation of various genes in target cells bolger et al 1998 it has been proposed that np leads to the common dna effects which might be dna damage and or point mutations or genomic rearrangements wang et al 2018 it should be noted that the estrogenic activity of np was dose dependent and usually emerged when it reached the threshold concentration bunay et al 2018 in uterine tissue high np dose 50 mg kg activated related genes while low np dose 0 5 and 5 mg kg did not watanabe et al 2004 similarly whether low dose of np can cause humans at risk of endocrine disruption has not reached agreement diao et al 2017 osimitz et al 2015 vazquez duhalt et al 2005 at present np still has a huge market demand due to the absence of perfect substitutes even though the adverse effect of np is well known in fact in addition to certain organisms np is widely existed in various environmental media contaminated sludge soil water etc specially sewage sludge has been proved to be a reservoir for np accumulation since most of np manufactures enter into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps and take the sewage sludge as a final receiving place the concentration of np accumulated in sludge varies with time and region diversed in the same order of magnitude mg kg dry sludge paterakis et al 2012 verlicchi and zambello 2015 for example the np content has been researched to be 0 02 2530 mg kg according to the sludge samples collected worldwide and the maximum value has been reported to be 500 0 mg kg dry sludge in china lately mailler et al 2017 therefore treatment and resource utilization of sludge also faces a risk of np till now most of the reported studies on effects of np focused on certain organism exposed to np and the influences of np on complex microbial system i e sludge aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion system have rarely been published anaerobic digestion first introduced in the natural process occurred in biological organisms has been strategically applied for treatment and comprehensive utilization of sewage sludge li et al 2019 martins et al 2018 quantity reduction and stabilization is achieved and valuable end products biogas liquid and biosolid are created simultaneously during sludge anaerobic digestion gonzalez gil et al 2016 whether the feedstock is sludge or any other organics feeding regime the pivotal components of anaerobic digestion involve substrates microorganisms and complex biochemical reactions that is hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis liu and chen 2018 each of which has the potential to be the rate limiting step according to distinct conditions liu and ghosh 1997 palmowski and muller 2000 acidogenic bacteria exert an effect on polymer mainly polysaccharide and protein hydrolysis and monomers acidification yielding short chain fatty acids scfas especially acetic acid for further methanogenesis driven by methanogenic archaea emptage et al 1997 zhou et al 2018 in this regard the variation of any aforementioned components will cause the dissimilarities in anerobic digestion processes for instance a great diversity of contents and compositions of products have been observed with different operational parameters ph temperature and srt shamurad et al 2020 yuan et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 pretreatments microwave ultrasonic and thermolysis cieslik et al 2015 elbeshbishy et

solid and nutrient contents hidaka et al 2013 hinken et al 2008 massanet nicolau et al 2008 as a refractory chemical in sludge however np has the potential to be a possibility affecting sludge anaerobic digestion different from the individual organism in the previous study sludge anaerobic digestion is the biochemical processes characterized by microbial uniquely collaborative way of working exposed to different doses of np according to these points key questions are asked how does np dose in sludge influence its anaerobic digestion i e dose response effect what is the prevailing mechanism of np effect on microbial processes in sludge or the difference similarity in estrogenic effect of np on individual organism cell tissue or organ and integrated microbial consortia sludge the objective of the present study was to explore the dose response relationship between methane production and np especially the changes in methane formation pathways during anaerobic digestion and the mechanisms first np shaped microbial processes such as hydrolysis acidification and substrate based methanogenesis were pinpointed specifically shift of the predominant methanogenic pathway such as aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic pathway in the presence of np was then studied by using stable isotope technology the populations of functional microbes involved in np shaped microbial process including acidogenic bacteria and two types of methanogenic archaea were deciphered by 16s rrna gene sequencing finally the np differentiated microbial function traits responsible for key microbial process were profiled at genetic level based on metagenomic analysis this study uncovered the dose specific effects and mechanisms underlying the complex microbial processes exposed to np and provided clues to resource utilization of np containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of the sludge and chemicals the sewage sludge applied in this study was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp in shanghai china before use the raw sludge was filtered with screen 1 mm 1mm to remove impurities and then concentrated by settling at 4 c for 1 d the final properties of sludge were ph 6 97 0 1 total suspended solid tss 15 7 0 5 g l volatile suspended solids vss 10 4 0 3 g l total chemical oxygen demand tcod 12660 190 mg l soluble chemical oxygen demand scod 130 10 mg

on sludge anaerobic digestion more conveniently by adding the external np 4 n np 98 extensively used in various industries was purchase from alfa aesar shanghai china np stock solution 1 g l was obtained by dissolving np into methanol high performance liquid chromatography grade sigma aldrich which was stored in dark place at 4 c 2 2 sludge anaerobic digesters exposed to np the experiments on np affecting anaerobic digestion were conducted in a series of identical serum bottles containing 300 ml of sludge the np concentrations in anaerobic digesters were set to 0 control 50 100 200 1000 mg kg dry sludge respectively the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by adding naoh or hcl and all reactors were purged with nitrogen for 2 minutes to remove oxygen after sealing with a rubber stopper the anaerobic digestion reactors were operated at 150 rpm and 35 1 c in an air bath shaker the srt was maintained at 20 d by discharging 15 ml of digestion mixture from the anaerobic reactors every day and replacing it with the same volume of the fresh corresponding np containing sludge gas mixture in anaerobic reactors was sampled every 2 d to determine the methane production after methane production was relatively stable the digestion liquid was taken to analyze the content of dissolved polysaccharides and proteins microbial community and metagenome and gas mixture was used to measure the stable carbon isotopic value of methane δ13ch4 and carbon dioxide δ13co2 the experiments on np affecting anaerobic digestion processes hydrolysis acidification and methanogenesis were performed in a series of identical anaerobic reactors using synthetic wastewater for experiment of np affecting hydrolysis 450 mg of bsa model protein and 90 mg of dextran model polysaccharide were dissolved into 270 ml tap water to form synthetic wastewater and 30 ml of digestion mixture from long term anaerobic reactors was added as the inoculum the operating parameters ph temperature and rotate speed and

flame ionization detector db waxetr column and a thermal conductivity detector nitrogen as carrier gas respectively the relative contribution of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways

digestion reactors fig 1 a shows the apparent yield of methane in anaerobic digesters under different np stresses obviously the presence of np gave a positive influence on methane production during sludge anaerobic digestion however the positive influences varied with np concentration in sludge the average production of methane in anaerobic digesters with np concentration of 0 50 100 200 and 1000 mg kg was 9 42 12 10 11 50 11 85 and 14 42 ml g vss respectively fig 1 b as the np content in sludge increased during anaerobic digestion the trend of methane production was divided into two stages by np at the dose of 200 mg kg in the first stage the methane yields increased first and then remained steady with the np content in the range of 0 200 mg kg in the second stage the methane yields increased with the concentration of np in the range of 200 1000 mg kg and the production of methane achieved the highest when the dose of np was 1000 mg kg in this study the biodegradation efficiency of np in sludge anaerobic digestion was relatively low indicating that the contribution of np biodegradation to methane production could be negligible supporting information and the promotion of methane production came from anaerobic digestion of sludge like the dose response relationship between np and organisms cells tissues or organs the methane production varied with np dose based on the methane production in the np influenced digesters here two doubts to be further disclosed are 1 why could np accelerate the anaerobic digestion of sludge 2 what was the difference in acceleration mechanism between low and high contents of np in order to reveal this uncertainty information more clearly the present study artificially defined the key np concentration nodes which were control 0 mg kg low dose 50 mg kg corresponding to the first peak of methane production and high dose 1000 mg kg corresponding to the second peak of methane production from the side of toxicology this dose specific relationship is neither a monotonic promotion or inhibition trend such as j shaped and s shaped curve nor a common hormesis trend such as u shaped curve it is of great and enlightening significance to explore the mechanisms on anaerobic digestion of sludge under different np stresses 3 2 key processes in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors typically anaerobic digestion of biowastes can be roughly separated into a prerequisite step where hydrolysis acidification and homoacetogenesis take place and a second step where acetate h2 and co2 are transformed into methane methanogenesis non methanogenesis occupies a crucially important niche for the robust performance of anaerobic digestion with a rate limited by hydrolysis of insoluble heterogeneous substrates liu and ghosh 1997 palmowski and muller 2000 it is worth noting that the majority of acetic acid utilized for methane production are generated from acidification which can be a potential rate limiting step under the condition of environmental stress due to the inhibition of microbial growth wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in fact the contribution of homoacetogenesis to acetic acid is almost negligible when other hydrogen consuming microorganisms such as methanogens exist in the system the current results showed that the promotion effect of np on anaerobic digestion was not originating from the influence of np on hydrolysis fig s1 for acidification fig 2 a no significant difference p 0 05 in production of total scfas 6238 6479 mg cod l was observed between the control and np reactors at the end of operation time 3 d the main scfas produced from acidification were acetic and n butyric acid which occupied 90 of the total scfas the productions of acetic acid with low and high np concentration 4454 and 4209 mg cod l were much higher than that in the control 3429 mg cod l which suggested that more acetic acid produced during acidification of sludge usually about one third of the methane is formed from h2 co2 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis hm and acetic acid is the source of the remaining two thirds aceticlastic methanogenesis am in the biowaste digestion system however no information is currently available on substrate based methanogenesis shaped by different np concentrations the accumulation of methane in am reactors with low and high np concentration was 130 2 and 127 9 ml fig 2 b when the operation time was 8 d respectively higher than that in the control 103 0 ml unlike am the methane production increased gradually with np content in the range of 0 1000 mg kg during hm fig 2 c when the operation time was 2 d the high np dose caused a drastic increase in methane accumulation 1 72 times of that in the control compared with the other reactors methane production was governed by methanogenic processes and pathways meaning that the np influenced processes were insufficient to explain the trend of methane production affected by np in the real bioreactors and thus shift of dominant methanogenic pathway was further investigated fig 2 d shows the values of δ13ch4 δ13co2 and αc in anaerobic digestion reactors with different np contents the average value of δ13ch4 in the control was 47 2 while it increased to 45 6 and then decreased to 53 4 respectively with low and high concentration of np in contrast the values of δ13co2 showed the opposite trend in anaerobic digestion systems which were 26 3 16 0 and 13 6 respectively with the increasing of np concentration the values of αc calculated from δ13ch4 and δ13co2 were 1 022 1 031 and 1 042 respectively under no low and high np stresses it was reported that the methane production was dominated by aceticlastic hydrogenotrophic and a combination of aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when αc 1 027 αc 1 065 and αc 1 045 lu et al 2013 thus the predominant pathway was am in the control and low np dose reactor and then it shifted to a combination of am and hm with high np dose to date the shift of predominant methanogenic pathway especially the restrained aceticlastic pathway has been reported under the condition of environmental stress eg high acetate and ammonium concentration lu et al 2013 low ph hao et al 2012 and methanogenic inhibitors bes and chloroform xu et al 2010 in this study not only was aceticlastic pathway not being suppressed by np but also hydrogenotrophic pathway was enhanced at high np dose which is different from the reported publications therefore both low and high concentration of np had a positive effect on acidification and am of sludge on this basis the production and proportion of methane from hm was further enhanced by high concentration of np fig 2 e consequently this paper focused on the methanogenesis and acidification of sludge and the influence of np on hydrolysis was not considered 3 3 core microbiota in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors acidogenic bacteria acidification mediated by acidogenic microorganisms can be a potential rate limiting step under the condition of environmental stress due to the shift of bacterial community wang et al 2020 in this sense anaerobic digester with np was characterized by the highest bacterial diversity and evenness fig s2 the higher microbial diversity and evenness is regarded as a reservoir of fermentative bacteria with redundant metabolic pathways which is desirable to ensure a functional stability of microbial communities and often correlated with more stable anaerobic reactor calusinska et al 2018 wittebolle et al 2009 bacterial communities of sludge in this study were mainly dominated by phylum bacteroidetes proteobacteria firmicutes spirochaetae chloroflexi actinobacteria parcubacteria acidobacteria and chlorobi fig s3 a which were usually regarded as the core bacteria during hydrolysis and acidification bacteria associated with acidification enriched in np reactors can be divided into three groups fig 3 a and s3 a the first group was organic substrate degrading bacteria representatives of acidimicrobiales and corynebacteriales which can convert glucose succinate and lactate etc to acetate co2 and h2 as intermediates de rezende et al 2020 detman et al 2018 the second group was the microorganisms i e anaerolineales and chlorobiales responsible for syntrophic metabolism with aceticlastic methanogens by providing acetate products florentino et al 2019 liang et al 2015 the third group was able to adapt to the complex environment by switching substrate types to avoid direct competition with other microbial populations representatives of rhizobiales which might exert a positive effect on the stable operation of anaerobic digestion pang and liu 2007 the relative abundances of all the mentioned bacteria in np reactors were much higher than that in the control indicating that the shift of bacterial community was beneficial to sludge acidification in the presence of np methanogenic archaea methanogenic archaea obtain their energy for growth from the conversion of a limited number of substrates to methane gas likewise methanogenic archaea were more diverse and evenly distributed with np methanobacteriaceae methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae methanoregulaceae and methanospirillaceae were pinpointed as the predominant methanogen at family level in the anaerobic digestion systems fig s3 b as shown in fig 3 b and s3 b the genus methanosaeta affiliated to methanosaetaceae and methanosarcina belonging to methanosarcinaceae carry out an aceticlastic reaction that splits acetate costa and leigh 2014 whose relative abundances with np 11 20 15 43 and 1 65 3 29 respectively were higher than that in the control 9 26 and 1 00 respectively the family methanoregulaceae mainly methanolinea methanospirillaceae mainly methanospirillum methanobacteriaceae and wcha1 57 were hydrogenotrophic that can reduce co2 to methane liu and whitman 2008 the total relative abundance of these hydrogenotrophic methanogen was 15 67 in the control whereas it increased to 23 48 with high np concentration on the other hand due to the accumulation of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen with np the relative abundance of methanogen utilizing other substrates i e methanomethylovorans using c 1 compounds as substrates jiang et al 2005 was suppressed in np reactors thus the methanogenic community in anaerobic digestion systems under np stress was advantageous to methane production from aceticlastic reaction and co2 reduction metagenomic analysis was used to further evaluate all the microorganisms belonging to different domains fig 3 c a higher number of archaea especially methanogen was obtained in np reactors 3 57 and 3 87 with low and high np contents respectively compared with the control 3 35 which could be related with the higher methane production in np reactors 3 4 functional traits of microbiota in np differentiated anaerobic digestion reactors as is well known almost all the life activities of microorganisms are essentially related with functional genes in order to further unravel the reason why microbial community was shifted to one suitable for acetate and methane productions by the np load the metagenomics analysis based on geneset constructed by acidogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea was conducted in this study in anaerobic digesters microbial functions harbor fermentation and growth which is associated with fermentative pathway and physiological status of microorganisms acidification related functions the pathways of acidification by acidogenic bacteria mainly consist of glycolysis emp and ed pathway monosaccharide metabolism amino acid metabolism stickland reaction and pyruvate metabolism it is worth noting that the pathways of glycolysis and monosaccharide metabolism fructose mannose galactose and amino nucleotide sugar metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway were enhanced significantly p 0 05 with both low and high doses of np fig 4 a and s4 additionally the functional genes encoding hexokinase hk glucose 6 phosphate isomerase pgi triosephosphate isomerase tpia phosphoglycerate mutase gpmai and apgm glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapn and 2 dehydro 3 deoxy phosphogluconate aldolase eda involved in glycolysis schroder et al 1994 amino acid reductase grdabcde and prd and aminotransferase asda associated with stickland reaction and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por and korab acetate kinase acka and phosphotransacetylase pta bouillaut et al 2013 embodied in pyruvate metabolism increased by 10 275 in np digesters compared with control acetate produced from acidogenic pathway should be transported then for utilization and in this regard acetate transporter genes atoe and smct were enhanced with both np doses for non acidogenic pathway translation ribosome was significantly p 0 05 enhanced by both low and high np concentrations fig 4 a and s4 the ribosome functions to translate mrna during protein biosynthesis to maintain cell homeostasis and survival the genes encoding components of the ribosomal subunit involved in repairing dna damage rps3 early development and a regulator of cell migration and survival in organism rps7 chaperones of the 5s rrna transported between nucleolus and cytosol rpl5 and ribosomal assembly rpl15 park and kwak 2012 yu et al 2006 were improved by np however differentiated pathways were observed with low and high np content fig s4 purine pyrimidine metabolism homologous recombination mismatch repair and dna replication increased significantly p 0 05 at low np dose whereas substrates amino acid and monosaccharide transporter genes livgfhmk rbsac ugpbe aapjm prowv and metq and quorum sensing controlling biofilm formation bapa secy and oppcd increased significantly under high dose of np based on bacteria gene set acidification was enhanced with dose specific mechanisms fig 4 b np positively affected functional genes involved in acidogenic pathway besides low np dose facilitated genetic information processing and high np dose was conductive to membrane transport and signal transduction methanogenesis related functions the pathways of methanogenesis aceticlastic reaction and co2 reduction were profiled based on gene set constructed by methanogenic archaea suggesting that the function methane metabolism ko00680 was enhanced by both low and high np contents fig 4 a and s5 for aceticlastic reaction the relative abundances of genes related with acetyl coa synthetase acs and co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthetase cdhcde in methanogen under np stress was higher than that in the control for co2 type pathway the abundances of genes corresponded to formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase fwdbcdef formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase ftr methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase mtd and 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer and genes included in the synthesis of coenzymes f420 and methanofuran mfr cofcdehg fbic and mfnce with high np stress were 1 2 1 6 times of that in the control for common pathway partial pathway existed in both am and hm genes mtrdgh coenzyme m methyltransferase mtr mcrabcdg methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr and hdrabc heterodisulfide reductase hdr were enriched in the presence of both low and high concentration of np thus both np doses benefited the functional genes involved in aceticlastic and common pathway in addition high concentration of np resulted in the promotion of functional genes involved in not only the metabolic pathway but also the synthesis of coenzymes for co2 reduction based on methanogenic gene set bio membrane mediated functions abc transporters with np were much higher than that in the control fig 4 a and s5 substrate binding atp binding and permease protein of iron complex cobalt nickel and molybdate transport system were accumulated under high np stress iron is the essential insertion into the protoporphyrin macrocycle to yield the haem used for iron supply of methanogen crichton 2019 cobalt and nickel act as the centrally coordinated ion in cyclic tetrapyrroles corrin rings in coenzymes participating in methanogenesis takashima et al 2011 unusual nickel corrin coenzyme f430 cofactor of mcr involved in the final step of methane production and subunit mtra harbors a cobalt corrin derivatives prosthetic group which is methylated and demethylated in the catalytic cycle during methanogenesis the molybdate due to its stereological similarity blocks the first enzyme in the sulfate reduction and thus stimulates the methane production banat et al 1983 substrate binding atp binding and permease protein of zinc only increased under high np concentration zinc is the essential site of formate dehydrogenase which catalyzes the reaction that produces reduced coenzyme f420 from the oxidation of formate in place of h2 the site of heterodisulfide reduction has been found in the zinc protein hdrb a subunit of hdr catalyzing the reduction of the cob com heterodisulfide back to cob and com takashima et al 2011 additionally the functions associated with the growth and proliferation of hydrogenotrophic methanogen ribosome pyrimidine metabolism rna polymerase and protein export were facilitated with high concentration of np fig 4 a and s5 demonstrating that more daughter cells of hydrogenotrophic methanogen were produced with high np content based on the above results sludge methanogenesis was facilitated and shaped with dose specific mechanisms fig 4 b both low and high contents of np promoted functional genes involved in aceticlastic pathway and transporters of essential components for coenzyme synthesis in common pathway besides high dose of np was beneficial to hydrogenotrophic pathway and transporters genes of key material involved in coenzyme synthesis in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis environmental information processing especially membrane transport and signal transduction were critical functions activated by np during sludge anaerobic digestion in fact the disturbed membrane permeability and uptake of substances have also been observed in individual organism np has higher affinity for membrane phospholipids and was found to affect the active transport of calcium to sarcoplasmic reticulum and cause cell death madhu and pooja 2018 under the condition of np inducing hepatotoxicity in the freshwater fish the inter and intracellular membrane transport decreased midhila and chitra 2015 the functions of membrane transport in bacteria and archaea involved in anaerobic digestion increased with np in the range of experimental concentration based on metagenomics analysis fig 4 b which is different from the mechanisms obtained in individual organism on the other hand it has now been understood that np exerted estrogenic effects by elaborating signaling transduction that control the overall physiology of the organism for instance er signalling pathway is targeted by np at the central level during zebrafish early development and long term exposure to np affects insulin signaling in the liver of adult male rates vosges et al 2012 in this study quorum sensing belonging to signal transduction controlling biofilm formation which is conductive to cell survival of bacteria was improved at high np dose fig 4 b by analogy with estrogenic mechanisms of np on organisms the alterations of these functions in sludge can be regarded as the estrogenic mechanisms of np on microbial consortium with regard to genes that were activated by np in previous publications many genes involved in amino acid and glucose metabolism were detected in addition to environmental information processing genes the activities of hexokinase in liver showed a significant decrease while the activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glucose 6 phosphatase increased in animals treated with np in a dose dependent manner when compared to control animals exposure to inappropriate concentrations of np may alter glucose metabolism and enhance the risk of diabetes jubendradass et al 2011 aspartate transaminase alanine transaminase lactate dehydrogenase thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and glutathione levels were influenced by np and thus it can induce oxidative stress in the liver of male rats korkmaz et al 2010 sludge anaerobic digestion especially acidification process is a complex system for the degradation of organic matters including amino acid and glucose fig 4 b which is interconnected with the metabolism of these organic matter in organisms this study provided a deep insight into dose specific effects of np on sludge anaerobic digestion at metabolic pathway and genetic level and had important implications in resource utilization of sludge containing refractory organics on the other hand the research was conducted to gain effect of np on all forms of life not only at the level of individual organism but also of the biological group involved in complex microbial processes 4 conclusion methane production from sludge anaerobic digestion exhibited the dose specific enhancement as the np dose increased low and high np doses facilitate anaerobic digestion with dose specific mechanisms both low and high np doses promoted acidification and am and am dominated the methanogenic pathway at low np dose high np dose further stimulated hm and a combination of am and hm dominated the methanogenic pathway at high np dose for acidification functional genes involved in substrate transportation and bioconversion into acetate and acetate transportation were promoted by both np doses for methanogenesis functional genes associated with aceclastic pathway were accumulated by both low and high np doses besides high np dose also stimulated a majority of genes involved in co2 reduction pathway and key material transporters for coenzyme synthesis
