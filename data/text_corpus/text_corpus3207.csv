16035,as peracetic acid paa is being increasingly used as an alternative disinfectant efficient activation of paa by low cost and environmentally friendly catalysts over a wide ph range is potentially useful for simultaneous sterilization and pharmaceutical degradation in wastewater such as hospital wastewater in this study peracetic acid paa was successfully activated by low cost and environmental friendly fes 25 mg l for efficient oxidative removal of three pharmaceuticals over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 as indicated by 80 100 removal rate within 5 min as expected fe ii rather than sulfur species was the primary reactive site for paa activation while unlike the homogeneous fe2 paa system with organic radicals r o and oh as the dominant reactive oxidized species ros oh is the key reactive species in the fes paa system interestingly and surprisingly in depth investigation revealed the dual role of sulfur species in regulating the reactive oxidized species 1 s ii and its conversion product h2s aq played a significant role in fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation 2 however the r o generated in the initial seconds of the fes paa process was supposed to be quickly consumed by sulfur species resulting in oh as the dominant ros over the whole process the selective reaction of sulfur species with r o instead of oh was supported by the obviously lower gibbs free energy of ch3coo and sulfur species than oh suggesting the preference of ch3coo to react with sulfur species with electron transfer after treatment with the fes paa system the products obtained from the three pharmaceuticals were detoxified and even facilitated the growth of e coli probably due to the supply of numerous carbon sources by activated paa this study significantly advances the understanding of the reaction between paa and sulfur containing catalysts and suggests the practical application potential of the fes paa process combined with biotreatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid fes pharmaceuticals degradation sulfur species organic radicals reactive oxidized species 1 introduction currently serious environmental health and human health risks are being posed by a diverse variety of pharmaceuticals and bacterium from hospital wastewater therefore it is urgent to address these problems top et al 2020 owing to the advantages of its prominent sterilization ability and the limited formation of harmful byproducts peracetic acid paa with a high oxidation power standard reduction potential eh 0 1 0 1 96 v has been applied in the wastewater disinfection process dominguez henao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however the rate constants of paa oxidation of organic compounds vary widely by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 3 2 10 6 to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 demonstrating its high selectivity kim and huang 2020 therefore paa can only directly oxidize limited refractory pollutants like 4 chlorophenol while is ineffective for degrading certain pharmaceuticals cai et al 2017 sharma 2010 external energy and catalysts have been used to activate paa by decomposing the o o bond with generation of reactive oxidized radicals ros oh ch3c o o ch3c o and singlet oxygen o2 1 suggesting great potential for the oxidative removal of contaminants cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 luukkonen et al 2015 murahashi et al 2000 rothbart et al 2012 wang et al 2021b wu et al 2020 zhou et al employed activated carbon fibers acfs as the catalyst to activate paa for degradation of dyes but with low degradation efficiency zhou et al 2015 although co based catalysts co3o4 and cofe2o4 showed better ability toward paa activation and further contaminant removal the secondary pollution of co leaching hinders their application wang et al 2021b wu et al 2020 therefore in order to promote the application of paa based technology for the simultaneous sterilization and pharmaceutical degradation in hospital wastewater attempts should be made to develop highly efficient low cost and environmental friendly heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation previous studies have reported that some non metallic elements like se and p possess a strong electron donating ability to regenerate fe ii and therefore assist iron based advanced oxygen processes aops optimization duan et al 2019 fang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 sulfide is one of the most abundant reductants in the subsurface environment and has been applied in aops for example mos2 and s zvi exhibited a high performance for peroxymonosulfate pms and h2o2 activation li et al 2017 pan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 particularly fes is widespread in anoxic systems commonly formed from dissimilatory bacterial reduction of sulfate he et al 2019 and can be easily prepared in the laboratory owing to its strong reducibility and low cost fes has been applied for direct treatment of organic contaminants and heavy metals and activating oxidants like h2o2 and peroxydisulfate pds chen et al 2017 chen et al 2015 cheng et al 2020 fan et al 2017 gong et al 2016 as such application of fes in paa activation might be effective and promising for pharmaceutical degradation as reported previously cheng et al 2016 fes and s ii have been proposed to accelerate the fe ii regeneration from the reduction of fe iii however s ii contained in fes could be converted into other sulfur species during the activation of oxidants such as h2s hs hso3 so3 2 etc rickard and luther 2007 furthermore it s discovered that the electron efficiency followed the order of s2 s2o4 2 s2o3 2 s0 when different sulfidation agents were used for s zvi preparation cai et al 2021 as such involvement of sulfur species in the activation of oxidants would be quite complicated while limited work has pointed out which of the sulfur species primarily contributing to fe ii fe iii conversion moreover although paa activation by homogeneous fe2 has been deeply investigated with the result of carbon centered radicals and or fe iv and oh dominated in the initial and second reaction phases respectively kim et al 2019 the formation of ros might be varied by the introduction of nonmetal sulfur species for example zhou et al stated that intermediate so3 2 of sulfur conversion played an important role in sulfate radical generation in the peroxymonosulfate pms fes2 system zhou et al 2018b it thus drove us to consider the role of sulfide conversion in regulating the ros amounts and species generated in the fes paa system the objectives of this study were to investigate the efficiency and mechanisms of paa with fes in the degradation of pharmaceuticals frequently detected in hospital wastewater firstly the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals in the fes paa system was evaluated based on the effects of reactant dosages initial ph values and water matrices ha hco3 h2po4 and cl subsequently the mechanism of paa activation by fes was explored from the perspective of reactive species identification and the role of sulfur in facilitating the iron cycle and regulating the dominant reactive oxygen species furthermore the degradation pathway of representative sulfamethoxazole smx and the toxicity of pharmaceuticals before and after their treatment in the fes paa system were estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details of the chemicals and reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 and were used without further purification iodometry and potassium permanganate titration were regularly employed to calibrate the stock solution of paa text s2 chemical solutions were prepared by dissolving the chemicals in ultrapure water thoroughly the preparation method of fes is provided in text s3 tap water and lake water were sampled at laboratory and campus sichuan chengdu respectively ultrapure water 18 2 m ω cm was used in all experiments except for the tests of actual water matrixes 2 2 reaction procedures batch degradation experiments were conducted in a 250 ml beaker containing 200 ml reaction solution in a water bath maintaining the reaction temperature at 25 1 c and magnetic stirring at a speed of 300 rpm the reaction solution consisted of the desired concentrations of the target compound smx carbamazepine cbz and naproxen nap and or oxidant paa and h2o2 pds with the initial ph adjusted by 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 1 m naoh for mechanism exploration smx was used as the model contaminant the buffer solution was not used to avoid possible reactions between the radicals and buffer species a predetermined dosage of fes stock was added to initiate the reaction at specific time intervals 1 5 ml samples were collected for filtration and quickly quenched by 0 1 mm sodium thiosulfate for further analysis to evaluate the contribution of radicals to the degradation of target compounds the same reaction experiments were conducted but predetermined tert butyl alcohol tba was added before the reaction details regarding the analytical methods are provided in text s4 all experiments were performed at least in triplicate and the average values with standard errors were reported 2 3 theoretical and computational details to obtain the gibbs free energy of the reactions the entropy values at the standard condition 1 atm and 298 15 k were calculated by harmonic approach all calculations were conducted using gaussian 16 package frisch et al 2009 geometry optimizations were performed at the m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2007 6 311 g d p level of theory with the grimme s empirical dispersion correction grimme et al 2010 grimme et al 2011 frequency analysis was subsequently conducted at the same level of theory to obtain the thermal corrections and confirm the stationary points as minima the single point energy calculations were conducted using the m06 2x functional with the def2 tzvp weigend and ahlrichs 2005 basis set solvation effects were introduced to all calculations including optimization and energy calculations using the smd model marenich et al 2009 with water as the solvent the reaction free energy g expressed as the eq 1 1 δ g g p g r where gp and gr are the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution of the product and reactant respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals by the fes paa system the degradation results of smx under different aqueous systems with an initial ph of 7 0 are illustrated in fig 1 a and b the negligible change in the smx concentration in the paa alone and fes alone systems excluded the contribution of paa oxidation and adsorption onto fes to smx removal fig 1a in the fes paa system 80 32 0 76 of smx 10 μm was degraded within 3 min by 100 μm paa in the presence of 25 mg l fes in comparison only 53 57 1 41 42 45 0 024 and 13 27 0 054 of smx were degraded in pms fes h2o2 fes and pds fes systems within 10 min respectively fig 1b it can be concluded that the fes paa process can degrade contaminants more efficiently than other oxidant systems catalyzed by fes notably compared with other heterogeneous catalysts in paa activation systems reported previously such as cofe2o4 co3o4 and afc as summarized in table s2 fes can achieve satisfactory degradation efficiency even at an extremely low dosage within a much shorter reaction time the degradation of smx in the fes paa system followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b with the k obs calculated as 0 5758 min 1 which stood out among the heterogeneous catalyzed paa systems table s2 moreover as illustrated in figs s3 and s4 cbz nap ibuprofen ibp ciprofloxacin cip levofloxacin lvf and diclofena dcf can be quickly removed in the proposed system within 10 min suggesting the good performance of fes paa system in degrading diverse pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 the effect of ph the removal of pharmaceuticals under different ph conditions was examined to further evaluate the degradation performance of the fes paa system as shown in fig s5b when the initial ph of the paa system was controlled at 3 0 and 11 0 the ph changed over a limited range during the reactions however probably due to the consumption of paa the ph value quickly decreased to 4 4 4 6 after reaction of 30 s in the systems with initial ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 the inhibitory effects at initial ph values of 11 0 for smx fig s5a might be ascribed to the weaker oxidizing ability of deprotonated paa paa kim and huang 2020 and the formation of iron hydroxo complexes babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 differently fig s3 and table s3 showed that the catalytic activation of paa by fes resulted in significant abatements of smx 10 μm cbz 10 μm and nap 10 μm over a 10 min time period at initial ph of 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 meanwhile the surface charge of fes decreased from 14 0 to 20 2 mv with an increase in ph value from 4 0 to 9 0 fig s6 indicating that the surface characteristics of fes would not be critical to affect its interaction with paa these results suggest that the combination of paa and fes exhibits extensive tolerance to the ph 3 1 2 the effect of fes and paa concentration smx was selected to investigate the factors affecting pharmaceutical degradation using the fes paa system as illustrated in figs 1d and s7 the degradation efficiencies and corresponding k obs of smx separately enhanced from 10 79 0 04 to 100 1 62 from 0 0291 to 3 0441 min 1 within 10 min when the paa concentration increased from 25 to 500 μm while k obs decreased to 0 8513 min 1 as the paa concentration was further enhanced to 1000 μm as shown in fig s8a the degradation rate of smx improved from 9 09 0 05 to 93 08 0 78 within 10 min and the observed reaction rate constants k obs increased markedly from 0 2020 to 0 5786 min 1 as the fes loading increased from 5 to 25 mg l fig 1c nevertheless a continuous increase in the fes dosage from 25 to 100 mg l caused a decrease in the smx degradation rate by 32 78 0 17 fig 1c interestingly the positive linear correlation 0 9806 between the observed paa decomposition rate constant k obs paa and fes concentration suggested the decomposition of paa followed positive linear correlation to fes concentration fig s9 however smx removal efficiency was not continuously enhanced with fes concentration which was reasonable and could be explained from two aspects 1 an excess dosage of fes would compete with contaminants for reacting with ros gao et al 2017 kim et al 2019 2 the increasing sulfur species are capable of consuming parts of paa fig s10 as such excess fes might act as a paa quencher and further reduce the production of ros kim and huang 2020 3 1 3 the influence of water matrix as can be seen from figs s11 s12 the addition of both humic acid and cl played a little role in smx degradation while obvious restraints on smx removal were observed in the presence of hco3 and h2po4 which are probably attributed by their radical scavenging ability and their possible occupation of the active sites to inhibit the oxidation process li et al 2021b in particular fig s13 illustrated that the effect of different water matrices on fe ii concentration was in accord with the effect on smx degradation the inhibition of h2po4 2 on fe ii concentration was stronger than h2co3 and ha due to the formation of different fe water matrices complexation rose and waite 2002 additionally since acetic acid coexisted in paa solution the influence of acetic acid on smx removal was evaluated as displayed in fig s14 the extra addition of ch3coo resulted in the inhibition of smx degradation the negative effect induced by ch3coo was likely ascribed to its quenching effect yamauchi et al 1992 nevertheless the removal efficiency of smx by fes paa system in the tap water and lake water compositions listed in table s4 could still reach 82 17 and 81 65 within 10 min respectively fig s15 suggesting the acceptable feasibility of this system in treating pharmaceuticals contained in real water 3 2 mechanism of paa activation by fes 3 2 1 role of fe species fe ii is well known as an oxidant activating catalyst for the generation of ros but the existence of sulfur species with reducing ability would influence the role of fe species as reported in fes2 pms system zhou et al 2018b nevertheless no peaks appeared in the epr spectra of the hso3 paa hs paa and so3 paa systems excluded this possibility fig s16 moreover reactive radicals such as oh might contribute to paa activation eqs 4 5 however as shown in fig s17 and table s5 the addition of tba had a slight inhibition on paa decomposition rate disclosing that the reaction between oh and paa partially contributed to paa decomposition it s thus concluded that the paa was indeed mainly activated by fe species rather than oh or sulfur specie fe ii on the fes surface and or fe ii released from fes dissolution are capable of being the active sites but this needs further verification because 2 2 bipyridyl bpy can chelate fe ii to hinder electron transfer to the oxidants on the surface of particles but cannot quench oh directly fang et al 2013 bpy was added to the reaction system to test the activation of paa by surface fe ii as expected the degradation efficiency of smx decreased from 93 08 0 10 to 18 07 0 12 in the presence of bpy 0 5 mm fig 2 a it should be noted that aqueous fe ii can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen but the process takes several hours cheng et al 2016 additionally the maximum dissolved fe ii achieved over 30 s 1 min following the order phini 3 0 phini 5 0 phini 7 0 phini 9 0 fig s18 fast decrease of ph to 4 4 4 6 after reaction of 30 s finally resulted in insignificant difference of maximum fe ii production in the systems with initial ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 however the maximum aqueous fe ii concentration is not consistent with the smx removal rate table s3 implying the contribution of surface fe ii to ros production these results demonstrate that both dissolved fe ii and surface fe ii are able to activate paa to produce reactive species in the fes paa system eqs 2 3 2 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o o fe iii oh 3 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o o fe iii o h 4 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 5 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o h 2 o o 2 3 2 2 fast regeneration of fe ii by sulfur species fig s19 shows that fe ii and s2 s ii were the dominant fe and s species in the pristine fes respectively after the activation reaction surface fe ii was transformed into fe iii and the surface disulfide and or polysulfides were oxidized into a series of s species covering the fes surface including s0 s8 0 and sn 2 fig 2c further analysis of the aqueous samples revealed a moderate increase in soluble so4 2 in the first 1 min fig 2d since so3 2 iv was unstable and easily oxidized to so4 2 the occurrence of trace s iv followed by its subsequent disappearance displayed in fig 2d is reasonable at the same time eds mappings showed that the proportion of surface s decreased from 29 90 to 13 83 after the reaction probably as a result of s release into the solution in the form of oxysulfides fig s20 further supporting the xps and aqueous phase analysis results the above results imply the regeneration of fe ii by sulfides and their intermediates which was further supported by the following phenomena and experiments i the total fe ii decreased at a slower rate in the fes paa system compared to the dissolved fe ii in the fe ii paa system ii as depicted in fig 3 a smx degradation was greatly accelerated by the simultaneous addition of fe iii with the efficiency becoming 48 05 0 75 within 10 s furthermore the variation trend of dissolved fe ii in the fe iii fes paa process fig 3b was in accord with the fes paa system while the peak concentration of dissolved fe ii was significantly increased by the extra dosing of fe iii these results indicate the fast reduction of fe iii to fe ii by s species resulting in accelerated paa activation and pollutant degradation in addition although the regenerated fe ii or fe ii in the system possessed reducibility the possibility of reducing the oxidized products back to smx could be ruled out as confirmed by the results presented in fig s21 however since the released s2 from fes might be transformed to various sulfur species like hso3 hs h2s and so3 due to the hydrolysis and electron donation process rickard and luther 2007 suleimenov and seward 1997 which sulfur species is the primary contributor for fe ii regeneration needs further identification as shown in fig s22 with the reaction ph decreased from initial 7 0 to 4 4 4 6 in the reaction process the concentration of hs and so3 2 reduced meanwhile h2s was the dominant sulfur species and hso3 increased slightly with a relative low concentration therefore the contributions of individual presence of hso3 hs s2 and so3 in the system to fe ii regeneration from fe iii systems have been taken into consideration as illustrated in fig 4 a although fe ii could be quickly regenerated from fe iii in the four systems the steady fe ii concentrations in s2 and hs system were significantly higher than other two sulfur species systems moreover the concentration of s iv in the fes paa system slightly increased within 10 s and then kept at a trace level fig 2d suggesting the inappreciable role of hso3 and so3 2 in fe ii fe iii conversation otherwise as the solution ph was acidic in the fe iii system reaction ph 3 5 and the ph quickly changed to acid values in the whole effective systems in the fes paa system fig s5b aqueous h2s was speculated to be the dominated sulfide in the solution of s2 fe iii hs fe iii and fes paa systems suleimenov and seward 1997 as such it can be concluded that the regeneration of aqueous fe ii concentration in fes paa system might be primarily ascribed to the presence of aqueous h2s rather than hs s2 hso3 and so3 2 eq 6 additionally in view of the contribution of surface fe ii in paa activation the detected s ii in the pristine fes fig s19c is also supposed to play a significant role in facilitate surfaced fe ii fe iii conversion eq 7 fan et al 2018 6 h 2 s aq 8 fe iii 4 h 2 o 8 fe ii so 4 2 10 h 7 fes 8 fe iii 4 h 2 o 9 fe ii so 4 2 8 h 3 2 3 reactive oxidized species generated in the fes paa system identification of reactive oxidized species according to previous studies fe iv likely plays an important role in micropollutant degradation in fe based aops ao et al 2021 the generation of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 from ethyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso oxidized by fe iv via two electron transfer was evaluated in fes paa system as described in fig s23 the generation of pmso2 was about 0 5 µm under different initial ph values much less than the concentration in the fe2 paa system kim et al 2019 indicating that fe iv played little role in the fes paa process eq 8 meanwhile almost no change of pmso2 concentration and no generation of pmso were observed following the addition of various sulfur species into the pmso2 solution excluding the possibility of fes and sulfur species in facilitating the transformation of pmso2 back to pmso fig s24 additionally the complexation of target compound with catalyst or oxidant with catalyst like cefalexin cu ii complex and co ii pms complex chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a has been regarded as the reactive species in aops however the role of complexation would be ruled out in fes paa system as detailed in text s7 8 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o oh f e iv o 2 the rapid decomposition of paa by fes may generate ch3c o o oh etc as primary ros via eqs 2 3 epr technology with dmpo and 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as spin trapping agents was applied to analyze the generated ros fig 3c shows a significant epr signal with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the typical signal of dmpo oh suggesting the presence of oh or fe iv but absence of sulfate radicals in the fes paa system the possibility of dmpo oxidation by fe iv to form dmpo oh can be excluded by the limited transformation of pmso into pmso2 fig s23 although h2o2 coexisted in the paa solution background h2o2 11 92 μm when paa 100 μm in this study the dmpo oh signal did not originate from the coexisting h2o2 eq 9 because there was no obvious dmpo oh signal in the fes h2o2 system fig s25 to better understand the ros generation process the epr spectra of the dippmpo adduct in the fes paa system with and without the presence of tba under different ph and reaction times were recorded it has been reported that dippmpo as a phosphorylated spin trapping agent can simultaneously record oh and carbon center radicals chalier and tordo 2002 rokhina et al 2010 as outlined previously the multiple line peaks observed in the epr spectra revealed the presence of oh and r o regardless of the initial ph fig 5 it should be noted that the intensities of epr signals were extremely weak at ph 10 0 despite the existence or absence of tba fig s26 consistent with no obvious degradation of smx under alkaline conditions fig s5 the addition of tba caused the disappearance of oh adducts 8 line signal indicated by black dots in fig 5a and the 12 line signal indicated by the pink heart shape indicative of four carbon centered adducts ch3c o o ch3 ch3c o and ch3oo rokhina et al 2013 remained in the epr spectra within a reaction time of 10 s with the reaction time being prolonged to 3 min the epr signal can still be clearly observed without the addition of tba however it almost disappeared in the presence of tba under various ph values these results indicated the generation of oh during the reaction process while the production of r o was only discovered in the initial seconds to further identify the roles of these radicals in pollutant degradation excess dosages of tba a well known oh scavenger k 6 0 108m 1 s 1 that would not react with organic radicals were added to the fes paa system to evaluate the contributions of oh yang et al 2019 fig 3d indicates that smx degradation was greatly inhibited when tba was added at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mm and the degradation efficiency decreased from 93 08 0 76 to 16 33 0 064 as 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd can quench both oh and r o radicals zhang et al 2020 it was also employed in this study interestingly the incomplete inhibition of smx degradation in the presence of tba but complete inhibition of degradation in the presence of 2 4 hd 10 mm in the first seconds indirectly indicated the presence of r o and their participation in smx oxidation figs 3d and s27 however the smx degradation efficiency of less than 10 after the addition of tba suggested the small amounts of r o generated from paa activation and the primary role of oh 9 h 2 o 2 fe ii oh fe iii o h steady state concentration calculation to interpret quantitatively the generation of oh and r o radicals the concentration of radicals was calculated according to the reaction kinetic rates of two pharmaceuticals with oh and r o as detailed in text s8 briefly nap and smx degradations in the fes paa system were fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model expressed as eq s4 based on the above analysis the ros responsible for contaminants oxidation were oh and r o and their corresponding degradation processes were represented as eq s5 and details provided in the text s8 according to text s8 the expressions of ʃ oh and ʃ r o can be obtained via the following eqs s11 and s12 and the average concentrations of the radicals over time t oh ave and r o ave are defined by eqs s13 and s14 the results indicated that oh ave 1 136 10 12 was about 6 4 times of r o ave 1 766 10 13 at initial ph of 7 0 which confirmed the above hypothesis that oh is the dominant ros produced in fes paa system moreover the accuracy of the calculated values oh ave and r o ave was verified by selecting cbz as a testing compound as can be seen from table s4 the rate constants of the reaction between cbz and k oh and k r o are 8 8 109 and 3 58 109 respectively table s6 according to the above equations the pseudo first order kinetic model of kcal cbz can be obtained with a result of 10 63 10 3s 1 which is very close to the observed experimental data k obs cbz 9 668 10 3 s 1 confirming the good feasibility of the proposed method to quantify the generated radicals regulating the dominated reactive oxygen species by sulfur in the homogeneous fe2 paa system the r o and or fe iv likely played an important role in micropollutant degradation in the initial kinetic phase while oh was important in the second reaction phase kim et al 2019 interestingly and unexpectedly r o was only detected in the initial stage with a low yield and oh was the dominant ros responsible for pharmaceutical removal during the fes paa process the disappearance of r o in the fes paa system might be contributed by their reaction with o2 however this possibility was excluded by no significant difference of smx degradation efficiency in co paa n2 and co paa air systems regardless of the presence or absence of s2 text s10 and fig 4b this drives us to consider the possible role of s species in regulating ros in the fes paa system especially the quenching effect of s species on r o dft calculation with gaussian 16 package was used to explore the possibility of oh and r o reacting with sulfur species possible reactions and their g are listed in eqs 17 26 and visually illustrated in fig 4c according to the negative values of g the reaction of ch3coo and sulfur species can spontaneously take place at the standard reaction condition thermodynamically notably the g values of oh and sulfur species like hso3 so3 2 hs and s2 were entirely higher than those of ch3coo and sulfur species at room temperature 298 15 k indicating that ch3coo is more inclined to react with sulfur species with electron transfer 10 c h 3 co o hso 3 δ g 12 0 kcal mol c h 3 co o hso 3 11 c h 3 co o so 3 2 δ g 52 0 kcal mol c h 3 co o so 3 12 c h 3 co o h s δ g 34 7 kcal mol c h 3

oh was detected with terephthalic acid tpa as the target contaminant in the fes paa and fe2 paa systems the concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa transformed from tpa in the fes paa system was obviously higher than that in the fe2 paa system fig 4d suggesting that sulfur species facilitated fe ii regeneration and paa activation resulting in higher yield of oh in the fes paa system considering the above results and discussion it was proposed that oh and r o were generated simultaneously from paa activation by fes according to eqs 2 3 at a fast speed sulfur species play an important role in regulating the dominant reactive radicals on the one hand sulfur species accelerated the paa activation and radical generation by assisting fe ii regeneration on the other hand r o radicals were rapidly consumed by sulfur species with oh being the primary radical accounting for pollutant degradation eq 10 19 3 2 4 degradation pathway and toxicity analysis degradation pathway of smx transformation products tps of smx in the fes paa system were analyzed using sciex exionlc ac coupled with sciex x500r ms with an electrospray ionization esi source hplc ms ms based on the analysis six major transformation products tps including tp 270 tp 271 tp 156 tp 99 tp 255 and smx were identified table s7 and fig s28 the possible degradation pathways are shown in fig s29 based on the chemical structure of smx and the transformation products generally oh likely reacts with organic compounds by an addition reaction hydrogen atom abstraction and single electron transfer an et al 2014 the detected hydroxyl smx derivative tp 270 after the reaction indicated that the occurrence of hydroxylation reaction on the aniline ring pathway i gardner et al 1964 additionally non selective hydroxyl radicals can attack the bond of sulfamethoxazole resulting in the cleavage of the s n bond with generation of tp 99 and tp 156 pathway ii liu et al 2017 smx was also subject to hydroxylation to produce tp271 via attack of oh pathway iii moreover the hydroxylation product tp 255 was initially formed by ros attack on the reactive site n of the nh2 in the benzene ring pathway iv toxicity analysis compared with the original cbz smx and nap solution the p phosphoreum t3 bioluminescence inhibition rate of the oxidized products of cbz smx and nap obtained after the treatment of fes paa system decreased by 29 12 10 78 and 18 21 respectively fig s30a the results demonstrated that the treatment with the fes paa process could detoxify the three pharmaceuticals to some extent the detoxification effect is further supported by the growth curves of e coli in the presence of three pharmaceuticals and their degradation products as displayed in figs s30b s30d the growth of e coli was restrained slightly by the three pharmaceuticals because of the detrimental effect on reproductive abilities and behaviors wang et al 2021c while the reaction products of the three pharmaceuticals surprisingly facilitated the growth of e coli a possible explanation is that the degradation process by fes paa provided extra nutrient such as carbon sources resulting from paa activation for microbial growth in particular the oxidation of refractory micro pollutants is a highly accepted method for improving the biodegradability of wastewater and improving the efficiency of the subsequent bio treatment process von gunten 2018 therefore combining the fes paa process and bio treatment process would be promising for the treatment of hospital wastewater 4 conclusion this study reports the use of widespread sulfur containing minerals as heterogeneous catalysts in paa based aops for the fast degradation of pharmaceuticals at low dosages although it is difficult to recycle fes since it would be consumed by paa repeated dosing of fes at every cycle and immobilization of fes onto other supporter or catalyst would be a good strategy to obtain a satisfactory decontamination performance figs s31 and s32 importantly the present study is among the first to record the process of r o generation and consumption and discover the dual role of sulfur species in regulating the ros 1 s ii and aqueous h2s aq contributed to fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation and contaminants degradation 2 while the r o generated in the initial stage of the fes paa process was quickly consumed by sulfur species resulting in oh as the dominant ros over the whole process additionally industrial wastewater such as tannery wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and refinery wastewater contains high concentration of sulfur species zhou et al 2018a therefore understanding the regulation effect of sulfur species on ros generation is of significant importance to the application of paa based aops in sulfur bearing wastewater however more research should be conducted to better understand the reaction process of s species and r o including research focused on the reaction rate and transformation products the new knowledge gained in this study is helpful for further development of paa based aops for environmental applications and provides a new insight into the

16035,as peracetic acid paa is being increasingly used as an alternative disinfectant efficient activation of paa by low cost and environmentally friendly catalysts over a wide ph range is potentially useful for simultaneous sterilization and pharmaceutical degradation in wastewater such as hospital wastewater in this study peracetic acid paa was successfully activated by low cost and environmental friendly fes 25 mg l for efficient oxidative removal of three pharmaceuticals over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 as indicated by 80 100 removal rate within 5 min as expected fe ii rather than sulfur species was the primary reactive site for paa activation while unlike the homogeneous fe2 paa system with organic radicals r o and oh as the dominant reactive oxidized species ros oh is the key reactive species in the fes paa system interestingly and surprisingly in depth investigation revealed the dual role of sulfur species in regulating the reactive oxidized species 1 s ii and its conversion product h2s aq played a significant role in fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation 2 however the r o generated in the initial seconds of the fes paa process was supposed to be quickly consumed by sulfur species resulting in oh as the dominant ros over the whole process the selective reaction of sulfur species with r o instead of oh was supported by the obviously lower gibbs free energy of ch3coo and sulfur species than oh suggesting the preference of ch3coo to react with sulfur species with electron transfer after treatment with the fes paa system the products obtained from the three pharmaceuticals were detoxified and even facilitated the growth of e coli probably due to the supply of numerous carbon sources by activated paa this study significantly advances the understanding of the reaction between paa and sulfur containing catalysts and suggests the practical application potential of the fes paa process combined with biotreatment processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid fes pharmaceuticals degradation sulfur species organic radicals reactive oxidized species 1 introduction currently serious environmental health and human health risks are being posed by a diverse variety of pharmaceuticals and bacterium from hospital wastewater therefore it is urgent to address these problems top et al 2020 owing to the advantages of its prominent sterilization ability and the limited formation of harmful byproducts peracetic acid paa with a high oxidation power standard reduction potential eh 0 1 0 1 96 v has been applied in the wastewater disinfection process dominguez henao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however the rate constants of paa oxidation of organic compounds vary widely by nearly 10 orders of magnitude from 3 2 10 6 to 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 demonstrating its high selectivity kim and huang 2020 therefore paa can only directly oxidize limited refractory pollutants like 4 chlorophenol while is ineffective for degrading certain pharmaceuticals cai et al 2017 sharma 2010 external energy and catalysts have been used to activate paa by decomposing the o o bond with generation of reactive oxidized radicals ros oh ch3c o o ch3c o and singlet oxygen o2 1 suggesting great potential for the oxidative removal of contaminants cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 luukkonen et al 2015 murahashi et al 2000 rothbart et al 2012 wang et al 2021b wu et al 2020 zhou et al employed activated carbon fibers acfs as the catalyst to activate paa for degradation of dyes but with low degradation efficiency zhou et al 2015 although co based catalysts co3o4 and cofe2o4 showed better ability toward paa activation and further contaminant removal the secondary pollution of co leaching hinders their application wang et al 2021b wu et al 2020 therefore in order to promote the application of paa based technology for the simultaneous sterilization and pharmaceutical degradation in hospital wastewater attempts should be made to develop highly efficient low cost and environmental friendly heterogeneous catalysts for paa activation previous studies have reported that some non metallic elements like se and p possess a strong electron donating ability to regenerate fe ii and therefore assist iron based advanced oxygen processes aops optimization duan et al 2019 fang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 sulfide is one of the most abundant reductants in the subsurface environment and has been applied in aops for example mos2 and s zvi exhibited a high performance for peroxymonosulfate pms and h2o2 activation li et al 2017 pan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 particularly fes is widespread in anoxic systems commonly formed from dissimilatory bacterial reduction of sulfate he et al 2019 and can be easily prepared in the laboratory owing to its strong reducibility and low cost fes has been applied for direct treatment of organic contaminants and heavy metals and activating oxidants like h2o2 and peroxydisulfate pds chen et al 2017 chen et al 2015 cheng et al 2020 fan et al 2017 gong et al 2016 as such application of fes in paa activation might be effective and promising for pharmaceutical degradation as reported previously cheng et al 2016 fes and s ii have been proposed to accelerate the fe ii regeneration from the reduction of fe iii however s ii contained in fes could be converted into other sulfur species during the activation of oxidants such as h2s hs hso3 so3 2 etc rickard and luther 2007 furthermore it s discovered that the electron efficiency followed the order of s2 s2o4 2 s2o3 2 s0 when different sulfidation agents were used for s zvi preparation cai et al 2021 as such involvement of sulfur species in the activation of oxidants would be quite complicated while limited work has pointed out which of the sulfur species primarily contributing to fe ii fe iii conversion moreover although paa activation by homogeneous fe2 has been deeply investigated with the result of carbon centered radicals and or fe iv and oh dominated in the initial and second reaction phases respectively kim et al 2019 the formation of ros might be varied by the introduction of nonmetal sulfur species for example zhou et al stated that intermediate so3 2 of sulfur conversion played an important role in sulfate radical generation in the peroxymonosulfate pms fes2 system zhou et al 2018b it thus drove us to consider the role of sulfide conversion in regulating the ros amounts and species generated in the fes paa system the objectives of this study were to investigate the efficiency and mechanisms of paa with fes in the degradation of pharmaceuticals frequently detected in hospital wastewater firstly the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals in the fes paa system was evaluated based on the effects of reactant dosages initial ph values and water matrices ha hco3 h2po4 and cl subsequently the mechanism of paa activation by fes was explored from the perspective of reactive species identification and the role of sulfur in facilitating the iron cycle and regulating the dominant reactive oxygen species furthermore the degradation pathway of representative sulfamethoxazole smx and the toxicity of pharmaceuticals before and after their treatment in the fes paa system were estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details of the chemicals and reagents used in this study are provided in text s1 and were used without further purification iodometry and potassium permanganate titration were regularly employed to calibrate the stock solution of paa text s2 chemical solutions were prepared by dissolving the chemicals in ultrapure water thoroughly the preparation method of fes is provided in text s3 tap water and lake water were sampled at laboratory and campus sichuan chengdu respectively ultrapure water 18 2 m ω cm was used in all experiments except for the tests of actual water matrixes 2 2 reaction procedures batch degradation experiments were conducted in a 250 ml beaker containing 200 ml reaction solution in a water bath maintaining the reaction temperature at 25 1 c and magnetic stirring at a speed of 300 rpm the reaction solution consisted of the desired concentrations of the target compound smx carbamazepine cbz and naproxen nap and or oxidant paa and h2o2 pds with the initial ph adjusted by 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 1 m naoh for mechanism exploration smx was used as the model contaminant the buffer solution was not used to avoid possible reactions between the radicals and buffer species a predetermined dosage of fes stock was added to initiate the reaction at specific time intervals 1 5 ml samples were collected for filtration and quickly quenched by 0 1 mm sodium thiosulfate for further analysis to evaluate the contribution of radicals to the degradation of target compounds the same reaction experiments were conducted but predetermined tert butyl alcohol tba was added before the reaction details regarding the analytical methods are provided in text s4 all experiments were performed at least in triplicate and the average values with standard errors were reported 2 3 theoretical and computational details to obtain the gibbs free energy of the reactions the entropy values at the standard condition 1 atm and 298 15 k were calculated by harmonic approach all calculations were conducted using gaussian 16 package frisch et al 2009 geometry optimizations were performed at the m06 2x zhao and truhlar 2007 6 311 g d p level of theory with the grimme s empirical dispersion correction grimme et al 2010 grimme et al 2011 frequency analysis was subsequently conducted at the same level of theory to obtain the thermal corrections and confirm the stationary points as minima the single point energy calculations were conducted using the m06 2x functional with the def2 tzvp weigend and ahlrichs 2005 basis set solvation effects were introduced to all calculations including optimization and energy calculations using the smd model marenich et al 2009 with water as the solvent the reaction free energy g expressed as the eq 1 1 δ g g p g r where gp and gr are the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution of the product and reactant respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating the degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals by the fes paa system the degradation results of smx under different aqueous systems with an initial ph of 7 0 are illustrated in fig 1 a and b the negligible change in the smx concentration in the paa alone and fes alone systems excluded the contribution of paa oxidation and adsorption onto fes to smx removal fig 1a in the fes paa system 80 32 0 76 of smx 10 μm was degraded within 3 min by 100 μm paa in the presence of 25 mg l fes in comparison only 53 57 1 41 42 45 0 024 and 13 27 0 054 of smx were degraded in pms fes h2o2 fes and pds fes systems within 10 min respectively fig 1b it can be concluded that the fes paa process can degrade contaminants more efficiently than other oxidant systems catalyzed by fes notably compared with other heterogeneous catalysts in paa activation systems reported previously such as cofe2o4 co3o4 and afc as summarized in table s2 fes can achieve satisfactory degradation efficiency even at an extremely low dosage within a much shorter reaction time the degradation of smx in the fes paa system followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b with the k obs calculated as 0 5758 min 1 which stood out among the heterogeneous catalyzed paa systems table s2 moreover as illustrated in figs s3 and s4 cbz nap ibuprofen ibp ciprofloxacin cip levofloxacin lvf and diclofena dcf can be quickly removed in the proposed system within 10 min suggesting the good performance of fes paa system in degrading diverse pharmaceuticals 3 1 1 the effect of ph the removal of pharmaceuticals under different ph conditions was examined to further evaluate the degradation performance of the fes paa system as shown in fig s5b when the initial ph of the paa system was controlled at 3 0 and 11 0 the ph changed over a limited range during the reactions however probably due to the consumption of paa the ph value quickly decreased to 4 4 4 6 after reaction of 30 s in the systems with initial ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 the inhibitory effects at initial ph values of 11 0 for smx fig s5a might be ascribed to the weaker oxidizing ability of deprotonated paa paa kim and huang 2020 and the formation of iron hydroxo complexes babuponnusami and muthukumar 2012 differently fig s3 and table s3 showed that the catalytic activation of paa by fes resulted in significant abatements of smx 10 μm cbz 10 μm and nap 10 μm over a 10 min time period at initial ph of 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 meanwhile the surface charge of fes decreased from 14 0 to 20 2 mv with an increase in ph value from 4 0 to 9 0 fig s6 indicating that the surface characteristics of fes would not be critical to affect its interaction with paa these results suggest that the combination of paa and fes exhibits extensive tolerance to the ph 3 1 2 the effect of fes and paa concentration smx was selected to investigate the factors affecting pharmaceutical degradation using the fes paa system as illustrated in figs 1d and s7 the degradation efficiencies and corresponding k obs of smx separately enhanced from 10 79 0 04 to 100 1 62 from 0 0291 to 3 0441 min 1 within 10 min when the paa concentration increased from 25 to 500 μm while k obs decreased to 0 8513 min 1 as the paa concentration was further enhanced to 1000 μm as shown in fig s8a the degradation rate of smx improved from 9 09 0 05 to 93 08 0 78 within 10 min and the observed reaction rate constants k obs increased markedly from 0 2020 to 0 5786 min 1 as the fes loading increased from 5 to 25 mg l fig 1c nevertheless a continuous increase in the fes dosage from 25 to 100 mg l caused a decrease in the smx degradation rate by 32 78 0 17 fig 1c interestingly the positive linear correlation 0 9806 between the observed paa decomposition rate constant k obs paa and fes concentration suggested the decomposition of paa followed positive linear correlation to fes concentration fig s9 however smx removal efficiency was not continuously enhanced with fes concentration which was reasonable and could be explained from two aspects 1 an excess dosage of fes would compete with contaminants for reacting with ros gao et al 2017 kim et al 2019 2 the increasing sulfur species are capable of consuming parts of paa fig s10 as such excess fes might act as a paa quencher and further reduce the production of ros kim and huang 2020 3 1 3 the influence of water matrix as can be seen from figs s11 s12 the addition of both humic acid and cl played a little role in smx degradation while obvious restraints on smx removal were observed in the presence of hco3 and h2po4 which are probably attributed by their radical scavenging ability and their possible occupation of the active sites to inhibit the oxidation process li et al 2021b in particular fig s13 illustrated that the effect of different water matrices on fe ii concentration was in accord with the effect on smx degradation the inhibition of h2po4 2 on fe ii concentration was stronger than h2co3 and ha due to the formation of different fe water matrices complexation rose and waite 2002 additionally since acetic acid coexisted in paa solution the influence of acetic acid on smx removal was evaluated as displayed in fig s14 the extra addition of ch3coo resulted in the inhibition of smx degradation the negative effect induced by ch3coo was likely ascribed to its quenching effect yamauchi et al 1992 nevertheless the removal efficiency of smx by fes paa system in the tap water and lake water compositions listed in table s4 could still reach 82 17 and 81 65 within 10 min respectively fig s15 suggesting the acceptable feasibility of this system in treating pharmaceuticals contained in real water 3 2 mechanism of paa activation by fes 3 2 1 role of fe species fe ii is well known as an oxidant activating catalyst for the generation of ros but the existence of sulfur species with reducing ability would influence the role of fe species as reported in fes2 pms system zhou et al 2018b nevertheless no peaks appeared in the epr spectra of the hso3 paa hs paa and so3 paa systems excluded this possibility fig s16 moreover reactive radicals such as oh might contribute to paa activation eqs 4 5 however as shown in fig s17 and table s5 the addition of tba had a slight inhibition on paa decomposition rate disclosing that the reaction between oh and paa partially contributed to paa decomposition it s thus concluded that the paa was indeed mainly activated by fe species rather than oh or sulfur specie fe ii on the fes surface and or fe ii released from fes dissolution are capable of being the active sites but this needs further verification because 2 2 bipyridyl bpy can chelate fe ii to hinder electron transfer to the oxidants on the surface of particles but cannot quench oh directly fang et al 2013 bpy was added to the reaction system to test the activation of paa by surface fe ii as expected the degradation efficiency of smx decreased from 93 08 0 10 to 18 07 0 12 in the presence of bpy 0 5 mm fig 2 a it should be noted that aqueous fe ii can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen but the process takes several hours cheng et al 2016 additionally the maximum dissolved fe ii achieved over 30 s 1 min following the order phini 3 0 phini 5 0 phini 7 0 phini 9 0 fig s18 fast decrease of ph to 4 4 4 6 after reaction of 30 s finally resulted in insignificant difference of maximum fe ii production in the systems with initial ph values of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 however the maximum aqueous fe ii concentration is not consistent with the smx removal rate table s3 implying the contribution of surface fe ii to ros production these results demonstrate that both dissolved fe ii and surface fe ii are able to activate paa to produce reactive species in the fes paa system eqs 2 3 2 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o o fe iii oh 3 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o o fe iii o h 4 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o o o h 2 o 5 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o h 2 o o 2 3 2 2 fast regeneration of fe ii by sulfur species fig s19 shows that fe ii and s2 s ii were the dominant fe and s species in the pristine fes respectively after the activation reaction surface fe ii was transformed into fe iii and the surface disulfide and or polysulfides were oxidized into a series of s species covering the fes surface including s0 s8 0 and sn 2 fig 2c further analysis of the aqueous samples revealed a moderate increase in soluble so4 2 in the first 1 min fig 2d since so3 2 iv was unstable and easily oxidized to so4 2 the occurrence of trace s iv followed by its subsequent disappearance displayed in fig 2d is reasonable at the same time eds mappings showed that the proportion of surface s decreased from 29 90 to 13 83 after the reaction probably as a result of s release into the solution in the form of oxysulfides fig s20 further supporting the xps and aqueous phase analysis results the above results imply the regeneration of fe ii by sulfides and their intermediates which was further supported by the following phenomena and experiments i the total fe ii decreased at a slower rate in the fes paa system compared to the dissolved fe ii in the fe ii paa system ii as depicted in fig 3 a smx degradation was greatly accelerated by the simultaneous addition of fe iii with the efficiency becoming 48 05 0 75 within 10 s furthermore the variation trend of dissolved fe ii in the fe iii fes paa process fig 3b was in accord with the fes paa system while the peak concentration of dissolved fe ii was significantly increased by the extra dosing of fe iii these results indicate the fast reduction of fe iii to fe ii by s species resulting in accelerated paa activation and pollutant degradation in addition although the regenerated fe ii or fe ii in the system possessed reducibility the possibility of reducing the oxidized products back to smx could be ruled out as confirmed by the results presented in fig s21 however since the released s2 from fes might be transformed to various sulfur species like hso3 hs h2s and so3 due to the hydrolysis and electron donation process rickard and luther 2007 suleimenov and seward 1997 which sulfur species is the primary contributor for fe ii regeneration needs further identification as shown in fig s22 with the reaction ph decreased from initial 7 0 to 4 4 4 6 in the reaction process the concentration of hs and so3 2 reduced meanwhile h2s was the dominant sulfur species and hso3 increased slightly with a relative low concentration therefore the contributions of individual presence of hso3 hs s2 and so3 in the system to fe ii regeneration from fe iii systems have been taken into consideration as illustrated in fig 4 a although fe ii could be quickly regenerated from fe iii in the four systems the steady fe ii concentrations in s2 and hs system were significantly higher than other two sulfur species systems moreover the concentration of s iv in the fes paa system slightly increased within 10 s and then kept at a trace level fig 2d suggesting the inappreciable role of hso3 and so3 2 in fe ii fe iii conversation otherwise as the solution ph was acidic in the fe iii system reaction ph 3 5 and the ph quickly changed to acid values in the whole effective systems in the fes paa system fig s5b aqueous h2s was speculated to be the dominated sulfide in the solution of s2 fe iii hs fe iii and fes paa systems suleimenov and seward 1997 as such it can be concluded that the regeneration of aqueous fe ii concentration in fes paa system might be primarily ascribed to the presence of aqueous h2s rather than hs s2 hso3 and so3 2 eq 6 additionally in view of the contribution of surface fe ii in paa activation the detected s ii in the pristine fes fig s19c is also supposed to play a significant role in facilitate surfaced fe ii fe iii conversion eq 7 fan et al 2018 6 h 2 s aq 8 fe iii 4 h 2 o 8 fe ii so 4 2 10 h 7 fes 8 fe iii 4 h 2 o 9 fe ii so 4 2 8 h 3 2 3 reactive oxidized species generated in the fes paa system identification of reactive oxidized species according to previous studies fe iv likely plays an important role in micropollutant degradation in fe based aops ao et al 2021 the generation of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 from ethyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso oxidized by fe iv via two electron transfer was evaluated in fes paa system as described in fig s23 the generation of pmso2 was about 0 5 µm under different initial ph values much less than the concentration in the fe2 paa system kim et al 2019 indicating that fe iv played little role in the fes paa process eq 8 meanwhile almost no change of pmso2 concentration and no generation of pmso were observed following the addition of various sulfur species into the pmso2 solution excluding the possibility of fes and sulfur species in facilitating the transformation of pmso2 back to pmso fig s24 additionally the complexation of target compound with catalyst or oxidant with catalyst like cefalexin cu ii complex and co ii pms complex chen et al 2019 li et al 2021a has been regarded as the reactive species in aops however the role of complexation would be ruled out in fes paa system as detailed in text s7 8 c h 3 c o ooh fe ii c h 3 c o oh f e iv o 2 the rapid decomposition of paa by fes may generate ch3c o o oh etc as primary ros via eqs 2 3 epr technology with dmpo and 5 diisopropoxyphosphoryl 5 methyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dippmpo as spin trapping agents was applied to analyze the generated ros fig 3c shows a significant epr signal with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 corresponding to the typical signal of dmpo oh suggesting the presence of oh or fe iv but absence of sulfate radicals in the fes paa system the possibility of dmpo oxidation by fe iv to form dmpo oh can be excluded by the limited transformation of pmso into pmso2 fig s23 although h2o2 coexisted in the paa solution background h2o2 11 92 μm when paa 100 μm in this study the dmpo oh signal did not originate from the coexisting h2o2 eq 9 because there was no obvious dmpo oh signal in the fes h2o2 system fig s25 to better understand the ros generation process the epr spectra of the dippmpo adduct in the fes paa system with and without the presence of tba under different ph and reaction times were recorded it has been reported that dippmpo as a phosphorylated spin trapping agent can simultaneously record oh and carbon center radicals chalier and tordo 2002 rokhina et al 2010 as outlined previously the multiple line peaks observed in the epr spectra revealed the presence of oh and r o regardless of the initial ph fig 5 it should be noted that the intensities of epr signals were extremely weak at ph 10 0 despite the existence or absence of tba fig s26 consistent with no obvious degradation of smx under alkaline conditions fig s5 the addition of tba caused the disappearance of oh adducts 8 line signal indicated by black dots in fig 5a and the 12 line signal indicated by the pink heart shape indicative of four carbon centered adducts ch3c o o ch3 ch3c o and ch3oo rokhina et al 2013 remained in the epr spectra within a reaction time of 10 s with the reaction time being prolonged to 3 min the epr signal can still be clearly observed without the addition of tba however it almost disappeared in the presence of tba under various ph values these results indicated the generation of oh during the reaction process while the production of r o was only discovered in the initial seconds to further identify the roles of these radicals in pollutant degradation excess dosages of tba a well known oh scavenger k 6 0 108m 1 s 1 that would not react with organic radicals were added to the fes paa system to evaluate the contributions of oh yang et al 2019 fig 3d indicates that smx degradation was greatly inhibited when tba was added at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mm and the degradation efficiency decreased from 93 08 0 76 to 16 33 0 064 as 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd can quench both oh and r o radicals zhang et al 2020 it was also employed in this study interestingly the incomplete inhibition of smx degradation in the presence of tba but complete inhibition of degradation in the presence of 2 4 hd 10 mm in the first seconds indirectly indicated the presence of r o and their participation in smx oxidation figs 3d and s27 however the smx degradation efficiency of less than 10 after the addition of tba suggested the small amounts of r o generated from paa activation and the primary role of oh 9 h 2 o 2 fe ii oh fe iii o h steady state concentration calculation to interpret quantitatively the generation of oh and r o radicals the concentration of radicals was calculated according to the reaction kinetic rates of two pharmaceuticals with oh and r o as detailed in text s8 briefly nap and smx degradations in the fes paa system were fitted by a pseudo first order kinetic model expressed as eq s4 based on the above analysis the ros responsible for contaminants oxidation were oh and r o and their corresponding degradation processes were represented as eq s5 and details provided in the text s8 according to text s8 the expressions of ʃ oh and ʃ r o can be obtained via the following eqs s11 and s12 and the average concentrations of the radicals over time t oh ave and r o ave are defined by eqs s13 and s14 the results indicated that oh ave 1 136 10 12 was about 6 4 times of r o ave 1 766 10 13 at initial ph of 7 0 which confirmed the above hypothesis that oh is the dominant ros produced in fes paa system moreover the accuracy of the calculated values oh ave and r o ave was verified by selecting cbz as a testing compound as can be seen from table s4 the rate constants of the reaction between cbz and k oh and k r o are 8 8 109 and 3 58 109 respectively table s6 according to the above equations the pseudo first order kinetic model of kcal cbz can be obtained with a result of 10 63 10 3s 1 which is very close to the observed experimental data k obs cbz 9 668 10 3 s 1 confirming the good feasibility of the proposed method to quantify the generated radicals regulating the dominated reactive oxygen species by sulfur in the homogeneous fe2 paa system the r o and or fe iv likely played an important role in micropollutant degradation in the initial kinetic phase while oh was important in the second reaction phase kim et al 2019 interestingly and unexpectedly r o was only detected in the initial stage with a low yield and oh was the dominant ros responsible for pharmaceutical removal during the fes paa process the disappearance of r o in the fes paa system might be contributed by their reaction with o2 however this possibility was excluded by no significant difference of smx degradation efficiency in co paa n2 and co paa air systems regardless of the presence or absence of s2 text s10 and fig 4b this drives us to consider the possible role of s species in regulating ros in the fes paa system especially the quenching effect of s species on r o dft calculation with gaussian 16 package was used to explore the possibility of oh and r o reacting with sulfur species possible reactions and their g are listed in eqs 17 26 and visually illustrated in fig 4c according to the negative values of g the reaction of ch3coo and sulfur species can spontaneously take place at the standard reaction condition thermodynamically notably the g values of oh and sulfur species like hso3 so3 2 hs and s2 were entirely higher than those of ch3coo and sulfur species at room temperature 298 15 k indicating that ch3coo is more inclined to react with sulfur species with electron transfer 10 c h 3 co o hso 3 δ g 12 0 kcal mol c h 3 co o hso 3 11 c h 3 co o so 3 2 δ g 52 0 kcal mol c h 3 co o so 3 12 c h 3 co o h s δ g 34 7 kcal mol c h 3

oh was detected with terephthalic acid tpa as the target contaminant in the fes paa and fe2 paa systems the concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa transformed from tpa in the fes paa system was obviously higher than that in the fe2 paa system fig 4d suggesting that sulfur species facilitated fe ii regeneration and paa activation resulting in higher yield of oh in the fes paa system considering the above results and discussion it was proposed that oh and r o were generated simultaneously from paa activation by fes according to eqs 2 3 at a fast speed sulfur species play an important role in regulating the dominant reactive radicals on the one hand sulfur species accelerated the paa activation and radical generation by assisting fe ii regeneration on the other hand r o radicals were rapidly consumed by sulfur species with oh being the primary radical accounting for pollutant degradation eq 10 19 3 2 4 degradation pathway and toxicity analysis degradation pathway of smx transformation products tps of smx in the fes paa system were analyzed using sciex exionlc ac coupled with sciex x500r ms with an electrospray ionization esi source hplc ms ms based on the analysis six major transformation products tps including tp 270 tp 271 tp 156 tp 99 tp 255 and smx were identified table s7 and fig s28 the possible degradation pathways are shown in fig s29 based on the chemical structure of smx and the transformation products generally oh likely reacts with organic compounds by an addition reaction hydrogen atom abstraction and single electron transfer an et al 2014 the detected hydroxyl smx derivative tp 270 after the reaction indicated that the occurrence of hydroxylation reaction on the aniline ring pathway i gardner et al 1964 additionally non selective hydroxyl radicals can attack the bond of sulfamethoxazole resulting in the cleavage of the s n bond with generation of tp 99 and tp 156 pathway ii liu et al 2017 smx was also subject to hydroxylation to produce tp271 via attack of oh pathway iii moreover the hydroxylation product tp 255 was initially formed by ros attack on the reactive site n of the nh2 in the benzene ring pathway iv toxicity analysis compared with the original cbz smx and nap solution the p phosphoreum t3 bioluminescence inhibition rate of the oxidized products of cbz smx and nap obtained after the treatment of fes paa system decreased by 29 12 10 78 and 18 21 respectively fig s30a the results demonstrated that the treatment with the fes paa process could detoxify the three pharmaceuticals to some extent the detoxification effect is further supported by the growth curves of e coli in the presence of three pharmaceuticals and their degradation products as displayed in figs s30b s30d the growth of e coli was restrained slightly by the three pharmaceuticals because of the detrimental effect on reproductive abilities and behaviors wang et al 2021c while the reaction products of the three pharmaceuticals surprisingly facilitated the growth of e coli a possible explanation is that the degradation process by fes paa provided extra nutrient such as carbon sources resulting from paa activation for microbial growth in particular the oxidation of refractory micro pollutants is a highly accepted method for improving the biodegradability of wastewater and improving the efficiency of the subsequent bio treatment process von gunten 2018 therefore combining the fes paa process and bio treatment process would be promising for the treatment of hospital wastewater 4 conclusion this study reports the use of widespread sulfur containing minerals as heterogeneous catalysts in paa based aops for the fast degradation of pharmaceuticals at low dosages although it is difficult to recycle fes since it would be consumed by paa repeated dosing of fes at every cycle and immobilization of fes onto other supporter or catalyst would be a good strategy to obtain a satisfactory decontamination performance figs s31 and s32 importantly the present study is among the first to record the process of r o generation and consumption and discover the dual role of sulfur species in regulating the ros 1 s ii and aqueous h2s aq contributed to fe ii regeneration with a result of accelerated paa activation and contaminants degradation 2 while the r o generated in the initial stage of the fes paa process was quickly consumed by sulfur species resulting in oh as the dominant ros over the whole process additionally industrial wastewater such as tannery wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater and refinery wastewater contains high concentration of sulfur species zhou et al 2018a therefore understanding the regulation effect of sulfur species on ros generation is of significant importance to the application of paa based aops in sulfur bearing wastewater however more research should be conducted to better understand the reaction process of s species and r o including research focused on the reaction rate and transformation products the new knowledge gained in this study is helpful for further development of paa based aops for environmental applications and provides a new insight into the regulation of reactive radicals by non metal species associated content the relevant supporting information si containing texts s1 s10 tables s1 s6 and figs s1 s31 are provided in si document

prbs compared to that in the zvi ca 0 004 h 1 system the reaction rate 0 011 h 1 of 2 4 6 tcp increased by 175 in the combined chemical biological batch system moreover chemical biological augmentation significantly improved the retardation effect of bio prbs for 2 4 6 tcp it came from that chemical biological augmentation significantly decreased the dispersivity a 0 53 to 0 20 cm and increased the distribution coefficient k d 2 20 to 19 00 cm3 mg 1 the reaction rate λ 2 40 to 3 60 day 1 and the fraction 30 to 80 of first order kinetic sorption of 2 4 6 tcp in the lab scale one

groundwater in a pesticide factory site the field test results demonstrated it is a promising technology to construct vertical reaction columns or horizontal bio prbs for the efficient remediation of actually contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar groundwater remediation immobilized microorganism permeable reactive barriers 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 1 introduction according to statistics more than 50 of urban groundwater has seriously deteriorated in china li et al 2021 in the urban and rural areas chlorophenol organic compound 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp is widely used in herbicides disinfectants pesticides papermaking and plastic industries fricker et al 2014 jarvinen et al 1994 it has been detected in various environmental media such as excess sludge groundwater surface water and wastewater song et al 2019 biological concerns arising from 2 4 6 tcp include genetic toxicity liver toxicity immunotoxicity neurotoxicity cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity song et al 2019 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 it is highly toxic when absorbed by human skin and can cause obesity high cholesterol and high blood pressure in children and adolescents yang et al 2021 owing to its high toxicity wide range of pollution and bioaccumulation properties 2 4 6 tcp is listed as a priority pollutant by the european economic community eec and u s environmental protection agency usepa al abduly et al 2021 many technologies have been utilized to remove 2 4 6 tcp from wastewater groundwater and soil including adsorption saigl 2020 tzou et al 2008 biodegradation marsolek et al 2007 chemical reduction liu et al 2019 and advanced oxidation processes aops karimipour et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 owing to the high reactivity low cost and non toxicity of zero valent iron zvi soil and groundwater remediation has widely adopted the zvi technology for constructing in situ permeable reactive barriers prbs guo et al 2021 chlorinated aromatic compounds 2 4 6 tcp etc have been reported to be effectively reduced in the presence of zvi and the contaminates were converted into small molecular organic substances which greatly reduces their toxicities kim and carraway 2000 liu et al 2019 however solid iron corrosion products e g fe3o4 and fe2o3 can be generated in the reaction process which are known to in situ coat the surface of aggregates these lead to zvi powder can easily undergo agglomeration and passivation tao et al 2022 wang et al 2020c in particular in the engineering application of prbs zvi can easily be passivated reactivity loss after a period of application tao et al 2022 some carrier materials have been used to support zvi powder and improve its performance including biochar liu et al 2019 graphene oxide wang et al 2022 zeolite eljamal et al 2022 magnesium hydroxide shell falyouna et al 2022b and titanium nanowires falyouna et al 2022a etc the use of iron supported materials can effectively prevent zvi agglomeration and passivation maamoun et al 2019 however solid precipitates such as iron oxide and sulfates could be generated and clogging the prbs the blockage and compaction of powdered and nano zvi which are dispersed on supports in prbs has still not been solved entirely compared with zvi remediation technology technology based on microorganisms was also widely adopted for the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the biodegradation and mineralization of 2 4 6 tcp at a lower cost could be achieved in anaerobic environments lin et al 2019 song et al revealed that the acclimated microorganisms have a strong ability to dechlorinate and degrade 2 4 6 tcp and phenol ring openings song et al 2019 however microorganisms also have the problem of biomass loss and inactivation in the application of the site zhang et al 2021 the biodegradation efficiency largely depends on the survival rate of microorganisms in the actual environment the immobilization carriers were developed to immobilize and protect microorganisms and subsequently enhance the biodegradation rate valdivia rivera et al 2021 in the construction of in situ microorganism augmented permeable reactive barriers bio prbs zeolite polyurethane foam natural loofah sponge ols and other carriers were used to immobilize the microorganisms wang et al 2017 however the immobilization and remediation performance of bio prbs was still affected by other factors especially such as the biological clogging of stuffing wang and wu 2019 furthermore before prbs installation the prbs dismantling or materials replacement should be considered as part of the design phillips 2009 whereas in the actual field remediation the maintenance and replacement of reaction materials were not convenient in conventional prbs because the single use wall barriers and reaction wells were always constructed bekele et al 2019 li et al 2021 to resolve the aforementioned problems calcium alginate ca embedded zvi zvi ca gel beads and ca embedded biochar bc immobilized microorganism bc cell ca gel beads were developed zvi ca gel beads avoid the appearance of powdered zvi hardening in bio prbs moreover bc cell ca gel beads provide large porosity between beads and beads and slow release microorganism cells then avoid biological clogging of stuffing in bio prbs the field scale modularization vertical reaction device which can conveniently replace material also was designed in this study their performances were tested by constructing the lab scale and field scale bc immobilized microorganism augmented zvi permeable reactive barriers bio prbs as a coating agent ca has the advantages of non toxicity harmlessness simple production low price biodegradability and high mechanical strength lemic et al 2021 park et al 2021 the surface of ca is porous and has abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups which can uniformly load zvi and microorganisms on biochar and significantly improve its mechanical stability direct contact between organic pollutants and microorganisms also produces toxicity especially for chlorophenol patel et al 2022 microorganisms in ca gel beads can effectively avoid direct contact with pollutants additionally as the microorganism carrier biochar can not only provide attachment sites for microorganisms but also enhance the abundance of microorganisms to form an effective co metabolism reduction dechlorination system liu et al 2021 in the in situ remediation process of contaminated soil and groundwater previous other types of bio prbs systems had shown the advantages of low maintenance costs and no energy consumption amoako nimako et al 2021 in the study the metabolic mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp and

feature of structural fe ⅲ goethite α feooh and the results of xrd fig 4 g additionally the results of sem fig 3i showed that the top of the lamellar structure was severely corroded fig 4a f shows the xps spectra of zvi ca before and after the reaction in the different systems the peak of fe 2p3 2 at 710 1 ev was attributed to fe2 the peak of fe 2p3 2 at 711 6 ev and fe 2p1 2 at 724 2 ev was attributed to fe3 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 the results demonstrated the existence of fe2 25 84 and fe3 74 16 oxides in the interface of zvi ca before the reaction fig 4a additionally iron oxide fe

results fig 4 g confirmed that the iron oxides in the surface of zvi ca gel beads mainly comprised goethite α feooh jcpds 26 792 and fe3o4 jcpds 2 1035 before the reaction this was consistent with the fe o 31 34 and fe o h 68 66 results of xps fig 4a this was because zvi ca gel beads were partially oxidized to α feooh and fe3o4 during their preparation and storage subsequently fe2 was oxidated to

methanobacterium was the cometabolism archaea for the dechlorination of 1 1 1 trichloroethane to 1 1 dichloroethane egli et al 1987 the abundance of methanospirillum increased by 105 under the 1 1 1 trichloroethane condition wang and wu 2017 the above five strains were presumed to be the dominant cometabolism functional archaea for the dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp moreover norank f nitrososphaeraceae 39 84 and nitrosarchaeum 5 38 in the s4 solution of the zvi ca bc cell ca system were significantly greater than those 0 00 and 1 02 respectively in the s3 solution of the zvi ca system candidatus nitrocosmicus belonging to the nitrososphaera sister cluster was a novel ammonia oxidizing archaea species wang et al 2019 figs 6b shows bacterial compositions at the phylum level the abundance of firmicutes in s2 gel beads 28 49 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system was significantly greater than those in s1 gel beads 18 98 of the bc cell ca system and control 1 04 moreover firmicutes in the s4 solution 5 26 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system also was greater than that 4 01 in the s3 solution of the zvi ca system the abundances of proteobacteria in the s3 and s4 solutions 95 97 and 94 72 were greater than those 80 96 and 71 20 in the s1 and s2 gel beads the dehalogenation bacteria e g delftia desulfitobacterium and pseudomonas belonged to the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2018 fig 6d showed that the dominant bacteria at the genus level in the zvi ca bc cell ca system were delftia and desulfitobacterium the abundances of delftia in the s3 and s4 solutions 94 27 and 94 07 were both greater than those in the control s1 and s2 gel beads 73 36 76 16 and 69 43 respectively the abundances of desulfitobacterium in the s2 gel beads 18 62 and s4 solution 1 36 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system were both greater than those of the s1 gel beads 0 03 and s3 solution 0 00 in the zvi ca system and control 0 08 however the abundances of pseudomonas in the s1 gel beads 1 26 and s3 solution 0 25 of the zvi ca system were both greater than those of the s2 gel beads 0 01 and s4 solution 0 00 in the zvi ca bc cell ca system at the phylum level the dominant bacteria proteobacteria were the dominant population involved in dechlorination song et al 2019 delftia was the dominant bacteria belonging to proteobacteria many species of delftia lived in anoxic aerobic environments and could dehalogenate and degrade halogenated aromatic compounds the genus delftia could also dechlorinate and degrade 2 4 6 tcp and 2 4 dcp zhang et al 2019 according to reports co metabolism bacteria desulfitobacterium could induce ortho dehalogenation of 2 4 6 tcp and had a high capacity for chlorophenol dehalogenation breitenstein et al 2007 pseudomonas could tolerate up to 600 mg l 1 of 2 4 dcp through the meta pathway degradation of 2 4 dcp olaniran et al 2017 therefore desulfitobacterium was presumably the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal in the zvi ca bc cell ca system conversely in the bc cell ca system delftia and pseudomonas were presumed to be the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal 3 4 2 the richness and diversity of archaea and bacteria after 96 h of the reaction the richness differences of archaea in gel beads were not significant among the control chao1 12 000 s1 chao1 12 000 and s2 chao1 11 000 table 3 however the archaeal richness in the s4 solution chao1 26 857 of the bc cell ca zvi ca system was significantly greater than those in the s3 solutions chao1 13 000 of the zvi ca system and control chao1 12 000 moreover the archaeal diversity of the s4 solution shannon 1 604 simpson 0 256 was significantly greater than those of the s3 solution shannon 0 788 simpson 0 684 and control shannon 1 399 simpson 0 410 the archaeal diversity in gel beads decreased therefore the results demonstrated that the combination of bc cell ca and zvi ca was more beneficial for improving the diversity and richness of archaea in the reaction solution rather than in gel beads table 3 also presented that the diversity differences of bacteria in gel beads were not significant among the control shannon 1 087 simpson 0 560 s1 shannon 1 035 simpson 0 592 and s2 shannon 1 055 simpson 0 521 however the bacterial richness in s2 gel beads chao1 105 000 of the bc cell ca zvi ca system was significantly greater than that in the s3 gel beads chao1 75 857 of the zvi ca system moreover the bacterial diversity of the s4 solution shannon 0 327 simpson 0 886 was slightly greater than that of the s3 solution shannon 0 286 simpson 0 890 the bacterial richness in the reaction solution decreased therefore the results demonstrated that the combination of bc cell ca and zvi ca was more beneficial for improving the bacterial richness in gel beads and bacterial diversity in the reaction solution considered together the archaeal richness and bacterial diversity in gel beads were not affected compared to the bc cell ca system the bc cell ca zvi ca system had more advantages in improving the diversity and richness of archaea in the reaction solution bacterial richness in gel beads and bacterial diversity in the reaction solution 3 5 reaction mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp and transformation path of iron oxides in different systems fig 5a shows the proposed reaction pathways of 2 4 6 tcp in the zvi ca system the pathways a and b were based on the results of lc ms and previous reports christoforidis et al 2011 dorathi and kandasamy 2012 souza et al 2019 dorathi and kandasamy 2012 reported that dcp cp and phenol were the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination products under zvi reduction dorathi and kandasamy 2012 moreover we demonstrated that the 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 4 monochlorphenol 4 mcp and 2 monochlorphenol 2 mcp were produced through pathway a under zvi conditions souza et al 2019 in our study we detected phenol which was an indicator of such a degradation mechanism additionally the intermediate 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq was detected this was consistent with the report from christoforidis 2011 stating that dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone dcq and 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq were produced through pathway b through the deprotonation and elimination of hcl christoforidis et al 2011 the proposed 2 4 6 tcp reaction pathways in the bc cell ca system is shown in fig 5b christoforidis et al 2019 reported that phenol was the final microbial dichlorination product through pathway a christoforidis et al 2011 except for the dechlorination reaction pathway a the results of lc ms indicated the presence of intermediates dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone dcq 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq and chlorinated dimers 2 6 dichloro 4 3 5 dichloro 4 oxocyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 yl oxy cyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 one c12h6cl4o3 the chlorinated dimers were obtained from coupling reactions between dcq through pathway c christoforidis et al 2011 the proposed 2 4 6 tcp reaction pathway in the zvi ca bc cell ca system is shown in fig 5c the lc ms result showed that dcq dcsq and hdcq were detected the 2 hydroxyl dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone hdcq was a hydroxo derivative of dcq produced through pathway d christoforidis et al 2011 under the synergistic effect of the zvi ca and bc cell ca systems the chlorinated dimers have not been detected this implies that the zvi ca bc cell ca could inhibit the coupling reactions between dcq based on the evidence from the change of microbial diversity and previous research in section 3 4 1 the functional bacteria playing a key role in 2 4 6 tcp removal was confirmed to be sulfate reducing bacteria delftia desulfitobacterium and pseudomonas christoforidis et al 2011 olaniran et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 furthermore desulfitobacterium is known to be a very versatile microorganism capable of using a large range of electron acceptors such as natural or man made halogenated organic compounds humic acids metal sulfites and nitrate villemur et al 2006 the research revealed that the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfovibrio ferrophilus produced electron intermediates which could pass through the sodium alginate microspheres and finally reduce fe iii oxides liang et al 2021 notably desulfitobacterium could use the poorly crystalline fe iii oxide as the electron acceptor shelobolina et al 2003 therefore the probable mechanism in the bc cell ca zvi ca system was the promotion of desulfitobacterium growth increased from 0 08 to 18 62 by an iron ion rich environment fig 6d and the faster co metabolism removal of 2 4 6 tcp breitenstein et al 2007 electron intermediates produced from desulfitobacterium successfully reduced and transformed the fe iii iron oxides fig 4 however in the bc cell ca system delftia and pseudomonas were presumed to be the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal see section 3 4 1 based on the xps xrd lc ms and the high throughput sequencing results fig 3 6 the underlying mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp removal and the transformation paths of iron oxides in the zvi ca bc cell ca and bc cell ca zvi ca systems are shown in fig 7 3 6 optimizing the width of bio prbs through the calibrated multi process reaction model the 2 4 6 tcp reaction parameters table 1 for different types of bio prbs were obtained through the column experiment results in section 3 2 fig 2 the calibrated model was used to design the optimal width of bio prbs and predict the evolution of pollution plumes in different types of bio prbs fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves of 2 4 6 tcp in observation points of different widths of bio prbs by the model prediction fig 8a showed that the optimal width of prbs with zvi ca amendment was 160 cm contain 35 2 cm width of zvi ca and 124 8 cm width of quartz sand which can achieve at least 90 of 2 4 6 tcp removal however that of bio prbs with the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 amendment was only 120 cm contain 13 2 cm width of zvi ca 13 2 cm width of bc cell ca and 93 6 cm width of quartz sand fig 8a the optimal width and cost were significantly less than that of prbs with the zvi ca amendment the above results showed that the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 type of bio prbs had excellent performance for the remediation of 2 4 6 tcp contaminated groundwater furthermore a combination of chemical and biological augmentation technology could significantly reduce the width of bio prbs and save costs 3 7 the field test performance of bio prbs for remediation of pesticide factory groundwater fig 9 showed that the field scale zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 reaction columns had excellent performance for in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds and btex in a pesticide factory site the initial average concentrations of two predominant pollutants chlorobenzene and methylbenzene reach 7322 µg l 1 and 8928 µg l 1 respectively figs 9a b the removal percentage of chlorinated organic compounds and btex 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene 2 chlorotoluene bromobenzene m p xylene ethylbenzene benzene methylbenzene chlorobenzene ranged from 61 to 100 the average removal percentage reached 71 fig 9c 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 158 µg l 1 1 2 dichlorobenzene 106 µg l 1 1 4 dichlorobenzene 155 µg l 1 were completely removed after remediation two high concentration pollutants chlorobenzene 7322 µg l 1 and methylbenzene 8928 µg l 1 decreased to 2120 and 2430 µg l 1 respectively the removal percentage reached 71 and 73 respectively fig 9c moreover the pentachlorophenol 162 µg l 1 was detected on 4th august 2021 after the reaction columns were installed on 5th august 2021 the pentachlorophenol has also not been detected in the following monitoring the field test results demonstrated that the pollutants were significantly eliminated by field scale zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 reaction columns it is a promising technology for the efficient remediation of actual groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds and btex 4 conclusions taken together the study explored the effect of chemical biological augmentation on the performance of bio prbs for 2 4 6 tcp removal the zvi ca and bc cell ca gel beads were developed to construct different types of bio prbs the underlying mechanism and multi process reaction model of 2 4 6 tcp in bio prbs was investigated

prbs compared to that in the zvi ca 0 004 h 1 system the reaction rate 0 011 h 1 of 2 4 6 tcp increased by 175 in the combined chemical biological batch system moreover chemical biological augmentation significantly improved the retardation effect of bio prbs for 2 4 6 tcp it came from that chemical biological augmentation significantly decreased the dispersivity a 0 53 to 0 20 cm and increased the distribution coefficient k d 2 20 to 19 00 cm3 mg 1 the reaction rate λ 2 40 to 3 60 day 1 and the fraction 30 to 80 of first order kinetic sorption of 2 4 6 tcp in the lab scale one

actually contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar groundwater remediation immobilized microorganism permeable reactive barriers 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 1 introduction according to statistics more than 50 of urban groundwater has seriously deteriorated in china li et al 2021 in the urban and rural areas chlorophenol organic compound 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp is widely used in herbicides disinfectants pesticides papermaking and plastic industries fricker et al 2014 jarvinen et al 1994 it has been detected in various environmental media such as excess sludge groundwater surface water and wastewater song et al 2019 biological concerns arising from 2 4 6 tcp include genetic toxicity liver toxicity immunotoxicity neurotoxicity cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity song et al 2019 wang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 it is highly toxic when absorbed by human skin and can cause obesity high cholesterol and high blood pressure in children and adolescents yang et al 2021 owing to its high toxicity wide range of pollution and bioaccumulation properties 2 4 6 tcp is listed as a priority pollutant by the european economic community eec and u s environmental protection agency usepa al abduly et al 2021 many technologies have been utilized to remove 2 4 6 tcp from wastewater groundwater and soil including adsorption saigl 2020 tzou et al 2008 biodegradation marsolek et al 2007 chemical reduction liu et al 2019 and advanced oxidation processes aops karimipour et al 2021 xiang et al 2021 owing to the high reactivity low cost and non toxicity of zero valent iron zvi soil and groundwater remediation has widely adopted the zvi technology for constructing in situ permeable reactive barriers prbs guo et al 2021 chlorinated aromatic compounds 2 4 6 tcp etc have been reported to be effectively reduced in the presence of zvi and the contaminates were converted into small molecular organic substances which greatly reduces their toxicities kim and carraway 2000 liu et al 2019 however solid iron corrosion products e g fe3o4 and fe2o3 can be generated in the reaction process which are known to in situ coat the surface of aggregates these lead to zvi powder can easily undergo agglomeration and passivation tao et al 2022 wang et al 2020c in particular in the engineering application of prbs zvi can easily be passivated reactivity loss after a period of application tao et al 2022 some carrier materials have been used to support zvi powder and improve its performance including biochar liu et al 2019 graphene oxide wang et al 2022 zeolite eljamal et al 2022 magnesium hydroxide shell falyouna et al 2022b and titanium nanowires falyouna et al 2022a etc the use of iron supported materials can effectively prevent zvi agglomeration and passivation maamoun et al 2019 however solid precipitates such as iron oxide and sulfates could be generated and clogging the prbs the blockage and compaction of powdered and nano zvi which are dispersed on supports in prbs has still not been solved entirely compared with zvi remediation technology technology based on microorganisms was also widely adopted for the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater the biodegradation and mineralization of 2 4 6 tcp at a lower cost could be achieved in anaerobic environments lin et al 2019 song et al revealed that the acclimated microorganisms have a strong ability to dechlorinate and degrade 2 4 6 tcp and phenol ring openings song et al 2019 however microorganisms also have the problem of biomass loss and inactivation in the application of the site zhang et al 2021 the biodegradation efficiency largely depends on the survival rate of microorganisms in the actual environment the immobilization carriers were developed to immobilize and protect microorganisms and subsequently enhance the biodegradation rate valdivia rivera et al 2021 in the construction of in situ microorganism augmented permeable reactive barriers bio prbs zeolite polyurethane foam natural loofah sponge ols and other carriers were used to immobilize the microorganisms wang et al 2017 however the immobilization and remediation performance of bio prbs was still affected by other factors especially such as the biological clogging of stuffing wang and wu 2019 furthermore before prbs installation the prbs dismantling or materials replacement should be considered as part of the design phillips 2009 whereas in the actual field remediation the maintenance and replacement of reaction materials were not convenient in conventional prbs because the single use wall barriers and reaction wells were always constructed bekele et al 2019 li et al 2021 to resolve the aforementioned problems calcium alginate ca embedded zvi zvi ca gel beads and ca embedded biochar bc immobilized microorganism bc cell ca gel beads were developed zvi ca gel beads avoid the appearance of powdered zvi hardening in bio prbs moreover bc cell ca gel beads provide large porosity between beads and beads and slow release microorganism cells then avoid biological clogging of stuffing in bio prbs the field scale modularization vertical reaction device which can conveniently replace material also was designed in this study their performances were tested by constructing the lab scale and field scale bc immobilized microorganism augmented zvi permeable reactive barriers bio prbs as a coating agent ca has the advantages of non toxicity harmlessness simple production low price biodegradability and high mechanical strength lemic et al 2021 park et al 2021 the surface of ca is porous and has abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amino groups which can uniformly load zvi and microorganisms on biochar and significantly improve its mechanical stability direct contact between organic pollutants and microorganisms also produces toxicity especially for chlorophenol patel et al 2022 microorganisms in ca gel beads can effectively avoid direct contact with pollutants additionally as the microorganism carrier biochar can not only provide attachment sites for microorganisms but also enhance the abundance of microorganisms to form an effective co metabolism reduction dechlorination system liu et al 2021 in the in situ remediation process of contaminated soil and groundwater previous other types of bio prbs systems had shown the advantages of low maintenance costs and no energy consumption amoako nimako et al 2021 in the study the metabolic mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp and

which was significantly greater than those in the zvi ca 47 and bc cell ca 46 systems the removal performance of the zvi ca bc cell ca system increased by 79 additionally the removal of 2 4 6 tcp fitted well with the first order kinetic model wang et al 2020b compared with those in the zvi ca 0 004 h 1 and bc cell ca 0 006 h 1 systems the first order reaction rate k 0 011 h 1 of 2 4 6 tcp in the combined zvi ca bc cell ca system increased by 175 and 83 respectively the chemical biological augmentation was shown to effectively improve the performance of the combined system by achieving greater removal efficiency and reaction rate k the associated reaction mechanism was discussed in section 3 5 3 2 the 2 4 6 tcp removal performance of different types of bio prbs fig 2a showed that 82 of 2 4 6 tcp breaks through the bc cell ca bio prbs which was less than those of the zvi ca prbs 88 system and control 96 fig 2b showed that 2 4 6 tcp attenuation of the effluent in 20 85 pvs stage in zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs was greater than that in bc cell ca zvi ca 10 bc cell ca 90 and zvi ca 90 bc cell ca 10 bio prbs furthermore a significant difference was shown from the sorption and desorption curves in different types of bio prbs in 0 20 pvs and 85 100 pvs stages the results demonstrated that the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs had the best sorption and desorption retardation effects and removal efficiency for 2 4 6 tcp the change in parameters table 1 of the reaction model further revealed that the underlying mechanisms were as follows decrease in the dispersivity a 0 53 to 0 20 cm and significant increases in the instantaneous equilibrium sorption distribution coefficient k d 2 2 to 19 00 cm3 mg 1 and reaction rate λ 2 4 to 3 6 day 1 in the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs additionally the first order kinetic sorption coefficient α 0 92 to 0 36 day 1 decreased however the fraction β of instantaneous equilibrium sorption decreased 70 to 20 implying that the fraction of first order kinetic sorption increased 30 to 80 table 1 furthermore the multi source data from cl and k breakthrough behavior was used to adjust and calibrate the parameters of the reaction model tables 1 and 2 the permeability coefficient ks table s3 and dispersivity a were verified based on the breakthrough behaviours of 2 4 6 tcp fig 2a b cl and k fig 2c d the results showed that the instantaneous equilibrium sorption distribution coefficient k d 0 001 to 1 21 cm3 mg 1 reaction rate λ 0 to 0 14 day 1 and first order kinetic sorption coefficient α 0 005 to 0 16 day 1 significantly increased in bio prbs using zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 fig 2c showed that 58 of cl and k broke through the bio prbs bc cell ca which was significantly lesser than those in zvi ca bio prbs 80 and control 99 the results revealed that the bc cell ca bio prbs had much better performance for preventing cl and k transport compared to the other types of bio prbs fig 2d showed that the conductivity cl and k attenuation of the effluent in 4 12 pvs stage had no significant difference in the bc cell ca zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 zvi ca 10 bc cell ca 90 and zvi ca 90 bc cell ca 10 bio prbs however a significant difference was observed from the sorption and desorption curves of cl and k in zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs in 0 4 pvs and 12 20 pvs stages the above results revealed that the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs showed the best sorption and desorption retardation effects for cl and k respectively fig 2d considered together and compared to other five types of bio prbs zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 bio prbs showed the best sorption and desorption retardation effects and removal efficiency for the remediation of cl k type of groundwater contaminated with 2 4 6 tcp 3 3 the change of secondary minerals in the interface of zvi ca in the different systems compared to the random structure of bare zvi powder fig s2 a d the results of the sem showed that fresh zvi ca had a well developed lamellar structure fig 3a 3c sem element mapping showed the formation of iron oxides fig 3d 3 g the distribution of the fe was uniform fig 3 g and o was mainly distributed in the peak and slope of the lamellar structure fig 3f additionally the results of sem showed that secondary minerals appeared needle and club shaped after the reaction fig 3h this was confirmed by the morphology feature of structural fe ⅲ goethite α feooh and the results of xrd fig 4 g additionally the results of sem fig 3i showed that the top of the lamellar structure was severely corroded fig 4a f shows the xps spectra of zvi ca before and after the reaction in the different systems the peak of fe 2p3 2 at 710 1 ev was attributed to fe2 the peak of fe 2p3 2 at 711 6 ev and fe 2p1 2 at 724 2 ev was attributed to fe3 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 the results demonstrated the existence of fe2 25 84 and fe3 74 16 oxides in the interface of zvi ca before the reaction fig 4a additionally iron oxide fe o and iron hydroxide fe oh were detected in the range of o 1 s fig 4b the two peaks located at 529 6 and 531 2 ev were attributed to the iron oxide fe o 31 34 and iron hydroxide fe oh 68 66 species kim et al 2011 after the reaction only fe3 2p3 2 and fe3 2p1 2 of iron oxide showed peaks 711 6 and 724 2 ev rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 which demonstrated that only fe3 oxides existed in the interface of zvi ca in the zvi ca and zvi ca bc cell ca systems after the reaction figs 4c and 4e the three peaks located at 530 1 531 4 and 532 9 ev were attributed to iron oxide fe o 18 59 iron hydroxide fe oh 51 93 and c o 29 48 species of zvi ca in the zvi ca system fig 4d kim et al 2011 the two peaks located at 531 2 and 533 0 ev were assigned iron hydroxide fe oh 69 86 and c o 30 14 species of zvi ca from the zvi ca bc cell ca system fig 4f c o is presumably derived comes from the intermediate dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone dcq of 2 4 6 tcp which was confirmed by lc ms fig 5b the xrd results fig 4 g confirmed that the iron oxides in the surface of zvi ca gel beads mainly comprised goethite α feooh jcpds 26 792 and fe3o4 jcpds 2 1035 before the reaction this was consistent with the fe o 31 34 and fe o h 68 66 results of xps fig 4a this was because zvi ca gel beads were partially oxidized to α feooh and fe3o4 during their preparation and storage subsequently fe2 was oxidated to fe3 during the removal of 2 4 6 tcp figs 4c and 4e fe3o4 was removed and fe2o3 was generated figs 4 g s2 and 4 g s3 the main secondary minerals in the surface of the zvi ca system were α feooh jcpds 26 792 and fe2o3 jcpds 3 812 figs 4 g s2 results of xps confirmed that the contents of fe o and fe oh changed to 18 59 and 51 93 respectively fig 4d however the main secondary mineral was α feooh 69 86 jcpds 26 792 in the zvi ca bc cell ca system figs 4f and 4i under the synergistic effect of the zvi ca and bc cell ca systems the fe2 and secondary iron oxide minerals are more inclined to form goethite α feooh 3 4 the diversity and abundance of bacteria and archaea and the reaction mechanism 3 4 1 archaeal and bacterial communities fig 6a shows the archaeal composition at the phylum level the abundance of halobacterota in s1 gel beads 93 44 of the bc cell ca system and s2 gel beads 90 06 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system was significantly greater than that of the control 87 02 we believed that some dehalogenation archaea e g methanosarcina and methanospirillum belonged to the phylum halobacterota holliger et al 1990 wang and wu 2017 moreover crenarchaeota 59 37 and thermoplasmatota 7 10 in the s4 solution of the zvi ca bc cell ca system were significantly greater than those 10 42 0 00 in the s3 solution of the zvi ca system fig 6c shows the genus level archaeal composition the abundance of methanosaeta in s1 gel beads 83 27 of the bc cell ca system and s2 gel beads 82 63 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system was significantly greater than that of the control 61 88 the methanosaeta methanolinea methanosarcina methanobacterium and methanospirillum were found in gel beads methanosarcina could dechlorinate the chloroethane to ethane holliger et al 1990 methanobacterium was the cometabolism archaea for the dechlorination of 1 1 1 trichloroethane to 1 1 dichloroethane egli et al 1987 the abundance of methanospirillum increased by 105 under the 1 1 1 trichloroethane condition wang and wu 2017 the above five strains were presumed to be the dominant cometabolism functional archaea for the dechlorination of 2 4 6 tcp moreover norank f nitrososphaeraceae 39 84 and nitrosarchaeum 5 38 in the s4 solution of the zvi ca bc cell ca system were significantly greater than those 0 00 and 1 02 respectively in the s3 solution of the zvi ca system candidatus nitrocosmicus belonging to the nitrososphaera sister cluster was a novel ammonia oxidizing archaea species wang et al 2019 figs 6b shows bacterial compositions at the phylum level the abundance of firmicutes in s2 gel beads 28 49 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system was significantly greater than those in s1 gel beads 18 98 of the bc cell ca system and control 1 04 moreover firmicutes in the s4 solution 5 26 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system also was greater than that 4 01 in the s3 solution of the zvi ca system the abundances of proteobacteria in the s3 and s4 solutions 95 97 and 94 72 were greater than those 80 96 and 71 20 in the s1 and s2 gel beads the dehalogenation bacteria e g delftia desulfitobacterium and pseudomonas belonged to the phylum proteobacteria zhang et al 2018 fig 6d showed that the dominant bacteria at the genus level in the zvi ca bc cell ca system were delftia and desulfitobacterium the abundances of delftia in the s3 and s4 solutions 94 27 and 94 07 were both greater than those in the control s1 and s2 gel beads 73 36 76 16 and 69 43 respectively the abundances of desulfitobacterium in the s2 gel beads 18 62 and s4 solution 1 36 of the zvi ca bc cell ca system were both greater than those of the s1 gel beads 0 03 and s3 solution 0 00 in the zvi ca system and control 0 08 however the abundances of pseudomonas in the s1 gel beads 1 26 and s3 solution 0 25 of the zvi ca system were both greater than those of the s2 gel beads 0 01 and s4 solution 0 00 in the zvi ca bc cell ca system at the phylum level the dominant bacteria proteobacteria were the dominant population involved in dechlorination song et al 2019 delftia was the dominant bacteria belonging to proteobacteria many species of delftia lived in anoxic aerobic environments and could dehalogenate and degrade halogenated aromatic compounds the genus delftia could also dechlorinate and degrade 2 4 6 tcp and 2 4 dcp zhang et al 2019 according to reports co metabolism bacteria desulfitobacterium could induce ortho dehalogenation of 2 4 6 tcp and had a high capacity for chlorophenol dehalogenation breitenstein et al 2007 pseudomonas could tolerate up to 600 mg l 1 of 2 4 dcp through the meta pathway degradation of 2 4 dcp olaniran et al 2017 therefore desulfitobacterium was presumably the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal in the zvi ca bc cell ca system conversely in the bc cell ca system delftia and pseudomonas were presumed to be the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal 3 4 2 the richness and diversity of archaea and bacteria after 96 h of the reaction the richness differences of archaea in gel beads were not significant among the control chao1 12 000 s1 chao1 12 000 and s2 chao1 11 000 table 3 however the archaeal richness in the s4 solution chao1 26 857 of the bc cell ca zvi ca system was significantly greater than those in the s3 solutions chao1 13 000 of the zvi ca system and control chao1 12 000 moreover the archaeal diversity of the s4 solution shannon 1 604 simpson 0 256 was significantly greater than those of the s3 solution shannon 0 788 simpson 0 684 and control shannon 1 399 simpson 0 410 the archaeal diversity in gel beads decreased therefore the results demonstrated that the combination of bc cell ca and zvi ca was more beneficial for improving the diversity and richness of archaea in the reaction solution rather than in gel beads table 3 also presented that the diversity differences of bacteria in gel beads were not significant among the control shannon 1 087 simpson 0 560 s1 shannon 1 035 simpson 0 592 and s2 shannon 1 055 simpson 0 521 however the bacterial richness in s2 gel beads chao1 105 000 of the bc cell ca zvi ca system was significantly greater than that in the s3 gel beads chao1 75 857 of the zvi ca system moreover the bacterial diversity of the s4 solution shannon 0 327 simpson 0 886 was slightly greater than that of the s3 solution shannon 0 286 simpson 0 890 the bacterial richness in the reaction solution decreased therefore the results demonstrated that the combination of bc cell ca and zvi ca was more beneficial for improving the bacterial richness in gel beads and bacterial diversity in the reaction solution considered together the archaeal richness and bacterial diversity in gel beads were not affected compared to the bc cell ca system the bc cell ca zvi ca system had more advantages in improving the diversity and richness of archaea in the reaction solution bacterial richness in gel beads and bacterial diversity in the reaction solution 3 5 reaction mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp and transformation path of iron oxides in different systems fig 5a shows the proposed reaction pathways of 2 4 6 tcp in the zvi ca system the pathways a and b were based on the results of lc ms and previous reports christoforidis et al 2011 dorathi and kandasamy 2012 souza et al 2019 dorathi and kandasamy 2012 reported that dcp cp and phenol were the 2 4 6 tcp dechlorination products under zvi reduction dorathi and kandasamy 2012 moreover we demonstrated that the 2 6 dichlorophenol 2 6 dcp 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 4 monochlorphenol 4 mcp and 2 monochlorphenol 2 mcp were produced through pathway a under zvi conditions souza et al 2019 in our study we detected phenol which was an indicator of such a degradation mechanism additionally the intermediate 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq was detected this was consistent with the report from christoforidis 2011 stating that dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone dcq and 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq were produced through pathway b through the deprotonation and elimination of hcl christoforidis et al 2011 the proposed 2 4 6 tcp reaction pathways in the bc cell ca system is shown in fig 5b christoforidis et al 2019 reported that phenol was the final microbial dichlorination product through pathway a christoforidis et al 2011 except for the dechlorination reaction pathway a the results of lc ms indicated the presence of intermediates dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone dcq 2 6 dichloro p benzosemiquinone radical dcsq and chlorinated dimers 2 6 dichloro 4 3 5 dichloro 4 oxocyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 yl oxy cyclohexa 2 5 dien 1 one c12h6cl4o3 the chlorinated dimers were obtained from coupling reactions between dcq through pathway c christoforidis et al 2011 the proposed 2 4 6 tcp reaction pathway in the zvi ca bc cell ca system is shown in fig 5c the lc ms result showed that dcq dcsq and hdcq were detected the 2 hydroxyl dichloro 2 6 benzoquinone hdcq was a hydroxo derivative of dcq produced through pathway d christoforidis et al 2011 under the synergistic effect of the zvi ca and bc cell ca systems the chlorinated dimers have not been detected this implies that the zvi ca bc cell ca could inhibit the coupling reactions between dcq based on the evidence from the change of microbial diversity and previous research in section 3 4 1 the functional bacteria playing a key role in 2 4 6 tcp removal was confirmed to be sulfate reducing bacteria delftia desulfitobacterium and pseudomonas christoforidis et al 2011 olaniran et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 furthermore desulfitobacterium is known to be a very versatile microorganism capable of using a large range of electron acceptors such as natural or man made halogenated organic compounds humic acids metal sulfites and nitrate villemur et al 2006 the research revealed that the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfovibrio ferrophilus produced electron intermediates which could pass through the sodium alginate microspheres and finally reduce fe iii oxides liang et al 2021 notably desulfitobacterium could use the poorly crystalline fe iii oxide as the electron acceptor shelobolina et al 2003 therefore the probable mechanism in the bc cell ca zvi ca system was the promotion of desulfitobacterium growth increased from 0 08 to 18 62 by an iron ion rich environment fig 6d and the faster co metabolism removal of 2 4 6 tcp breitenstein et al 2007 electron intermediates produced from desulfitobacterium successfully reduced and transformed the fe iii iron oxides fig 4 however in the bc cell ca system delftia and pseudomonas were presumed to be the functional bacteria for 2 4 6 tcp removal see section 3 4 1 based on the xps xrd lc ms and the high throughput sequencing results fig 3 6 the underlying mechanism of 2 4 6 tcp removal and the transformation paths of iron oxides in the zvi ca bc cell ca and bc cell ca zvi ca systems are shown in fig 7 3 6 optimizing the width of bio prbs through the calibrated multi process reaction model the 2 4 6 tcp reaction parameters table 1 for different types of bio prbs were obtained through the column experiment results in section 3 2 fig 2 the calibrated model was used to design the optimal width of bio prbs and predict the evolution of pollution plumes in different types of bio prbs fig 8 shows the breakthrough curves of 2 4 6 tcp in observation points of different widths of bio prbs by the model prediction fig 8a showed that the optimal width of prbs with zvi ca amendment was 160 cm contain 35 2 cm width of zvi ca and 124 8 cm width of quartz sand which can achieve at least 90 of 2 4 6 tcp removal however that of bio prbs with the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 amendment was only 120 cm contain 13 2 cm width of zvi ca 13 2 cm width of bc cell ca and 93 6 cm width of quartz sand fig 8a the optimal width and cost were significantly less than that of prbs with the zvi ca amendment the above results showed that the zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 type of bio prbs had excellent performance for the remediation of 2 4 6 tcp contaminated groundwater furthermore a combination of chemical and biological augmentation technology could significantly reduce the width of bio prbs and save costs 3 7 the field test performance of bio prbs for remediation of pesticide factory groundwater fig 9 showed that the field scale zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 reaction columns had excellent performance for in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds and btex in a pesticide factory site the initial average concentrations of two predominant pollutants chlorobenzene and methylbenzene reach 7322 µg l 1 and 8928 µg l 1 respectively figs 9a b the removal percentage of chlorinated organic compounds and btex 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 4 dichlorobenzene 2 chlorotoluene bromobenzene m p xylene ethylbenzene benzene methylbenzene chlorobenzene ranged from 61 to 100 the average removal percentage reached 71 fig 9c 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 158 µg l 1 1 2 dichlorobenzene 106 µg l 1 1 4 dichlorobenzene 155 µg l 1 were completely removed after remediation two high concentration pollutants chlorobenzene 7322 µg l 1 and methylbenzene 8928 µg l 1 decreased to 2120 and 2430 µg l 1 respectively the removal percentage reached 71 and 73 respectively fig 9c moreover the pentachlorophenol 162 µg l 1 was detected on 4th august 2021 after the reaction columns were installed on 5th august 2021 the pentachlorophenol has also not been detected in the following monitoring the field test results demonstrated that the pollutants were significantly eliminated by field scale zvi ca 50 bc cell ca 50 reaction columns it is a promising technology for the efficient remediation of actual groundwater contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds and btex 4 conclusions taken together the study explored the effect of chemical biological augmentation on the performance of bio prbs for 2 4 6 tcp removal the zvi ca and bc cell ca gel beads were developed to construct different types of bio prbs the underlying mechanism and multi process reaction model of 2 4 6 tcp in bio prbs was investigated the reaction rate of 2 4 6 tcp increased by 175 in the combined chemical biological system two site sorption coupling chemical biological multi process reaction model can be used for revealing 2 4 6 tcp transport behavior and optimizing bio prbs chemical biological augmentation significantly improved the retardation effect of bio prbs for 2 4 6 tcp moreover versatile functional bacteria desulfitobacterium was crucial in the transformation of fe iii iron oxides the diversity and richness of archaea in the reaction solution were improved by zvi ca gel beads addition furthermore field test results demonstrated it is a promising technology to construct vertical reaction columns or horizontal bio prbs for the efficient remediation of actually contaminated groundwater declaration of

16037,due to the sheer number of contaminated sites bioavailability based measurement and modeling of toxicity is used to triage response despite advances both remain relatively cumbersome cadmium cd and lead pb are two of the most toxic and globally prevalent pollutants disproportionately impacting disadvantaged communities here we demonstrate the use of high throughput lights on bioreporter technology to measure both speciation and toxicity the organism s response is fit for purpose to parameterize the biotic ligand model used in risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity and setting environmental water quality criteria toxicity endpoints for analogous cd and pb models reported in literature average 71st and 44th rank percentile sensitivity of genus mean acute values for acute toxicity i e insensitive in comparison to the bioreporter the unique dual mode measurement ability of which can predict toxicity endpoints from below the 5th percentile up to the 50th rank percentile

image graphical abstract keywords microbial biosensor environmental biotechnology environmental decision support metal ligand complexation biogeochemistry heavy metal and toxic metal bioluminescence inhibition response 1 introduction chemical speciation bioavailability and toxicity are key issues in environmental risk assessment toxic effect is a function of bioavailability rather than total concentration wells et al 2004 harms et al 2006 as acknowledged for instance by the us environmental protection agency s us epa s framework for metals risk assessment which states that for hazardous metals risk assessors should explicitly incorporate factors that influence the bioavailability of a metal fairbrother et al 2007 also see review of the metals action plan to identify key scientific issues important for assessing the risks of toxic metal contamination us epa 2002 while the us epa was early to recognize these inter relationships the perspective is now woven into practice in many counties e g see ec 2013 because bioavailability is a function of metal chemical speciation hereafter speciation nor and cheng 1986 tessier and turner 1995 sander et al 2011 khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 and 2020a many environmental factors that influence speciation e g ph organic matter complexation with heavy metals also influence metal bioavailability most environmental studies focus on either speciation bioavailability e g bagherifam et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 yan et al 2020 or toxicity based on bioavailability e g an et al 2012 2015 gao et al 2021 i e one or the other usually not both to our knowledge there is a paucity of work demonstrating a simple and efficacious approach to span the continuum of speciation to toxicity measurement as a holistic mechanism to understand biological effects to assist with setting defensible water quality criteria wqc the biotic ligand model blm was developed us epa 2003 us epa 2016a as a mechanistic model having evolved from multiple linear regression models hodge and armstrong 1993 and theory from the gill surface interaction model and the free ion activity model pagenkopf 1983 morel 1983 the mechanistic aspects of the blm explicitly links speciation to toxicity albeit for most risk assessment work the blm is run in toxicity mode since available biological endpoints consist of a single metric such as ec50 effective concentration causing 50 toxic effect in the framework of the blm a biotic ligand bl is a specific receptor within an organism for which complexation by a metal m can lead to toxic effects hence the blm includes expressions to describe metal complexation with bls us epa 2007 nontoxic metal cation bl complexation is also specified in the model and the competition of major cations in environmental samples that is cations of ca mg k na for binding with bl reduces toxic m bl complexation and therefore toxic effects parameters describing the reactions of bl with m and major cations are therefore required for blm models run in speciation mode for blm toxicity mode there needs to be further parameterization for calculation of a toxicity endpoint such as ec50 e g di toro et al 2001 crémazy et al 2016 the blm model is mechanistic in nature and model inputs are simple and inexpensive to obtain blm results have been demonstrated to be an accurate predictor of environmental risk for several toxic heavy metals and to be fit for purpose tool for decisions regarding wqc niyogi and wood 2004 though developed in the us the blm has also been adopted as the basis of some environmental quality standards eqs in europe to enable site specific eqs values to be derived ec 2010 while copper cu and nickel ni blms have been thoroughly studied and are used in the united states in europe and increasingly in other places ec 2010 us epa 2016a as an et al 2012 have pointed out fewer bl based models are available for cadmium cd and lead pb considering the toxicity of cd and pb increasing the focus on these environmental contaminants within the blm framework is timely cd and pb are considered to be two of the most hazardous substances globally tellez plaza et al 2013 pure earth green cross 2015 alengebawy et al 2021 and also contribute to alarming environmental issues in china and india which together account for about 37 of the entire global population tong et al 2000 cheng 2003 kan 2009 kumar et al 2019 hu et al 2020 cd ranks seventh on one list referred to as the top 20 hazardous substance cercla 2005 additionally cadmium and cadmium compounds i e anything that contains cd is on the two most well known lists of carcinogens as classified by the international agency for research on cancer and the national toxicology program ntp of the united states the latter of which only contains 69 line items as compared to the tens of thousands of agents that are probable or possible carcinogens mcguire 2016 ntp 2016 oldani et al 2020 cd is notably affected by ph in soils thus its bioavailability is increased by anthropogenic increases in acid rain and this contributes to cd s being accumulated in important foodstuffs such as rice liu et al 2007 song et al 2015 due to the carcinogenicity of cd and its increasing presence in food items cd contamination represents a global threat to both food security and human health khan et al 2021 with regard to pb its increasing environmental prevalence might arguably be described as an impending crisis inasmuch as there is no safe level of pb exposure grandjean 2010 and pb is differentially neurotoxic to children compromising cognitive development grandjean and landrigan 2014 the global annual costs of childhood pb exposure from cognitive defects alone are estimated to be 1 15 trillion us dollars most of which is borne by low and middle income countries grandjean and bellange 2017 due to activities such as coal burning that release pb and cd and the continued increasing global production of pb mudd 2013 marx et al 2016 for use in various applications including increasing use in sustainable solar photovoltaic energy systems gottesfeld and cherry 2011 a continued stark increase in environmental pb levels is virtually assured the increasing prevalence and highly toxic nature of cd and pb ensures that exposure to these contaminants is an intergenerational issue predicating our choice to study cd and pb in this work many different methods have been and are being developed florence 1986 batley et al 2004 us epa 2007a fairbrother et al 2007 to quantify bioavailability for metals among which whole cell bioreporters have become of increasing interest with respect to pollutants in environmental matrices such as water soil sediments and other geomaterials belkin 2003 al anizi et al 2014 wells 2012 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 bioreporters are living microbial cells that have been genetically engineered to produce a measurable signal typically optical measured as bioluminescence fluorescence or absorbance in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their environment van der meer and belkin 2010 whole cell bioreporters have been described as falling into two mechanistic response categories lights off and lights on belkin 2003 xu et al 2014 lights off bioreporters are used for toxicity measurements as they emit a continuous signal in the absence of toxin for example vibrio fischeri in the well known microtox assay farré and barceló 2003 and only after dosing reaches toxic levels signal is inhibited belkin 2003 an et al 2012 abbas et al 2018 as diminishing signal accompanies toxicity the process is referred to as lights off and the effect is non specific any toxin could cause signal diminution i e there is no specific bioengineering design involved in response and any substance bioavailable in quantities sufficient to provoke a toxic response is not differentiable from another such substance zhang et al 2022 1 1 this is common of many other toxicity tests lights off bioreporters fish springtails daphnia etc are all non specific and additional chemical analysis would be necessary if measuring mixed or unknown toxicants in natural waters to understand the contribution from a specific toxin lights on bioreporters are notably used in speciation measurements as they have the capacity to emit a dose dependent bioluminescence in response to bioavailable chemicals that induce a responsive promoter that was genetically introduced belkin 2003 magrisso et al 2008 senevirathna et al 2009 shemer et al 2015 i e signal increases lights on typically linearly with concentration of the target analyte to which the bioreporter was designed to respond lights on bioreporters are notably selective or sometimes even specific to a single analyte for example we use a lights on bioreporter in this work for which resistance to cd2 and pb2 toxicity is mediated at least in part by the presence of the znta gene riether et al 2001 this gene endows the bioreporter with the capacity to emit a positive nontoxic dose dependent bioluminescence response to bioavailable cd2 and pb2 toxic free ions kessler et al 2012 within environmentally relevant cd and pb concentration ranges in theory a lights on bioreporter can also be used in toxicity measurement as once toxicity is reached the organism cannot function as a lights on bioreporter because the reporting signal is diminished as with other toxicity measurements fish springtails daphnia microtox etc irrespective of what the mechanism of toxicity is while lights on bioreporters have demonstrated success for speciation measurements of metal free ion to our knowledge they have not been used to quantify toxic effects here we posit that it is possible to achieve an approach to the determination of bioavailability that spans the continuum from speciation to toxicity and in a manner that permits the unified validation of both within a blm modeling framework at the outset of this work we hypothesized that some forms of bioreporter technology have been tailored at an engineering level to possess the precise characteristics to achieve such a goal with the added advantage of being high throughput to test our suppositions we chose a lights on bioreporter that emits bioluminescence in response to cd and pb and we observed concordance between measurement and prediction of free metal species in the presence of different solution components that affect bioavailability next we conducted experiments to parameterize bioreporter toxicity models for cd and pb and we subsequently benchmarked bioreporter predicted toxicity to that of a standard method in common use we then compare toxicity model results for the bioreporter to other organisms for which literature exists organisms that are commonly the subject of toxicity studies but are not generally recognized as fit for rendering results on speciation we find that the bioreporter is able to respond to a continuum of speciation up to its own toxicity endpoint and is thus able to report endpoints for cd and pb levels in a range spanning that of the most sensitive freshwater organisms up to approximately the 50th percentile sensitivity such that the approach we developed here is fit for purpose to parameterize the blm used in setting environmental wqc and risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity with the increasing numbers of bioreporters to measure different bioavailable pollutants ekrami et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 and the inevitability of toxic response for any toxin at high enough dosage exposure the approach that we demonstrate is reasonably expected to be extensible 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreporter growth media speciation and toxicity assays escherichia coli phl268 strain znta hereafter znta in contrast to the gene znta was used as the lights on bioreporter for this study kessler et al 2012 for both speciation and toxicity measurement the strain was stored at 4 c on lysogeny broth lb agar bertani 2004 amended with 40 μg ml 1 ampicillin overnight cultures were grown at 30 c with shaking at 90 rpm for 16 h the overnight culture was diluted 100 fold in fresh lb without ampicillin and re grown at 26 c shaking at 200 rpm at an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 0 10 cells were harvested by centrifugation 13 200 g the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in optimized minimal medium mm to an od600 of 0 20 the mm contained 6 06 g of 3 n morpholino propane sulfonic acid mops 2 g of sodium gluconate 0 23 g β glycero phosphate 4 68 g of nacl 1 07 g of nh4cl 0 43 g of na2so4 0 2 g of mgcl2 6h2o and 0 03 g of cacl2 2h2o dissolved in 1000 ml of distilled water and adjusted to ph 7 0 0 1 mergeay et al 1985 magrisso et al 2009 all chemicals were reagent grade or better and purchased from alfa aesar co ltd shanghai china this strain has the demonstrated ability to respond to cd pb toxic metal species i e free ion as a c d 2 or a p b 2 activity of cd2 or pb2 respectively quantified using a bioavailability calibration curve e g riether et al 2001 magrisso et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a for the bioavailability speciation assay zhang et al 2017 and references therein 50 µl of bioreporter cell suspension od600 0 2 was added to a 96 well white microtiter plate nunc denmark followed by adding 50 µl of cd or pb standard prepared per zhang et al 2017 or sample all cd and pb standards were analyzed by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion300 perkinelmer usa see supplementary material sm for details next the microplate was incubated at 26 c with a rotation speed of 180 rpm and bioluminescence was measured every 10 min for 3 h using a luminometer varioskan lux thermo fisher scientific usa while we use a 96 well microplate plates with larger numbers of wells could equally well be used all of which constitute high throughput methodology particularly as compared to most assays for both bioavailability and toxicity bioluminescence response was calculated as maximum response ratio mrr mrr rlu c m max rlu0 max where rlu c m max is the maximum response in relative luminescence units for metal concentration c m and rlu0 max is the maximum response of the blank per zhang et al 2017 the limit of detection lod was calculated as signal greater than three times the standard deviation of the blank and the loq as three times the lod shrivastava 2011 a common feature of lights on bioreporters that enables them to be useful in work with contaminated samples is that they are by design to some extent resistant to their toxic target analytes in znta resistance to cd and pb toxicity is mediated by the znta gene which encodes a metal efflux pump that enables the reduction of intracellular toxic metals riether et al 2001 and accordingly many papers have used znta to measure metal free ion speciation i e the metal species regarded as causing toxic effects e g magrisso et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a while lights on bioreporters do typically have characteristics that convey resistance to toxic effects from the chemical species on which they report toxic effects nonetheless occur given high enough levels exposure to toxins e g riether et al 2001 it should be noted that even though subject as any other organism would be to toxic response lights on bioreporters are referred to as such based on their engineering therefore even though the lights on reporter that we use here can be made to exhibit a lights off type of response when exposed to high cd pb it is still inherently a lights on reporter by design since this is the first time that we know of for a lights on bioreporter to be used for toxicity studies or in a blm context and a low bioluminescence signal can equally well result either from low a c d 2 a p b 2 or bioluminescence inhibition due to toxicity at high a c d 2 a p b 2 we employed the well known live dead toxicity bioassay as a benchmark for toxicity studies since for some experiments we needed to collect both bioluminescence and fluorescence readings from one plate discussed below a single type of white microtiter plate was used for internal consistency using the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit l13152 thermo fisher live and dead cells were differentiated respectively by syto 9 and propidium iodide pi fluorescent dye staining stocks 2004 following the manufacturer s directions in the kit the live dead fluorescence emission ratio λ max syto 9 λ max pi was calculated from spectra calibration plots of λ max syto 9 λ max pi versus the ratio of live to dead cells r l d were constructed and subsequently the r l d toxic effect for samples was determined live dead toxicity measurements were always performed immediately after bioreporter bioluminescence measurements to quantify bioluminescence inhibition from toxicity per the common approach to toxicity measurements for lights off bioreporters an et al 2012 qu et al 2013 to determine cd pb toxicity to znta using bioluminescence inhibition we first assessed ranges for which bioreporter bioluminescence increases as a function of increasing activity of metal free ion until a transition point is reached wherein bioluminescence decreases in a sigmoidal fashion consistent with toxic effect toxic effect for bioluminescence inhibition is expressed as r lum mrr c i mrr0i where mrr0i is the maximum response with zero inhibition and mrr c i is the mrr at some concentration ci at which bioluminescence is inhibited by cd or pb while lights on reporters are not normally used for toxicity work it is normal to combine cell viability tests with lights on reporter speciation measurements to ensure that low bioluminescence results from low activity of metal free ion and not toxicity for instance buffi et al 2011 measured cell viability during lights on bioreporter studies using the approach that we use here for additional information on speciation and toxicity assays see the sm 2 2 experiments on the effect of inorganic cations and dissolved organic matter on cd and pb bioavailability speciation and toxicity table 1 summarizes the experiments performed in this study in order to build and validate blm models regarding parameterization of blm models for znta no further information was needed for speciation since the blm run in speciation mode requires no specific organism dependent parameters for blm run in toxicity mode parameterization is needed and it is necessary to first characterize the individual effect of cations ca mg k and na major inorganic constituents on cd and pb toxicity the cd and pb toxicity tests for blm parameterization contained four sets of major cation concentrations referred to as ca set mg set k set and na set each set was composed of a series of media having different concentrations of one target cation with the remaining major cation and other component concentrations being fixed us epa 2003 per de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 we followed the blm development convention of choosing concentration ranges that reasonably span those found in natural freshwaters albeit the ranges that we use are in some cases orders of magnitude greater than those of other work that we cite e g de schamphelaere et al 2014 an et al 2012 the background ion concentration in each dilution series was chosen as that of the medium used in experiments points were spaced by an order of magnitude with some adjustment points added as determined in preliminary experiments to ensure that cation concentrations would result in a usable spacing for the linear regression analysis needed for determination of r cation defined in eq 2 in section 2 3 below for each specific target cation concentration in each set toxicity bioassays across a range of cd or pb concentrations were conducted allowing the calculation of the ec50 sebaugh 2011 and the subsequent systematic analysis of the effects of inorganic cations on ec50 subsequent to construction of the blm toxicity model for znta validation experiments were conducted for blm performance in speciation and toxicity mode calculations for parameterization of the znta blm model experiments with dissolved organic matter dom were not needed however for validation experiments it was desirable to test effects of varying both cations and dom to investigate the effect of dom on cd and pb bioavailability humic acid ha was selected to represent dom as in aqueous systems ha is typically the fraction of dom that is prevalent and most strongly complexes bivalent metals coles and yong 2006 shahid et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2016 ha alfa aesar tianjin china stock solutions were prepared according to the method of zhang et al 2017 and concentrations were verified using a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany per zhang et al 2017 solutions with different ha concentrations were spiked with cd or pb standard and stored in the dark overnight at room temperature to allow equilibration of metal complexation with ha before use sander et al 2004 bioavailability of cd or pb in metal spiked ha solutions was determined per section 2 1 there were three types of validation experiments two using lab prepared samples to mimic the environmental variability of cations and or ha and the third type of validation experiment used real complex matrix environmental field samples the first type of validation involved testing samples containing different concentrations of major cations according to extrema for speciation representative low and high values sv cation series table 1 and varied randomly for toxicity i e randomly chosen variation of cations within the range of extrema tv c series table 1 solutions were spiked with cd or pb equilibrated and tested for the second type of validation experiment a range of ha solutions were prepared holding cation concentrations constant for speciation sv ha table 1 for toxicity three different ha solutions with cation concentrations varied randomly tv ha c series table 1 were made solutions were subsequently spiked with different concentrations of cd and pb equilibrated and tested the third exercise for validation involved testing natural water samples from lake tai tv lt st series table 1 collected at stations that are routinely monitored by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences zhang and chen 2011 lake tai is china s third largest lake subject to a large amount of agricultural run off and a drinking water source for millions of people around the lake qin et al 2007 these water samples were chosen as they were characterized as part of an investigation of metal bioavailability based risk assessment zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b table 1 summarizes major cation and dom ha concentrations of these samples see sm for the detailed results from water quality analysis of those water samples water samples were filtered through a pre combusted 45 mm whatman gf f glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 mm and then spiked with different concentrations of cd or pb standards allowed to equilibrate overnight and tested speciation and toxicity measurements for cd and pb for all types of validation experiments were measured per section 2 1 2 3 biotic ligand model parameterization formal derivation of the full set of equations describing blm parameterization has been well documented elsewhere us epa 2003 for brevity here we summarize those expressions and equations that are needed in practice see us epa 2003 for formal derivation the affinities of cd pb cations for binding to bl are represented by the expressions 1a m n b l 1 mb l n 1 and 1b k mbl a mb l n 1 a m n a b l 1 where the charges and reaction stoichiometry are operationally assumed a m n is the activity of the toxic metal cd or pb a b l 1 is the bl free site activity a mb l n 1 is the activity of the mbln 1 complex and k mbl is the complexation association constant charges henceforth omitted for bl species we use m for toxic metal however the eq 1a and 1b expressions would also apply to ca mg k na binding with bl leading to a system of four major cation equations that can be solved for k cationbl values 2 1 r ca a m g 2 ca r mg a c a 2 mg 1 r k a c a 2 k r k a m g 2 k r na a c a 2 na r na a m g 2 na r ca a k ca r ca a n a ca r mg a k mg r mg a n a mg 1 r k a n a k r na a k na 1 k cabl k mgbl k kbl k nabl r ca r mg r k r na where the ratio r cation is calculated as slope m divided by intercept b obtained through linear regression analysis of ec50 versus cation free ion activity thus a m g 2 ca for instance is the activity of mg2 in the ca set table 1 after obtaining k cationbl additional parameters are needed to describe the interaction of m with bl the total activity of bl sites a tbl is a sum of all bl species the expression for which can be rearranged to express the fraction f of bl sites occupied by m according to 3a a tbl a b l 1 blspecies and 3b f a mbl a tbl k mbl a m n blspecies where blspecies 1 k cabl a c a 2 k mgbl a m g 2 k kbl a k k nabl a n a k mbl a m n the k mbl is obtained as a fitting parameter from the optimized relationship between the logit transformed toxic effect r l d or r lum plotted versus f eq 3b the specific fraction of bl sites occupied by m at the ec50 f crit critical fraction is the x intercept of this plot brown and markich 2000 mathematically the quantity f crit may be related to a number of other quantities that are relevant to blm models however the most simple expression is 4 f crit a mbl crit a tbl where the value a mbl crit is the activity of bl sites occupied by toxic metal at ec50 and this value is constant as can be understood given that the total bl sites are constant and f crit is a constant parameter while ec50 changes with water chemistry a mbl crit does not and while f crit is needed for blm toxicity mode calculations it is not needed for speciation calculations if k mbl is known speciation mode calculations can be performed to determine a mbl crit the absolute value of which will be higher for less sensitive species and vice versa with respect to measurement equilibrium theory entails that for any given water chemistry a specific value of a m n will be associated with a mbl crit i e measuring a m n enables the determination of a mbl crit in this way a less sensitive species capable of measuring speciation can be used to determine when water quality speciation will be at an exact composition equivalent to a mbl crit for a more sensitive species it cannot work the other way around because then the species intended to measure speciation would encounter its toxicity endpoint prior to being able to measure the metal free ion at which a mbl crit occurs while this is all fundamental to the well established theory of speciation modeling based on first principles and blm modeling that derives from speciation modeling it is an unexplored facet of blm work precisely because organisms used in blm modeling have been based on toxicity based endpoints to date with respect to calculations the blm and indeed all speciation models in common use are based on the tableau method of morel 1983 which entails using total concentrations e g table 1 as model component inputs with outputs being speciation in concentration or activity since ks are thermodynamic quantities activity is used in literature however particularly toxicity literature total concentration is more common for instance as the abscissa in dose response curves or reported ec50s in discussing our results we use activity for blm parameterization and validation results and total concentration otherwise particularly when comparing our results to literature findings the designation for the cd or pb concentration at which a mbl crit occurs is c cd crit or c pb crit respectively 2 4 data analysis values for ec50 were determined from dose response curves using originlab software for blm toxicity model parameterization k cationbl parameters were obtained by solving eq 2 using r r core team 2020 the 95 confidence limits for k cationbl were calculated by performing 1000 monte carlo simulations of r cation based on uncertainty in measured m and b followed by solution of eq 2 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 subsequently k mbl and f crit were determined via optimization of the logit toxic response versus f plot blm speciation and toxicity mode calculations were performed using visual minteq 3 1 vm gustafsson 2014 for experiments utilizing commercially purchased ha the standard parameterization of m dom binding in the stockholm humic model shm in vm was retained zhang et al 2017 2020a for toxicity predictions for experiments utilizing lake tai natural water samples dom specific values of k pbha from zhang et al 2020a were used and values of k cdha were determined according to the approach of plaza et al 2006 based on relationships between cd and pb binding dose response curves ritz 2010 used to determine ec50s for both live dead and bioluminescence inhibition toxicity assays via nonlinear fitting employed the following sigmoidal function 5 r toxic effec t 1 1 10 loge c 50 a m n p where r toxic effect is either r l d or r lum for live dead or bioluminescence inhibition assays respectively and p is the slope at the steepest part of the curve also known as the hill slope for the sigmoidal dose response curve for blm toxicity model parameterization values for m and b that are needed to calculate r cations in eq 2 were obtained by linear regression analysis of ec50 versus major cation free ion activity a one tailed t test was used to confirm m 0 which in turn determines whether data for any given major cation is used in parameterization of blm models inputs for speciation and toxicity mode calculations were comprised of c cd c pb c ca c mg c k c na and c dom ha as well as total concentrations of all other mm constituents sections 2 1 and 2 3 table 1 and yield species outputs in activity in both speciation and toxicity calculations dom does not directly interact with the bl however it has a competitive effect via complexing toxic metal for experiments utilizing commercially purchased ha the standard parameterization of m dom binding in the stockholm humic model in vm was retained and for toxicity predictions for lake tai natural water samples dom specific values of k pbha and k cdha were used as we have found that we obtain much better agreement when using models based on our own parameterization of m ha binding as compared to one size fits all models such as the shm see for instance mostofa et al 2013 ahmed et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b all blm toxicity predictions were run with the parameters k cationbl k mbl and f crit determined as described herein to obtain predicted ec50 for any given sample composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of major cations and dissolved organic matter ha on measured cd pb bioavailability and comparison to predictions in blm speciation mode for bioreporter measurement of speciation it is first necessary to construct bioavailability calibration curves magrisso et al 2009 fig 1 s in the sm shows examples of znta bioluminescence response versus time after activation with cd pb and representative bioavailability calibration curves from independent experiments magrisso et al 2009 after induction the bioluminescence response typically reaches a maximum at 180 min results are consistently similar day to day with the average relative standard deviation rsd of replicates for each independent experiment being consistently lower than 8 which represents excellent precision for this type of biological measurement the pearson r 2 for all bioavailability calibration curves in fig 1s is 0 99 which is typical for our work the average znta loq for cd and pb in mm control or reference expressed as c cd and c pb is 0 0011 mg l 1 and 0 015 mg l 1 respectively it has long been recognized that both inorganic and organic constituents of environmental samples can strongly affect the speciation and thus bioavailability of metals morel and hering 1993 scwarzenbach et al 2002 to measure how such constituents affect metal free ion speciation we designed experiments keeping the c cd or c pb constant and varying c cation inorganic or c ha organic as ha as c cd or c pb increases a c d 2 or a p b 2 the bioavailable toxic metal free ion will increase to a greater or lesser extent depending upon the reactions with major cations and or ha in solution fig 1a and b show the measured and predicted a c d 2 and a p b 2 for the speciation mode validation experiments listed in table 1 the solid black line indicates exact agreement between measured and predicted and the dashed lines indicate a factor of twice the average relative percent difference rpd between measured and predicted over the range of cd and pb response pooled all measurements speciation and toxicity to provide a common indicative metric we use average rpd as a nominal guideline our average rpd of 12 reflects how results we report herein are consistently well below the validation guideline that measured and predicted response should agree within a factor of two zhang et al 2020a us epa 2003 the mean absolute error mae between predicted and measured for cd and pb were both calculated to be less than 10 of the mean measured ec50s statistical power was greater than 0 8 with an α 0 05 for major cations the agreement between predicted and measured a c d 2 a p b 2 is generally distributed about the black line that represents exact agreement and free ion activity increases with increasing total concentration for dom we find that as ha increases the bioavailability of cd and pb decreases and results here are in very close agreement with zhang et al 2017 previous findings for pb the average rpd for predicted and measured a c d 2 a p b 2 for ha speciation was 22 which is higher than for major cations the least favorable agreement is for pb at lower a p b 2 and in fig 1a and b we see that for cd and pb agreement is better at higher a c d 2 a p b 2 and vice versa with a slight bias toward overestimation and underestimation of predictions for cd and pb respectively at lower a c d 2 a p b 2 this may be due in part to values that are approaching loq however we and others have previously documented the shortcomings of one size fits all models such as the shm for describing m ha speciation mostofa et al 2013 ahmed et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b while we do use one size fits all models for some work we find much better agreement when using m ha models based on our own parameterization of m ha binding zhang et al 2020a however obtaining bespoke parameters is more experimentally intensive with models such as the shm being more convenient 3 2 use of a lights on bioreporter to measure toxicity blm parameterization and toxicity validation 3 2 1 live dead toxicity measurement the results discussed in section 3 1 are consistent with other reports hynninen and virta 2009 zhang et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 on using bioreporters to measure speciation we have not found reports detailing the use of a lights on bioreporter to measure toxicity thus the point of departure in toxicity studies was to use a standard method such as live dead for comparison the experiments performed to parameterize the cd and pb blms for toxicity are given in table 1 and representative results from these experiments are shown in fig 2 the results in fig 2a show fluorescence spectra for different percentages of live higher fluorescence signal at 505 nm from syto 9 to dead higher fluorescence signal at 645 nm from pi znta cells after dyeing with the live dead working solution and fig 2b shows a resulting calibration line the linear relationship between λ max syto 9 λ max pi plotted versus r l d showed good agreement with manufacturer s protocol specifications confirming that the live dead method was suitable for toxicity experiments with znta fig 2c f show fluorescence spectra c and e and dose response curves d and f in the control medium for cd and pb live dead toxicity experiments with znta for the control we found an ec 50 c cd of 7 1 mg l 1 compared to an ec 50 c pb of 10 mg l 1 indicating that these two metals are similarly toxic to znta one recent report for the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii frequently investigated for its resistance to metals also found less tolerance to cd ec 50 c cd 13 mg l 1 than to pb ec 50 c pb 30 mg l 1 li et al 2021 meanwhile the world health organization who 2013 has set guidance levels for drinking water quality for c cd and c pb at 0 001 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively results from our and li et al 2021 acute toxicity tests on lower organisms and the who exposure metrics for humans indicate that the hazards posed by cd in comparison to pb are of the same order of magnitude in each case albeit with lower metrics for cd i e lower levels being associated with greater acute toxicity for blm parameterization we used the live dead method to determine ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 and how these vary as a function of major cation free ion activities results for which are shown in fig 3 all four major cations have a protective effect on the toxicity of cd the results are different for pb only ca and mg have a protective effect on the toxicity of pb whereas increasing k and na appear to promote pb toxicity nonlinearly similar results have been found by an et al 2012 for cd and pb effects on the bacterium v fischeri these authors did not discuss their observations of this effect and omitted these alkaline metals in their blm parameterization kim et al 2002 observed that increases in ca and mg aqueous free ion decreased the bioaccumulated cd and pb in rice roots however k did not diminish cd and pb bioaccumulation the effect we observe for k and na on pb in fig 3c and d was also found for cu by de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 with daphnia magna these authors remarked upon the effect however gave no explanation of possible reasons behind it gao et al 2020 in studying the toxicity of cu to danio rerio reported the slopes for ec50s versus k and na activities were not differentiable from zero qu et al 2013 observed similar effects as we do here for k in experiments with cd on the bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum these authors theorized that cd might inhibit na k atpase in a variety of tissues such that increases in k will promote the excretion of na by cells making p phosphoreum more sensitive to cd this explanation seems reasonable but since qu et al 2013 did not vary na in their toxicity tests their explanation may not be suitable to explain why both k and na lack the protective effect in the case of our observations and those of other authors cited above the non protective effect found in an et al 2012 qu et al 2013 and de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 looks very similar to our results here in fig 3 c and d exhibiting a behaviour that is fitted better with a decreasing logarithmic function rather than a linear decrease since we do not have a suitable explanation for the effect that would also support cogent parameterization we do as others and omit k and na from calculations for k kbl and k nabl for pb since the effect has been observed for multiple metals and is not limited to bacteria it would seem to warrant more detailed investigation 3 2 2 bioluminescence inhibition toxicity measurement subsequent to characterizing cd and pb toxicity using the live dead method we were interested to see how the results based on bioreporter bioluminescence inhibition might compare representative results from which using the control medium are shown in fig 4 we generally find that dose response curves based on bioluminescence inhibition are quite similar to those obtained with the live dead method for instance when comparing toxicity in the same medium measured by the standard toxicity method live dead in fig 2 to the bioluminescence inhibition results in fig 4 we find that the ec 50 c cd is 5 2 mg l 1 and 7 1 mg l 1 for bioluminescence and live dead respectively and for ec 50 c pb the values are both 10 mg l 1 on average we find that the ec50 we obtain from bioluminescence inhibition for cd and pb is respectively 83 and 89 of the ec50 for these toxic metals that we obtain with the live dead method and that these differences are both significant at p 0 001 this difference might be viewed as reasonable since the uncertainties from sigmoidal curve fitting and also the endpoint of these two types of toxicity measurement methods are different regarding curve fitting there is more uncertainty regarding the exact concentration at which mrr0i occurs which will affect the curve fit with respect to the measurement endpoint live dead reflects cell membrane integrity while bioluminescence inhibition measures cellular metabolic status as bioluminescence is directly linked to respiration through the electron transport chain the inhibition of bacterial metabolism is manifested by attenuation of light emittance that occurs at the toxicity level of the tested substance girotti et al 2008 nonetheless considering that the generally accepted blm convention holding that predicted versus measured need to agree to within a factor of two was adopted in view of large uncertainties associated with many types of toxicity test agreement to within 83 or 89 hardly seems a notable difference even if statistically significant fig 5 shows ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 plotted as a function of major cation free ion activities for toxicity measurements using bioluminescence inhibition as for the live dead results in fig 3 bioluminescence inhibition experiments also show that k and na did not have a protective effect with respect to pb toxicity comparing cd pb toxicity measured by live dead fig 3 to bioluminescence inhibition fig 5 there is no systematic trend for differences in m and b however r cation described in section 2 3 is always smaller for live dead compared to the bioluminescence inhibition method the value r cation may be thought of as the rate of change of m toxicity as a function of the rate of change of major cation free ion activity m normalized to the toxicity of m in the absence of any given major cation b in physical terms a smaller r cation indicates that the protective effect of major cations per unit increase in major cation free ion activity is less as measured by bioluminescence inhibition as compared to live dead the key issue is how such differences affect model parameterization which we discuss in the next section 3 2 3 blm model parameterization per section 2 r cation values from the data in figs 3 and 5 were calculated and used to solve eq 2 for k cabl k mgbl k kbl and k nabl and then k mbl and f crit were then calculated using eq 3 fig 6 shows the logit of the r l d and r lum for cd and pb respectively plotted versus f for both the live dead a b and bioluminescence inhibition method c d reflecting the fits associated with final values of k mbl and f crit results for all parameters used to construct final blm toxicity models are given in table 2 along with parameters reported for cd and pb blm models developed for other test organisms the parameters k cation k mbl and f crit interactively determine the toxic effect within the framework of the blm higher k cation values indicate that major cations are more competitive with toxic metals for bl binding thus reducing toxicity higher k mbl values indicate that the toxic metal has a higher binding affinity for bl increasing toxicity a small f crit indicates that only a small fraction of the bl needs to be occupied to cause a toxic effect and the bioreporter will reach the toxic effect sooner as compared to an organism that models high f crit in theory k cation and k mbl for the same bioreporter by live dead and bioluminescence inhibition methods should be equal as the competitive binding ability of the major cations with toxic metals for the identical bl should be equal while one tailed t tests showed that k cation determined by live dead were greater than for bioluminescence inhibition this may result from various experimental uncertainties some of which we discussed previously because all of these parameters influence model predictions it is difficult to draw conclusions from pairwise comparison of like parameters in table 2 however we will return to a discussion of how they affect the overall model result later in the context of wqc 3 3 comparison of blm toxicity validation results for the live dead and bioluminescence inhibition methods fig 7 shows blm predicted versus measured ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 including results from back calculation and validation using live dead a b and bioluminescence inhibition c d methods back calculation is the process of verifying that predicted toxicities from the blm toxicity mode parameterization experiments in table 1 ca set mg set k set and na set correspond to measurements for validation three types of experiment were performed to verify that the model could predict resulting changes in toxicity 1 varying major cation concentrations randomly changes in inorganic components 2 varying ha concentrations changes in organic components 3 testing natural freshwater samples changes in inorganic and organic components in environmental matrices as with speciation agreement between measured and predicted values is quite strong and well within the factor of two that is the guideline for validation mae between predicted and measured for cd and pb were both calculated to be less than 10 of the mean measured ec50s and statistical power was greater than 0 8 with an α 0 05 the results in fig 7 demonstrate that the bioluminescence inhibition assay produces similarly well behaved validation results for both cd and pb when compared to the well known live dead toxicity bioassay and in practice we find that the bioluminescence inhibition assay is much faster and cheaper when compared to the live dead toxicity measurement 3 4 implications of two in one combination of speciation and toxicity mode in the context of water quality criteria for environmental risk assessment and ecotoxicity studies returning to the discussion of the blm toxicity mode parameters in table 2 we compare the outcomes i e the predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb from blm models for different organisms in the context of aquatic ecotoxicity wqcs as the blm was developed to assist with setting defensible wqc the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb that we predict here are acute criteria and for illustrative purposes we will consider results relative to the criterion maximum concentration cmc which is the highest concentration in ambient water that an aquatic community can tolerate for brief durations acute basis without resulting in an unacceptable adverse effect the cmc originates from genus mean acute values gmavs for aquatic ecotoxicity to calculate a cmc the typical approach is to rank available data for gmavs with the most sensitive genus having the lowest rank and from this assess the ec50 at p 5 5th percentile according to rank to obtain a final acute value fav since the fav is a mean ec50 i e a concentration at which 50 of a population experiences effects the fav is divided by two to obtain the cmc according to one set of guidance documentation on ambient freshwater wqc the cd gmavs range from 0 00419 mg l 1 for salvelinus char trout to 49 052 mg l 1 for chironomus midge us epa 2016b the cd freshwater fav wqc for cd at a hardness of 100 mg l 1 was reported to be 0 00573 mg l 1 however for cd the cmc was set at c cd 0 0018 mg l 1 us epa 2021 lower than the fav 2 to protect the commercially important rainbow trout for pb the gmav ranged from 0 3446 for gammarus amphipod crustacean to 570 1 mg l 1 for the tanytarsus midge us epa 1984 relatively fewer data were available for pb and the pb cmc for freshwater was set at c pb 0 065 mg l 1 at hardness of 100 mg l 1 us epa 2021 based on inference of the p 5 gmav in order to assess how useful blm models for the organisms listed in table 2 are in light of these wqc cmc we calculated predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb and plot these results in fig 8 along with the gmav for the most sensitive organism used in calculating fav wqcs the least sensitive organism s gmav from the same ranking the cmc and the lod of znta which we discuss in context further below the x axis in fig 8 places the ec50 results for the organisms in table 2 at the p n percentile where they fall among all the gmavs in the wqc guidance documentation in fig 8 we see immediately that although the znta blm parameters for bioluminescence inhibition are consistently lower than for live dead the predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for the two are similar for both cd and pb in comparison to variations from other organisms even though the blm parameters for znta from live dead are in some cases statistically different from bioluminescence inhibition the outcome in terms of toxicity is a result of the interplay of all parameters hence the decreased protective effect of the lower k cation values for znta bioluminescence inhibition are in whole or part offset by the lower k mbl values found for bioluminescence inhibition comparing the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for znta from fig 8 to other organisms with reported cd pb blms the predicted ec50s for d rerio and especially eisenia fetida are higher the highest predicted ec 50 c cd is for e fetida which at 1 234 mg l 1 is over an order of magnitude higher than the highest cd gmav for chironomus thus plotted above p 100 in terms of blm parameters the highest f crit in table 2 is for e fetida being half again 50 higher than the average f crit in table 2 it is logical that e fetida is relatively insensitive work by jones et al 2009 and li et al 2009 shows that e fetida can compartmentalize sequester cd and pb increasing the organism s resistance to cd and pb toxicity d rerio meanwhile has documented heavy metal detoxification mechanisms such as glutathione s transferase protein expression tierbach et al 2018 the f crit of hordeum vulgare is the lowest compared to all the organisms in table 2 such that only 29 of bl sites need to complex with cd to cause a toxic effect for barley root elongation cd is absorbed and accumulated in plant tissues and as roots are the primary site of accumulation shi et al 2016 and references therein they are also a locus of toxic effects likely explaining the sensitivity and low f crit of h vulgare bioreporters may be engineered to tailor for sensitivity according to the needs of the intended application as zhang et al 2022 discussed many factors will affect whether a particular construct is fit for purpose with respect to the desired use for instance magrisso et al 2009 selected cupriavidus metallidurans strain ch34 with its high resistance to pb which was of benefit to their application studying soil contamination where very high pb concentrations may be present van der lelie and tibazarwa 2001 also listed many different mechanisms of metal resistance for different bacteria regarding results for bacteria in fig 8 v fischeri and znta have similar predicted ec 50 c cd s 12 mg l 1 for v fischeri 9 1 mg l 1 for znta live dead and 10 1 mg l 1 for znta bioluminescence inhibition however the v fischeri ec 50 c pb is 30 times lower on average than for znta 0 4 mg l 1 for v fischeri versus 12 6 mg l 1 for znta live dead and 12 8 mg l 1 for znta bioluminescence inhibition the insensitivity of v fischeri to cd in comparison to znta was not expected inasmuch as v fischeri is a lights off bioreporter hence a lower ec 50 c cd is consistent with needs for measurement of toxic response whereas znta as a lights on reporter should ideally be more resistant to toxic metals in order to measure speciation for environmental samples from contaminated sites for v fischeri ranjitha and karthy 2012 have reported that heavy metal resistance is highly variable and teodorovic et al 2009 have questioned the applicability of v fischeri as a useful screening method in assessing various environmental samples due to its low sensitivity to heavy metals as such the variability of results and insensitivity with regard to cd for v fischeri in fig 8 are consistent with literature reports while some organisms are more sensitive than others as compared to the fav for cd and pb and the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for sensitive species salvelinus and gammarus respectively none of the organisms for which blms have been developed could be regarded as fit for purpose for ambient aquatic toxic metal environmental risk assessment according to existing wqcs i e the metrics that matter even v fischeri for pb is above the p 10 while the cmc is set at p 5 this point relates to the application of any given blm a point that is often not explicitly addressed in many of the works whose model results we include in fig 8 such relatively insensitive organisms may still offer great applicability to ecotoxicological studies on soils as one example also one application is not always separable from others for instance the high concentrations of contaminants that may result in water from agricultural run off mentioned for our field samples from lake tai the potential range in sensitivity that might be desirable to span multiple applications is one attractive feature of using an organism such as znta although znta has a toxicity endpoint that is like the other blm organisms in fig 8 relatively insensitive for the aquatic ecotoxicological application the dual mode use capacity coupled with the low lod and higher ec50 of znta results in a measurement range rather than a single measurement endpoint conferring significantly greater flexibility in use it is an important point and it underscores the essential difference in the approach we take here namely that because lights on reporters are capable of measuring speciation and toxicity consistent with how the blm can be run in speciation and toxicity mode they are much less limited compared to effectively any other organisms in use for blm studies fig 9 graphically illustrates the dual mode response characteristic for cd and pb whereby at concentrations well below the ec50 the lights on znta is able to report levels of toxic cd and pb in a linear data not shown to log linear solid lines in fig 9 response pattern the relative ranges over which znta is able to report for cd and pb begin below the corresponding cmc for each metal compare the lods for these metals to the cmcs in fig 8 at the maximum of the log linear speciation range the response smoothly transitions to bioluminescence inhibition toxicity thus while other organisms used in blm work report toxicity as a single metric such as ec50 for any given water composition the lights on bioreporter is able to render results for an entire concentration range in the case of cd and pb starting from well below the respective favs for these metals up to the ec50 for the bioreporter while the cd and pb blms for other organisms listed in table 2 are not able to produce results for cd and pb levels that are environmentally relevant in terms of wqc znta and by extension other lights on reporters can measure speciation before reaching toxic effect consequently we may use the two in one speciation toxicity capability of lights on bioreporters as demonstrated here for znta to report at toxicity endpoints for many other organisms whose toxicity endpoints lie in the lod ec50 range of the bioreporter the values of cdblcrit and pbblcrit for znta that correspond to the reported ec50s us epa 1984 and 2016b of selected test organisms used in setting wqcs were calculated via speciation mode using the cdblcrit and pbblcrit for the aquatic ecotoxicy test organisms the corresponding ec50s for the base test media background ion composition in table 1 were determined and are plotted in fig 9 in units of total metal at which each organism s ec50 occurs i e cdblcrit and pbblcrit for the particular composition of the media these examples illustrate the manner in which znta is able to serve as a proxy for measurement or prediction of the ec50s based on speciation mode capabilities of znta in the case of znta specifically we may measure and with the validated blm predict cd and pb ec50s for any genus for which the gmav falls in the range of cmc p 50 or cmc p 55 respectively for cd and pb i e the most sensitive half of all species for which data has been reported in setting the wqc guidance values used for discussion in fig 8 while this range may exclude relatively insensitive species such as e fetida it includes the majority of sensitive species and these are precisely the species that are of interest with regard to wqc and environmental risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity 4 conclusions this is the first work to use a lights on bioreporter combining the study of speciation and toxicity simultaneously and within the blm framework for risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity our major findings include the following we verified a two in one functionality for the lights on bioreporter including speciation and toxicity measurement and prediction validated blm the ability of the bioreporter to measure speciation has implications for wqc and environmental management toxicity endpoints for other cd and pb blms reported in literature average p 71 and p 44 rank percentile sensitivity i e insensitive for cd and pb respectively and in consequence could not be regarded in any context as fit for purpose for toxic metal environmental risk assessment according to wqcs based on protection of 95 of aquatic species p 5 with the low lods of cd and pb for the bioreporter below the relevant cd and pb cmcs and the ability to measure speciation in addition to toxicity the bioreporter is able to measure the speciated values of cd and pb that correspond to the toxicity endpoints of the most sensitive half of species from the cmc wqc to the p 50 the results reported here for the lights on bioreporter as a two in one bioreporter for cd and pb measurements and blm predictions are theoretically and in all reasonable expectation generalizable to any lights on bioreporter because these reporters are typically designed and constructed for the purposes of measuring environmental contamination which entails 1 that lights on bioreporter lods are low enough to be environmentally relevant and 2 that the lights on bioreporter resistance to the target analyte s also enables speciation measurement in higher concentration ranges that are often found at contaminated sites perhaps most importantly in being able to represent and report on endpoints for a wide range of other species the two in one approach which is also high throughput methodology has potential to substitute rapid testing in many instances where traditional toxicity testing is both limited to a single endpoint such as ec50 and is also more time consuming and expensive a future direction for this research would include work with other reporters toxic analytes and work to test proof of principle calibrating lights on reporters to chronic toxicity endpoints declaration of competing interest

16037,due to the sheer number of contaminated sites bioavailability based measurement and modeling of toxicity is used to triage response despite advances both remain relatively cumbersome cadmium cd and lead pb are two of the most toxic and globally prevalent pollutants disproportionately impacting disadvantaged communities here we demonstrate the use of high throughput lights on bioreporter technology to measure both speciation and toxicity the organism s response is fit for purpose to parameterize the biotic ligand model used in risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity and setting

concentration wells et al 2004 harms et al 2006 as acknowledged for instance by the us environmental protection agency s us epa s framework for metals risk assessment which states that for hazardous metals risk assessors should explicitly incorporate factors that influence the bioavailability of a metal fairbrother et al 2007 also see review of the metals action plan to identify key scientific issues important for assessing the risks of toxic metal contamination us epa 2002 while the us epa was early to recognize these inter relationships the perspective is now woven into practice in many counties e g see ec 2013 because bioavailability is a function of metal chemical speciation hereafter speciation nor and cheng 1986 tessier and turner 1995 sander et al 2011 khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 and 2020a many environmental factors that influence speciation e g ph organic matter complexation with heavy metals also influence metal bioavailability most environmental studies focus on either speciation bioavailability e g bagherifam et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 yan et al 2020 or toxicity based on bioavailability e g an et al 2012 2015 gao et al 2021 i e one or the other usually not both to our knowledge there is a paucity of work demonstrating a simple and efficacious approach to span the continuum of speciation to toxicity measurement as a holistic mechanism to understand biological effects to assist with setting defensible water quality criteria wqc the biotic ligand model blm was developed us epa 2003 us epa 2016a as a mechanistic model having evolved from multiple linear regression models hodge and armstrong 1993 and theory from the gill surface interaction model and the free ion activity model pagenkopf 1983 morel 1983 the mechanistic aspects of the blm explicitly links speciation to toxicity albeit for most risk assessment work the blm is run in toxicity mode since available biological endpoints consist of a single metric such as ec50 effective concentration causing 50 toxic effect in the framework of the blm a biotic ligand bl is a specific receptor within an organism for which complexation by a metal m can lead to toxic effects hence the blm includes expressions to describe metal complexation with bls us epa 2007 nontoxic metal cation bl complexation is also specified in the model and the competition of major cations in environmental samples that is cations of ca mg k na for binding with bl reduces toxic m bl complexation and therefore toxic effects parameters describing the reactions of bl with m and major cations are therefore required for blm models run in speciation mode for blm toxicity mode there needs to be further parameterization for calculation of a toxicity endpoint such as ec50 e g di toro et al 2001 crémazy et al 2016 the blm model is mechanistic in nature and model inputs are simple and inexpensive to obtain blm results have been demonstrated to be an accurate predictor of environmental risk for several toxic heavy metals and to be fit for purpose tool for decisions regarding wqc niyogi and wood 2004 though developed in the us the blm has also been adopted as the basis of some environmental quality standards eqs in europe to enable site specific eqs values to be derived ec 2010 while copper cu and nickel ni blms have been thoroughly studied and are used in the united states in europe and increasingly in other places ec 2010 us epa 2016a as an et al 2012 have pointed out fewer bl based models are available for cadmium cd and lead pb considering the toxicity of cd and pb increasing the focus on these environmental contaminants within the blm framework is timely cd and pb are considered to be two of the most hazardous substances globally tellez plaza et al 2013 pure earth green cross 2015 alengebawy et al 2021 and also contribute to alarming environmental issues in china and india which together account for about 37 of the entire global population tong et al 2000 cheng 2003 kan 2009 kumar et al 2019 hu et al 2020 cd ranks seventh on one list referred to as the top 20 hazardous substance cercla 2005 additionally cadmium and cadmium compounds i e anything that contains cd is on the two most well known lists of carcinogens as classified by the international agency for research on cancer and the national toxicology program ntp of the united states the latter of which only contains 69 line items as compared to the tens of thousands of agents that are probable or possible carcinogens mcguire 2016 ntp 2016 oldani et al 2020 cd is notably affected by ph in soils thus its bioavailability is increased by anthropogenic increases in acid rain and this contributes to cd s being accumulated in important foodstuffs such as rice liu et al 2007 song et al 2015 due to the carcinogenicity of cd and its increasing presence in food items cd contamination represents a global threat to both food security and human health khan et al 2021 with regard to pb its increasing environmental prevalence might arguably be described as an impending crisis inasmuch as there is no safe level of pb exposure grandjean 2010 and pb is differentially neurotoxic to children compromising cognitive development grandjean and landrigan 2014 the global annual costs of childhood pb exposure from cognitive defects alone are estimated to be 1 15 trillion us dollars most of which is borne by low and middle income countries grandjean and bellange 2017 due to activities such as coal burning that release pb and cd and the continued increasing global production of pb mudd 2013 marx et al 2016 for use in various applications including increasing use in sustainable solar photovoltaic energy systems gottesfeld and cherry 2011 a continued stark increase in environmental pb levels is virtually assured the increasing prevalence and highly toxic nature of cd and pb ensures that exposure to these contaminants is an intergenerational issue predicating our choice to study cd and pb in this work many different methods have been and are being developed florence 1986 batley et al 2004 us epa 2007a fairbrother et al 2007 to quantify bioavailability for metals among which whole cell bioreporters have become of increasing interest with respect to pollutants in environmental matrices such as water soil sediments and other geomaterials belkin 2003 al anizi et al 2014 wells 2012 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 jiang et al 2021 bioreporters are living microbial cells that have been genetically engineered to produce a measurable signal typically optical measured as bioluminescence fluorescence or absorbance in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their environment van der meer and belkin 2010 whole cell bioreporters have been described as falling into two mechanistic response categories lights off and lights on belkin 2003 xu et al 2014 lights off bioreporters are used for toxicity measurements as they emit a continuous signal in the absence of toxin for example vibrio fischeri in the well known microtox assay farré and barceló 2003 and only after dosing reaches toxic levels signal is inhibited belkin 2003 an et al 2012 abbas et al 2018 as diminishing signal accompanies toxicity the process is referred to as lights off and the effect is non specific any toxin could cause signal diminution i e there is no specific bioengineering design involved in response and any substance bioavailable in quantities sufficient to provoke a toxic response is not differentiable from another such substance zhang et al 2022 1 1 this is common of many other toxicity tests lights off bioreporters fish springtails daphnia etc are all non specific and additional chemical analysis would be necessary if measuring mixed or unknown toxicants in natural waters to understand the contribution from a specific toxin lights on bioreporters are notably used in speciation measurements as they have the capacity to emit a dose dependent bioluminescence in response to bioavailable chemicals that induce a responsive promoter that was genetically introduced belkin 2003 magrisso et al 2008 senevirathna et al 2009 shemer et al 2015 i e signal increases lights on typically linearly with concentration of the target analyte to which the bioreporter was designed to respond lights on bioreporters are notably selective or sometimes even specific to a single analyte for example we use a lights on bioreporter in this work for which resistance to cd2 and pb2 toxicity is mediated at least in part by the presence of the znta gene riether et al 2001 this gene endows the bioreporter with the capacity to emit a positive nontoxic dose dependent bioluminescence response to bioavailable cd2 and pb2 toxic free ions kessler et al 2012 within environmentally relevant cd and pb concentration ranges in theory a lights on bioreporter can also be used in toxicity measurement as once toxicity is reached the organism cannot function as a lights on bioreporter because the reporting signal is diminished as with other toxicity measurements fish springtails daphnia microtox etc irrespective of what the mechanism of toxicity is while lights on bioreporters have demonstrated success for speciation measurements of metal free ion to our knowledge they have not been used to quantify toxic effects here we posit that it is possible to achieve an approach to the determination of bioavailability that spans the continuum from speciation to toxicity and in a manner that permits the unified validation of both within a blm modeling framework at the outset of this work we hypothesized that some forms of bioreporter technology have been tailored at an engineering level to possess the precise characteristics to achieve such a goal with the added advantage of being high throughput to test our suppositions we chose a lights on bioreporter that emits bioluminescence in response to cd and pb and we observed concordance between measurement and prediction of free metal species in the presence of different solution components that affect bioavailability next we conducted experiments to parameterize bioreporter toxicity models for cd and pb and we subsequently benchmarked bioreporter predicted toxicity to that of a standard method in common use we then compare toxicity model results for the bioreporter to other organisms for which literature exists organisms that are commonly the subject of toxicity studies but are not generally recognized as fit for rendering results on speciation we find that the bioreporter is able to respond to a continuum of speciation up to its own toxicity endpoint and is thus able to report endpoints for cd and pb levels in a range spanning that of the most sensitive freshwater organisms up to approximately the 50th percentile sensitivity such that the approach we developed here is fit for purpose to parameterize the blm used in setting environmental wqc and risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity with the increasing numbers of bioreporters to measure different bioavailable pollutants ekrami et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 and the inevitability of toxic response for any toxin at high enough dosage exposure the approach that we demonstrate is reasonably expected to be extensible 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreporter growth media speciation and toxicity assays escherichia coli phl268 strain znta hereafter znta in contrast to the gene znta was used as the lights on bioreporter for this study kessler et al 2012 for both speciation and toxicity measurement the strain was stored at 4 c on lysogeny broth lb agar bertani 2004 amended with 40 μg ml 1 ampicillin overnight cultures were grown at 30 c with shaking at 90 rpm for 16 h the overnight culture was diluted 100 fold in fresh lb without ampicillin and re grown at 26 c shaking at 200 rpm at an optical density at 600 nm od600 of 0 10 cells were harvested by centrifugation 13 200 g the supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in optimized minimal medium mm to an od600 of 0 20 the mm contained 6 06 g of 3 n morpholino propane sulfonic acid mops 2 g of sodium gluconate 0 23 g β glycero phosphate 4 68 g of nacl 1 07 g of nh4cl 0 43 g of na2so4 0 2 g of mgcl2 6h2o and 0 03 g of cacl2 2h2o dissolved in 1000 ml of distilled water and adjusted to ph 7 0 0 1 mergeay et al 1985 magrisso et al 2009 all chemicals were reagent grade or better and purchased from alfa aesar co ltd shanghai china this strain has the demonstrated ability to respond to cd pb toxic metal species i e free ion as a c d 2 or a p b 2 activity of cd2 or pb2 respectively quantified using a bioavailability calibration curve e g riether et al 2001 magrisso et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a for the bioavailability speciation assay zhang et al 2017 and references therein 50 µl of bioreporter cell suspension od600 0 2 was added to a 96 well white microtiter plate nunc denmark followed by adding 50 µl of cd or pb standard prepared per zhang et al 2017 or sample all cd and pb standards were analyzed by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion300 perkinelmer usa see supplementary material sm for details next the microplate was incubated at 26 c with a rotation speed of 180 rpm and bioluminescence was measured every 10 min for 3 h using a luminometer varioskan lux thermo fisher scientific usa while we use a 96 well microplate plates with larger numbers of wells could equally well be used all of which constitute high throughput methodology particularly as compared to most assays for both bioavailability and toxicity bioluminescence response was calculated as maximum response ratio mrr mrr rlu c m max rlu0 max where rlu c m max is the maximum response in relative luminescence units for metal concentration c m and rlu0 max is the maximum response of the blank per zhang et al 2017 the limit of detection lod was calculated as signal greater than three times the standard deviation of the blank and the loq as three times the lod shrivastava 2011 a common feature of lights on bioreporters that enables them to be useful in work with contaminated samples is that they are by design to some extent resistant to their toxic target analytes in znta resistance to cd and pb toxicity is mediated by the znta gene which encodes a metal efflux pump that enables the reduction of intracellular toxic metals riether et al 2001 and accordingly many papers have used znta to measure metal free ion speciation i e the metal species regarded as causing toxic effects e g magrisso et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a while lights on bioreporters do typically have characteristics that convey resistance to toxic effects from the chemical species on which they report toxic effects nonetheless occur given high enough levels exposure to toxins e g riether et al 2001 it should be noted that even though subject as any other organism would be to toxic response lights on bioreporters are referred to as such based on their engineering therefore even though the lights on reporter that we use here can be made to exhibit a lights off type of response when exposed to high cd pb it is still inherently a lights on reporter by design since this is the first time that we know of for a lights on bioreporter to be used for toxicity studies or in a blm context and a low bioluminescence signal can equally well result either from low a c d 2 a p b 2 or bioluminescence inhibition due to toxicity at high a c d 2 a p b 2 we employed the well known live dead toxicity bioassay as a benchmark for toxicity studies since for some experiments we needed to collect both bioluminescence and fluorescence readings from one plate discussed below a single type of white microtiter plate was used for internal consistency using the live dead baclighttm bacterial viability kit l13152 thermo fisher live and dead cells were differentiated respectively by syto 9 and propidium iodide pi fluorescent dye staining stocks 2004 following the manufacturer s directions in the kit the live dead fluorescence emission ratio λ max syto 9 λ max pi was calculated from spectra calibration plots of λ max syto 9 λ max pi versus the ratio of live to dead cells r l d were constructed and subsequently the r l d toxic effect for samples was determined live dead toxicity measurements were always performed immediately after bioreporter bioluminescence measurements to quantify bioluminescence inhibition from toxicity per the common approach to toxicity measurements for lights off bioreporters an et al 2012 qu et al 2013 to determine cd pb toxicity to znta using bioluminescence inhibition we first assessed ranges for which bioreporter bioluminescence increases as a function of increasing activity of metal free ion until a transition point is reached wherein bioluminescence decreases in a sigmoidal fashion consistent with toxic effect toxic effect for bioluminescence inhibition is expressed as r lum mrr c i mrr0i where mrr0i is the maximum response with zero inhibition and mrr c i is the mrr at some concentration ci at which bioluminescence is inhibited by cd or pb while lights on reporters are not normally used for toxicity work it is normal to combine cell viability tests with lights on reporter speciation measurements to ensure that low bioluminescence results from low activity of metal free ion and not toxicity for instance buffi et al 2011 measured cell viability during lights on bioreporter studies using the approach that we use here for additional information on speciation and toxicity assays see the sm 2 2 experiments on the effect of inorganic cations and dissolved organic matter on cd and pb bioavailability speciation and toxicity table 1 summarizes the experiments performed in this study in order to build and validate blm models regarding parameterization of blm models for znta no further information was needed for speciation since the blm run in speciation mode requires no specific organism dependent parameters for blm run in toxicity mode parameterization is needed and it is necessary to first characterize the individual effect of cations ca mg k and na major inorganic constituents on cd and pb toxicity the cd and pb toxicity tests for blm parameterization contained four sets of major cation concentrations referred to as ca set mg set k set and na set each set was composed of a series of media having different concentrations of one target cation with the remaining major cation and other component concentrations being fixed us epa 2003 per de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 we followed the blm development convention of choosing concentration ranges that reasonably span those found in natural freshwaters albeit the ranges that we use are in some cases orders of magnitude greater than those of other work that we cite e g de schamphelaere et al 2014 an et al 2012 the background ion concentration in each dilution series was chosen as that of the medium used in experiments points were spaced by an order of magnitude with some adjustment points added as determined in preliminary experiments to ensure that cation concentrations would result in a usable spacing for the linear regression analysis needed for determination of r cation defined in eq 2 in section 2 3 below for each specific target cation concentration in each set toxicity bioassays across a range of cd or pb concentrations were conducted allowing the calculation of the ec50 sebaugh 2011 and the subsequent systematic analysis of the effects of inorganic cations on ec50 subsequent to construction of the blm toxicity model for znta validation experiments were conducted for blm performance in speciation and toxicity mode calculations for parameterization of the znta blm model experiments with dissolved organic matter dom were not needed however for validation experiments it was desirable to test effects of varying both cations and dom to investigate the effect of dom on cd and pb bioavailability humic acid ha was selected to represent dom as in aqueous systems ha is typically the fraction of dom that is prevalent and most strongly complexes bivalent metals coles and yong 2006 shahid et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2016 ha alfa aesar tianjin china stock solutions were prepared according to the method of zhang et al 2017 and concentrations were verified using a total organic carbon toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany per zhang et al 2017 solutions with different ha concentrations were spiked with cd or pb standard and stored in the dark overnight at room temperature to allow equilibration of metal complexation with ha before use sander et al 2004 bioavailability of cd or pb in metal spiked ha solutions was determined per section 2 1 there were three types of validation experiments two using lab prepared samples to mimic the environmental variability of cations and or ha and the third type of validation experiment used real complex matrix environmental field samples the first type of validation involved testing samples containing different concentrations of major cations according to extrema for speciation representative low and high values sv cation series table 1 and varied randomly for toxicity i e randomly chosen variation of cations within the range of extrema tv c series table 1 solutions were spiked with cd or pb equilibrated and tested for the second type of validation experiment a range of ha solutions were prepared holding cation concentrations constant for speciation sv ha table 1 for toxicity three different ha solutions with cation concentrations varied randomly tv ha c series table 1 were made solutions were subsequently spiked with different concentrations of cd and pb equilibrated and tested the third exercise for validation involved testing natural water samples from lake tai tv lt st series table 1 collected at stations that are routinely monitored by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences zhang and chen 2011 lake tai is china s third largest lake subject to a large amount of agricultural run off and a drinking water source for millions of people around the lake qin et al 2007 these water samples were chosen as they were characterized as part of an investigation of metal bioavailability based risk assessment zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b table 1 summarizes major cation and dom ha concentrations of these samples see sm for the detailed results from water quality analysis of those water samples water samples were filtered through a pre combusted 45 mm whatman gf f glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 mm and then spiked with different concentrations of cd or pb standards allowed to equilibrate overnight and tested speciation and toxicity measurements for cd and pb for all types of validation experiments were measured per section 2 1 2 3 biotic ligand model parameterization formal derivation of the full set of equations describing blm parameterization has been well documented elsewhere us epa 2003 for brevity here we summarize those expressions and equations that are needed in practice see us epa 2003 for formal derivation the affinities of cd pb cations for binding to bl are represented by the expressions 1a m n b l 1 mb l n 1 and 1b k mbl a mb l n 1 a m n a b l 1 where the charges and reaction stoichiometry are operationally assumed a m n is the activity of the toxic metal cd or pb a b l 1 is the bl free site activity a mb l n 1 is the activity of the mbln 1 complex and k mbl is the complexation association constant charges henceforth omitted for bl species we use m for toxic metal however the eq 1a and 1b expressions would also apply to ca mg k na binding with bl leading to a system of four major cation equations that can be solved for k cationbl values 2 1 r ca a m g 2 ca r mg a c a 2 mg 1 r k a c a 2 k r k a m g 2 k r na a c a 2 na r na a m g 2 na r ca a k ca r ca a n a ca r mg a k mg r mg a n a mg 1 r k a n a k r na a k na 1 k cabl k mgbl k kbl k nabl r ca r mg r k r na where the ratio r cation is calculated as slope m divided by intercept b obtained through linear regression analysis of ec50 versus cation free ion activity thus a m g 2 ca for instance is the activity of mg2 in the ca set table 1 after obtaining k cationbl additional parameters are needed to describe the interaction of m with bl the total activity of bl sites a tbl is a sum of all bl species the expression for which can be rearranged to express the fraction f of bl sites occupied by m according to 3a a tbl a b l 1 blspecies and 3b f a mbl a tbl k mbl a m n blspecies where blspecies 1 k cabl a c a 2 k mgbl a m g 2 k kbl a k k nabl a n a k mbl a m n the k mbl is obtained as a fitting parameter from the optimized relationship between the logit transformed toxic effect r l d or r lum plotted versus f eq 3b the specific fraction of bl sites occupied by m at the ec50 f crit critical fraction is the x intercept of this plot brown and markich 2000 mathematically the quantity f crit may be related to a number of other quantities that are relevant to blm models however the most simple expression is 4 f crit a mbl crit a tbl where the value a mbl crit is the activity of bl sites occupied by toxic metal at ec50 and this value is constant as can be understood given that the total bl sites are constant and f crit is a constant parameter while ec50 changes with water chemistry a mbl crit does not and while f crit is needed for blm toxicity mode calculations it is not needed for speciation calculations if k mbl is known speciation mode calculations can be performed to determine a mbl crit the absolute value of which will be higher for less sensitive species and vice versa with respect to measurement equilibrium theory entails that for any given water chemistry a specific value of a m n will be associated with a mbl crit i e measuring a m n enables the determination of a mbl crit in this way a less sensitive species capable of measuring speciation can be used to determine when water quality speciation will be at an exact composition equivalent to a mbl crit for a more sensitive species it cannot work the other way around because then the species intended to measure speciation would encounter its toxicity endpoint prior to being able to measure the metal free ion at which a mbl crit occurs while this is all fundamental to the well established theory of speciation modeling based on first principles and blm modeling that derives from speciation modeling it is an unexplored facet of blm work precisely because organisms used in blm modeling have been based on toxicity based endpoints to date with respect to calculations the blm and indeed all speciation models in common use are based on the tableau method of morel 1983 which entails using total concentrations e g table 1 as model component inputs with outputs being speciation in concentration or activity since ks are thermodynamic quantities activity is used in literature however particularly toxicity literature total concentration is more common for instance as the abscissa in dose response curves or reported ec50s in discussing our results we use activity for blm parameterization and validation results and total concentration otherwise particularly when comparing our results to literature findings the designation for the cd or pb concentration at which a mbl crit occurs is c cd crit or c pb crit respectively 2 4 data analysis values for ec50 were determined from dose response curves using originlab software for blm toxicity model parameterization k cationbl parameters were obtained by solving eq 2 using r r core team 2020 the 95 confidence limits for k cationbl were calculated by performing 1000 monte carlo simulations of r cation based on uncertainty in measured m and b followed by solution of eq 2 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 subsequently k mbl and f crit were determined via optimization of the logit toxic response versus f plot blm speciation and toxicity mode calculations were performed using visual minteq 3 1 vm gustafsson 2014 for experiments utilizing commercially purchased ha the standard parameterization of m dom binding in the stockholm humic model shm in vm was retained zhang et al 2017 2020a for toxicity predictions for experiments utilizing lake tai natural water samples dom specific values of k pbha from zhang et al 2020a were used and values of k cdha were determined according to the approach of plaza et al 2006 based on relationships between cd and pb binding dose response curves ritz 2010 used to determine ec50s for both live dead and bioluminescence inhibition toxicity assays via nonlinear fitting employed the following sigmoidal function 5 r toxic effec t 1 1 10 loge c 50 a m n p where r toxic effect is either r l d or r lum for live dead or bioluminescence inhibition assays respectively and p is the slope at the steepest part of the curve also known as the hill slope for the sigmoidal dose response curve for blm toxicity model parameterization values for m and b that are needed to calculate r cations in eq 2 were obtained by linear regression analysis of ec50 versus major cation free ion activity a one tailed t test was used to confirm m 0 which in turn determines whether data for any given major cation is used in parameterization of blm models inputs for speciation and toxicity mode calculations were comprised of c cd c pb c ca c mg c k c na and c dom ha as well as total concentrations of all other mm constituents sections 2 1 and 2 3 table 1 and yield species outputs in activity in both speciation and toxicity calculations dom does not directly interact with the bl however it has a competitive effect via complexing toxic metal for experiments utilizing commercially purchased ha the standard parameterization of m dom binding in the stockholm humic model in vm was retained and for toxicity predictions for lake tai natural water samples dom specific values of k pbha and k cdha were used as we have found that we obtain much better agreement when using models based on our own parameterization of m ha binding as compared to one size fits all models such as the shm see for instance mostofa et al 2013 ahmed et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b all blm toxicity predictions were run with the parameters k cationbl k mbl and f crit determined as described herein to obtain predicted ec50 for any given sample composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of major cations and dissolved organic matter ha on measured cd pb bioavailability and comparison to predictions in blm speciation mode for bioreporter measurement of speciation it is first necessary to construct bioavailability calibration curves magrisso et al 2009 fig 1 s in the sm shows examples of znta bioluminescence response versus time after activation with cd pb and representative bioavailability calibration curves from independent experiments magrisso et al 2009 after induction the bioluminescence response typically reaches a maximum at 180 min results are consistently similar day to day with the average relative standard deviation rsd of replicates for each independent experiment being consistently lower than 8 which represents excellent precision for this type of biological measurement the pearson r 2 for all bioavailability calibration curves in fig 1s is 0 99 which is typical for our work the average znta loq for cd and pb in mm control or reference expressed as c cd and c pb is 0 0011 mg l 1 and 0 015 mg l 1 respectively it has long been recognized that both inorganic and organic constituents of environmental samples can strongly affect the speciation and thus bioavailability of metals morel and hering 1993 scwarzenbach et al 2002 to measure how such constituents affect metal free ion speciation we designed experiments keeping the c cd or c pb constant and varying c cation inorganic or c ha organic as ha as c cd or c pb increases a c d 2 or a p b 2 the bioavailable toxic metal free ion will increase to a greater or lesser extent depending upon the reactions with major cations and or ha in solution fig 1a and b show the measured and predicted a c d 2 and a p b 2 for the speciation mode validation experiments listed in table 1 the solid black line indicates exact agreement between measured and predicted and the dashed lines indicate a factor of twice the average relative percent difference rpd between measured and predicted over the range of cd and pb response pooled all measurements speciation and toxicity to provide a common indicative metric we use average rpd as a nominal guideline our average rpd of 12 reflects how results we report herein are consistently well below the validation guideline that measured and predicted response should agree within a factor of two zhang et al 2020a us epa 2003 the mean absolute error mae between predicted and measured for cd and pb were both calculated to be less than 10 of the mean measured ec50s statistical power was greater than 0 8 with an α 0 05 for major cations the agreement between predicted and measured a c d 2 a p b 2 is generally distributed about the black line that represents exact agreement and free ion activity increases with increasing total concentration for dom we find that as ha increases the bioavailability of cd and pb decreases and results here are in very close agreement with zhang et al 2017 previous findings for pb the average rpd for predicted and measured a c d 2 a p b 2 for ha speciation was 22 which is higher than for major cations the least favorable agreement is for pb at lower a p b 2 and in fig 1a and b we see that for cd and pb agreement is better at higher a c d 2 a p b 2 and vice versa with a slight bias toward overestimation and underestimation of predictions for cd and pb respectively at lower a c d 2 a p b 2 this may be due in part to values that are approaching loq however we and others have previously documented the shortcomings of one size fits all models such as the shm for describing m ha speciation mostofa et al 2013 ahmed et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b while we do use one size fits all models for some work we find much better agreement when using m ha models based on our own parameterization of m ha binding zhang et al 2020a however obtaining bespoke parameters is more experimentally intensive with models such as the shm being more convenient 3 2 use of a lights on bioreporter to measure toxicity blm parameterization and toxicity validation 3 2 1 live dead toxicity measurement the results discussed in section 3 1 are consistent with other reports hynninen and virta 2009 zhang et al 2017 hansen et al 2019 on using bioreporters to measure speciation we have not found reports detailing the use of a lights on bioreporter to measure toxicity thus the point of departure in toxicity studies was to use a standard method such as live dead for comparison the experiments performed to parameterize the cd and pb blms for toxicity are given in table 1 and representative results from these experiments are shown in fig 2 the results in fig 2a show fluorescence spectra for different percentages of live higher fluorescence signal at 505 nm from syto 9 to dead higher fluorescence signal at 645 nm from pi znta cells after dyeing with the live dead working solution and fig 2b shows a resulting calibration line the linear relationship between λ max syto 9 λ max pi plotted versus r l d showed good agreement with manufacturer s protocol specifications confirming that the live dead method was suitable for toxicity experiments with znta fig 2c f show fluorescence spectra c and e and dose response curves d and f in the control medium for cd and pb live dead toxicity experiments with znta for the control we found an ec 50 c cd of 7 1 mg l 1 compared to an ec 50 c pb of 10 mg l 1 indicating that these two metals are similarly toxic to znta one recent report for the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii frequently investigated for its resistance to metals also found less tolerance to cd ec 50 c cd 13 mg l 1 than to pb ec 50 c pb 30 mg l 1 li et al 2021 meanwhile the world health organization who 2013 has set guidance levels for drinking water quality for c cd and c pb at 0 001 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively results from our and li et al 2021 acute toxicity tests on lower organisms and the who exposure metrics for humans indicate that the hazards posed by cd in comparison to pb are of the same order of magnitude in each case albeit with lower metrics for cd i e lower levels being associated with greater acute toxicity for blm parameterization we used the live dead method to determine ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 and how these vary as a function of major cation free ion activities results for which are shown in fig 3 all four major cations have a protective effect on the toxicity of cd the results are different for pb only ca and mg have a protective effect on the toxicity of pb whereas increasing k and na appear to promote pb toxicity nonlinearly similar results have been found by an et al 2012 for cd and pb effects on the bacterium v fischeri these authors did not discuss their observations of this effect and omitted these alkaline metals in their blm parameterization kim et al 2002 observed that increases in ca and mg aqueous free ion decreased the bioaccumulated cd and pb in rice roots however k did not diminish cd and pb bioaccumulation the effect we observe for k and na on pb in fig 3c and d was also found for cu by de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 with daphnia magna these authors remarked upon the effect however gave no explanation of possible reasons behind it gao et al 2020 in studying the toxicity of cu to danio rerio reported the slopes for ec50s versus k and na activities were not differentiable from zero qu et al 2013 observed similar effects as we do here for k in experiments with cd on the bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum these authors theorized that cd might inhibit na k atpase in a variety of tissues such that increases in k will promote the excretion of na by cells making p phosphoreum more sensitive to cd this explanation seems reasonable but since qu et al 2013 did not vary na in their toxicity tests their explanation may not be suitable to explain why both k and na lack the protective effect in the case of our observations and those of other authors cited above the non protective effect found in an et al 2012 qu et al 2013 and de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 looks very similar to our results here in fig 3 c and d exhibiting a behaviour that is fitted better with a decreasing logarithmic function rather than a linear decrease since we do not have a suitable explanation for the effect that would also support cogent parameterization we do as others and omit k and na from calculations for k kbl and k nabl for pb since the effect has been observed for multiple metals and is not limited to bacteria it would seem to warrant more detailed investigation 3 2 2 bioluminescence inhibition toxicity measurement subsequent to characterizing cd and pb toxicity using the live dead method we were interested to see how the results based on bioreporter bioluminescence inhibition might compare representative results from which using the control medium are shown in fig 4 we generally find that dose response curves based on bioluminescence inhibition are quite similar to those obtained with the live dead method for instance when comparing toxicity in the same medium measured by the standard toxicity method live dead in fig 2 to the bioluminescence inhibition results in fig 4 we find that the ec 50 c cd is 5 2 mg l 1 and 7 1 mg l 1 for bioluminescence and live dead respectively and for ec 50 c pb the values are both 10 mg l 1 on average we find that the ec50 we obtain from bioluminescence inhibition for cd and pb is respectively 83 and 89 of the ec50 for these toxic metals that we obtain with the live dead method and that these differences are both significant at p 0 001 this difference might be viewed as reasonable since the uncertainties from sigmoidal curve fitting and also the endpoint of these two types of toxicity measurement methods are different regarding curve fitting there is more uncertainty regarding the exact concentration at which mrr0i occurs which will affect the curve fit with respect to the measurement endpoint live dead reflects cell membrane integrity while bioluminescence inhibition measures cellular metabolic status as bioluminescence is directly linked to respiration through the electron transport chain the inhibition of bacterial metabolism is manifested by attenuation of light emittance that occurs at the toxicity level of the tested substance girotti et al 2008 nonetheless considering that the generally accepted blm convention holding that predicted versus measured need to agree to within a factor of two was adopted in view of large uncertainties associated with many types of toxicity test agreement to within 83 or 89 hardly seems a notable difference even if statistically significant fig 5 shows ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 plotted as a function of major cation free ion activities for toxicity measurements using bioluminescence inhibition as for the live dead results in fig 3 bioluminescence inhibition experiments also show that k and na did not have a protective effect with respect to pb toxicity comparing cd pb toxicity measured by live dead fig 3 to bioluminescence inhibition fig 5 there is no systematic trend for differences in m and b however r cation described in section 2 3 is always smaller for live dead compared to the bioluminescence inhibition method the value r cation may be thought of as the rate of change of m toxicity as a function of the rate of change of major cation free ion activity m normalized to the toxicity of m in the absence of any given major cation b in physical terms a smaller r cation indicates that the protective effect of major cations per unit increase in major cation free ion activity is less as measured by bioluminescence inhibition as compared to live dead the key issue is how such differences affect model parameterization which we discuss in the next section 3 2 3 blm model parameterization per section 2 r cation values from the data in figs 3 and 5 were calculated and used to solve eq 2 for k cabl k mgbl k kbl and k nabl and then k mbl and f crit were then calculated using eq 3 fig 6 shows the logit of the r l d and r lum for cd and pb respectively plotted versus f for both the live dead a b and bioluminescence inhibition method c d reflecting the fits associated with final values of k mbl and f crit results for all parameters used to construct final blm toxicity models are given in table 2 along with parameters reported for cd and pb blm models developed for other test organisms the parameters k cation k mbl and f crit interactively determine the toxic effect within the framework of the blm higher k cation values indicate that major cations are more competitive with toxic metals for bl binding thus reducing toxicity higher k mbl values indicate that the toxic metal has a higher binding affinity for bl increasing toxicity a small f crit indicates that only a small fraction of the bl needs to be occupied to cause a toxic effect and the bioreporter will reach the toxic effect sooner as compared to an organism that models high f crit in theory k cation and k mbl for the same bioreporter by live dead and bioluminescence inhibition methods should be equal as the competitive binding ability of the major cations with toxic metals for the identical bl should be equal while one tailed t tests showed that k cation determined by live dead were greater than for bioluminescence inhibition this may result from various experimental uncertainties some of which we discussed previously because all of these parameters influence model predictions it is difficult to draw conclusions from pairwise comparison of like parameters in table 2 however we will return to a discussion of how they affect the overall model result later in the context of wqc 3 3 comparison of blm toxicity validation results for the live dead and bioluminescence inhibition methods fig 7 shows blm predicted versus measured ec 50 a c d 2 and ec 50 a p b 2 including results from back calculation and validation using live dead a b and bioluminescence inhibition c d methods back calculation is the process of verifying that predicted toxicities from the blm toxicity mode parameterization experiments in table 1 ca set mg set k set and na set correspond to measurements for validation three types of experiment were performed to verify that the model could predict resulting changes in toxicity 1 varying major cation concentrations randomly changes in inorganic components 2 varying ha concentrations changes in organic components 3 testing natural freshwater samples changes in inorganic and organic components in environmental matrices as with speciation agreement between measured and predicted values is quite strong and well within the factor of two that is the guideline for validation mae between predicted and measured for cd and pb were both calculated to be less than 10 of the mean measured ec50s and statistical power was greater than 0 8 with an α 0 05 the results in fig 7 demonstrate that the bioluminescence inhibition assay produces similarly well behaved validation results for both cd and pb when compared to the well known live dead toxicity bioassay and in practice we find that the bioluminescence inhibition assay is much faster and cheaper when compared to the live dead toxicity measurement 3 4 implications of two in one combination of speciation and toxicity mode in the context of water quality criteria for environmental risk assessment and ecotoxicity studies returning to the discussion of the blm toxicity mode parameters in table 2 we compare the outcomes i e the predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb from blm models for different organisms in the context of aquatic ecotoxicity wqcs as the blm was developed to assist with setting defensible wqc the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb that we predict here are acute criteria and for illustrative purposes we will consider results relative to the criterion maximum concentration cmc which is the highest concentration in ambient water that an aquatic community can tolerate for brief durations acute basis without resulting in an unacceptable adverse effect the cmc originates from genus mean acute values gmavs for aquatic ecotoxicity to calculate a cmc the typical approach is to rank available data for gmavs with the most sensitive genus having the lowest rank and from this assess the ec50 at p 5 5th percentile according to rank to obtain a final acute value fav since the fav is a mean ec50 i e a concentration at which 50 of a population experiences effects the fav is divided by two to obtain the cmc according to one set of guidance documentation on ambient freshwater wqc the cd gmavs range from 0 00419 mg l 1 for salvelinus char trout to 49 052 mg l 1 for chironomus midge us epa 2016b the cd freshwater fav wqc for cd at a hardness of 100 mg l 1 was reported to be 0 00573 mg l 1 however for cd the cmc was set at c cd 0 0018 mg l 1 us epa 2021 lower than the fav 2 to protect the commercially important rainbow trout for pb the gmav ranged from 0 3446 for gammarus amphipod crustacean to 570 1 mg l 1 for the tanytarsus midge us epa 1984 relatively fewer data were available for pb and the pb cmc for freshwater was set at c pb 0 065 mg l 1 at hardness of 100 mg l 1 us epa 2021 based on inference of the p 5 gmav in order to assess how useful blm models for the organisms listed in table 2 are in light of these wqc cmc we calculated predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb and plot these results in fig 8 along with the gmav for the most sensitive organism used in calculating fav wqcs the least sensitive organism s gmav from the same ranking the cmc and the lod of znta which we discuss in context further below the x axis in fig 8 places the ec50 results for the organisms in table 2 at the p n percentile where they fall among all the gmavs in the wqc guidance documentation in fig 8 we see immediately that although the znta blm parameters for bioluminescence inhibition are consistently lower than for live dead the predicted ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for the two are similar for both cd and pb in comparison to variations from other organisms even though the blm parameters for znta from live dead are in some cases statistically different from bioluminescence inhibition the outcome in terms of toxicity is a result of the interplay of all parameters hence the decreased protective effect of the lower k cation values for znta bioluminescence inhibition are in whole or part offset by the lower k mbl values found for bioluminescence inhibition comparing the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for znta from fig 8 to other organisms with reported cd pb blms the predicted ec50s for d rerio and especially eisenia fetida are higher the highest predicted ec 50 c cd is for e fetida which at 1 234 mg l 1 is over an order of magnitude higher than the highest cd gmav for chironomus thus plotted above p 100 in terms of blm parameters the highest f crit in table 2 is for e fetida being half again 50 higher than the average f crit in table 2 it is logical that e fetida is relatively insensitive work by jones et al 2009 and li et al 2009 shows that e fetida can compartmentalize sequester cd and pb increasing the organism s resistance to cd and pb toxicity d rerio meanwhile has documented heavy metal detoxification mechanisms such as glutathione s transferase protein expression tierbach et al 2018 the f crit of hordeum vulgare is the lowest compared to all the organisms in table 2 such that only 29 of bl sites need to complex with cd to cause a toxic effect for barley root elongation cd is absorbed and accumulated in plant tissues and as roots are the primary site of accumulation shi et al 2016 and references therein they are also a locus of toxic effects likely explaining the sensitivity and low f crit of h vulgare bioreporters may be engineered to tailor for sensitivity according to the needs of the intended application as zhang et al 2022 discussed many factors will affect whether a particular construct is fit for purpose with respect to the desired use for instance magrisso et al 2009 selected cupriavidus metallidurans strain ch34 with its high resistance to pb which was of benefit to their application studying soil contamination where very high pb concentrations may be present van der lelie and tibazarwa 2001 also listed many different mechanisms of metal resistance for different bacteria regarding results for bacteria in fig 8 v fischeri and znta have similar predicted ec 50 c cd s 12 mg l 1 for v fischeri 9 1 mg l 1 for znta live dead and 10 1 mg l 1 for znta bioluminescence inhibition however the v fischeri ec 50 c pb is 30 times lower on average than for znta 0 4 mg l 1 for v fischeri versus 12 6 mg l 1 for znta live dead and 12 8 mg l 1 for znta bioluminescence inhibition the insensitivity of v fischeri to cd in comparison to znta was not expected inasmuch as v fischeri is a lights off bioreporter hence a lower ec 50 c cd is consistent with needs for measurement of toxic response whereas znta as a lights on reporter should ideally be more resistant to toxic metals in order to measure speciation for environmental samples from contaminated sites for v fischeri ranjitha and karthy 2012 have reported that heavy metal resistance is highly variable and teodorovic et al 2009 have questioned the applicability of v fischeri as a useful screening method in assessing various environmental samples due to its low sensitivity to heavy metals as such the variability of results and insensitivity with regard to cd for v fischeri in fig 8 are consistent with literature reports while some organisms are more sensitive than others as compared to the fav for cd and pb and the ec 50 c cd and ec 50 c pb for sensitive species salvelinus and gammarus respectively none of the organisms for which blms have been developed could be regarded as fit for purpose for ambient aquatic toxic metal environmental risk assessment according to existing wqcs i e the metrics that matter even v fischeri for pb is above the p 10 while the cmc is set at p 5 this point relates to the application of any given blm a point that is often not explicitly addressed in many of the works whose model results we include in fig 8 such relatively insensitive organisms may still offer great applicability to ecotoxicological studies on soils as one example also one application is not always separable from others for instance the high concentrations of contaminants that may result in water from agricultural run off mentioned for our field samples from lake tai the potential range in sensitivity that might be desirable to span multiple applications is one attractive feature of using an organism such as znta although znta has a toxicity endpoint that is like the other blm organisms in fig 8 relatively insensitive for the aquatic ecotoxicological application the dual mode use capacity coupled with the low lod and higher ec50 of znta results in a measurement range rather than a single measurement endpoint conferring significantly greater flexibility in use it is an important point and it underscores the essential difference in the approach we take here namely that because lights on reporters are capable of measuring speciation and toxicity consistent with how the blm can be run in speciation and toxicity mode they are much less limited compared to effectively any other organisms in use for blm studies fig 9 graphically illustrates the dual mode response characteristic for cd and pb whereby at concentrations well below the ec50 the lights on znta is able to report levels of toxic cd and pb in a linear data not shown to log linear solid lines in fig 9 response pattern the relative ranges over which znta is able to report for cd and pb begin below the corresponding cmc for each metal compare the lods for these metals to the cmcs in fig 8 at the maximum of the log linear speciation range the response smoothly transitions to bioluminescence inhibition toxicity thus while other organisms used in blm work report toxicity as a single metric such as ec50 for any given water composition the lights on bioreporter is able to render results for an entire concentration range in the case of cd and pb starting from well below the respective favs for these metals up to the ec50 for the bioreporter while the cd and pb blms for other organisms listed in table 2 are not able to produce results for cd and pb levels that are environmentally relevant in terms of wqc znta and by extension other lights on reporters can measure speciation before reaching toxic effect consequently we may use the two in one speciation toxicity capability of lights on bioreporters as demonstrated here for znta to report at toxicity endpoints for many other organisms whose toxicity endpoints lie in the lod ec50 range of the bioreporter the values of cdblcrit and pbblcrit for znta that correspond to the reported ec50s us epa 1984 and 2016b of selected test organisms used in setting wqcs were calculated via speciation mode using the cdblcrit and pbblcrit for the aquatic ecotoxicy test organisms the corresponding ec50s for the base test media background ion composition in table 1 were determined and are plotted in fig 9 in units of total metal at which each organism s ec50 occurs i e cdblcrit and pbblcrit for the particular composition of the media these examples illustrate the manner in which znta is able to serve as a proxy for measurement or prediction of the ec50s based on speciation mode capabilities of znta in the case of znta specifically we may measure and with the validated blm predict cd and pb ec50s for any genus for which the gmav falls in the range of cmc p 50 or cmc p 55 respectively for cd and pb i e the most sensitive half of all species for which data has been reported in setting the wqc guidance values used for discussion in fig 8 while this range may exclude relatively insensitive species such as e fetida it includes the majority of sensitive species and these are precisely the species that are of interest with regard to wqc and environmental risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity 4 conclusions this is the first work to use a lights on bioreporter combining the study of speciation and toxicity simultaneously and within the blm framework for risk assessment of aquatic ecotoxicity our major findings include the following we verified a two in one functionality for the lights on bioreporter including speciation and toxicity measurement and prediction validated blm the ability of the bioreporter to measure speciation has implications for wqc and environmental management toxicity endpoints for other cd and pb blms reported in literature average p 71 and p 44 rank percentile sensitivity i e insensitive for cd and pb respectively and in consequence could not be regarded in any context as fit for purpose for toxic metal environmental risk assessment according to wqcs based on protection of 95 of aquatic species p 5 with the low lods of cd and pb for the bioreporter below the relevant cd and pb cmcs and the ability to measure speciation in addition to toxicity the bioreporter is able to measure the speciated values of cd and pb that correspond to the toxicity endpoints of the most sensitive half of species from the cmc wqc to the p 50 the results reported here for the lights on bioreporter as a two in one bioreporter for cd and pb measurements and blm predictions are theoretically and in all reasonable expectation generalizable to any lights on bioreporter because these reporters are typically designed and constructed for the purposes of measuring environmental contamination which entails 1 that lights on bioreporter lods are low enough to be environmentally relevant and 2 that the lights on bioreporter resistance to the target analyte s also enables speciation measurement in higher concentration ranges that are often found at contaminated sites perhaps most importantly in being able to represent and report on endpoints for a wide range of other species the two in one approach which is also high throughput methodology has potential to substitute rapid testing in many instances where traditional toxicity testing is both limited to a single endpoint such as ec50 and is also more time consuming and expensive a future direction for this research would include work with other reporters toxic analytes and work to test proof of principle calibrating lights on reporters to chronic toxicity endpoints declaration of competing interest

16038,migratory geese could influence the microbiological water quality however their impacts on pathogen dynamics remain largely unknown in this study we analyzed the population dynamics of campylobacter and arcobacter group bacteria agb in a freshwater lake in japan over two years the bacteria were quantified by using both culture dependent and independent methods the potential sources of these bacteria were examined by a high throughput flaa sequencing approach campylobacter was abundantly detected both by culture dependent and independent methods in the lake especially when migratory geese were present in the lake high throughput flaa sequencing suggests that geese were the likely source of campylobacter in the lake the viable population of campylobacter exceeds the concentrations that can potentially cause 10 4 infections per person per year when water is used to grow fresh vegetables the occurrence of agb on the other hand was not directly related to the population of migratory geese agb were not detected in geese fecal samples diverse agb flaa genotypes occurred in the lake over multiple seasons our results suggest that agb likely comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population of the lake and grow in response to high nutrient warm temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake geese therefore can indirectly impact the agb population by providing nutrients to cause eutrophication and lower the dissolved oxygen concentration since geese travel long distance and disperse their fecal microbiota and nutrients to wide areas they may have significant impacts on water quality and public health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords campylobacter arcobacter water quality fecal pollution migratory birds microbial source tracking 1 introduction contamination of water with pathogens can cause human diseases discharge from wastewater treatment plants and the leakage from septic systems are important sources of pathogen contamination epa 2004 however non human sources such as domestic and wild animals and waterfowls can also release human pathogens through their feces elmberg et al 2017 wahlström et al 2003 among those migratory waterfowls could contribute to the occurrence and spread of pathogens such as campylobacter spp in water environments ishii et al 2014 lu et al 2013 campylobacter spp are among the most common bacterial pathogens with 96 million estimated cases in 2010 kaakoush et al 2015 the number of campylobacteriosis cases has increased in many areas in the world kaakoush et al 2015 and is expected to increase further due in part to the ongoing climate change kuhn et al 2020 the most common hosts for campylobacter spp are avian species including commercial poultry species e g chickens and turkeys and waterfowl e g geese elmberg et al 2017 pacha et al 1988 but they are also found in other animals such as cattle pigs and dairy cows silva et al 2011 campylobacter species cannot grow but can survive well in various environments such as fresh and coastal waters and sediment after they are released from their primary hosts e g birds animals thus the environments can act as self perpetuating reservoirs of campylobacter infection cycling between wild domestic and avian animals jones 2001 because there are reported cases of water related campylobacter outbreaks it is important to clarify the ecology of campylobacter in the water environment ishii 2019 pitkänen 2013 similar to pathogenic campylobacter species some arcobacter group bacteria i e bacteria classified as arcobacter spp until the recent reclassification to six genera of arcobacter aliiarcobacter pseudoarcobacter haloarcobacter malacobacter and poseidonibacter by pérez cataluña et al pérez cataluña et al 2018 hereafter called as agb can also cause campylobacteriosis like diseases to humans collado and figueras 2011 because of their similar symptoms some agb infections could have been misclassified as campylobacteriosis agb are considered emerging human pathogens yet their significance is largely underestimated due to inappropriate detection and identification snelling et al 2006 in addition to humans some agb can cause diseases e g abortion to domestic animals unlike many campylobacter spp agb can survive and grow in various environments such as soil water and sediment at ambient air and lower temperature 15 30 c conditions collado and figueras 2011 agb have been frequently and abundantly detected in wastewater fisher et al 2014 kristensen et al 2020 levican et al 2016 in addition the occurrence of agb was highly correlated with human fecal pollution collado et al 2008 some agb can also occur in avian species including chickens turkeys and geese çelik and otlu 2020 therefore waterfowl may also be the source of agb contamination in water environments lakes used by migratory birds can be contaminated with campylobacter agb and other pathogens we previously detected various enteric pathogens in a freshwater lake that is used as a stopover site for migratory greater white fronted goose anser albifrons by using the high throughput microfluidic quantitative pcr qpcr approach ishii et al 2014 concentrations of these pathogens greatly changed over time most likely due to changes in the abundance of their potential source e g geese among the pathogens detected campylobacter spp were frequently and abundantly detected in the lake water the occurrence of agb in the lake was unknown because agb were not included in the list of target pathogens for the microfluidic qpcr ishii et al 2014 because the lake water is used for irrigation to the surrounding and downstream agricultural fields contamination of the lake water with campylobacter pathogen is of serious food safety and public health concern to assess the health risks of the water it is essential to have a number of live pathogens however qpcr can detect signals both from dead and live cells while the use of ethidium monoazide ema or propidium monoazide pma before dna extraction and pcr can minimize the pcr signals from dead cells zeng et al 2016 these approaches may not function well when samples contain a high concentration of suspended solids ss varma et al 2009 which is commonly seen in various natural systems such as eutrophic lakes ishii et al 2014 for these situations culture dependent approaches are useful to verify the presence of viable pathogens while migratory geese are the likely source of campylobacter contamination in the lake tested in our previous study ishii et al 2014 it is not confirmed by genotyping such as multilocus sequence typing mlst dingle et al 2001 and flagellin gene flaa sequencing meinersmann et al 1997 we previously developed a campylobacter characterization method by sequencing the flagellin gene flaa in high throughput zhang et al 2018 by comparing the flaa genotypes detected in water samples and those from known animals e g geese we would be able to identify the sources of campylobacter pathogens a similar approach can be also used to identify the sources of agb consequently the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the temporal dynamics of campylobacter and agb in the lake water by culture dependent and independent analyses 2 identify the potential sources of these potential pathogens by sequencing flaa amplicons and 3 analyze the environmental variables influencing the occurrences and diversities of campylobacter and agb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study site is lake miyajimanuma

october ishii et al 2014 because of this lake miyajimanuma is registered as s ramsar site and protected by the ministry of the environment japan japan ministry of the environment 2015 in addition to geese other waterfowls e g swans ducks and animals e g deer foxes racoons also use the lake environment there are small influent streams to the lake which contained water discharged from surrounding agricultural fields mostly for rice and soybean cultivation ishii et al 2014 lake effluent is used for irrigation of rice paddy fields large livestock facilities are absent near or upstream of the

ma water filtration was done in four replicates following filtration three out of four replicates were used for culture independent analyses while another replicate was used for culture based analysis each membrane was cut into four pieces and placed in a 50 ml conical tube after adding 20 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 containing 0 1 gelatin ishii et al 2014 zhang and ishii 2018 the tubes were horizontally placed on a vortex mixer and vigorously shaken at the maximum speed for 15 min to detach cells from the membranes the resultant cell suspensions were used for the culture dependent and independent analyses as described below for culture independent analyses the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4 c after removing the supernatant the pellet was re suspended with 1 ml pbs and transferred to a new 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min and used for dna extraction with dneasy powersoil kit qiagen according to the manufacturer s instruction dna was also extracted from geese fecal samples 0 2 g by using a qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen all of the extracted dna samples were stored at 20 c until

5 enumeration and isolation of culturable campylobacter and agb campylobacter and agb were also quantified and isolated from water and fecal samples by using culture dependent mpn method similar but slightly different approaches were used for samples collected in 2013 and 2014 for water samples collected in 2013 five aliquots of three different volumes 2 5 ml 0 25 ml and 0 025 ml of the cell suspensions in 20 ml pbs as described above were spiked into 22 5 ml 5 ml and 5 ml respectively of bolton broth oxoid supplemented with laked horse blood remel and antibiotics 20 µg ml cefoperazone 20 µg ml trimethoprim 20 µg ml vancomycin and 50 µg ml cycloheximide we accidentally did not add antibiotics when processing samples collected in april and may 2013 for fecal samples collected in 2013 the cell suspension was prepared by vigorously mixing 1 g samples with 9 ml of pbs from which one ml each was inoculated into 9 ml bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics these test tubes were incubated at 37 c for 4 h followed by 42 c for 44 h under microaerobic conditions created by using anaeropak microaero mitsubishi gas chemical tokyo japan for the selective growth of campylobacter we accidentally incubated them at 37 c for 48 h for samples collected in june and july 2013 resulting in the growth of agb for water samples collected in 2014 ten aliquots of three different volumes 1 ml 0 1 ml and 0 01 ml of the cell suspensions were spiked into 9 ml 5 ml and 5 ml respectively of bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics the resulting 30 test tubes were divided into two sets set a and b each containing 15 tubes 5 tubes 3 dilutions for fecal samples collected in 2014 one ml of fecal suspension prepared as described above was inoculated into two tubes set a and b containing 9 ml bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics set a tubes were incubated at 37 c for 4 h followed by 42 c for 44 h under microaerobic conditions for the selective growth of campylobacter while set b tubes were incubated at 37 c for 48 h under microaerobic conditions for the growth of agb after incubation a loopful of culture ca 10 µl was streaked onto modified campylobacter blood free agar m ccda medium oxoid supplemented with 32 µg ml cefoperazone and 10 µg ml amphotericin b and incubated under microaerobic conditions at the same incubation temperatures used for enrichment with bolton broth e g 42 c and 37 c for set a and b cultures respectively for 48 h colonies formed on the m ccda medium were re streaked on a new m ccda medium and further incubated to obtain well isolated colonies colonies were confirmed as being campylobacter or agb by sequencing the 16s rrna gene fragment amplified with c412f and c1228r primers linton et al 1996 table s1 as described previously ishii et al 2006 agb colonies were further identified at the species level by using species specific multiplex pcr for al butzleri al cryaerophilus and al skirrowii as described previously houf et al 2000 tubes positive for campylobacter or agb were counted and used for the mpn calculation with the 5 tubes 3 dilutions mpn table as described previously ishii et al 2006 2 6 flaa svr sequencing for the campylobacter and agb isolates all campylobacter and agb isolates purified from the colonies on m ccda medium 248 and 79 isolates respectively were genotyped by sequencing the flaa short variable region svr with the primers shown in table s1 the primer set campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r can amplify ca 400 bp flaa fragment from various campylobacter species zhang et al 2018 the primer set acro flaa 229f and arco flaa 715r were newly designed in this study by using degeprime hugerth et al 2014 to amplify flaa fragment of ca 486 bp from various agb species the pcr reaction mixture 20 μl contained 1 ex taq buffer takara bio 0 5 μm of each primer 0 2 mm of each dntp 0 4 u of ex taq dna polymerase takara bio and 1 μl of dna template pcr was performed using a veriti 96 well thermal cycler with the following conditions initial annealing at 95 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 c for 30 sec 52 c 55 c for arco flaa primers for 30 sec and 72 c for 30 sec after the final extension at 72 c for 7 min the pcr mixtures were stored at 4 c the pcr products were purified and sequenced by the sanger method as described previously zhang et al 2018 the flaa svr nucleotide sequences of the isolates were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by using mothur schloss et al 2009 when isolates obtained from water samples had the identical flaa svr sequences i e those clustered together into the same otus at 100 sequence similarity to those obtained from fecal samples these water isolates were identified as of geese origin 2 7 high throughput sequencing of flaa svr from water and geese feces the flaa svr of campylobacter and agb were also directly amplified and sequenced from water and geese fecal samples without culture isolation as described previously zhang et al 2018 in brief flaa svr was amplified from the dna extracted from water and fecal samples by using the flaa specific primers tagged with illumina overhang adaptor sequences table s1 the purified pcr products were tagged with sample unique index and illumina adapter sequences at their 5 end by using nextera xt index kit v2 illumina after agarose gel electrophoresis pcr products 500 600 bp were excised from the gel and purified using the fastgene gel pcr purification kit nippon genetics tagged amplicons from multiple samples were pooled and sequenced by illumina miseq platform in 300 bp paired end sequencing reaction with v3 reagent kit illumina according to the manufacturer s instruction sequence data were processed using the shi7 program al ghalith et al 2018 as described previously zhang et al 2018 in brief we removed illumina adaptor and primer sequences assembled paired end sequences trimmed qc value less than 33 of sequencing reads the resulting sequences were further filtered by the size of the expected flaa amplicon length 355 370 bp for campylobacter and 368 448 bp for agb and by removing singletons sequence denoising was done by systematically varied two parameters the number of duplicated reads d and the sequence alignment similarity s of operational taxonomic units otus to identify the largest number of duplicates and the highest sequence alignment similarity to cluster sequences to otus that represent 95 of all length trimmed amplicon data the optimized d and s values for the campylobacter flaa and arcobacter flaa analyses were identified as 50 and 98 and 10 and 98 respectively the representative sequences for each otu were selected by using burst aligner al ghalith and knights 2020 2 8 phylogenetic and statistical analyses the flaa sequences obtained by culture dependent and independent analyses were combined for phylogenetic analysis we first clustered the flaa sequences obtained by each analysis into otus at 98 similarity by using mothur representative sequences for each otu were combined aligned with references by using clustalw and used to generate a phylogenetic tree by using the maximum likelihood method with mega ver 10 1 8 kumar et al 2018 the tree was trimmed using fig tree ver 1 4 4 https github com rambaut figtree releases diversities of campylobacter spp and agb were analyzed based on the flaa sequences obtained by miseq by using r version 4 0 2 https www r project org with vegan oksanen et al 2019 and phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 packages for the analysis of alpha diversity of the campylobacter and agb flaa the sequences obtained by miseq were rarefied to 100 and 1000 reads per sample respectively principal coordinates analysis pcoa with bray curtis distance matrices were used to visualize the dissimilarities in the microbial communities by year and season differences in microbial community structures were tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap was done using bray curtis distance matrices to identify environmental variables associated with the patterns in microbial communities anderson and willis 2003 variables for the cap models were selected by forward selection method by using the ordistep function of vegan only variables that were significant p 0 05 by permanova remained in the final model statistical significances in the other quantitative data e g water quality data obtained in this study were tested with the analysis of variance anova at alpha 0 05 by using r version 4 0 2 generalized linear model glm was used to identify the environmental variables that can explain the levels of campylobacter and agb 2 9 nucleotide sequence accession numbers the flaa sequences of campylobacter and agb isolates identified in this study were deposited to ddbj embl genbank databases under accession no mg694324 mg694346 and mk495476 mk495700 for campylobacter sp isolates and mk505487 mk505565 for agb isolates miseq data were also deposited under the bioproject accession no prjna423240 and prjna509378 for campylobacter flaa and agb flaa respectively 3 results 3 1 general water quality of lake miyajimanuma lake miyajimanuma is a small and shallow lake in an agricultural area mostly for rice and soybean productions the peak geese population during their migration seasons ranged from 20 000 to 70 000 birds day in 2012 and 2013 fig s2 the geese population size was larger in the spring migration than the fall migration in both years goose specific mst marker was detected in the lake water samples during the geese migration season fig s2 whereas the mst markers for human cow pig chicken and deer were not detected suggesting that the major source of fecal contamination in the lake was geese the level of e coli was also high when geese were present in the lake table 1 although the highest e coli levels in the fall were seen after the geese migration peaked fig s2 this is probably because of the water stagnation and the survival of e coli after geese left nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural area and geese fecal inputs likely caused relatively high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations often exceeding 5 mg n l and 1 mg p l in the lake water table 1 algal blooms occurred during summer and fall months likely resulting in increased ph and ss and cod concentrations table 1 flow volume was generally higher in spring than in the other months most likely because of the snowmelt table 1 3 2 temporal dynamics of campylobacter and agb populations in the lake the population of culturable campylobacter spp and agb were measured by the mpn method fig 1 bacteria were first enriched in bolton broth and then isolated on an m ccda medium the identity of the isolates was confirmed by sequencing the 16s rrna gene with the sangar method and agb species specific multiplex pcr our primary culture target in 2013 was campylobacter spp although we could not enrich them in spring 2013 samples most likely due to the lack of appropriate antibiotics for april and may 2013 samples and the use of inappropriate incubation temperature 37 c for 48 h for june and july 2013 samples when we added antibiotics and used the appropriate incubation temperature 42 c we detected high levels of campylobacter spp during the geese migration seasons in fall 2013 spring 2014 and fall 2014 as a result of the culture procedure a total of 163 campylobacter sp isolates were obtained from the water samples table s2 based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis most of these isolates were closely related to c jejuni with some related to c coli and c lari fig s3 similar to the results obtained from the mpn method campylobacter spp were abundantly detected in spring and fall by qpcr fig 1 their concentration was comparable to those obtained by the mpn suggesting that many of the campylobacter spp detected were viable occasionally we did not detect campylobacter by qpcr when they were detected by mpn e g spring 2014 this is probably because the detection limit of qpcr was larger than that of mpn in this study 40 copies l vs 1 8 mpn l during the spring and fall migration seasons the levels of campylobacter spp in the lake water exceeded the acceptable concentration of c jejuni to grow fresh vegetables 0 46 log cells l which is defined as the pathogen concentration that can cause infection at a probability of 10 4 infections per person per year ishii et al 2014 campylobacter spp were more abundant in the fall than spring migration seasons in 2014 most likely due to the washout of the pathogen from the lake by snowmelt the abundance of campylobacter spp was low 1 8 mpn l during summer months june to august and in september before the arrival of geese based on the glm analysis no environmental variables significantly p 0 05 explained the levels of campylobacter in the lake although the temperature and geese population had relatively small p values 0 0648 and 0 0924 respectively in contrast to campylobacter populations agb were detected in the lake water regardless of the presence of geese fig 1 similar results were obtained by qpcr but the agb concentrations measured by qpcr were larger than those obtained by the mpn method likely reflecting the broad reactivity of the qpcr assays to various agb species a total of 79 agb isolates were obtained from the water samples table s3 based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis and the agb species specific multiplex pcr houf et al 2000 all of these isolates were closely related to aliiarcobacter butzleri fig s4 based on the glm analysis temperature and ph significantly p 0 05 explained the levels of culturable agb in the lake whereas the other variables did not p 0 1 3 3 detection and isolation of campylobacter spp from geese fecal samples campylobacter spp were also detected and isolated from the geese fecal samples collected around the lake however no agb was detected both by culture dependent and culture independent analysis higher recovery of campylobacter was seen when elevated incubation temperature 42 c was used 54 positives out of 205 samples 26 3 than when 37 c was used 31 positives out of 181 samples 17 0 table s4 except for one case all fecal samples positive for campylobacter at 37 c were also campylobacter positive at 42 c a total of 85 campylobacter sp isolates were obtained from the fecal samples all of which were related to c jejuni 3 4 flaa typing of campylobacter and arcobacter group isolates two hundred forty eight campylobacter isolates 163 and 85 isolates obtained from water and fecal samples respectively and 79 agb isolates obtained from water samples were characterized by flaa sequencing done with the sangar method the 248 campylobacter isolates were grouped into 125 genotypes based on their flaa sequences isolates in the same genotype have identical flaa sequences i e 100 sequence similarity about 20 32 out of 163 isolates of the isolates obtained from water samples were grouped together with fecal isolates and therefore were considered as likely being from geese the proportion of the isolates identified as being from geese was larger in the isolates obtained in 2014 33 28 out of 84 isolates than those obtained in 2013 5 4 out of 79 isolates fig 2 this might be related to the number of campylobacter isolates obtained from fecal samples 23 and 62 isolates were obtained from geese fecal samples collected in 2013 and 2014 respectively table s4 some campylobacter flaa genotypes appeared at more than one sampling date table s5 for example genotype represented by isolate 14 13 occurred in the fecal samples collected in october 2013 october 2014 and november 2014 and in the water samples collected in april august october and november 2014 similarly genotypes represented by isolates 14 143 14 175 14 202 14 225 14 248 occurred over months or years the 79 agb isolates were grouped into 40 genotypes based on their flaa sequences with 100 sequence similarity as a cutoff all these flaa sequences were closely related to those of al butzleri fig s5 in agreement with the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis fig s4 similar to campylobacter some agb genotypes appeared over time table s6 for example agb genotype represented by isolate 13 12 occurred in the water samples collected in june july and september 2013 and in june september and november 2014 similarly the agb genotype represented by isolate 14 74 occurred in two different months july and october in 2014 3 5 high throughput campylobacter flaa sequencing the diversity of campylobacter was assessed by sequencing the flaa fragments amplified with campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r primers a total of 488 521 campylobacter flaa reads were obtained for 148 samples 25 water and 123 fecal samples with a mean of 3 300 reads and a median of 933 reads per sample sequence reads were rarefied to 100 reads for the analysis of alpha diversity after rarefication the read coverages were 0 92 and 0 98 for water and geese samples respectively the flaa alpha diversity was higher in water samples than fecal samples p 0 05 by anova table s7 within water samples no significant differences were detected in the diversity index values between seasons spring vs fall and years 2013 vs 2014 the 488 521 flaa sequences were clustered into 121 otus at 98 sequence similarity among those 30 otus were more closely related to helicobacter spp than campylobacter spp based on the phylogenetic analysis but the other otus 91 otus were closely related to campylobacter spp fig 3 most of these campylobacter flaa sequences 97 88 out of 91 otus were highly similar 98 to those obtained by culture based approach fig 3 among the 121 flaa otus 87 of them 105 otus were shared between water samples and geese fecal samples while 4 5 otus and 9 11 otus of otus specifically occurred in water and geese fecal samples respectively among the 110 otus detected in water samples 97 otus 88 occurred over time most of which 95 92 otus were also detected in geese fecal samples fig 4 interestingly many of the flaa otus that appeared more abundantly in geese fecal samples than water samples 30 otus highlighted in fig 4 were more closely related to flaa of helicobacter than those of campylobacter 3 6 high throughput agb related flaa sequencing diversity of agb was also assessed by sequencing the flaa fragments amplified with acro flaa 229f and arco flaa 715r primers a total of 198 451 high quality agb related flaa reads were obtained for 47 water samples with a mean of 4 222 reads and a median 2 437 of reads per sample these flaa sequences were clustered into 599 otus at 98 sequence similarity phylogenetically diverse agb related flaa sequences were obtained fig s5 most of the flaa sequences obtained by miseq were related to those of aliiarcobacter and pseudoarcobacter while some flaa otu 163 and otu 164 were more closely related to those of malaciobacter a part of agb in addition some flaa otus in the aliiarcobacter pseudoarcobacter cluster did not have close culture representatives based on the flaa phylogenic analysis indicating the presence of previously uncharacterized agb in the study site in contrast to the analysis of campylobacter flaa agb related flaa obtained by miseq were different from those obtained by the culture based method for the analysis of alpha diversity sequence reads were rarefied to 1000 reads after rarefication the read coverages were 0 92 for all samples the alpha diversity of agb related flaa was higher in water samples collected in spring than those collected in summer or fall p 0 05 by anova table s8 beta diversity of agb also varied by season and year based on the pcoa with the flaa data fig s7 community dissimilarities among different seasons spring summer and fall and years 2013 and 2014 were supported by permanova p 0 01 canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap was used to clarify the relationship between environmental variables and the patterns in microbial communities fig 5 six variables ph temperature flux cod ss and do were selected to build the final cap model based on the forward selection and permanova p 0 05 suggesting that these environmental variables might have influenced the community structure of the agb 4 discussion 4 1 temporal dynamics of campylobacter in the lake water migration and gathering of geese negatively influenced the lake water quality as shown by the elevated levels of e coli and campylobacter in this and other studies ishii et al 2014 vogel et al 2013 campylobacter spp occurred in spring and fall especially during and after the geese migration seasons they were mostly undetected in summer when geese were absent in the lake suggesting that geese might have released campylobacter to the lake water most of the campylobacter in the lake were likely viable because similar campylobacter concentrations were obtained by culture dependent and independent methods this is probably because the bacteria had been released from the source e g geese to the water within a short time e g days campylobacter spp are known to survive well in natural lake water for up to one week especially at cold temperatures korhonen and martikalnon 1991 similar campylobacter spp concentration 2 4 log copies l was also obtained in the same lake in 2012 ishii et al 2014 as well as in the other sites during the bird migration season lu et al 2013 most of the campylobacter sp isolates obtained in this study were related to c jejuni similar to other studies colles et al 2008 llarena et al 2015 this is of human health concern because c jejuni is the major species that cause human campylobacteriosis jones 2001 silva et al 2011 a few isolates of c coli and c lari were also obtained in this study these species are also known to cause human diseases jones 2001 silva et al 2011 the concentration of the viable campylobacter spp in the lake water was high enough 0 46 log cells l to cause diseases at a probability of 10 4 infections per person per year if used to grow fresh vegetables ishii et al 2014 currently rice and soybean are the major crops grown in the agricultural fields around lake miyajimanuma fresh vegetables are not cultivated for commercial purposes however if farmers want to grow fresh vegetables they should treat the lake water e g by filtration or disinfection prior to use in irrigation to protect human health 4 2 source identification of campylobacter spp in this study about 26 of fecal samples from greater white fronted geese were positive for campylobacter spp which is similar to previous studies 12 32 done with canada geese branta canadensis in north america van dyke et al 2010 and canada geese and barnacle geese branta leucopsis in europe llarena et al 2015 wahlström et al 2003 our previous qpcr analysis also suggests a similar frequency of campylobacter jejuni occurrences 16 in the feces of greater white fronted geese in japan ishii et al 2014 these results suggest that the frequency of campylobacter occurrences in geese were similar across a wide range of geographical areas and among different goose species identical flaa genotypes occurred in both water and fecal samples indicating that campylobacter originated from geese was present in the lake water it is also possible that geese acquired campylobacter spp by ingesting the lake water however since campylobacter was not detected in the lake before the arrival of geese the original host of the water isolates is most likely geese some flaa genotypes occurred over months or years indicating that they were carried and spread by geese survived in the water environment and re infected geese these results suggest that lakes can act as temporal reservoirs of campylobacter infection for geese because tens of thousands of geese gather in lake miyajimanuma the lake can serve as a place for geese to share and exchange campylobacter spp based on the flaa typing of the campylobacter isolates only about 20 of the isolates obtained from the water samples were identified as being from geese the sources of the remaining isolates are unknown probably because our known source flaa library was not large enough to capture campylobacter diversity similar to this study a low rate of source apportionment 32 was reported in culture based source tracking of e coli which is also genetically highly diverse ishii et al 2007 it is also possible that other sources such as cattle may contribute to the release of campylobacter as other studies suggested guy et al 2018 however this is unlikely in the site we studied because 1 there are no ruminant or chicken farms near lake miyajimanuma 2 the mst markers for human cow pig chicken and deer were undetected and 3 campylobacter was undetected or very low when geese were absent in the lake we could not exclude the possibility of the contributions of other waterfowls such as swans and ducks as well as animals such as foxes and raccoons which are present around the lake nonetheless since their population sizes are much smaller than that of geese in the study area their contribution to the lake water contamination is likely smaller than that of geese to capture more diverse flaa genotypes present in the lake water we used the high throughput flaa sequencing approach with the illumina miseq platform zhang et al 2018 in addition to most of the flaa sequences obtained by the culture based approach the high throughput flaa sequencing approach detected more diverse flaa genotypes from the water samples suggesting that this approach is suitable to analyze the genetic diversity of campylobacter spp most otus detected in water samples were also detected in geese fecal samples further supporting the geese origin of campylobacter spp in the lake this study shows that the high throughput flaa sequencing approach is useful to identify the potential sources of campylobacter zhang et al 2018 similar to other sequence based microbial source tracking mst e g for bacteroides approaches unno et al 2010 unno et al 2018 4 3 occurrence of helicobacter in geese and water we frequently and abundantly detected helicobacter related flaa sequences in geese fecal samples the primers we used campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r were originally designed to amplify diverse flaa fragments from the genus campylobacter zhang et al 2018 however they were likely not specific enough to campylobacter nonetheless the results we found have important implications for water quality monitoring and mst similar to this study the helicobacter 16s rrna gene was previously abundantly detected in geese fecal samples and based on that geese specific mst marker gfd was designed green et al 2012 however this study showed that helicobacter related flaa was not frequently detected in the water samples contaminated with geese feces this indicates that geese borne helicobacter does not survive well in water environments at least as compared to campylobacter spp decay of mst markers is important when interpreting the mst results zhang et al 2019 if geese mst marker gfd decays faster than pathogens such as campylobacter spp we may underestimate the health risks of water contaminated with geese feces therefore the decay kinetics of the geese marker gfd should be examined in the future 4 4 temporal dynamics of agb in the lake water the pattern of agb occurrence was very different from that of campylobacter spp culturable agb were detected more abundantly in summer than in spring and fall suggesting that the occurrence of agb was not directly related to the migration of geese this is also supported by the no detection of agb in geese fecal samples both by culture dependent and independent methods however this contradicts the previous report in which various agb were enriched from domesticated geese çelik and otlu 2020 the difference may be due in part to the different goose species and or the use of different culture media and incubation conditions 30 c in çelik and otlu 2020 vs 37 c in our study our medium also contained multiple antibiotics originally designed for the selective enrichment of campylobacter spp which are different from those recommended for the selective enrichment of agb houf et al 2001 more agb specific isolation methods may be necessary to verify the presence of agb in wild geese nonetheless since agb related flaa and 16s rrna gene i e arco f r assay designed by shrestha et al 2018 were not detected by qpcr in our geese fecal samples geese are probably not the major reservoir of agb at least in the studied area all of our agb isolates obtained from water samples were closely related to al butzleri this however might be related to the use of culture enrichment a previous study showed that the enrichment culture technique is biased more toward al butzleri than other agb species levican et al 2016 when culture independent flaa analysis was used more diverse agb related flaa were detected 4 5 factors influencing the occurrence of agb in contrast to the previous study collado et al 2008 no correlation was found between agb abundance and fecal indicator e coli levels the study site is mostly an agricultural area and there are no wastewater effluent discharge and animal farms nearby as a result potential sources of agb are currently unknown it is probable that these agb are of environmental origin and comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population lake miyajimanuma is a shallow eutrophic lake with high nutrient c n and p concentrations the temperature of the lake can exceed 20 c during the summer months the occurrence of algal cyanobacterial blooms in the lake could lower the do concentrations all of these conditions are favorable for agb to grow collado and figueras 2011 among these environmental variables temperature and ph significantly explain the levels of culturable agb based on the glm analysis since ph can increase as a result of algal cyanobacterial photosynthesis raven et al 2020 this suggests the potential influence of algal cyanobacterial blooms on the occurrence of agb these environmental conditions can also shape the populations of agb six variables were specifically identified in this study including ph water temperature water flux cod ss and do this is reasonable as the tolerance to o2 and ph can vary by agb species collado and figueras 2011 these results suggest that we may need to fundamentally improve the lake water quality to mitigate the agb problem in the lake for example by changing the flow of the influent streams so that the agriculture derived nutrients will not run into the lake or by dredging p rich sediments from the lake bormans et al 2016 4 6 implications this study shows that migratory geese are the likely source of campylobacter in lake miyajimanuma since these geese travel long distance and disperse their fecal microbiota to wide areas campylobacter contamination can also occur in other lakes some of which are used for recreational activities appropriate management of the lake water activities therefore should be done to protect public health arcobacter group bacteria on the other hand are likely not of geese origin geese however can indirectly influence the population of agb by increasing the levels of nutrients in the water environments the population of agb in eutrophic lakes and rivers has not been examined well however this study implies that agb may proliferate in these environments even when the input of human sewage is absent further research is necessary to clarify the ecology of this emerging pathogen in the water environment 5 conclusions campylobacter was abundantly detected both by culture dependent and independent methods in lake miyajimanuma especially when migratory geese were present in the lake geese were the likely source of campylobacter based on the high throughput flaa sequencing analysis the occurrence of arcobacter group bacteria was not directly related to the migratory behavior of geese arcobacter group bacteria likely comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population of the lake and grow in response to high nutrient warm temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake geese fecal inputs are one of the major causes of lake eutrophication which influences the population structure of

16038,migratory geese could influence the microbiological water quality however their impacts on pathogen dynamics remain largely unknown in this study we analyzed the population dynamics of campylobacter and arcobacter group bacteria agb in a freshwater lake in japan over two years the bacteria were quantified by using both culture dependent and independent methods the potential sources of these bacteria were examined by a high throughput flaa sequencing approach campylobacter was abundantly detected both by culture dependent and independent methods in the lake especially when migratory geese were present in the lake high throughput flaa sequencing suggests that geese were the likely source of campylobacter in the lake the viable population of campylobacter exceeds the concentrations that can potentially cause 10 4 infections per person per year when water is used to grow fresh vegetables the occurrence of agb on the other hand was not directly related to the population of migratory geese agb were not detected in geese fecal samples diverse agb flaa genotypes occurred in the lake over multiple seasons our results suggest that agb likely comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population of the lake and grow in response to high nutrient warm temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake geese therefore can indirectly impact the agb population by providing nutrients to cause eutrophication and lower the dissolved oxygen concentration since geese travel long distance and disperse their fecal microbiota and nutrients to wide areas they may have significant impacts on water quality and public health graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords campylobacter arcobacter water quality fecal pollution migratory birds microbial source tracking 1 introduction contamination of water with pathogens can cause human diseases discharge from wastewater treatment plants and the leakage from septic systems are important sources of pathogen contamination epa 2004 however non human sources such as domestic and wild animals and waterfowls can also release human pathogens through their feces elmberg et al 2017 wahlström et al 2003 among those migratory waterfowls could contribute to the occurrence and spread of pathogens such as campylobacter spp in water environments ishii et al 2014 lu et al 2013 campylobacter spp are among the most common bacterial pathogens with 96 million estimated cases in 2010 kaakoush et al 2015 the number of campylobacteriosis cases has increased in many areas in the world kaakoush et al 2015 and is expected to increase further due in part to the ongoing climate change kuhn et al 2020 the most common hosts for campylobacter spp are avian species including commercial poultry species e g chickens and turkeys and waterfowl e g geese elmberg et al 2017 pacha et al 1988 but they are also found in other animals such as cattle pigs and dairy cows silva et al 2011 campylobacter species cannot grow but can survive well in various environments such as fresh and coastal waters and sediment after they are released from their primary hosts e g birds animals thus the environments can act as self perpetuating reservoirs of campylobacter infection cycling between wild domestic and avian animals jones 2001 because there are reported cases of water related campylobacter outbreaks it is important to clarify the ecology of campylobacter in the water environment ishii 2019 pitkänen 2013 similar to pathogenic campylobacter species some arcobacter group bacteria i e bacteria classified as arcobacter spp until the recent reclassification to six genera of arcobacter aliiarcobacter pseudoarcobacter haloarcobacter malacobacter and poseidonibacter by pérez cataluña et al pérez cataluña et al 2018 hereafter called as agb can also cause campylobacteriosis like diseases to humans collado and figueras 2011 because of their similar symptoms some agb infections could have been misclassified as campylobacteriosis agb are considered emerging human pathogens yet their significance is largely underestimated due to inappropriate detection and identification snelling et al 2006 in addition to humans some agb can cause diseases e g abortion to domestic animals unlike many campylobacter spp agb can survive and grow in various environments such as soil water and sediment at ambient air and lower temperature 15 30 c conditions collado and figueras 2011 agb have been frequently and abundantly detected in wastewater fisher et al 2014 kristensen et al 2020 levican et al 2016 in addition the occurrence of agb was highly correlated with human fecal pollution collado et al 2008 some agb can also occur in avian species including chickens turkeys and geese çelik and otlu 2020 therefore waterfowl may also be the source of agb contamination in water environments lakes used by migratory birds can be contaminated with campylobacter agb and other pathogens we previously detected various enteric pathogens in a freshwater lake that is used as a stopover site for migratory greater white fronted goose anser albifrons by using the high throughput microfluidic quantitative pcr qpcr approach ishii et al 2014 concentrations of these pathogens greatly changed over time most likely due to changes in the abundance of their potential source e g geese among the pathogens detected campylobacter spp were frequently and abundantly detected in the lake water the occurrence of agb in the lake was unknown because agb were not included in the list of target pathogens for the microfluidic qpcr ishii et al 2014 because the lake water is used for irrigation to the surrounding and downstream agricultural fields contamination of the lake water with campylobacter pathogen is of serious food safety and public health concern to assess the health risks of the water it is essential to have a number of live pathogens however qpcr can detect signals both from dead and live cells while the use of ethidium monoazide ema or propidium monoazide pma before dna extraction and pcr can minimize the pcr signals from dead cells zeng et al 2016 these approaches may not function well when samples contain a high concentration of suspended solids ss varma et al 2009 which is commonly seen in various natural systems such as eutrophic lakes ishii et al 2014 for these situations culture dependent approaches are useful to verify the presence of viable pathogens while migratory geese are the likely source of campylobacter contamination in the lake tested in our previous study ishii et al 2014 it is not confirmed by genotyping such as multilocus sequence typing mlst dingle et al 2001 and flagellin gene flaa sequencing meinersmann et al 1997 we previously developed a campylobacter characterization method by sequencing the flagellin gene flaa in high throughput zhang et al 2018 by comparing the flaa genotypes detected in water samples and those from known animals e g geese we would be able to identify the sources of campylobacter pathogens a similar approach can be also used to identify the sources of agb consequently the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the temporal dynamics of campylobacter and agb in the lake water by culture dependent and independent analyses 2 identify the potential sources of these potential pathogens by sequencing flaa amplicons and 3 analyze the environmental variables influencing the occurrences and diversities of campylobacter and agb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study site is lake miyajimanuma hokkaido japan fig s1 this lake is used as a stopover site for 50 000 to 70 000 birds of greater white fronted goose anser albifrons every spring late april to early may and fall late september to october ishii et al 2014 because of this lake miyajimanuma is registered as s ramsar site and protected by the ministry of the environment japan japan ministry of the environment 2015 in addition to geese other waterfowls e g swans ducks and animals e g deer foxes racoons also use the lake environment there are small influent streams to the lake which contained water discharged from surrounding agricultural fields mostly for rice and soybean cultivation ishii et al 2014 lake effluent is used for irrigation of rice paddy fields large livestock facilities are absent near or upstream of the lake water samples ca 20 l were collected from the effluent stream from lake miyajimanuma 43 33 39 n 141 71 66 w once or twice a month from april to november in 2013 and 2014 a total of 19 sampling events water samples were kept on ice in surface disinfected plastic tanks and processed within 2 h after collection during the geese migration seasons fecal materials from geese were also collected by using a surface disinfected spatula from agricultural fields near lake miyajimanuma up to 60 fecal samples were collected per sampling event a total of 205 samples fecal samples were individually placed in whirl pak bags and kept on ice during transportation to the laboratory 2 h 2 2 measurement of water quality parameters water depth and flow rate at the time of sample collection were measured by using a flow meter model l 2 taihei sangyo takayama gifu japan water ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured on site by using ph ec and do meters

solid ss content were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 as described previously ishii et al 2014 e coli most probably numbers mpn were obtained by using the ec blue kit nissui pharmaceutical tokyo japan 2 3 water and fecal sample processing water samples 5 l were pressure filtered through 142 mm diameter 0 22 µm pore poly ether sulfone membrane filters millipore billerica ma water filtration was done in four replicates following filtration three out of four replicates were used for culture independent analyses while another replicate was used for culture based analysis each membrane was cut into four pieces and placed in a 50 ml conical tube after adding 20 ml phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 2 containing 0 1 gelatin ishii et al 2014 zhang and ishii 2018 the tubes were horizontally placed on a vortex mixer and vigorously shaken at the maximum speed for 15 min to detach cells from the membranes the resultant cell suspensions were used for the culture dependent and independent analyses as described below for culture independent analyses the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 15 min at 4 c after removing the supernatant the pellet was re suspended with 1 ml pbs and transferred to a new 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min and used for dna extraction with dneasy powersoil kit qiagen according to the manufacturer s instruction dna was also extracted from geese fecal samples 0 2 g by using a qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen all of the extracted dna samples were stored at 20 c until use 2 4 quantitative pcr campylobacter and agb in the water samples were quantified by using culture independent quantitative pcr qpcr with camp2 lund et al 2004 and arco assays shrestha et al 2018 respectively table s1 in addition qpcr was done to measure microbial source tracking mst markers for human cow pig poultry goose and deer human nd5 cow nd5 pig nd5 la35 goose nd2 and deer cytb assays

the synthetic gblock dna fragments synthesized by integrated dna technologies containing each of the target gene sequences were used to generate standard curves ishii et al 2013 zhang and ishii 2018 2 5 enumeration and isolation of culturable campylobacter and agb campylobacter and agb were also quantified and isolated from water and fecal samples by using culture dependent mpn method similar but slightly different approaches were used for samples collected in 2013 and 2014 for water samples collected in 2013 five aliquots of three different volumes 2 5 ml 0 25 ml and 0 025 ml of the cell suspensions in 20 ml pbs as described above were spiked into 22 5 ml 5 ml and 5 ml respectively of bolton broth oxoid supplemented with laked horse blood remel and antibiotics 20 µg ml cefoperazone 20 µg ml trimethoprim 20 µg ml vancomycin and 50 µg ml cycloheximide we accidentally did not add antibiotics when processing samples collected in april and may 2013 for fecal samples collected in 2013 the cell suspension was prepared by vigorously mixing 1 g samples with 9 ml of pbs from which one ml each was inoculated into 9 ml bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics these test tubes were incubated at 37 c for 4 h followed by 42 c for 44 h under microaerobic conditions created by using anaeropak microaero mitsubishi gas chemical tokyo japan for the selective growth of campylobacter we accidentally incubated them at 37 c for 48 h for samples collected in june and july 2013 resulting in the growth of agb for water samples collected in 2014 ten aliquots of three different volumes 1 ml 0 1 ml and 0 01 ml of the cell suspensions were spiked into 9 ml 5 ml and 5 ml respectively of bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics the resulting 30 test tubes were divided into two sets set a and b each containing 15 tubes 5 tubes 3 dilutions for fecal samples collected in 2014 one ml of fecal suspension prepared as described above was inoculated into two tubes set a and b containing 9 ml bolton broth supplemented with the blood and antibiotics set a tubes were incubated at 37 c for 4 h followed by 42 c for 44 h under microaerobic conditions for the selective growth of campylobacter while set b tubes were incubated at 37 c for 48 h under microaerobic conditions for the growth of agb after incubation a loopful of culture ca 10 µl was streaked onto modified campylobacter blood free agar m ccda medium oxoid supplemented with 32 µg ml cefoperazone and 10 µg ml amphotericin b and incubated under microaerobic conditions at the same incubation temperatures used for enrichment with bolton broth e g 42 c and 37 c for set a and b cultures respectively for 48 h colonies formed on the m ccda medium were re streaked on a new m ccda medium and further incubated to obtain well isolated colonies colonies were confirmed as being campylobacter or agb by sequencing the 16s rrna gene fragment amplified with c412f and c1228r primers linton et al 1996 table s1 as described previously ishii et al 2006 agb colonies were further identified at the species level by using species specific multiplex pcr for al butzleri al cryaerophilus and al skirrowii as described previously houf et al 2000 tubes positive for campylobacter or agb were counted and used for the mpn calculation with the 5 tubes 3 dilutions mpn table as described previously ishii et al 2006 2 6 flaa svr sequencing for the campylobacter and agb isolates all campylobacter and agb isolates purified from the colonies on m ccda medium 248 and 79 isolates respectively were genotyped by sequencing the flaa short variable region svr with the primers shown in table s1 the primer set campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r can amplify ca 400 bp flaa fragment from various campylobacter species zhang et al 2018 the primer set acro flaa 229f and arco flaa 715r were newly designed in this study by using degeprime hugerth et al 2014 to amplify flaa fragment of ca 486 bp from various agb species the pcr reaction mixture 20 μl contained 1 ex taq buffer takara bio 0 5 μm of each primer 0 2 mm of each dntp 0 4 u of ex taq dna polymerase takara bio and 1 μl of dna template pcr was performed using a veriti 96 well thermal cycler with the following conditions initial annealing at 95 c for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 c for 30 sec 52 c 55 c for arco flaa primers for 30 sec and 72 c for 30 sec after the final extension at 72 c for 7 min the pcr mixtures were stored at 4 c the pcr products were purified and sequenced by the sanger method as described previously zhang et al 2018 the flaa svr nucleotide sequences of the isolates were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by using mothur schloss et al 2009 when isolates obtained from water samples had the identical flaa svr sequences i e those clustered together into the same otus at 100 sequence similarity to those obtained from fecal samples these water isolates were identified as of geese origin 2 7 high throughput sequencing of flaa svr from water and geese feces the flaa svr of campylobacter and agb were also directly amplified and sequenced from water and geese fecal samples without culture isolation as described previously zhang et al 2018 in brief flaa svr was amplified from the dna extracted from water and fecal samples by using the flaa specific primers tagged with illumina overhang adaptor sequences table s1 the purified pcr products were tagged with sample unique index and illumina adapter sequences at their 5 end by using nextera xt index kit v2 illumina after agarose gel electrophoresis pcr products 500 600 bp were excised from the gel and purified using the fastgene gel pcr purification kit nippon genetics tagged amplicons from multiple samples were pooled and sequenced by illumina miseq platform in 300 bp paired end sequencing reaction with v3 reagent kit illumina according to the manufacturer s instruction sequence data were processed using the shi7 program al ghalith et al 2018 as described previously zhang et al 2018 in brief we removed illumina adaptor and primer sequences assembled paired end sequences trimmed qc value less than 33 of sequencing reads the resulting sequences were further filtered by the size of the expected flaa amplicon length 355 370 bp for campylobacter and 368 448 bp for agb and by removing singletons sequence denoising was done by systematically varied two parameters the number of duplicated reads d and the sequence alignment similarity s of operational taxonomic units otus to identify the largest number

agb flaa respectively 3 results 3 1 general water quality of lake miyajimanuma lake miyajimanuma is a small and shallow lake in an agricultural area mostly for rice and soybean productions the peak geese population during their migration seasons ranged from 20 000 to 70 000 birds day in 2012 and 2013 fig s2 the geese population size was larger in the spring migration than the fall migration in both years goose specific mst marker was detected in the lake water samples during the geese migration season fig s2 whereas the mst markers for human cow pig chicken and deer were not detected suggesting that the major source of fecal contamination in the lake was geese the level of e coli was also high when geese were present in the lake table 1 although the highest e coli levels in the fall were seen after the geese migration peaked fig s2 this is probably because of the water stagnation and the survival of e coli after geese left nutrient loading from the surrounding agricultural area and geese fecal inputs likely caused relatively high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations often exceeding 5 mg n l and 1 mg p l in the lake water table 1 algal blooms occurred during summer and fall months likely resulting in increased ph and ss and cod concentrations table 1 flow volume was generally higher in spring than in the other months most likely because of the snowmelt table 1 3 2 temporal dynamics of campylobacter and agb populations in the lake the population of culturable campylobacter spp and agb were measured by the mpn method fig 1 bacteria were first enriched in bolton broth and then isolated on an m ccda medium the identity of the isolates was confirmed by sequencing the 16s rrna gene with the sangar method and agb species specific multiplex pcr our primary culture target in 2013 was campylobacter spp although we could not enrich them in spring 2013 samples most likely due to the lack of appropriate antibiotics for april and may 2013 samples and the use of inappropriate incubation temperature 37 c for 48 h for june and july 2013 samples when we added antibiotics and used the appropriate incubation temperature 42 c we detected high levels of campylobacter spp during the geese migration seasons in fall 2013 spring 2014 and fall 2014 as a result of the culture procedure a total of 163 campylobacter sp isolates were obtained from the water samples table s2 based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis most of these isolates were closely related to c jejuni with some related to c coli and c lari fig s3 similar to the results obtained from the mpn method campylobacter spp were abundantly detected in spring and fall by qpcr fig 1 their concentration was comparable to those obtained by the mpn suggesting that many of the campylobacter spp detected were viable occasionally we did not detect campylobacter by qpcr when they were detected by mpn e g spring 2014 this is probably because the detection limit of qpcr was larger than that of mpn in this study 40 copies l vs 1 8 mpn l during the spring and fall migration seasons the levels of campylobacter spp in the lake water exceeded the acceptable concentration of c jejuni to grow fresh vegetables 0 46 log cells l which is defined as the pathogen concentration that can cause infection at a probability of 10 4 infections per person per year ishii et al 2014 campylobacter spp were more abundant in the fall than spring migration seasons in 2014 most likely due to the washout of the pathogen from the lake by snowmelt the abundance of campylobacter spp was low 1 8 mpn l during summer months june to august and in september before the arrival of geese based on the glm analysis no environmental variables significantly p 0 05 explained the levels of campylobacter in the lake although the temperature and geese population had relatively small p values 0 0648 and 0 0924 respectively in contrast to campylobacter populations agb were detected in the lake water regardless of the presence of geese fig 1 similar results were obtained by qpcr but the agb concentrations measured by qpcr were larger than those obtained by the mpn method likely reflecting the broad reactivity of the qpcr assays to various agb species a total of 79 agb isolates were obtained from the water samples table s3 based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis and the agb species specific multiplex pcr houf et al 2000 all of these isolates were closely related to aliiarcobacter butzleri fig s4 based on the glm analysis temperature and ph significantly p 0 05 explained the levels of culturable agb in the lake whereas the other variables did not p 0 1 3 3 detection and isolation of campylobacter spp from geese fecal samples campylobacter spp were also detected and isolated from the geese fecal samples collected around the lake however no agb was detected both by culture dependent and culture independent analysis higher recovery of campylobacter was seen when elevated incubation temperature 42 c was used 54 positives out of 205 samples 26 3 than when 37 c was used 31 positives out of 181 samples 17 0 table s4 except for one case all fecal samples positive for campylobacter at 37 c were also campylobacter positive at 42 c a total of 85 campylobacter sp isolates were obtained from the fecal samples all of which were related to c jejuni 3 4 flaa typing of campylobacter and arcobacter group isolates two hundred forty eight campylobacter isolates 163 and 85 isolates obtained from water and fecal samples respectively and 79 agb isolates obtained from water samples were characterized by flaa sequencing done with the sangar method the 248 campylobacter isolates were grouped into 125 genotypes based on their flaa sequences isolates in the same genotype have identical flaa sequences i e 100 sequence similarity about 20 32 out of 163 isolates of the isolates obtained from water samples were grouped together with fecal isolates and therefore were considered as likely being from geese the proportion of the isolates identified as being from geese was larger in the isolates obtained in 2014 33 28 out of 84 isolates than those obtained in 2013 5 4 out of 79 isolates fig 2 this might be related to the number of campylobacter isolates obtained from fecal samples 23 and 62 isolates were obtained from geese fecal samples collected in 2013 and 2014 respectively table s4 some campylobacter flaa genotypes appeared at more than one sampling date table s5 for example genotype represented by isolate 14 13 occurred in the fecal samples collected in october 2013 october 2014 and november 2014 and in the water samples collected in april august october and november 2014 similarly genotypes represented by isolates 14 143 14 175 14 202 14 225 14 248 occurred over months or years the 79 agb isolates were grouped into 40 genotypes based on their flaa sequences with 100 sequence similarity as a cutoff all these flaa sequences were closely related to those of al butzleri fig s5 in agreement with the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis fig s4 similar to campylobacter some agb genotypes appeared over time table s6 for example agb genotype represented by isolate 13 12 occurred in the water samples collected in june july and september 2013 and in june september and november 2014 similarly the agb genotype represented by isolate 14 74 occurred in two different months july and october in 2014 3 5 high throughput campylobacter flaa sequencing the diversity of campylobacter was assessed by sequencing the flaa fragments amplified with campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r primers a total of 488 521 campylobacter flaa reads were obtained for 148 samples 25 water and 123 fecal samples with a mean of 3 300 reads and a median of 933 reads per sample sequence reads were rarefied to 100 reads for the analysis of alpha diversity after rarefication the read coverages were 0 92 and 0 98 for water and geese samples respectively the flaa alpha diversity was higher in water samples than fecal samples p 0 05 by anova table s7 within water samples no significant differences were detected in the diversity index values between seasons spring vs fall and years 2013 vs 2014 the 488 521 flaa sequences were clustered into 121 otus at 98 sequence similarity among those 30 otus were more closely related to helicobacter spp than campylobacter spp based on the phylogenetic analysis but the other otus 91 otus were closely related to campylobacter spp fig 3 most of these campylobacter flaa sequences 97 88 out of 91 otus were highly similar 98 to those obtained by culture based approach fig 3 among the 121 flaa otus 87 of them 105 otus were shared between water samples and geese fecal samples while 4 5 otus and 9 11 otus of otus specifically occurred in water and geese fecal samples respectively among the 110 otus detected in water samples 97 otus 88 occurred over time most of which 95 92 otus were also detected in geese fecal samples fig 4 interestingly many of the flaa otus that appeared more abundantly in geese fecal samples than water samples 30 otus highlighted in fig 4 were more closely related to flaa of helicobacter than those of campylobacter 3 6 high throughput agb related flaa sequencing diversity of agb was also assessed by sequencing the flaa fragments amplified with acro flaa 229f and arco flaa 715r primers a total of 198 451 high quality agb related flaa reads were obtained for 47 water samples with a mean of 4 222 reads and a median 2 437 of reads per sample these flaa sequences were clustered into 599 otus at 98 sequence similarity phylogenetically diverse agb related flaa sequences were obtained fig s5 most of the flaa sequences obtained by miseq were related to those of aliiarcobacter and pseudoarcobacter while some flaa otu 163 and otu 164 were more closely related to those of malaciobacter a part of agb in addition some flaa otus in the aliiarcobacter pseudoarcobacter cluster did not have close culture representatives based on the flaa phylogenic analysis indicating the presence of previously uncharacterized agb in the study site in contrast to the analysis of campylobacter flaa agb related flaa obtained by miseq were different from those obtained by the culture based method for the analysis of alpha diversity sequence reads were rarefied to 1000 reads after rarefication the read coverages were 0 92 for all samples the alpha diversity of agb related flaa was higher in water samples collected in spring than those collected in summer or fall p 0 05 by anova table s8 beta diversity of agb also varied by season and year based on the pcoa with the flaa data fig s7 community dissimilarities among different seasons spring summer and fall and years 2013 and 2014 were supported by permanova p 0 01 canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap was used to clarify the relationship between environmental variables and the patterns in microbial communities fig 5 six variables ph temperature flux cod ss and do were selected to build the final cap model based on the forward selection and permanova p 0 05 suggesting that these environmental variables might have influenced the community structure of the agb 4 discussion 4 1 temporal dynamics of campylobacter in the lake water migration and gathering of geese negatively influenced the lake water quality as shown by the elevated levels of e coli and campylobacter in this and other studies ishii et al 2014 vogel et al 2013 campylobacter spp occurred in spring and fall especially during and after the geese migration seasons they were mostly undetected in summer when geese were absent in the lake suggesting that geese might have released campylobacter to the lake water most of the campylobacter in the lake were likely viable because similar campylobacter concentrations were obtained by culture dependent and independent methods this is probably because the bacteria had been released from the source e g geese to the water within a short time e g days campylobacter spp are known to survive well in natural lake water for up to one week especially at cold temperatures korhonen and martikalnon 1991 similar campylobacter spp concentration 2 4 log copies l was also obtained in the same lake in 2012 ishii et al 2014 as well as in the other sites during the bird migration season lu et al 2013 most of the campylobacter sp isolates obtained in this study were related to c jejuni similar to other studies colles et al 2008 llarena et al 2015 this is of human health concern because c jejuni is the major species that cause human campylobacteriosis jones 2001 silva et al 2011 a few isolates of c coli and c lari were also obtained in this study these species are also known to cause human diseases jones 2001 silva et al 2011 the concentration of the viable campylobacter spp in the lake water was high enough 0 46 log cells l to cause diseases at a probability of 10 4 infections per person per year if used to grow fresh vegetables ishii et al 2014 currently rice and soybean are the major crops grown in the agricultural fields around lake miyajimanuma fresh vegetables are not cultivated for commercial purposes however if farmers want to grow fresh vegetables they should treat the lake water e g by filtration or disinfection prior to use in irrigation to protect human health 4 2 source identification of campylobacter spp in this study about 26 of fecal samples from greater white fronted geese were positive for campylobacter spp which is similar to previous studies 12 32 done with canada geese branta canadensis in north america van dyke et al 2010 and canada geese and barnacle geese branta leucopsis in europe llarena et al 2015 wahlström et al 2003 our previous qpcr analysis also suggests a similar frequency of campylobacter jejuni occurrences 16 in the feces of greater white fronted geese in japan ishii et al 2014 these results suggest that the frequency of campylobacter occurrences in geese were similar across a wide range of geographical areas and among different goose species identical flaa genotypes occurred in both water and fecal samples indicating that campylobacter originated from geese was present in the lake water it is also possible that geese acquired campylobacter spp by ingesting the lake water however since campylobacter was not detected in the lake before the arrival of geese the original host of the water isolates is most likely geese some flaa genotypes occurred over months or years indicating that they were carried and spread by geese survived in the water environment and re infected geese these results suggest that lakes can act as temporal reservoirs of campylobacter infection for geese because tens of thousands of geese gather in lake miyajimanuma the lake can serve as a place for geese to share and exchange campylobacter spp based on the flaa typing of the campylobacter isolates only about 20 of the isolates obtained from the water samples were identified as being from geese the sources of the remaining isolates are unknown probably because our known source flaa library was not large enough to capture campylobacter diversity similar to this study a low rate of source apportionment 32 was reported in culture based source tracking of e coli which is also genetically highly diverse ishii et al 2007 it is also possible that other sources such as cattle may contribute to the release of campylobacter as other studies suggested guy et al 2018 however this is unlikely in the site we studied because 1 there are no ruminant or chicken farms near lake miyajimanuma 2 the mst markers for human cow pig chicken and deer were undetected and 3 campylobacter was undetected or very low when geese were absent in the lake we could not exclude the possibility of the contributions of other waterfowls such as swans and ducks as well as animals such as foxes and raccoons which are present around the lake nonetheless since their population sizes are much smaller than that of geese in the study area their contribution to the lake water contamination is likely smaller than that of geese to capture more diverse flaa genotypes present in the lake water we used the high throughput flaa sequencing approach with the illumina miseq platform zhang et al 2018 in addition to most of the flaa sequences obtained by the culture based approach the high throughput flaa sequencing approach detected more diverse flaa genotypes from the water samples suggesting that this approach is suitable to analyze the genetic diversity of campylobacter spp most otus detected in water samples were also detected in geese fecal samples further supporting the geese origin of campylobacter spp in the lake this study shows that the high throughput flaa sequencing approach is useful to identify the potential sources of campylobacter zhang et al 2018 similar to other sequence based microbial source tracking mst e g for bacteroides approaches unno et al 2010 unno et al 2018 4 3 occurrence of helicobacter in geese and water we frequently and abundantly detected helicobacter related flaa sequences in geese fecal samples the primers we used campy flaa 235f and campy flaa 635r were originally designed to amplify diverse flaa fragments from the genus campylobacter zhang et al 2018 however they were likely not specific enough to campylobacter nonetheless the results we found have important implications for water quality monitoring and mst similar to this study the helicobacter 16s rrna gene was previously abundantly detected in geese fecal samples and based on that geese specific mst marker gfd was designed green et al 2012 however this study showed that helicobacter related flaa was not frequently detected in the water samples contaminated with geese feces this indicates that geese borne helicobacter does not survive well in water environments at least as compared to campylobacter spp decay of mst markers is important when interpreting the mst results zhang et al 2019 if geese mst marker gfd decays faster than pathogens such as campylobacter spp we may underestimate the health risks of water contaminated with geese feces therefore the decay kinetics of the geese marker gfd should be examined in the future 4 4 temporal dynamics of agb in the lake water the pattern of agb occurrence was very different from that of campylobacter spp culturable agb were detected more abundantly in summer than in spring and fall suggesting that the occurrence of agb was not directly related to the migration of geese this is also supported by the no detection of agb in geese fecal samples both by culture dependent and independent methods however this contradicts the previous report in which various agb were enriched from domesticated geese çelik and otlu 2020 the difference may be due in part to the different goose species and or the use of different culture media and incubation conditions 30 c in çelik and otlu 2020 vs 37 c in our study our medium also contained multiple antibiotics originally designed for the selective enrichment of campylobacter spp which are different from those recommended for the selective enrichment of agb houf et al 2001 more agb specific isolation methods may be necessary to verify the presence of agb in wild geese nonetheless since agb related flaa and 16s rrna gene i e arco f r assay designed by shrestha et al 2018 were not detected by qpcr in our geese fecal samples geese are probably not the major reservoir of agb at least in the studied area all of our agb isolates obtained from water samples were closely related to al butzleri this however might be related to the use of culture enrichment a previous study showed that the enrichment culture technique is biased more toward al butzleri than other agb species levican et al 2016 when culture independent flaa analysis was used more diverse agb related flaa were detected 4 5 factors influencing the occurrence of agb in contrast to the previous study collado et al 2008 no correlation was found between agb abundance and fecal indicator e coli levels the study site is mostly an agricultural area and there are no wastewater effluent discharge and animal farms nearby as a result potential sources of agb are currently unknown it is probable that these agb are of environmental origin and comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population lake miyajimanuma is a shallow eutrophic lake with high nutrient c n and p concentrations the temperature of the lake can exceed 20 c during the summer months the occurrence of algal cyanobacterial blooms in the lake could lower the do concentrations all of these conditions are favorable for agb to grow collado and figueras 2011 among these environmental variables temperature and ph significantly explain the levels of culturable agb based on the glm analysis since ph can increase as a result of algal cyanobacterial photosynthesis raven et al 2020 this suggests the potential influence of algal cyanobacterial blooms on the occurrence of agb these environmental conditions can also shape the populations of agb six variables were specifically identified in this study including ph water temperature water flux cod ss and do this is reasonable as the tolerance to o2 and ph can vary by agb species collado and figueras 2011 these results suggest that we may need to fundamentally improve the lake water quality to mitigate the agb problem in the lake for example by changing the flow of the influent streams so that the agriculture derived nutrients will not run into the lake or by dredging p rich sediments from the lake bormans et al 2016 4 6 implications this study shows that migratory geese are the likely source of campylobacter in lake miyajimanuma since these geese travel long distance and disperse their fecal microbiota to wide areas campylobacter contamination can also occur in other lakes some of which are used for recreational activities appropriate management of the lake water activities therefore should be done to protect public health arcobacter group bacteria on the other hand are likely not of geese origin geese however can indirectly influence the population of agb by increasing the levels of nutrients in the water environments the population of agb in eutrophic lakes and rivers has not been examined well however this study implies that agb may proliferate in these environments even when the input of human sewage is absent further research is necessary to clarify the ecology of this emerging pathogen in the water environment 5 conclusions campylobacter was abundantly detected both by culture dependent and independent methods in lake miyajimanuma especially when migratory geese were present in the lake geese were the likely source of campylobacter based on the high throughput flaa sequencing analysis the occurrence of arcobacter group bacteria was not directly related to the migratory behavior of geese arcobacter group bacteria likely comprise a part of the indigenous microbial population of the lake and grow in response to high nutrient warm temperature and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lake geese fecal inputs are one of the major causes of lake eutrophication which influences the population structure of

16039,constructed wetlands cws integrated with the bioelectrochemical system bes cw to stimulate bio refractory compounds removal holds particular promise owing to its inherent greater scale and well recognized environmentally benign wastewater advanced purification technology however the knowledge regarding the feasibility and removal mechanisms particularly the potential negative effects of biorefractory compounds on nitrogen removal performance for the cws is far insufficient this study performed a critical assessment by using bes cw ecw and conventional cw cw to investigate the effects of p chloronitrobenzene pcnb on nitrogen transformations in cws the results showed that low concentration 1 mg l 1 of pcnb would inhibit the ammonia oxidation in cws while ecw could improve its tolerance to pcnb to a certain level 8 mg l 1 due to the high pcnb degradation efficiencies 2 5 times higher than cws accordingly much higher tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in ecws 81 71 96 82 tn higher than cws further leading to a lower n2o emission from ecws than cws the main intermediate of pcnb degradation was p chloroaniline pcan and the genera geobacter and propionimicrobium were consider to be the responsible pcnb degradation bacteria in the present study however too high concentration 20 mg l 1 of pcnb would have a huge impact on ecw and cw especially microbial biomass nevertheless ecw could improve the 1 87 times higher microbial biomass than cw on the substrate accordingly considerably higher functional gene abundance was observed in ecw therefore the introduction of bes has great potential to ensure cw stability when treating industrial wastewater containing bio refractory compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland bioelectrochemical system p chloronitrobenzene nitrogen transformation 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is a kind of biologically engineered systems which is designed to treat wastewaters followed a sustainable and environmental friendly way ramirez vargas et al 2020 although cw is widely known as an ecological technology for advanced treatment of nitrogenous wastewater control of eutrophication and etc it is initially designed to effectively treat raw primary secondary or tertiary treated wastewaters from different origins dotro et al 2017 such as domestic drainage mining runoff industrial and agriculture effluents chen et al 2021 vymazal 2014 the gradual functional deterioration of constructed wetland in application mainly results from the high removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus in micro polluted water and the high time cost of removal on refractory organic pollutants in complex wastewater origins e g industrial effluent even though cw has the potential to degrade the refractory organic pollutants its efficiency is low and there are risks of toxic effects on cw functional microbial communities p chloronitrobenzene pcnb is a kind of important intermediate for chemical syntheses of medicines dyes herbicides and etc peng et al 2018 which has the characteristics of high persistence in industrial wastewater and poses a critical threat to humans and animals health such as acute chronic or persistent physiological toxicity given that the compound has been categorized as the priority pollutants by us epa and ec in china the discharge standard gb 8978 1996 for pcnb from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has also been promulgated 0 5 5 mg l 1 however it was reported that pcnb concentration in industrial wastewater could reach to 0 05 200 mg l 1 guo et al 2015 indicating that superior sewage treatment performance is required to meet the strict standard unfortunately the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as nitro and chloro on the benzene ring makes it difficult to be degraded under aerobic conditions but thermodynamic favorable to be reduced in anaerobic and anoxic conditions nevertheless low degradation rates and poor stability were always obtained in anaerobic and anoxic technologies xia et al 2011 what s worse peng et al 2018 reported that pcnb might inhibit bioactivity at a certain concentration thereby reducing the performance of processes based on biological technologies although there is rare discussion in literatures about the interaction between cw performance especially nitrogen transformations and pcnb the cw mostly relied on biological degradation may achieve similar results to common biological technologies such as the activated sludge method thus improvement of cw performance on pcnb degradation and mitigation of the inhibiting effects from pcnb through accelerating the transformation of pcnb to low toxic compounds are extremely necessary bioelectrochemistry system bes has been considered to be a promising technology for degradation of refractory organic pollutants and several successful applications were conducted in azo dyes nitrobenzene and halogenated aromatic compounds treatment jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 guo et al 2015 and xu et al 2016 have demonstrated biocathode has the ability to deoxidize the nitro group and dehalogenate the chloro group on the benzene ring when using a single bes or integrating bes with anaerobic processes the redox reactions reduction of nitro and chloro aromatic contaminants are mostly dependent on the concentration of pollutants the availability of electron donors and the competition with other electron acceptors on electron e g nitrate zhu et al 2012 the existence of bioelectrodes can reinforce the transformation of pollutants as electron donor and enhance the reduction property of anaerobic microbe lin et al 2011 therefore the introduction of bes into cw ecw has the potential to solved the problems within conventional cw mentioned above however rare discussion has been reported about the mutual influence between pcnb and ecw performance especially nitrogen transformations in the present study different concentrations of pcnb were used in the influent of cw to investigate the effects of pcnb on its performance of nitrogen transformations based on the principle of biological activation bes was introduced into cw aiming to directionally regulate electron transfer pathways activate metabolic pathways between microorganisms and pcnb assist microorganisms to cross the respiratory energy barrier and provide additional reducing power electrons to degrade pcnb finally accelerate the process of directional detoxification and dehalogenation of pcnb and remove its biological toxicity inhibition effects the mutual influence between pcnb and ecw was explored in the present study including aspects of wastewater purification greenhouse gas n2o emission plant growth microbial community and etc the study will propose a feasible solution for the improvement of functional diversity of conventional cw and provide the theoretical basis of degrading refractory organic pollutants in ecw 2 material andmethods 2 1 constructed wetlands set up and operation different types of wetlands with different pcnb concentrations in the influent i e

measurement of no3 n concentration using spectrophotometry will be affected by pcnb therefore no3 n concentration was determined by ion chromatography 883 basic ic plus metrohm switzerland when pcnb was added into influent do concentration and water temperature were determined by do meter multi 3510 ids set 4 wtw germany and ph value was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leici china the concentrations of pcnb in influent and effluent and its products during degradation i e p chloroaniline pcan and aniline an were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20ad shimazu japan at the mobile phase ratio methanol water of 7 3 through the calibration curve of the pure compounds relative to external standards at 265 nm for pcnb 240 nm for pcan and 231 nm for an respectively peng et al 2018 2 3 nitrogen content analysis because the concentration of nitrogen in gravel powder was too low to be detected nitrogen in the biofilm on a certain weight of gravel was used to evaluate the nitrogen content of the substrate in detail substrate samples were collected following the five point sampling method to make the samples representative then biofilm on substrate samples was washed into phosphate buffer saline pbs by ultrasound oscillation for 30 min and then extracted biofilm from pbs by filtering with 0 22 μm membrane gao et al 2018 finally biofilm plant and electrode samples were dried to constant weight and then grinded to pass 100 mesh sieves for further nitrogen content analysis nitrogen content of all samples was detected using an elementary analyzer vario macro cube elementar germany equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd as a bias of water purification cw has been found to be one of the most important sources of n2o emission mander et al 2014 therefore n2o emission was measured during the stable period in the present study gas samples were collected from all cws every 12 min using closed chamber methods zhang et al 2018 each sampling process lasted for 60 min and was conducted three times during 3 d hrt n2o concentrations in gas samples were detected by a gas chromatograph 7890b agilent usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and gas emission fluxes were calculated using the equation reported by zhang et al 2005 supplementary material 2 4 microbial analysis adenosine triphosphate atp activity analysis was used to evaluate microbial biomass on the substrate and electrodes in different cws biofilm samples from substrate and electrodes were repeatedly stripped into pbs by a vortex mixer vortex 2 huxi shanghai and atp activity in the samples was determined using the bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay kit no g8231 promega corporation dübendorf switzerland according to the manufacturer s protocol based on the bioluminescence theory wang et al 2020a the microbial community in the biofilm formed on the substrate and electrodes of all cws was analyzed by dna based molecular techniques mainly including real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing technology hts dna was extracted from the biofilm samples by using power soil dna isolation kit 12888 50 mobio usa according to the manufacturer s instructions due to the connection with nitrogen transformations amoa nsr nosz and narg genes were chosen to be quantified through qpcr assays using a real time pcr system linegene9600plus bori china qpcr was performed with the 20 μl of reaction mixture which contained 10 μl of sybr premix taq 0 4 μl of each of forward and reverse primer 7 2 μl of rnase free water and 2 μl of template dna zhi and ji 2014 the dna samples were amplified and sequenced by majorbio sanger bio pharm technology co ltd wang et al 2020b 2 5 statistics analysis microbial and water quality data presented in the present study was the mean of three replicates spss 17 0 ibm usa was used to statistically analyze whether microbial community functional genes and nitrogen content in different cws were statistically significant using the one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 3 results anddiscussion throughout the experimental period no obvious disease or death of plants was observed do and temperature in different cws were maintained at a similar level while ecw obtained higher ph values due to its better denitrification table 1 3 1 accelerated pcnb degradation in ecws 3 1 1 pcnb degradation performance fig 1 shows the performance of pcnb degradation in cw and ecw during the whole experiment and the results demonstrated that the introduction of bes to cw could greatly improve pcnb degradation efficiency both in low and high influent pcnb concentration conditions generally at different concentrations of pcnb the degradation efficiencies of ecw 81 74 20 46 and 90 34 7 19 for low and high conc respectively were approximately 2 5 times higher than cws 23 02 10 80 and 25 59 11 88 respectively fig 1 however it should be noted that pcnb degradation efficiencies reduced drastically with decreasing temperature fig s2 in both cw groups and ecwgroups especially at ecw with low pcnb influent concentration conditions the pcnb degradation efficiencies were almost reduced from 97 04 7 54 to 58 77 9 10 the average degradation efficiency in ecw was basically similar to the previous study with a single bes under room temperature 93 70 guo et al 2015 but the applied voltage 0 1 v in the present study was much lower than that in other studies 0 5 v the feasibility of low applied voltage for high degradation efficiencies mainly came from the advantages of cw with inherent redox potential gradient which could accelerate the formation of a suitable reduction potential environment for pcnb degradation the peak reduction potential 0 664 v yuan et al 2015 in which the redox potential on the cathode was between 0 50 and 0 66 v in the present study 3 1 2 pcnb degradation kinetics batch degradation experiments were carried out in the cw and ecw for investgated the pcnb degradation kinetics when systems were operated stably the protocol began with original pcnb concentrations of about 1 and 8 mg l 1 for degradation of 72 h in the cw and ecw under the room 20 2 c and lower 8 2 c temperature fig 2 fig 2 demonstrate that ecws were much faster than those of cws under all operating conditions thus the experimental results also indicated that pcnb degradation was accelerated due to the stimulation of the bio electrochemical module whose catabolism provided reductive electron carriers needed for pcnb broken bond reactions pcnb degradation trends suggested that the kinetics of pcnb removal fit the first order kinetic model dashed lines table 2 showed the best fit parameters and pearson r2 values for all operating conditions which pointed out that pcnb removal rates increased drastically with the introduction of bes to cw under the room and low temperature experiments for example at room temperature the ecw had k values of 49 9 10 3 and 33 6 10 3 h 1 for influent pcnb concentrations of about 1 and 8 mg l 1 respectively consequently ecw accelerated pcnb removal efficiencies by 15 6 and 11 3 times than cw this trend was reduced when cw operated at a lower temperature the k values of ecw also were 3 2 and 6 2 times of cw respectively this trend further supported that the bio electrochemical module provided reductive electron carriers needed for broken bond reactions used to initiate pcnb catabolism moreover during the room temperature the pcnb degradation rates table 2 observed in ecw were 0 034 0 003 and 0 159 0 011 g m 2 d 1 for low conc and high conc respectively which were 4 25 and 3 05 times of the cw the degradation rates in ecw were also higher than that in the previous study 0 058 g m 2 d 1 for the degradation of 2 mg l 1 pcnb using a hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor xia et al 2011 similar to k values when cw operated at lower temperatures the pcnb degradation rates in ecw also observed 150 and 273 higher than the cw in all groups pcnb degradation rates increased as the influent pcnb concentrations increased however too high concentrations may depress the microbial electrocatalytic process such as over 40 mg l 1 and further affect the removal of all pollutants peng et al 2018 according to the experimental results and our previous study guo et al 2015 the main pathways of pcnb degradation in ecw were proposed and shown in fig s3 i e pcnb could be reduced to pcan through unstable intermediates p chloronitrosobenzene and 2 amino 4 chlorophenol i e pcnsb and 2 4 acp and further dechlorinated to an on the cathode however the biological reaction by microorganism was more efficient to reduce the unstable intermediates leading to the simple pathway of directly reducing nitro to amino without intermediates accumulation therefore pcan and an were the main products of pcnb degradation in ecw and cw fig s4 showed the intermediate products of one cycle in the cw and ecw operated under lower temperature and low pcnb influent concentration condition the pcan and an concentrations increased along with the reduction of pcnb however the variation of an concentration increased and then decreased to 0 mg l 1 indicated there was a further reduction process as an transformation 3 2 the performance for nitrogen removal fig 3 and fig s5 showd how tn tan nitrate and nitrite changed in cw and ecw with different influent pcnb concentrations generally nitrogen removal efficiencies in both cw and ecw groups are all followed the negative relationship with pcnb influent concentration the cw0 and ecw0 observed the highest nitrogen removal efficiencies and the highest influent pcnb concentration with the lowest nitrogen removal efficiencies 3 2 1 tn removal for the tn removal performance fig 3a and b significant within group differences p 0 05 were all observed between high conc and other groups 35 18 11 91 and 69 24 7 86 for cw8 and ecw8 respectively however tn removal efficiencies in all groups of ecw were much higher than that in cws due to the gap between cw groups and ecw groups on nitrate removal the efficiencies in ecw groups 69 24 81 84 were also higher than that reported by wang et al 2020b with a range of 38 80 73 10 when treating the similar nitrogen content of the influent averagely ecw groups were 89 26 higher than cw groups and the advantage of ecws 81 71 96 82 improvement for no pcnb high conc were more obvious along with the increase of pcnb concentrations accordingly the nitrogen removal rate fig 3b of ecw groups 0 33 0 04 0 39 0 04 g n m 2 d 1 were about twice as high as that of cw groups 0 16 0 06 0 21 0 06 g n m 2 d 1 which indicated ecw had more resistance to pcnb than cw 3 2 2 nitrate removal a significant difference was observed in terms of nitrate removal fig 3c p 0 05 ecw groups presented much better nitrate removal efficiency 98 16 2 54 98 83 2 54 than that of cw groups 14 59 23 18 21 47 23 31 even under the pressure of pcnb which resulted from the enhanced microbial activity and electron transfer supported by the bes that was consistent with the results reported in other studies with the integration of bes and cw gao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 notably the removal efficiencies in ecw groups were all higher than that the highest 84 00 in the studies of gao et al gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 mainly due to the longer hrt in the present study which indicated the importance of hrt with a low voltage in ecw however different concentrations of pcnb had few effects on nitrate removal in both cw groups and ecw groups similar results were obtained in terms of nitrate removal rate and nitrite removal fig 3d and fig s5b 3 2 3 tan removal fig s5a demonstrated that the tan concentrations in effluent of cw groups increased after the addition of pcnb on the 37th day and the increase rate expanded as the pcnb concentrations were raised however tan removal was enhanced after acclimatation for several days mainly due to the gradually increased do concentration in influent resulting from decreased temperature fig s2 the average tan removal efficiencies fig 3e of cw0 cw1 and cw8 are 97 24 5 14 94 43 8 54 and 68 07 18 06 with corresponding removal rates fig 3f of 0 19 0 01 0 19 0 02 and 0 13 0 04 g n m 2 d 1 ammonia accumulation was observed in all ecw groups and the average tan removal efficiencies of ecw0 ecw1 and ecw8 were observed 41 41 34 73 and 57 49 lower than the cw groups however the tan removal efficiencies in ecw0 was similar to that reported in other studies with similar nitrogen content in the influent of conventional cw lan et al 2018 and higher than that the highest 39 60 in the study of wang et al 2017 using the integration of bes and cw it s noted that low pcnb influent concentration had few effects on tan removal in ecw but ecw8 was more sensitive to the high concentration of pcnb high conc 8 mg l 1 and more severe ammonia accumulation was observed on the one hand the high consumption rate of do in ecw caused the inhibition of ammonia oxidation on the other hand the degradation of pcnb was probably one of the most important pathways of amino group production 3 3 effects of pcnb on nitrogen removal 3 3 1 effects of pcnb concentration on nitrogen removal fig 4 showed the periodic nitrogen transformation in cws and ecws under the stress of different concentrations of pcnb the results showed that tn removal tendencies of all the cws were well fitted to the first order kinetic equations fig 4a in the cw groups tn removal performances were greatly influenced by the influent pcnb concentration for instance the first order kinetics constant k of cw0 was 7 71 10 3 h 1 which is about 145 8 higher than cw8 moreover the k value of tn in ecw0 ecw1 and ecw8 were observed as 0 020 0 028 and 0 024 h 1 which were about 2 58 5 04 and 7 50 times the cw groups respectively the k values were also higher than that reported in the study 0 170 0 179 h 1 of fia et al 2021 and the review 0 06 0 16 d 1 of rousseau et al 2004 with conventional cws which demonstrated that the introduction of the bes module to cw can relieve the inhibition of pcnb on total nitrogen removal for the tan removal fig 4b the primary tan removal process occurred during the first 18 h in both cw and ecw groups however tan removal efficiencies and rates in the ecw groups were both lower than those in cw groups and with the increase of pcnb concentration the tan removal rates decreased which was consistent with the results observed in the long term experiment the reasons could be found in do variation fig s6 the dissolved oxygen rapidly decreased to the anaerobic anaerobic state within 4 hours after loading and the oxygen consumption rates of ecw groups were considerably faster than that of cw groups which confirmed the hypothesis mentioned above that one of the main reasons for the poor ammonia nitrogen removal of ecw was the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen by bes in ecw dissolved oxygen was not only consumed by aerobic bacteria but also preferentially used as an electron acceptor in the reduction reaction on biocathode due to its high redox potential however whether or not there was pcnb tan removal in each wetland increased significantly in the later period of the cycle and the recovery levels of ecw groups were larger than cw groups therefore it was reasonable to assume that there was a possibility of regenerating tan in the system since the recovery of tan was also found in ecw0 and cw0 this phenomenon was not only caused by the generation of pcnb degradation but also by the process of dissimilation and reduction of nitrate to ammonium dnra dnra process was commonly observed in constructed wetlands often accompanied by poor ammonia removal efficiency and it has also been reported in constructed wetlands with electric intervention yu et al 2020 as for nitrite removal there was no apparent correlation between its variation and pcnb concentrations and as an intermediate product nitrite removal increased first and then decreased or maintained balance there was a significant difference between ecw groups and cw groups on nitrate removal p 0 05 due to the superior nitrification capacity the nitrate generation rate in cw groups was significantly higher than its reduction rate resulting in the accumulation of nitrate the higher nitrate removal rate was obtained in ecw groups which was consistent with the results mentioned above 3 3 2 effects of pcnb loading rate on nitrogen removal the effects of pcnb loading rate on nitrogen removal rate were investigated by gradually increasing the loading rate from 0 to 0 5 g m 2 d 1 initial pcnb concentration 0 20 mg l 1 fig 5 presented the relationship between pcnb loading rate and nitrogen removal rate nitrogen removal in ecw with low pcnb loading rate 0 20 g m 2 d 1 8 48 mg l 1 was similar to no pcnb group while obviously reduced nitrogen removal rate was observed with the increased loading rate 0 20 g m 2 d 1 8 48 mg l 1 however as long as pcnb loading rate increased the nitrogen removal in cw reduced and the relationship was consistent with a negative linear correlation eq 1 and eq 2s demonstrated the relationship between pcnb loading rate and nitrogen tn and tan removal rates 1 e c w t n r r 0 057 p c n b l r 0 379 r 2 0 422 c w t n r r 0 189 p c n b l r 0 190 r 2 0 806 2 e c w t a n r r 0 136 p c n b l r 0 128 r 2 0 856 c w t a n r r 0 344 p c n b l r 0 173 r 2 0 927 where tnrr and tanrr represent the tn and tan removal rate rr in different cws g n m 2 d 1 pcnblr represent the influent pcnb loading rate g m 2 d 1 for the tn and tan the slopes of the functions between ecw and pcnblr were much lower than the functions between cw and pcnblr these results further illustrated that introduction of bes to cw can significantly relieve the inhibition of pcnb on nitrogen removal the primary process inhibited by pcnb was ammonia oxidation accordingly tn removal notably nitrate removal rate almost kept at a stable level both in ecw and cw systems even the pcnb loading rate increased from 0 to 0 5 g m 2 d 1 3 4 effects of pcnb on nitrogen distribution nitrogen mass balance was used to evaluate the effects of pcnb on nitrogen distribution in cw and ecw with influent pcnb concentrations of 0 1 and 8 mg l 1 although cw was usually used as an end treatment process an extreme situation of 20 mg l 1 pcnb was added to the discussion to evaluate the performance of cw and ecw in an emergency fig 6 showed that nitrate was the main nitrogen form accumulated in cw groups while ammonia in ecw groups the increased pcnb concentrations raised the tan concentration in effluent of cw groups 4 93 16 59 as well as ecw groups 16 83 27 12 however due to the higher nitrate and nitrite removal lower nitrogen content was observed in the effluent of ecw groups nitrogen content on the substrate and electrodes could reflect microbial growth while similar nitrogen content on the substrate was detected in all cws 5 03 5 09 and ecws 4 66 4 70 much nitrogen accumulated on electrodes in ecw groups 4 26 4 75 even though it only occupied a small proportion of the whole ecw volume indicating the bes stimulated the accumulation of microbe on electrodes but when pcnb increased to 20 mg l 1 the percentage was lowered which suggested a too high concentration pcnb would inhibit the microbial growth to a certain extent nitrogen in plants could be used to evaluate plant growth under pressure from pcnb a negative correlation was observed in cw groups between pcnb concentrations and nitrogen in plants while a positive correlation in ecw groups except for the 20 mg l 1 group although plant growth in ecw without pcnb 7 91 was lower than that in cw 11 41 due to the too low nutrients content for plant growth after purification by bes the inhibition from pcnb on nitrogen removal in ecw could reduce the competition between bes process and plant assimilation on nutrients which indicated that ecw could enhance the tolerance of plants to pcnb which was consistent with the results of the reactive oxygen species ros content in plant fig s7 previous studies have reported the introduction of bes could stimulate the plants to increase the palisade cells chloroplast grana and thylakoid lamellas which could enhance the chlorophyll synthesis and effectively inhibit the accumulation of sulfide which has negative effects on plants and microbes ju et al 2014 song et al 2011 however a too high concentration of pcnb 20 mg l 1 would also deteriorate the plant growth on the contrary pcnb would increase the n2o emission from cws and ecws and n2o emission fluxes in cw groups and ecw groups all followed the positive correlation with pcnb concentrations however ecw groups could much reduce the n2o emission flux compared with cw groups at the same pcnb level and the higher the pcnb concentration was the more significant the gap such as ecw20 0 16 and cw20 0 32 this was mainly due to its high nitrate removal efficiency because nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor over n2o for denitrification and more nitrate existed in the system which was often the inducement of high n2o release hu et al 2012 moreover it s worth noting that nitrogen in others was main in the form of n2 which was the primary end product of biological denitrification and electrochemical nitrogen removal fig 6 demonstrated the nitrogen removal through n2 emission in cw groups and ecw groups followed the negative correlation with influent pcnb concentrations except ecw20 in ecw20 nh3 emission was possibly another pathway for nitrogen removal because a high ph value 7 84 0 12 caused by the electrolysis and a high tan concentration will shift the ionization equilibrium between nh3 and nh4 towards nh3 3 5 effects of pcnb on microbial biomass and community 3 5 1 effects of pcnb on microbial biomass fig 7 showed the living cell amount on the substrate and electrodes on the substrate the living cell amount mainly presented a negative correlation with the pcnb concentrations but the introduction of bes ecw0 5572 245 cells g 1 could improve the microbial biomass on the substrate which was 1 87 times higher than that in cw0 1941 71 cells g 1 this was one of the important reasons for higher removal efficiency on nitrogen and pcnb in ecw0 an interesting thing was observed i e the microbial biomass in ecw8 wasn t inhibited compared with ecw1 while that in cw8 decreased to a similar level to cw20 may because the high pcnb degradation efficiency of bes resulted in the generation of additionally available organics for microbial growth in ecw8 however a too high concentration of pcnb would significantly decrease the microbial biomass on the substrate p 0 05 similar results were also observed in terms of microbial biomass on the electrodes which was consistent with the results of nitrogen mass balance the introduction of bes could significantly improve the microbial biomass on electrodes especially the anode because the anode was the main place for the degradation of available organics however the degradation of pcnb mainly occurred on the cathode because the oxidation of pcnb would cost much more energy than the reduction and the applied voltage in the present study was too low to perform the electrochemical oxidation of pcnb 3 5 2 effects of pcnb on functional gene abundance the gene amoa performs the encoding of ammonia monooxygenase which is involved in ammonia oxidation and can reflect the abundance of ammonia oxidation bacteria aob abundance kong et al 2010 the genes nsr narg and nosz were respectively involved in nitrite oxidation nitrate reduction and n2o reduction fig 8 a showed that the highest aob abundance was observed in cw0 which led to the optimal ammonia removal mentioned in section 3 1 1 after the addition of pcnb amoa gene abundance on the substrate of cw groups and ecw groups increased except for the ecw20 which indicated the 1 and 8 mg l 1 of pcnb would not completely inhibit the aob growth but the emergency high concentration of 20 mg l 1 would significantly decrease the ammonia oxidation performance in ecw similar results could be observed in terms of nsr fig 8b narg fig 8c and nosz fig 8d genes in addition at the same pcnb level amoa gene abundance in ecw groups was lower than that in cw groups which was one of the most important reasons for its lower ammonia removal in contrast nsr gene abundance in ecw groups was relatively higher than that in cw groups at the same pcnb level except for the ecw20 which was consistent with the result of lower nitrite accumulation in ecw groups than in cw groups similarly lower n2o emission from ecw groups was also benefited from the higher nosz gene abundance pcnb had less effect on narg genes on the substrate even at a high concentration of pcnb 20 mg l 1 thus there was no significant difference within the group of cw or ecw on nitrate removal on the electrodes the applied voltage could improve the abundance of the four functional genes especially the anode which was consistent with the results about microbial biomass and the gap between cw groups and ecw groups on nitrogen removal mainly came from the high abundance of functional genes on ecw electrodes however the abundance all declined as long as the pcnb was added indicating the functional bacteria on the electrodes were more sensitive to pcnb the positive correlation between pcnb and gene abundance on electrodes 1 mg l 1 may be resulted from the organic supplement by pcnb degradation in addition the abundance of denitrifiers narg and nosz were all higher than nitrifiers amoa and nsr especially on the electrodes mainly due to the suitable anaerobic or anoxic environment generated through the rapid oxygen consumption of bes 3 5 3 effects of pcnb on microbial community fig 9 demonstrated the microbe in all cw groups and ecw groups were mainly divided into 65 phyla microbial α diversity indexes table s1 revealed that microbial diversity in cw groups decreased after adding pcnb but had less impact on the substrate of ecw groups and the diversity on electrodes increased with the pcnb concentrations on the phyla level the primary phyla in all cw groups and ecw groups were proteobacteria 11 47 38 36 chloroflexi 15 04 40 10 and actinobacteriota 7 25 33 99 it is well known that a large proportion of bacteria involved in nitrification and denitrification belong to proteobacteria gao et al 2018 in addition previous studies showed that proteobacteria kondaveeti et al 2014 and chloroflexi wrighton et al 2010 were involved in biocathode denitrification and played an important role in nitrate removal in bes among them proteobacteria were the common electrochemically active bacteria eab logan and regan 2006 after the addition of pcnb proteobacteria proportion decreased in cw groups while increased in ecw groups actinobacteriota proportion increased in both cw groups and ecw groups except for the ecw20 and the high percentage of phylum patescibacteria was accumulated on the electrodes indicating ecw had more nitrogen removal potential than that of cw in terms of the microbial community on the genus level arthrobacter was one of the primary genera in all samples which was a kind of organic degrading bacteria and performed denitrification compared cw groups with ecw groups the genus proportion increased in cw groups with pcnb concentrations while decreased in ecw groups however the highest genus proportion was observed in ecw0 18 73 which resulted in the best nitrogen removal in ecw0 on electrodes the proportion in ecw groups with pcnb increased as the pcnb concentration increased especially on the cathodes indicating that arthrobacter may contribute to pcnb degradation in ecw groups due to its ability to remove chlorobenzene compounds westerberg et al 2000 another dominant genus was classified as caldilinea which was a kind of dnra bacteria as the pcnb concentration increased the proportion of the genus geobacter increased in both cw and ecw groups the highest 11 26 and the electrodes were also the critical carrier for the genus growth similarly dnra bacteria such as geobacter tang et al 2020 anaerolinea pan et al 2020 and bacillus soares castro et al 2019 were accumulated in ecw groups and their electrodes this was because the genera geobacter and bacillus were declared to be eab and favorite for growth on electrodes with current especially cathodes di et al 2020 additionally the high consumption of do in ecw groups provided a more suitable anaerobic environment for the growth of dnra bacteria and denitrifying bacteria such as rivibacter lactobacillus longilinea steroidobacter and aridibacter thus leading to the worse ammonia removal and better nitrate removal in ecw groups than in cw groups among these denitrifying bacteria the proportions of rivibacter steroidobacter and aridibacter had a positive correlation with pcnb concentrations which may be due to the supplement of carbon source for microbial growth from pcnb degradation the genus nitrosospira was the main ammonia oxidation bacteria in cw groups and ecw groups the highest proportion was observed in cw0 2 66 within cw groups while the cathode of ecw0 2 33 within ecw groups the proportion variation of nitrosospira with pcnb concentration was consistent with the results of ammonia removal and amoa gene abundance the genus propionimicrobium geobacter sporotomaculum pelolinea gemmatimonas sphingomonas devosia nocardioides and mycobacterium were the primary bacteria for pcnb degradation processes among them the genus propionimicrobium and geobacter were almost only detected in ecw groups and their proportions increased with pcnb concentrations which were reported to have the ability to reduce the nitro group williams 2015 yun et al 2017 therefore the genera were considered as the main pcnb degradation bacteria which contributed to the high pcnb degradation rate in ecw groups the genus sporotomaculum could encode the dehalogenase gene and perform the dechlorinating process fan et al 2017 in the present study a much higher proportion of the genus 1 29 2 62 was detected on the electrodes of ecw groups with pcnb therefore the sporotomaculum was the main genus for pcan dechlorinating among other dechlorinating bacteria i e sphingomonas and devosia the genus pelolinea chen et al 2020 and gemmatimonas zhang et al 2022 were reported to have the ability to degrade phenyl compounds and catalyze the open loop cleavage of benzene rings by generating dioxygenase in the present study much pelolinea was accumulated on the electrodes of ecw groups the highest 2 21 which was considered to be the responsible functional genus for an degradation the genera nocardioides and mycobacterium may also contribute to the process due to their ability on aromatic hydrocarbon compounds degradation in addition the genus candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus were only detected in ecw groups and were well known to be glycogen accumulating organisms gaos and they can consume various forms of glycogen to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates phas and enhance biological phosphorus removal burow et al 2007 similarly the genera halomonas chi et al 2021 and tetrasphaera liu et al 2019 were the typical phosphate accumulating organisms paos these genera were all much higher in ecw groups than that in cw groups which resulted in the higher phosphorus removal in ecw groups fig s8 the genus deinococcus was known as the great resistance to environmental hazards due to their dna repair system genes and multiple stress response genes xiong et al 2018 they also had the capacity to eliminate organic and inorganic cell toxic components gerber et al 2015 in the present study the proportion of deinococcus increased with the increase of pcnb concentrations in ecw while a lower proportion was observed in cw with 20 mg l 1 pcnb which indicated ecw had stronger resistance to pcnb on the microbial structure 4 conclusion in the present study ecw and cw were operated to investigate the effects of p chloronitrobenzene pcnb on nitrogen transformations in ecw results showed that as the pcnb concentration increased ammonia oxidation plant growth and microbial biomass in cw were inhibited to a certain extent however the introduction of bes could improve the tolerance of cw to pcnb through pcnb degradation with high efficiency the genera geobacter and propionimicrobium were considered to be the responsible pcnb degradation bacteria in the present study which performed the reduction of pcnb to pcan and further the an at the same time much higher tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in ecw groups which was 81 71 96 82 higher than cws lower n2o emission was observed in ecw groups than that in cw groups indicating the ecw has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas mitigation in addition ecw could improve the 1 87 times higher microbial biomass than cw on the substrate accordingly much higher functional gene abundance was observed in ecw groups which improved the potential of ecw to face extreme challenges therefore the introduction of bes could be an alternative technology to improve the tolerance of cw when treating industrial wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors

biorefractory compounds on nitrogen removal performance for the cws is far insufficient this study performed a critical assessment by using bes cw ecw and conventional cw cw to investigate the effects of p chloronitrobenzene pcnb on nitrogen transformations in cws the results showed that low concentration 1 mg l 1 of pcnb would inhibit the ammonia oxidation in cws while ecw could improve its tolerance to pcnb to a certain level 8 mg l 1 due to the high pcnb degradation efficiencies 2 5 times higher than cws accordingly much higher tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in ecws 81 71 96 82 tn higher than cws further leading to a lower n2o emission from ecws than cws the main intermediate of pcnb degradation was p chloroaniline pcan and the genera geobacter and propionimicrobium were consider to be the responsible pcnb degradation bacteria in the present study however too high concentration 20 mg l 1 of pcnb would have a huge impact on ecw and cw especially microbial biomass nevertheless ecw could improve the 1 87 times higher microbial biomass than cw on the substrate accordingly considerably higher functional gene abundance was observed in ecw therefore the introduction of bes has great potential to ensure cw stability when treating industrial wastewater containing bio refractory compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetland bioelectrochemical system p chloronitrobenzene nitrogen transformation 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is a kind of biologically engineered systems which is designed to treat wastewaters followed a sustainable and environmental friendly way ramirez vargas et al 2020 although cw is widely known as an ecological technology for advanced treatment of nitrogenous wastewater control of eutrophication and etc it is initially designed to effectively treat raw primary secondary or tertiary treated wastewaters from different origins dotro et al 2017 such as domestic drainage mining runoff industrial and agriculture effluents chen et al 2021 vymazal 2014 the gradual functional deterioration of constructed wetland in application mainly results from the high removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus in micro polluted water and the high time cost of removal on refractory organic pollutants in complex wastewater origins e g industrial effluent even though cw has the potential to degrade the refractory organic pollutants its efficiency is low and there are risks of toxic effects on cw functional microbial communities p chloronitrobenzene pcnb is a kind of important intermediate for chemical syntheses of medicines dyes herbicides and etc peng et al 2018 which has the characteristics of high persistence in industrial wastewater and poses a critical threat to humans and animals health such as acute chronic or persistent physiological toxicity given that the compound has been categorized as the priority pollutants by us epa and ec in china the discharge standard gb 8978 1996 for pcnb from wastewater treatment plants wwtps has also been promulgated 0 5 5 mg l 1 however it was reported that pcnb concentration in industrial wastewater could reach to 0 05 200 mg l 1 guo et al 2015 indicating that superior sewage treatment performance is required to meet the strict standard unfortunately the presence of electron withdrawing groups such as nitro and chloro on the benzene ring makes it difficult to be degraded under aerobic conditions but thermodynamic favorable to be reduced in anaerobic and anoxic conditions nevertheless low degradation rates and poor stability were always obtained in anaerobic and anoxic technologies xia et al 2011 what s worse peng et al 2018 reported that pcnb might inhibit bioactivity at a certain concentration thereby reducing the performance of processes based on biological technologies although there is rare discussion in literatures about the interaction between cw performance especially nitrogen transformations and pcnb the cw mostly relied on biological degradation may achieve similar results to common biological technologies such as the activated sludge method thus improvement of cw performance on pcnb degradation and mitigation of the inhibiting effects from pcnb through accelerating the transformation of pcnb to low toxic compounds are extremely necessary bioelectrochemistry system bes has been considered to be a promising technology for degradation of refractory organic pollutants and several successful applications were conducted in azo dyes nitrobenzene and halogenated aromatic compounds treatment jiang et al 2016 wang et al 2011 guo et al 2015 and xu et al 2016 have demonstrated biocathode has the ability to deoxidize the nitro group and dehalogenate the chloro group on the benzene ring when using a single bes or integrating bes with anaerobic processes the redox reactions reduction of nitro and chloro aromatic contaminants are mostly dependent on the concentration of pollutants the availability of electron donors and the competition with other electron acceptors on electron e g nitrate zhu et al 2012 the existence of bioelectrodes can reinforce the transformation of pollutants as electron donor and enhance the reduction property of anaerobic microbe lin et al 2011 therefore the introduction of bes into cw ecw has the potential to solved the problems within conventional cw mentioned above however rare discussion has been reported about the mutual influence between pcnb and ecw performance especially nitrogen transformations in the present study different concentrations of pcnb were used in the influent of cw to investigate the effects of pcnb on its performance of nitrogen transformations based on the principle of biological activation bes was introduced into cw aiming to directionally regulate electron transfer pathways activate metabolic pathways between microorganisms and pcnb assist microorganisms to cross the respiratory energy barrier and provide additional reducing power electrons to degrade pcnb finally accelerate the process of directional detoxification and dehalogenation of pcnb and remove its biological toxicity inhibition effects the mutual influence between pcnb and ecw was explored in the present study including aspects of wastewater purification greenhouse gas n2o emission plant growth microbial community and etc the study will propose a feasible solution for the improvement of functional diversity of conventional cw and provide the theoretical basis of degrading refractory organic pollutants in ecw 2 material andmethods 2 1 constructed wetlands set up and operation different types of wetlands with different pcnb concentrations in the influent i e conventional vertical subsurface cws and ecws ecw were operated at beijing china a polyethylene column of 300 mm diameter and 350 mm height was used as the microcosm of cws gravel and sand were selected as the substrate material in detail gravel 10 15 mm diameter was filled to 150 mm height of the bottom layer and at a volume ratio of 1 4 mixed substrate consisting of sand and gravel diameter 3 5 mm was placed at the upper layer 150 mm acting as filler and plant support layer iris pseudoacorus was planted in the substrate at a density of 85 strain m2 in the ecws fig s1 two stainless steel mesh electrodes were parallelly arranged horizontally in the upper and medium layers as the cathode and anode with a distance of 10 cm in order to improve the biocompatibility of electrodes a piece of carbon felt was added to each round electrode at the diameter of 30 cm the thickness of 6 mm and the pores diameter of 3 mm the electrodes in ecw were connected to a dc regulated power supply at a stable voltage of 0 1 v and a 20 ω resistor in the external circuit a keithley model 2700 data acquisition card tektronix inc beaverton or usa was used to automatically record the voltage on the resistor and the potential between electrodes and solid ag agcl2 reference electrode every 30 min an open circuit ecw ocw was built as a control system all cws were operated followed batch sequence strategy at 3 d hydraulic retention time hrt the volume of influent was 5 l 2 2 wastewater characteristics and determination the influent wastewater consisted of 8 mg l 1 nh4 n 12 mg l 1 no3 n 1 mg l 1 po4 3 p and 60 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod which was prepared by dissolving ammonium chloride potassium nitrate potassium dihydrogen phosphate and soluble starch in tap water respectively 10 revised hoagland s solution eliminate n p elements was added into the synthetic wastewater to meet the element demand of plant and microbe growth after the 37th d pcnb at concentrations of 0 mg l 1 1 mg l 1 and 8 mg l 1 were injected into three cws cw0 cw1 and cw8 respectively and three ecws ecw0 ecw1 and ecw8 respectively along with synsthetic wastewater influent respectively total ammonia nitrogen tan no2 n no3 n po4 3 p and cod in influent and effluent were measured every three days according to the standard methods described by apha 2005 however the measurement of no3 n concentration using spectrophotometry will be affected by pcnb therefore no3 n concentration was determined by ion chromatography 883 basic ic plus metrohm switzerland when pcnb was added into influent do concentration and water temperature were determined by do meter multi 3510 ids set 4 wtw germany and ph value was measured by a ph meter phs 3c leici china the concentrations of pcnb in influent and effluent and its products during degradation i e p chloroaniline pcan and aniline an were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 20ad shimazu japan at the mobile phase ratio methanol water of 7 3 through the calibration curve of the pure compounds relative to external standards at 265 nm for pcnb 240 nm for pcan and 231 nm for an respectively peng et al 2018 2 3 nitrogen content analysis because the concentration of nitrogen in gravel powder was too low to be detected nitrogen in the biofilm on a certain weight of gravel was used to evaluate the nitrogen content of the substrate in detail substrate samples were collected following the five point sampling method to make the samples representative then biofilm on substrate samples was washed into phosphate buffer saline pbs by ultrasound oscillation for 30 min and then extracted biofilm from pbs by filtering with 0 22 μm membrane gao et al 2018 finally biofilm plant and electrode samples were dried to constant weight and then grinded to pass 100 mesh sieves for further nitrogen content analysis nitrogen content of all samples was detected using an elementary analyzer vario macro cube elementar germany equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd as a bias of water purification cw has been found to be one of the most important sources of n2o emission mander et al 2014 therefore n2o emission was measured during the stable period in the present study gas samples were collected from all cws every 12 min using closed chamber methods zhang et al 2018 each sampling process lasted for 60 min and was conducted three times during 3 d hrt n2o concentrations in gas samples were detected by a gas chromatograph 7890b agilent usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd and gas emission fluxes were calculated using the equation reported by zhang et al 2005 supplementary material 2 4 microbial analysis adenosine triphosphate atp activity analysis was used to evaluate microbial biomass on the substrate and electrodes in different cws biofilm samples from substrate and electrodes were repeatedly stripped into pbs by a vortex mixer vortex 2 huxi shanghai and atp activity in the samples was determined using the bactiter glotm microbial cell viability assay kit no g8231 promega corporation dübendorf switzerland according to the manufacturer s protocol based on the bioluminescence theory wang et al 2020a the microbial community in the biofilm formed on the substrate and electrodes of all cws was analyzed by dna based molecular techniques mainly including real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and high throughput sequencing technology hts dna was extracted from the biofilm samples by using power soil dna isolation kit 12888 50 mobio usa according to the manufacturer s instructions due to the connection with nitrogen transformations amoa nsr nosz and narg genes were chosen to be quantified through qpcr assays using a real time pcr system linegene9600plus bori china qpcr was performed with the 20 μl of reaction mixture which contained 10 μl of sybr premix taq 0 4 μl of each of forward and reverse primer 7 2 μl of rnase free water and 2 μl of template dna zhi and ji 2014 the dna samples were amplified and sequenced by majorbio sanger bio pharm technology co ltd wang et al 2020b 2 5 statistics analysis microbial and water quality data presented in the present study was the mean of three replicates spss 17 0 ibm usa was used to statistically analyze whether microbial community functional genes and nitrogen content in different cws were statistically significant using the one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 3 results anddiscussion throughout the experimental period no obvious disease or death of plants was observed do and temperature in different cws were maintained at a similar level while ecw obtained higher ph values due to its better denitrification table 1 3 1 accelerated pcnb degradation in ecws 3 1 1 pcnb degradation performance fig 1 shows the performance of pcnb degradation in cw and ecw during the whole experiment and the results demonstrated that the introduction of bes to cw could greatly improve pcnb degradation efficiency both in low and high influent pcnb concentration conditions generally at different concentrations of pcnb the degradation efficiencies of ecw 81 74 20 46 and 90 34 7 19 for low and high conc respectively were approximately 2 5 times higher than cws 23 02 10 80 and 25 59 11 88 respectively fig 1 however it should be noted that pcnb degradation efficiencies reduced drastically with decreasing temperature fig s2 in both cw groups and ecwgroups especially at ecw with low pcnb influent concentration conditions the pcnb degradation efficiencies were almost reduced from 97 04 7 54 to 58 77 9 10 the average degradation efficiency in ecw was basically similar to the previous study with a single bes under room temperature 93 70 guo et al 2015 but the applied voltage 0 1 v in the present study was much lower than that in other studies 0 5 v the feasibility of low applied voltage for high degradation efficiencies mainly came from the advantages of cw with inherent redox potential gradient which could accelerate the formation of a suitable reduction potential environment for pcnb degradation the peak reduction potential 0 664 v yuan et al 2015 in which the redox potential on the cathode was between 0 50 and 0 66 v in the present study 3 1 2 pcnb degradation kinetics batch degradation experiments were carried out in the cw and ecw for investgated the pcnb degradation kinetics when systems were operated stably the protocol began with original pcnb concentrations of about 1 and 8 mg l 1 for degradation of 72 h in the cw and ecw under the room 20 2 c and lower 8 2 c temperature fig 2 fig 2 demonstrate that ecws were much faster than those of cws under all operating conditions thus the experimental results also indicated that pcnb degradation was accelerated due to the stimulation of the bio electrochemical module whose catabolism provided reductive electron carriers needed for pcnb broken bond reactions pcnb degradation trends suggested that the kinetics of pcnb removal fit the first order kinetic model dashed lines table 2 showed the best fit parameters and pearson r2 values for all operating conditions which pointed out that pcnb removal rates increased drastically with the introduction of bes to cw under the room and low temperature experiments for example at room temperature the ecw had k values of 49 9 10 3 and 33 6 10 3 h 1 for influent pcnb concentrations of about 1 and 8 mg l 1 respectively consequently ecw accelerated pcnb removal efficiencies by 15 6 and 11 3 times than cw this trend was reduced when cw operated at a lower temperature the k values of ecw also were 3 2 and 6 2 times of cw respectively this trend further supported that the bio electrochemical module provided reductive electron carriers needed for broken bond reactions used to initiate pcnb catabolism moreover during the room temperature the pcnb degradation rates table 2 observed in ecw were 0 034 0 003 and 0 159 0 011 g m 2 d 1 for low conc and high conc respectively which were 4 25 and 3 05 times of the cw the degradation rates in ecw were also higher than that in the previous study 0 058 g m 2 d 1 for the degradation of 2 mg l 1 pcnb using a hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor xia et al 2011 similar to k values when cw operated at lower temperatures the pcnb degradation rates in ecw also observed 150 and 273 higher than the cw in all groups pcnb degradation rates increased as the influent pcnb concentrations increased however too high concentrations may depress the microbial electrocatalytic process such as over 40 mg l 1 and further affect the removal of all pollutants peng et al 2018 according to the experimental results and our previous study guo et al 2015 the main pathways of pcnb degradation in ecw were proposed and shown in fig s3 i e pcnb could be reduced to pcan through unstable intermediates p chloronitrosobenzene and 2 amino 4 chlorophenol i e pcnsb and 2 4 acp and further dechlorinated to an on the cathode however the biological reaction by microorganism was more efficient to reduce the unstable intermediates leading to the simple pathway of directly reducing nitro to amino without intermediates accumulation therefore pcan and an were the main products of pcnb degradation in ecw and cw fig s4 showed the intermediate products of one cycle in the cw and ecw operated under lower temperature and low pcnb influent concentration condition the pcan and an concentrations increased along with the reduction of pcnb however the variation of an concentration increased and then decreased to 0 mg l 1 indicated there was a further reduction process as an transformation 3 2 the performance for nitrogen removal fig 3 and fig s5 showd how tn tan nitrate and nitrite changed in cw and ecw with different influent pcnb concentrations generally nitrogen removal efficiencies in both cw and ecw groups are all followed the negative relationship with pcnb influent concentration the cw0 and ecw0 observed the highest nitrogen removal efficiencies and the highest influent pcnb concentration with the lowest nitrogen removal efficiencies 3 2 1 tn removal for the tn removal performance fig 3a and b significant within group differences p 0 05 were all observed between high conc and other groups 35 18 11 91 and 69 24 7 86 for cw8 and ecw8 respectively however tn removal efficiencies in all groups of ecw were much higher than that in cws due to the gap between cw groups and ecw groups on nitrate removal the efficiencies in ecw groups 69 24 81 84 were also higher than that reported by wang et al 2020b with a range of 38 80 73 10 when treating the similar nitrogen content of the influent averagely ecw groups were 89 26 higher than cw groups and the advantage of ecws 81 71 96 82 improvement for no pcnb high conc were more obvious along with the increase of pcnb concentrations accordingly the nitrogen removal rate fig 3b of ecw groups 0 33 0 04 0 39 0 04 g n m 2 d 1 were about twice as high as that of cw groups 0 16 0 06 0 21 0 06 g n m 2 d 1 which indicated ecw had more resistance to pcnb than cw 3 2 2 nitrate removal a significant difference was observed in terms of nitrate removal fig 3c p 0 05 ecw groups presented much better nitrate removal efficiency 98 16 2 54 98 83 2 54 than that of cw groups 14 59 23 18 21 47 23 31 even under the pressure of pcnb which resulted from the enhanced microbial activity and electron transfer supported by the bes that was consistent with the results reported in other studies with the integration of bes and cw gao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 notably the removal efficiencies in ecw groups were all higher than that the highest 84 00 in the studies of gao et al gao et al 2017 gao et al 2018 mainly due to the longer hrt in the present study which indicated the importance of hrt with a low voltage in ecw however different concentrations of pcnb had few effects on nitrate removal in both cw groups and ecw groups similar results were obtained in terms of nitrate removal rate and nitrite removal fig 3d and fig s5b 3 2 3 tan removal fig s5a demonstrated that the tan concentrations in effluent of cw groups increased after the addition of pcnb on the 37th day and the increase rate expanded as the pcnb concentrations were raised however tan removal was enhanced after acclimatation for several days mainly due to the gradually increased do concentration in influent resulting from decreased temperature fig s2 the average tan removal efficiencies fig 3e of cw0 cw1 and cw8 are 97 24 5 14 94 43 8 54 and 68 07 18 06 with corresponding removal rates fig 3f of 0 19 0 01 0 19 0 02 and 0 13 0 04 g n m 2 d 1 ammonia accumulation was observed in all ecw groups and the average tan removal efficiencies of ecw0 ecw1 and ecw8 were observed 41 41 34 73 and 57 49 lower than the cw groups however the tan removal efficiencies in ecw0 was similar to that reported in other studies with similar nitrogen content in the influent of conventional cw lan et al 2018 and higher than that the highest 39 60 in the study of wang et al 2017 using the integration of bes and cw it s noted that low pcnb influent concentration had few effects on tan removal in ecw but ecw8 was more sensitive to the high concentration of pcnb high conc 8 mg l 1 and more severe ammonia accumulation was observed on the one hand the high consumption rate of do in ecw caused the inhibition of ammonia oxidation on the other hand the degradation of pcnb was probably one of the most important pathways of amino group production 3 3 effects of pcnb on nitrogen removal 3 3 1 effects of pcnb concentration on nitrogen removal fig 4 showed the periodic nitrogen transformation in cws and ecws under the stress of different concentrations of pcnb the results showed that tn removal tendencies of all the cws were well fitted to the first order kinetic equations fig 4a in the cw groups tn removal performances were greatly influenced by the influent pcnb concentration for instance the first order kinetics constant k of cw0 was 7 71 10 3 h 1 which is about 145 8 higher than cw8 moreover the k value of tn in ecw0 ecw1 and ecw8 were observed as 0 020 0 028 and 0 024 h 1 which were about 2 58 5 04 and 7 50 times the cw groups respectively the k values were also higher than that reported in the study 0 170 0 179 h 1 of fia et al 2021 and the review 0 06 0 16 d 1 of rousseau et al 2004 with conventional cws which demonstrated that the introduction of the bes module to cw can relieve the inhibition of pcnb on total nitrogen removal for the tan removal fig 4b the primary tan removal process occurred during the first 18 h in both cw and ecw groups however tan removal efficiencies and rates in the ecw groups were both lower than those in cw groups and with the increase of pcnb concentration the tan removal rates decreased which was consistent with the results observed in the long term experiment the reasons could be found in do variation fig s6 the dissolved oxygen rapidly decreased to the anaerobic anaerobic state within 4 hours after loading and the oxygen consumption rates of ecw groups were considerably faster than that of cw groups which confirmed the hypothesis mentioned above that one of the main reasons for the poor ammonia nitrogen removal of ecw was the rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen by bes in ecw dissolved oxygen was not only consumed by aerobic bacteria but also preferentially used as an electron acceptor in the reduction reaction on biocathode due to its high redox potential however whether or not there was pcnb tan removal in each wetland increased significantly in the later period of the cycle and the recovery levels of ecw groups were larger than cw groups therefore it was reasonable to assume that there was a possibility of regenerating tan in the system since the recovery of tan was also found in ecw0 and cw0 this phenomenon was not only caused by the generation of pcnb degradation but also by the process of dissimilation and reduction of nitrate to ammonium dnra dnra process was commonly observed in constructed wetlands often accompanied by poor ammonia removal efficiency and it has also been reported in constructed wetlands with electric intervention yu et al 2020 as for nitrite removal there was no apparent correlation between its variation and pcnb concentrations and as an intermediate product nitrite removal increased first and then decreased or maintained balance there was a significant difference between ecw groups and cw groups on nitrate removal p 0 05 due to the superior nitrification capacity the nitrate generation rate in cw groups was significantly higher than its reduction rate resulting in the accumulation of nitrate the higher nitrate removal rate was obtained in ecw groups which was consistent with the results mentioned above 3 3 2 effects of pcnb loading rate on nitrogen removal the effects of pcnb loading rate on nitrogen removal rate were investigated by gradually increasing the loading rate from 0 to 0 5 g m 2 d 1 initial pcnb concentration 0 20 mg l 1 fig 5 presented the relationship between pcnb loading rate and nitrogen removal rate nitrogen removal in ecw with low pcnb loading rate 0 20 g m 2 d 1 8 48 mg l 1 was similar to no pcnb group while obviously reduced nitrogen removal rate was observed with the increased loading rate 0 20 g m 2 d 1 8 48 mg l 1 however as long as pcnb loading rate increased the nitrogen removal in cw reduced and the relationship was consistent with a negative linear correlation eq 1 and eq 2s demonstrated the relationship between pcnb loading rate and nitrogen tn and tan removal rates 1 e c w t n r r 0 057 p c n b l r 0 379 r 2 0 422 c w t n r r 0 189 p c n b l r 0 190 r 2 0 806 2 e c w t a n r r 0 136 p c n b l r 0 128 r 2 0 856 c w t a n r r 0 344 p c n b l r 0 173 r 2 0 927 where tnrr and tanrr represent the tn and tan removal rate rr in different cws g n m 2 d 1 pcnblr represent the influent pcnb loading rate g m 2 d 1 for the tn and tan the slopes of the functions between ecw and pcnblr were much lower than the functions between cw and pcnblr these results further illustrated that introduction of bes to cw can significantly relieve the inhibition of pcnb on nitrogen removal the primary process inhibited by pcnb was ammonia oxidation accordingly tn removal notably nitrate removal rate almost kept at a stable level both in ecw and cw systems even the pcnb loading rate increased from 0 to 0 5 g m 2 d 1 3 4 effects of pcnb on nitrogen distribution nitrogen mass balance was used to evaluate the effects of pcnb on nitrogen distribution in cw and ecw with influent pcnb concentrations of 0 1 and 8 mg l 1 although cw was usually used as an end treatment process an extreme situation of 20 mg l 1 pcnb was added to the discussion to evaluate the performance of cw and ecw in an emergency fig 6 showed that nitrate was the main nitrogen form accumulated in cw groups while ammonia in ecw groups the increased pcnb concentrations raised the tan concentration in effluent of cw groups 4 93 16 59 as well as ecw groups 16 83 27 12 however due to the higher nitrate and nitrite removal lower nitrogen content was observed in the effluent of ecw groups nitrogen content on the substrate and electrodes could reflect microbial growth while similar nitrogen content on the substrate was detected in all cws 5 03 5 09 and ecws 4 66 4 70 much nitrogen accumulated on electrodes in ecw groups 4 26 4 75 even though it only occupied a small proportion of the whole ecw volume indicating the bes stimulated the accumulation of microbe on electrodes but when pcnb increased to 20 mg l 1 the percentage was lowered which suggested a too high concentration pcnb would inhibit the microbial growth to a certain extent nitrogen in plants could be used to evaluate plant growth under pressure from pcnb a negative correlation was observed in cw groups between pcnb concentrations and nitrogen in plants while a positive correlation in ecw groups except for the 20 mg l 1 group although plant growth in ecw without pcnb 7 91 was lower than that in cw 11 41 due to the too low nutrients content for plant growth after purification by bes the inhibition from pcnb on nitrogen removal in ecw could reduce the competition between bes process and plant assimilation on nutrients which indicated that ecw could enhance the tolerance of plants to pcnb which was consistent with the results of the reactive oxygen species ros content in plant fig s7 previous studies have reported the introduction of bes could stimulate the plants to increase the palisade cells chloroplast grana and thylakoid lamellas which could enhance the chlorophyll synthesis and effectively inhibit the accumulation of sulfide which has negative effects on plants and microbes ju et al 2014 song et al 2011 however a too high concentration of pcnb 20 mg l 1 would also deteriorate the plant growth on the contrary pcnb would increase the n2o emission from cws and ecws and n2o emission fluxes in cw groups and ecw groups all followed the positive correlation with pcnb concentrations however ecw groups could much reduce the n2o emission flux compared with cw groups at the same pcnb level and the higher the pcnb concentration was the more significant the gap such as ecw20 0 16 and cw20 0 32 this was mainly due to its high nitrate removal efficiency because nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor over n2o for denitrification and more nitrate existed in the system which was often the inducement of high n2o release hu et al 2012 moreover it s worth noting that nitrogen in others was main in the form of n2 which was the primary end product of biological denitrification and electrochemical nitrogen removal fig 6 demonstrated the nitrogen removal through n2 emission in cw groups and ecw groups followed the negative correlation with influent pcnb concentrations except ecw20 in ecw20 nh3 emission was possibly another pathway for nitrogen removal because a high ph value 7 84 0 12 caused by the electrolysis and a high tan concentration will shift the ionization equilibrium between nh3 and nh4 towards nh3 3 5 effects of pcnb on microbial biomass and community 3 5 1 effects of pcnb on microbial biomass fig 7 showed the living cell amount on the substrate and electrodes on the substrate the living cell amount mainly presented a negative correlation with the pcnb concentrations but the introduction of bes ecw0 5572 245 cells g 1 could improve the microbial biomass on the substrate which was 1 87 times higher than that in cw0 1941 71 cells g 1 this was one of the important reasons for higher removal efficiency on nitrogen and pcnb in ecw0 an interesting thing was observed i e the microbial biomass in ecw8 wasn t inhibited compared with ecw1 while that in cw8 decreased to a similar level to cw20 may because the high pcnb degradation efficiency of bes resulted in the generation of additionally available organics for microbial growth in ecw8 however a too high concentration of pcnb would significantly decrease the microbial biomass on the substrate p 0 05 similar results were also observed in terms of microbial biomass on the electrodes which was consistent with the results of nitrogen mass balance the introduction of bes could significantly improve the microbial biomass on electrodes especially the anode because the anode was the main place for the degradation of available organics however the degradation of pcnb mainly occurred on the cathode because the oxidation of pcnb would cost much more energy than the reduction and the applied voltage in the present study was too low to perform the electrochemical oxidation of pcnb 3 5 2 effects of pcnb on functional gene abundance the gene amoa performs the encoding of ammonia monooxygenase which is involved in ammonia oxidation and can reflect the abundance of ammonia oxidation bacteria aob abundance kong et al 2010 the genes nsr narg and nosz were respectively involved in nitrite oxidation nitrate reduction and n2o reduction fig 8 a showed that the highest aob abundance was observed in cw0 which led to the optimal ammonia removal mentioned in section 3 1 1 after the addition of pcnb amoa gene abundance on the substrate of cw groups and ecw groups increased except for the ecw20 which indicated the 1 and 8 mg l 1 of pcnb would not completely inhibit the aob growth but the emergency high concentration of 20 mg l 1 would significantly decrease the ammonia oxidation performance in ecw similar results could be observed in terms of nsr fig 8b narg fig 8c and nosz fig 8d genes in addition at the same pcnb level amoa gene abundance in ecw groups was lower than that in cw groups which was one of the most important reasons for its lower ammonia removal in contrast nsr gene abundance in ecw groups was relatively higher than that in cw groups at the same pcnb level except for the ecw20 which was consistent with the result of lower nitrite accumulation in ecw groups than in cw groups similarly lower n2o emission from ecw groups was also benefited from the higher nosz gene abundance pcnb had less effect on narg genes on the substrate even at a high concentration of pcnb 20 mg l 1 thus there was no significant difference within the group of cw or ecw on nitrate removal on the electrodes the applied voltage could improve the abundance of the four functional genes especially the anode which was consistent with the results about microbial biomass and the gap between cw groups and ecw groups on nitrogen removal mainly came from the high abundance of functional genes on ecw electrodes however the abundance all declined as long as the pcnb was added indicating the functional bacteria on the electrodes were more sensitive to pcnb the positive correlation between pcnb and gene abundance on electrodes 1 mg l 1 may be resulted from the organic supplement by pcnb degradation in addition the abundance of denitrifiers narg and nosz were all higher than nitrifiers amoa and nsr especially on the electrodes mainly due to the suitable anaerobic or anoxic environment generated through the rapid oxygen consumption of bes 3 5 3 effects of pcnb on microbial community fig 9 demonstrated the microbe in all cw groups and ecw groups were mainly divided into 65 phyla microbial α diversity indexes table s1 revealed that microbial diversity in cw groups decreased after adding pcnb but had less impact on the substrate of ecw groups and the diversity on electrodes increased with the pcnb concentrations on the phyla level the primary phyla in all cw groups and ecw groups were proteobacteria 11 47 38 36 chloroflexi 15 04 40 10 and actinobacteriota 7 25 33 99 it is well known that a large proportion of bacteria involved in nitrification and denitrification belong to proteobacteria gao et al 2018 in addition previous studies showed that proteobacteria kondaveeti et al 2014 and chloroflexi wrighton et al 2010 were involved in biocathode denitrification and played an important role in nitrate removal in bes among them proteobacteria were the common electrochemically active bacteria eab logan and regan 2006 after the addition of pcnb proteobacteria proportion decreased in cw groups while increased in ecw groups actinobacteriota proportion increased in both cw groups and ecw groups except for the ecw20 and the high percentage of phylum patescibacteria was accumulated on the electrodes indicating ecw had more nitrogen removal potential than that of cw in terms of the microbial community on the genus level arthrobacter was one of the primary genera in all samples which was a kind of organic degrading bacteria and performed denitrification compared cw groups with ecw groups the genus proportion increased in cw groups with pcnb concentrations while decreased in ecw groups however the highest genus proportion was observed in ecw0 18 73 which resulted in the best nitrogen removal in ecw0 on electrodes the proportion in ecw groups with pcnb increased as the pcnb concentration increased especially on the cathodes indicating that arthrobacter may contribute to pcnb degradation in ecw groups due to its ability to remove chlorobenzene compounds westerberg et al 2000 another dominant genus was classified as caldilinea which was a kind of dnra bacteria as the pcnb concentration increased the proportion of the genus geobacter increased in both cw and ecw groups the highest 11 26 and the electrodes were also the critical carrier for the genus growth similarly dnra bacteria such as geobacter tang et al 2020 anaerolinea pan et al 2020 and bacillus soares castro et al 2019 were accumulated in ecw groups and their electrodes this was because the genera geobacter and bacillus were declared to be eab and favorite for growth on electrodes with current especially cathodes di et al 2020 additionally the high consumption of do in ecw groups provided a more suitable anaerobic environment for the growth of dnra bacteria and denitrifying bacteria such as rivibacter lactobacillus longilinea steroidobacter and aridibacter thus leading to the worse ammonia removal and better nitrate removal in ecw groups than in cw groups among these denitrifying bacteria the proportions of rivibacter steroidobacter and aridibacter had a positive correlation with pcnb concentrations which may be due to the supplement of carbon source for microbial growth from pcnb degradation the genus nitrosospira was the main ammonia oxidation bacteria in cw groups and ecw groups the highest proportion was observed in cw0 2 66 within cw groups while the cathode of ecw0 2 33 within ecw groups the proportion variation of nitrosospira with pcnb concentration was consistent with the results of ammonia removal and amoa gene abundance the genus propionimicrobium geobacter sporotomaculum pelolinea gemmatimonas sphingomonas devosia nocardioides and mycobacterium were the primary bacteria for pcnb degradation processes among them the genus propionimicrobium and geobacter were almost only detected in ecw groups and their proportions increased with pcnb concentrations which were reported to have the ability to reduce the nitro group williams 2015 yun et al 2017 therefore the genera were considered as the main pcnb degradation bacteria which contributed to the high pcnb degradation rate in ecw groups the genus sporotomaculum could encode the dehalogenase gene and perform the dechlorinating process fan et al 2017 in the present study a much higher proportion of the genus 1 29 2 62 was detected on the electrodes of ecw groups with pcnb therefore the sporotomaculum was the main genus for pcan dechlorinating among other dechlorinating bacteria i e sphingomonas and devosia the genus pelolinea chen et al 2020 and gemmatimonas zhang et al 2022 were reported to have the ability to degrade phenyl compounds and catalyze the open loop cleavage of benzene rings by generating dioxygenase in the present study much pelolinea was accumulated on the electrodes of ecw groups the highest 2 21 which was considered to be the responsible functional genus for an degradation the genera nocardioides and mycobacterium may also contribute to the process due to their ability on aromatic hydrocarbon compounds degradation in addition the genus candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus were only detected in ecw groups and were well known to be glycogen accumulating organisms gaos and they can consume various forms of glycogen to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates phas and enhance biological phosphorus removal burow et al 2007 similarly the genera halomonas chi et al 2021 and tetrasphaera liu et al 2019 were the typical phosphate accumulating organisms paos these genera were all much higher in ecw groups than that in cw groups which resulted in the higher phosphorus removal in ecw groups fig s8 the genus deinococcus was known as the great resistance to environmental hazards due to their dna repair system genes and multiple stress response genes xiong et al 2018 they also had the capacity to eliminate organic and inorganic cell toxic components gerber et al 2015 in the present study the proportion of deinococcus increased with the increase of pcnb concentrations in ecw while a lower proportion was observed in cw with 20 mg l 1 pcnb which indicated ecw had stronger resistance to pcnb on the microbial structure 4 conclusion in the present study ecw and cw were operated to investigate the effects of p chloronitrobenzene pcnb on nitrogen transformations in ecw results showed that as the pcnb concentration increased ammonia oxidation plant growth and microbial biomass in cw were inhibited to a certain extent however the introduction of bes could improve the tolerance of cw to pcnb through pcnb degradation with high efficiency the genera geobacter and propionimicrobium were considered to be the responsible pcnb degradation bacteria in the present study which performed the reduction of pcnb to pcan and further the an at the same time much higher tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in ecw groups which was 81 71 96 82 higher than cws lower n2o emission was observed in ecw groups than that in cw groups indicating the ecw has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas mitigation in addition ecw could improve the 1 87 times higher microbial biomass than cw on the substrate accordingly much higher functional gene abundance was observed in ecw groups which improved the potential of ecw to face extreme challenges therefore the introduction of bes could be an alternative technology to improve the tolerance of cw when treating industrial wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors
