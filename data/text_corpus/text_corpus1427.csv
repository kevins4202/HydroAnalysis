7135,performance of environmental justice models depends on the level of accuracy in measuring or estimating the health of the environment in the past decades and especially in the area of stream health modeling significant improvement has been observed however the impacts of these improvements on the robustness of environmental justice models have not been evaluated therefore in this study the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice modeling was evaluated the saginaw river basin in michigan was considered as the study area and four major ecological indices evaluating the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to instream stressors were used for stream health assessment seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic indices were evaluated at three census levels of county census tract and block group then the ecological socioeconomic and physiographic indices were used in the development of stream health based environmental justice models results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant indices and a using two phase modeling approach not only improved the performance of stream health predictive models but also reduced the sensitivity of environmental justice models to aggregation at different census levels in addition using improved stream health indices reduced the redundancy of the independent variables socioeconomic and physiographic indices where the total number of significant parameters was reduced from 171 to 115 besides that more robust and meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among stream health measures and environmental justice parameters at different spatial levels in summary having a reliable stream health information is the key for development of robust environmental justice models as evidence by improving model predictability and eliminating contradictory results compared to previous studies keywords ecohydrology socioeconomic conditional autoregressive bayesian 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have degraded natural resources which in turn also threatens human ecosystems due to the interwoven nature of natural and human system interactions liu et al 2007 carpenter et al 2009 alberti et al 2011 however degraded environments do not equally affect various groups in society and some communities such as low income and people of color are more vulnerable to environmental hazards than other groups massey 2004 downey and hawkins 2008 therefore the concept of environmental justice was introduced to provide fair treatment and involvement of all social groups in implementation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations u s epa 2014 in other words the aim of environmental justice is providing equal access to healthy environments as right for all people water is one of the environmental resources that is considered in the environmental justice studies in the u s the traditional approach for water resources assessment was mainly focused on water quality and physical characteristics however a nationwide assessment of riverine ecosystems that was performed by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa found that despite all implemented water quality regulations still more than 40 of nation s streams were in poor biological condition u s epa 2015 therefore a new criterion called biological integrity assessment was introduced in which the physical chemical and biological characteristics of streams should be simultaneously considered to improve the overall assessment of water resources u s epa 2011 u s epa 2015 woznicki et al 2015 this was achieved by the introduction of stream health indices which quantify the response of aquatic species to instream stressors herman and nejadhashemi 2015 van metre et al 2017 however monitoring stream health indices in a large area is both expensive and time consuming therefore modeling approaches have been used to estimate stream health indices woznicki et al 2016a the general inputs to these models are landscape features and in instream water quantity and water quality parameters miserendino et al 2011 einheuser et al 2012 traditionally linear regression frimpong et al 2005 pont et al 2009 moya et al 2011 and multivariate techniques simpson and norris 2000 aguiar et al 2011 were used for stream health model development later nonlinear techniques such as fuzzy logic adriaenssens et al 2006 marchini et al 2009 artificial neural network ann lencioni et al 2007 mathon et al 2013 and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis einheuser et al 2012 2013 were used to improve model predictabilities despite all of these improvements the predictive power of stream health models is moderate mainly due to the complexity of natural systems woznicki et al 2015 meanwhile further improvements were achieved when in the early 2010s poff and zimmerman 2010 highlighted the importance of flow alteration on ecological response in particular the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flow are master variables that affect aquatic species poff et al 1997 olden and poff 2003 poff and zimmerman 2010 therefore several tools such as the hydrological index tool hit usgs 2017 eflowstats archfield et al 2014 and matlab hydrological index tool mhit abouali et al 2016a were developed to incorporate ecologically relevant hydrological indices studies showed that these indices significantly improved the accuracy of stream health predictive models herman et al 2015 herman et al 2016 abouali et al 2016b one of the applications of steam health models is to describe the environmental conditions that impact human well being and therefore relate to the concept of environmental justice as a result the concept of biological integrity assessment has recently been introduced in environmental justice studies through integration of stream health models sanchez et al 2014 used spatial regression models and bivariate mapping to find vulnerable social communities they used four common stream health indices for fish and macroinvertebrates and nine socioeconomic indices representing education housing income population and race collected at the census tract level the results were promising and showed high correlations between regions with the lowest stream health status and vulnerable social communities sanchez et al 2014 sanchez et al 2015 also introduced spatial clustering which improved the predictability of environmental justice models daneshvar et al 2016 further improved the model predictabilities through the introduction of multilevel socioeconomic and physiographic census information however all three studies sanchez et al 2014 2015 daneshvar et al 2016 used the same nonlinear stream health modeling approach these studies showed relationships between stream health indices and socioeconomic variables however in several cases these relationships were either very weak or contradictory therefore there is a need to explore the cause of these deficiencies as described earlier the variability in the stream health model performance can introduce a large level of error on stream health based environmental justice models however new developments in stream health modeling such as the two phase approach abouali et al 2016b has resulted in significant improvement in the overall predictability for both fish and macroinvertebrate based stream health models therefore the goal of this study is to assess the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice models by comparing the results against previous studies our hypothesis was that more accurate stream health predictions would result in the development of more robust environmental justice models in which spatial dependencies among biological and socioeconomic characteristics at different spatial levels would be revealed in order to examine this hypothesis we tested three objectives considering results from former and current stream health models by comparing the level of 1 interdependence between stream health indices and socioeconomic and physiographical parameters 2 spatial dependency for single level environmental justice models and 3 improvement for multilevel environmental justice models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the saginaw river basin which is located in the state of michigan u s a was selected as the study area fig 1 with the total drainage area of more than 16 000 km2 it is the largest watershed in michigan and drains to lake huron agricultural lands are the dominant landuse 36 2 followed by forest 24 8 wetland lake 14 3 pasture 12 4 and urban 12 3 lands the u s epa identified the saginaw river and bay as an area of concern due to degraded fisheries sediment pollution and loss of recreational values u s epa 2017 agricultural and urban runoff industrial discharges and sewer overflows are some major sources of pollution in this region u s epa 2017 with more than 7 000 miles of streams the saginaw river basin provides a wide range of habitats for fish and other species win 2017 it also addresses the needs for drinking water electrical power generation and industrial consumption in this region win 2017 according to the u s census bureau 2010 the saginaw river basin is home of almost 1 5 million people where 49 are men and 51 are women the majority of residents are young and more than 52 of them are in the range of 25 to 65 years old 34 are under 25 years old while only 14 are senior above 65 years old more than 85 of population is white followed by african american 10 while other races are less than 5 the saginaw river is also a key shipping transit in mid michigan that connects two cities saginaw and bay city flint is another big city in this region that has faced water contamination problems u s epa 2013 2 2 stream health indices four common stream health indices including 1 the index of biotic integrity ibi for fish and 2 the hilsenhoff biotic intex hbi 3 family index of biotic integrity fibi and 4 ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera ept index for macroinvertebrates were used in order to assess the biological integrity of riverine ecosystems the ibi is a multi metric index first developed in the 1980 s that evaluates stream conditions by measuring 12 metrics that describe the species richness abundance and trophic composition of fish communities karr 1981 kerans and karr 1994 these metrics are given individual scores that are summed to calculate an overall measure of stream health with score ranges from zero poor condition to 100 pristine condition herman and nejadhashemi 2015 meanwhile the hbi first developed in the 1970 s evaluates stream conditions with respect to organic pollution by identifying all of the taxa found in the stream and determining their tolerances to organic pollution hilsenhoff 1987 after identifying all taxa present an average score is calculated with scores ranging from zero pristine condition to 10 poor condition which is used to classify organic pollution based stream degradation hilsenhoff 1987 the fibi first developed in the 1990 s is the third index used in this study and is a multi metric stream health index based on the ibi kerans and karr 1994 unlike the ibi though the fibi evaluates stream conditions by evaluating the response of macroinvertebrate communities to industrial pollutants by measuring 13 metrics that describe the species richness abundance and trophic composition of macroinvertebrate communities kerans and karr 1994 similar to the ibi these metrics are scored individually and then aggregated to produce an overall stream health score with scores ranging from zero poor condition to 45 pristine condition woznicki et al 2015 the final stream health index used in this study was the ept index which was first developed in the 1980s lenat 1988 this index utilizes the sensitivity of three macroinvertebrate orders namely ephemeroptera mayflies plecoptera stoneflies and trichoptera caddisflies to organic pollution to evaluate local instream degradations woznicki et al 2015 scores for the ept index are based on the abundance and richness of the ept taxa with zero scores representing high levels of degradation woznicki et al 2015 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq has quantified the fish index ibi and the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept for 193 and 262 monitoring sites within the saginaw river basin respectively mdeq 1997 seelbach and wiley 1997 these monitoring sites are shown in fig 1 however since there are 13 831 stream segments in the basin stream health models need to be developed for both fish and macroinvertebrates indices to estimate the overall biological conditions of streams beyond the monitoring sites 2 3 socioeconomic physiographic indices socioeconomic indices representing concentrated disadvantages are commonly used for environmental justice assessments sampson et al 2008 in this study sixteen frequently used indices for population age race housing education and income disadvantages assessment are taken into account and are listed in table 1 brulle and pellow 2006 bullard et al 2008 sampson et al 2008 lin and morefield 2011 these indices are obtained from the u s census bureau for three census levels of county census tract and block group u s census bureau 2010 the saginaw river basin overlaps with 21 393 and 1076 census units of counties fig 2 a census tracts fig 2 b and block groups fig 2 c respectively in addition to sixteen socioeconomic indices one physiographic index called drainage density was also used to quantify the relative distance of population under study to waterbodies drainage density was calculated as the ratio of the total length of streams in a census unit of county census tract or block group to the unit area daneshvar et al 2016 2 4 modeling process fig 3 illustrates the modeling process used to predict the stream health indices beyond the monitoring sites and the analysis conducted for the stream health based environmental justice assessments a hydrologic water quality model was initially setup calibrated and validated for the study area to estimate streamflow and water quality parameters including sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for each stream segment on a daily time step the estimated flow and water quality parameters were used as inputs to the matlab hydrological index tool mhit that calculates ecologically relevant water quality and water quantity indices abouali et al 2016a these indices quantify the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change in flow and water quality parameters that can affect aquatic ecosystems poff et al 1997 henriksen et al 2006 mhit outputs were then used to develop stream health predictive models for this purpose a two phase approach abouali et al 2016b was implemented in which 1 partial least square regression plsr was used to predict the initial stream health indices and their associated errors and then 2 a fuzzy logic approach e g anfis was used to estimate the modified stream health indices based on the initial estimations and associated errors having the four predicted stream health measures along with 17 socioeconomic and physiographic indices at three census levels of county census tract and block group the individual correlations among indices were evaluated and the stream health based environmental justice models were developed since these two datasets are in different spatial units one at the stream level and one at the census levels scale adjustment was conducted first in which weighted average scores based on stream lengths falling in each census unit were used as their associated stream health scores the process is similar to the one performed by daneshvar et al 2016 except the highlighted sections in fig 3 in the former study a nonlinear one phase approach was used to build the stream health models using only water quality and quantity parameters obtained from the hydrological model while here the water quality and quantity parameters were first converted into ecologically relevant indices and then used to build stream health models using the two phase approach 2 4 1 hydrological water quality modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop a hydrologic water quality model for the study area swat is a physically based and semi distributed watershed and water quality model developed by u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars in order to evaluate the impact of land management practices on water quantity and water quality arnold et al 1998 swat delineates a watershed into subwatersheds with unique stream segments passing through them with each subwatershed being divided into several hydrologic response units hrus based on similarity in landuse soil and slope variations within the region neitsch et al 2011 in this study a pre delineated watershed developed by michigan institute of fisheries research was used in which the study area was divided into 13 831 subwatersheds with unique hrus the developed swat model was then calibrated based on three statistical criteria including 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 2 percent bias pbias and 3 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 nse ranges from one optimum value to minus infinity pbias ranges from minus infinity to infinity with optimum value of zero and rsr ranges from zero optimum value to infinity moriasi et al 2007 for both streamflow and water quality components nse above 0 5 and rsr below 0 7 are considered satisfactory while the satisfactory range for pbias varies based on the variable in question where absolute pbiass below 25 55 and 70 are called satisfactory for streamflow sediment and nutrients respectively moriasi et al 2007 streamflow was calibrated and validated based on daily streamflow data collected by the u s geological survey usgs for nine monitoring stations within the region while water quality including sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were calibrated and validated based on monthly observations provided by the u s epa daneshvar et al 2017 all three statistical criteria were met for streamflow nses ranging from 0 54 to 0 80 pbiass ranging from 16 34 to 1 53 and rsrs ranging from 0 68 to 0 45 and water quality nses ranging from 0 57 to 0 75 pbiass ranging from 35 52 to 10 00 and rsrs ranging from 0 65 to 0 50 components calibration and validation table a1 the calibrated swat model was then used to evaluate streamflow sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for all stream segments on a daily basis 2 4 2 stream health model development 2 4 2 1 one phase approach fuzzy logic and anfis models developed by einheuser et al 2012 2013 were used in former stream health based environmental justice studies by sanchez et al 2014 2015 and daneshvar et al 2016 this technique is commonly used for ecological modeling woznicki et al 2016a however their inputs are limited due to computational resources and finite ecological observations hamaamin et al 2013 therefore parameter selection must be conducted first to limit models inputs woznicki et al 2015 einheuser et al 2012 2013 used spearman s rank correlation to find the most significant water quantity and water quality parameters with respect to stream health measures which reduced the number of inputs to four for each macroinvertebrates index einheuser et al 2012 and five for the fish index einheuser et al 2013 selected input parameters for this approach are listed in table a2 these input parameters were defined as membership functions in the fuzzy logic approach these functions were graphically represented and contain information about the importance weight of different input parameters at the start a partitioning technique was used to create fuzzy inference system parameters then the shape of the membership function was selected and rules for the training and testing of the models were established einheuser et al 2012 finally the 10 fold cross validation technique was used to examine the accuracy of all stream health predictive models and to identify the best model 2 4 2 2 two phase approach to address the drawback of limited input parameters a two phase approach abouali et al 2016b was used in this study where during the first phase all input parameters will be used to estimate the stream health index and associated error while during the second phase anfis will use these two predictions as inputs to estimate the final stream health score the general stream health model can be described as abouali et al 2016b 1 y y x ε where y is the observed stream health index y is the predicted stream health index as a function of set of x that represents stream health conditions e g water quality and quantity parameters and ε is the degree of error between the observed and the predictive values of the stream health index the degree of error in the stream health model can also be presented using eq 2 2 ε ε x ε where ε is the predicted error for the stream health index as a function of set of x that represents stream health conditions and ε is the degree of error between the observed and the predictive errors in the phase of the study two sets of linear models were developed t o p r e d i c t t h e s t r e a m h e a l t h i n d e x a n d t h e d e g r e e o f e r r o r i n e s t i m a t i n g t h e s t r e a m h e a l t h i n d e x t h e n t h e s e t w o s e t s o f m o d e l s w e r e u s e d t o d e v e l o p t h e f i n a l n o n l i n e a r s t r e a m h e a l t h p r e d i c t i v e m o d e l i n t h e s e c o n d p h a s e o f s t u d y to predict the stream health index and the degree of error in estimating the stream health index then these two sets of models were used to develop the final nonlinear stream health predictive model in the second phase of study plsr was used for the first phase to project both the inputs and outputs into a mutually orthogonal coordinate system plsr is able to use all input parameters and unlike regular linear regressions it is not affected by multicollinearity that may exist among input parameters therefore all 171 ecologically relevant hydrologically indices introduced by poff et al 1997 in addition to the 78 water quality parameters representing annual and seasonal averages and coefficients of variations were used as input parameters for the first phase these plsr predictions of stream health indices and their associated errors were used as inputs for the anfis models in the second phase table a2 summarizes the two phase input parameters during the second phase two different sets of stream health predictive models were developed one set for all streams and then another set for different stream groups based on the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 instream species characteristics vary across different stream sizes that can be classified into three major groups of headwater stream orders 1 3 medium stream orders 4 7 and large stream orders 7 10 streams the maximum stream order within the saginaw river basin is 7 fig 1 therefore two stream groups of headwater streams orders 1 3 and medium and large streams orders 4 7 were defined and different stream health predictive models were developed for each group then the set of stream health predictive models with a better performance was used to calculate the four stream health measures for all 13 831 stream segments 2 5 data analysis scatter plot matrices were developed for each census level in which histograms pairwise distributions and pairwise correlation coefficients were evaluated for all indices including the four stream health measures and the seventeen socioeconomic physiographic indicators spearman s ranking was used for pairwise correlation coefficients evaluation lehmann 1998 in order to evaluate spatial dependencies among stream health measures and socioeconomic physiographic indices the spatial conditional autoregressive car technique banerjee et al 2004 was used to develop stream health based environmental justice models eq 3 represents the general form of car model used in this study 3 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 m i γ i w i 1 i 1 2 i census units in which y i and x i represent the stream health measure and the corresponding p covariates vector for the i th census unit e g county census tract or block group spatial neighborhood dependencies for the i census units are represented by w i and the number of neighbors are listed as diagonal entries of the m i matrix variation and spatial dependency are also measured by τ i 2 and γ i respectively in order to assess the significance of spatial dependency two simplified forms of the spatial car model were also developed as follows i assuming γ i 0 means no spatial dependence while the residual variance is weighted by the number of neighbors this simplifies the spatial model to a weighted regression model as shown in eq 4 4 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 m i 1 i 1 2 i census units i while setting γ i 0 and m i i i the identity matrix means no spatial information is implemented and the spatial model will be simplified to an ordinary regression model as shown in eq 5 5 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 i i i 1 2 i census units these three forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression were used to develop single level with no random effect and multilevel with random effect models at three census levels of county census tract and block group 2 5 1 single level with no random effect models assuming 1 2 i j 1 2 j and k 1 2 k represent the number of counties census tracts and block groups respectively the single level with no random effect car models at the three census levels are presented as follow 4 1 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 d i γ i i 1 2 i 4 2 y j x j β ε j ε ñ 0 τ j 2 d j γ j j 1 2 j 4 3 y k x k β ε k ε ñ 0 τ k 2 d k γ k k 1 2 k where using full forms of d i γ i m i γ i w i 1 d j γ j m j γ j w j 1 and d k γ k m k γ k w k 1 resulted in spatial models development while d i γ i m i 1 d j γ j m j 1 and d k γ k m k 1 implementations resulted in weighted regression models at three census levels of county census tract and block group respectively ordinary regression models are also developed by setting d i γ i i i d j γ j i j and d k γ k i k for the three levels of county census tract and block group respectively 2 5 2 multilevel with random effect models since the three census levels of county census tract and block group are nested the total number of census tracts is j i 1 i j i where j i is the number of census tracts in the i th county and the total number of block groups is k j 1 j k j i 1 i j 1 j i k j where k j is the number of block groups in the j th census tract to assess the nested effect of aggregated data at different spatial levels multilevel with random effect models were also developed for the census tract and block group levels as follows 1 multilevel with random effect models at the census tract level implementation of the random effects of data collected at the census tract and county levels resulted in the following form of the spatial car model at the census tract level 6 y ij x ij β u i ε ij ε ñ 0 τ j 2 d γ j u ñ 0 τ i 2 d γ i j 1 2 j i i 1 2 i where u and ε represent the residual terms at two levels of county and census tract respectively d γ i and d γ j can be either in spatial weighted regression or ordinary regression form and their combination will result in 3 3 9 different multilevel with random effect models 2 multilevel with random effect models at the block group level implementation of the random effects of data collected at the block group census tract and county levels resulted in the development of the following form of the spatial car model at the block group level 7 y ijk x ijk β u i v ij ε ijk ε ñ 0 τ k 2 d γ k k 1 2 k j v ñ 0 τ j 2 d γ j j 1 2 j i u ñ 0 τ i 2 d γ i i 1 2 i where u v and ε represent the residual terms at the three levels of county census tract and block group respectively combinations of the three forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression implementation of d γ i d γ j and d γ k will result in the development of 3 4 4 3 45 multilevel with random effect models while only one of d γ i or d γ j can be zero not both at the same time for both the single level with no random effect and multilevel with random effect analysis markov chain monte carlo mcmc was used to estimate parameters six chains with different initial values were used for each model and were run for 6000 iterations the last 1000 samples after convergence for each chain were then used as posterior samples deviance information criterion dic4 was used for model comparison celeux et al 2006 which measures both model simplicity and model fit at the same time and models with lower dics are preferred 3 results and discussion 3 1 stream health indices comparison of the stream health model performances when all streams were used for development of the predictive model reveals that the two phase approach used in this study has outperformed the former predictive models for all four stream health measures within all streams tables 2 and a3 present the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse of current two phase approach and former one phase approach developed stream health predictive models the fish index ibi has the highest improvement compared to previous approach where a r2 of 0 89 and rmse of 7 56 are achieved compared to the former r2 of 0 48 and rmse of 16 37 this shows that incorporating larger sets of ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters 249 and combining the two methods of plsr and anfis resulted in more accurate predictions of stream health measures rather than just using the one phase fuzzy logic model with a few water quantity and water quality parameters 4 5 especially for fish that are highly sensitive to ecologically relevant flow parameters poff and zimmerman 2010 the next two columns of tables 2 and a3 summarize the performance of the stream health predictive models developed for two stream classes of headwater streams and medium and large streams results show that for all stream health indices models developed for the two classes have better performances with r2 values ranging from 0 90 to 0 97 and rmse values ranging from 0 11 to 6 24 than models developed for all streams combined with r2 values ranging from 0 70 to 0 89 and rmse values ranging from 0 27 to 7 56 for instance r2 values of 0 97 and 0 91 were achieved for the ept predictive models for the two stream classes instead of the 0 72 obtained for the ept predictive model for all streams combined a similar trend was also observed for rmse for instance rmse values of 0 73 and 1 10 were achieved for the ept predictive models for the two stream classes instead of the 2 04 obtained for the ept predictive model for all streams combined this is due to the fact that species are often found in specific stream classes and have different responses to stressors mcmanamay et al 2014 herman et al 2015 so distinct models for different stream classes are preferred to models that are developed for all streams especially for macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept that are more sensitive to local impairment than fish kerans and karr 1994 the new developed stream health predictive models for two stream classes were then used to simulate the four stream health indices beyond the sampling points fig a1 and their predictions are compared with the one phase approach by calculating the absolute percent of change in prediction nejadhashemi et al 2011 as shown in table 3 results show that hbi scores have the lowest deviation from the results obtained in the one phase approach where 71 2 of headwater streams and 91 1 of medium and large streams have less than a 25 change in scores meanwhile the highest changes are found in the ibi prediction for headwater streams where 38 8 of streams in this class have more than a 75 change in score prediction the level of change in the models predictabilities one phase vs two phase is mainly related to the number of independent variables used to develop the models and the capabilities of the models to identify the true relationships between independent and dependent variables as explained earlier the number of independent variables that were used for development of the one phase models were limited meanwhile in the two phase approach this problem was solved and the model used all independent variables as a result the highest changes are found in the ibi prediction due to the high dependency of the fish index on ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters poff and zimmerman 2010 meanwhile the hbi is less sensitive to these parameters due to the fact that it measures the response of aquatic species to organic pollutants hilsenhoff 1987 similarly other macroinvertebrates indices fibi and ept are less sensitive to the new incorporated ecologically relevant hydrological indices tables 2 and a3 instead higher levels of improvement in model predictabilities occurred by introducing stream health grouping in which stream health predictive models for two classes of headwater streams and medium and large streams had better performance than models developed for all streams combined 3 2 variables distribution and pairwise correlations in this section the level of interdependence between stream health indices from one phase and two phase models and socioeconomic and physiographical parameters were evaluated in summary the modified stream health indices prediction has changed their distribution correlation with each other and correlation with independent variables s1 to s17 figs 4 a2 and a3 present the correlation matrices for all indices including the four stream health measures ibi hbi fibi and ept and the seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic variables s1 to s17 at three levels of county census tract and block group respectively the diagonals of the matrices represent the indices distribution while upper and lower parts represent pairwise correlation coefficients and scatterplots respectively compared to the previous study daneshvar et al 2016 that used one phase stream health modeling approach to construct the environmental justice models stream health indices distribution are more consistent among three levels of county census tract and block group while there was inconsistency among stream health scores distribution at the county level compared to the census tract and block group levels in the previous study for example using the results from the one phase approach ept had right skewness at the county level and left skewness at the census tract and block group levels while using the results from the two phase approach ept scores have close to normal distributions with slight skewness to the left among all three census levels figs 4 a2 and a3 this means that the new developed stream health scores are less sensitive to stream health score aggregation and more consistent at the different census levels the same consistency among the three levels exists in pairwise correlations where correlation coefficients have the same sign at all three levels while in the previous study correlation coefficients at the county level showed opposite correlations compared to the census tract and block group levels tables 4 6 for example aggregation of ibi scores from two phase modeling at county level blue numbers in table 4 resulted in similar correlation sign with the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept at the census tract and block group blue numbers in tables 5 and 6 while in the former study daneshvar et al 2016 aggregated ibi scores at the county level red numbers in table 4 had opposite correlations with the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept at the census tract and block group levels red numbers in tables 5 and 6 for the new developed stream health scores hbi had negative correlations with ibi fibi and ept at all three levels while these three had positive correlations with each other this is also in agreement with their definitions where higher values of ibi fibi and ept represent better stream health condition while for hbi it is reversed woznicki et al 2016b besides that pairwise correlation coefficients for each pair are almost the same at all three census levels which again reveals that the new developed stream health scores are not as sensitive to aggregation at different spatial levels 3 3 single level with no random effect stream health based environmental justice regression models in this section the level spatial dependency for single level environmental justice models were evaluated similar to the previous study using the one phase approach daneshvar et al 2016 spatial models had better performances with lower dics than the two non spatial models at the census tract and block group levels while at the county level the dics of the three models are close and in some cases e g hbi non spatial models had slightly lower dics than the spatial model in other words spatial models are preferred at the census tract and block group levels while at the county level there is no major preference tables a4 a15 summarize the outputs of the three single level with no random effect regression models including spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression developed for the four stream health measures of ibi hbi fibi and ept at three levels of county census tract and block group dics of the developed models are also shown in table 7 and lower dics representing better performances for each of the four stream health measures at all three census levels are boldfaced comparison of significant parameters selected for each model also resulted in the same conclusion for each regression model tables a4 a15 significant parameters meaning that their range does not cover zero are boldfaced table 8 summarizes all significant parameters for the three regression models developed for each of the four stream health measures like the previous study table a16 all three models of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression had similar significant parameters at the county level while moving to census tract and block group fewer and different parameters were identified as significant for the spatial models than the two non spatial models for instance three independent variables of s2 population density s16 households with public assistance income and s17 unemployed population over 16 years old were significant for ept prediction by all three regression models at the county level meanwhile at the census tract s1 drainage density and s11 percentage of occupied housing units and at the block group only s1 were significant for spatial models meanwhile for the two non spatial models significant parameters were s6 percentage of african american population and s11 at the census tract and s1 s5 percentage of population of or over 65 years old s6 and s11 at the block group levels this is also in agreement with the former study daneshvar et al 2016 showing that spatial dependencies are lost at the county level while census tract and block group levels can capture spatial dependencies among variables however comparison of current significant parameters table 8 with those from the previous study table a16 reveals that the modified stream health scores that used the two phase approach resulted in much fewer and different significant parameters for the same regression model overall 115 significant parameters are identified for all regression models tables a4 a15 while this number was 171 in the former study daneshvar et al 2016 especially at the county level the number of significant parameters have drastically dropped compared to the previous study for instance nine independent parameters s1 s3 s7 s11 s12 s13 s14 s16 and s17 identified by all regression models developed for the ibi at the county level has reduced to only two parameters s1 s3 this shows that using the two phase approach modified the regression models and removed redundancies that existed before especially at the county level this is also in agreement with the pairwise correlation results that showed that the new developed stream health scores improved the correlations at the county level while in the former study using the one phase approach aggregated stream health scores at the county level showed opposite correlations compared to the census tract and block group levels 3 4 multilevel with random effect stream health based environmental justice regression models the objective of this section is to evaluate the level of improvement in environmental justice models predictability in multilevel settings the combination of the three residual forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression for data collected at the three census levels county census tract and block group resulted in 48 multilevel with random effect models among the three levels table a17 summarizes the dics of these models and the lowest dics are boldfaced the county level is the coarsest level used in this study with no nested upper level so only three regression models spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression are developed for each stream health measure at this level similar to the single level analysis there is no major preference among the three models developed for each stream health measure at the county level and the three dics are very close 2 meanwhile at the census tract and block group levels considering the nested effect of data collected at upper levels the models predictability outperformed the single level analysis for both census tract and block group analysis combinations of spatial models at the finest resolution and a mix of spatial and non spatial models for nested upper levels resulted in lower dics compared to the single level models table 9 summarizes the dics of the best selected single level and multilevel models developed for the four stream health based environmental justice analysis multilevel models have much lower dics compared to the single level models at the same level especially in the block group level where much lower dics are achieved for the multilevel models compared to the single level models ranging from 23 to 120 decrease in dics this is also in agreement with daneshvar et al 2016 results showing that multilevel models had better performance than single level models meanwhile the significant parameters of the best selected models are different from the former study using the single phase approach table 10 summarizes the significant parameters of the best selected models for each of the four stream health measures at all three census levels similar to the previous study both single level and multilevel models had the same significant parameters this shows that considering the nested effect of data collected in upper levels does not change the significant parameters while at the same time considering the nested effect of aggregated data at different levels will improve the model prediction however a totally different trend in significant parameters selected was observed in this study table 10 shows that for the fish index ibi only two significant parameters s1 and s3 are selected at the county level while moving to the census tract and block group levels resulted in a change in significant parameters selected as well as an increase in the total number of parameters selected to three s5 s9 and s11 and four s6 s8 s10 and s17 for the census tract and block group levels respectively however the trend is the opposite for the other three other macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept for instance three significant parameters s2 s16 and s17 are selected at the county level while moving to the census tract and block group levels resulted in a change in significant parameters selected as well as a decrease in the total number of parameters selected to only two s1 and s11 one s1 for the census tract and block group levels respectively the same trend of reduction is significant parameters is observed for the hbi and fibi when moving from county to census tract and block group levels respectively this dissimilarity in the trend of significant parameters among fish and macroinvertebrates indices can be explained by the fact that fish indices measure large scale impacts while macroinvertebrates are responding to local stressors flinders et al 2008 paller et al 2014 herman and nejadhashemi 2015 therefore for the ibi fish index less significant parameters are selected at the county level compared to the two detailed spatial levels of census tract and block group meanwhile for macroinvertebrates indices that are sensitive to local stressors more parameters are selected as significant at the coarser resolution compared to finer census levels this trend was not observed in the former study by daneshvar et al 2016 for instance six significant parameters s2 s3 s6 s10 s15 and s17 were reported for the fibi at the county level while at the census tract level the number of significant parameters was reduced to two s2 and s10 and again increased to four s2 s5 s6 and s7 at the block group level daneshvar et al 2016 therefore the modified stream health scores using the two phase approach improved model performances not only in terms of dics but also with regard to the type and number of significant parameters required for stream health based environmental justice models development this is especially true for the county level where the number of significant parameters was drastically reduced from 9 6 6 and 6 to 2 1 4 and 3 for ibi hbi fibi and ept respectively in summary comparison of single level and multilevel regression models showed that the multilevel models provide better prediction lower dics compared to the single level models especially at the block group level where dics were improved by 120 table 9 while in terms of significant parameters similar socioeconomic and physiographic indices were highlighted for both the single level and the multilevel models table 10 however using the modified stream health scores resulted in more meaningful trend and fewer number of significant parameters compared to the former study daneshvar et al 2016 especially at the county level table 10 regression models developed for ibi that is suitable for large scale stream health assessment required fewer significant parameters at the county level large scale compared to the census tract and block group levels small scale while for the three macroinvertebrates indices that are suitable for small scale stream health assessment the trend was reversed and fewer significant parameters were highlighted at the block group finest scale compared to the two upper levels table 10 4 conclusion the goal of this study was to assess the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice model development the results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters and using a two phase approach will provide more reliable and consistent stream health predictions that are less sensitive to aggregation at different census levels besides that comparison of significant parameters selected for the development of stream health based environmental justice models for one and two phase approaches revealed that the modified stream health indices improve stream health based environmental justice models performance by reducing redundancies especially at the county level in addition more meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among fish and macroinvertebrates indices and socioeconomic physiographic components using the improved stream health models where more significant parameters were selected at the finest level block group compared to the coarsest level county for fish index while the trend was opposite for macroinvertebrates indices finally in order to better evaluate the robustness of the developed techniques in this study it is recommended that future studies will be implemented in other regions with different socioeconomic and physiographic characteristics acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the center for water science and environmental science

7135,performance of environmental justice models depends on the level of accuracy in measuring or estimating the health of the environment in the past decades and especially in the area of stream health modeling significant improvement has been observed however the impacts of these improvements on the robustness of environmental justice models have not been evaluated therefore in this study the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice modeling was evaluated the saginaw river basin in michigan was considered as the study area and four major ecological indices evaluating the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to instream stressors were used for stream health assessment seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic indices were evaluated at three census levels of county census tract and block group then the ecological socioeconomic and physiographic indices were used in the development of stream health based environmental justice models results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant indices and a using two phase modeling approach not only improved the performance of stream health predictive models but also reduced the sensitivity of environmental justice models to aggregation at different census levels in addition using improved stream health indices reduced the redundancy of the independent variables socioeconomic and physiographic indices where the total number of significant parameters was reduced from 171 to 115 besides that more robust and meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among stream health measures and environmental justice parameters at different spatial levels in summary having a reliable stream health information is the key for development of robust environmental justice models as evidence by improving model predictability and eliminating contradictory results compared to previous studies keywords ecohydrology socioeconomic conditional autoregressive bayesian 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have degraded natural resources which in turn also threatens human ecosystems due to the interwoven nature of natural and human system interactions liu et al 2007 carpenter et al 2009 alberti et al 2011 however degraded environments do not equally affect various groups in society and some communities such as low income and people of color are more vulnerable to environmental hazards than other groups massey 2004 downey and hawkins 2008 therefore the concept of environmental justice was introduced to provide fair treatment and involvement of all social groups in implementation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations u s epa 2014 in other words the aim of environmental justice is providing equal access to healthy environments as right for all people water is one of the environmental resources that is considered in the environmental justice studies in the u s the traditional approach for water resources assessment was mainly focused on water quality and physical characteristics however a nationwide assessment of riverine ecosystems that was performed by the u s environmental protection agency u s epa found that despite all implemented water quality regulations still more than 40 of nation s streams were in poor biological condition u s epa 2015 therefore a new criterion called biological integrity assessment was introduced in which the physical chemical and biological characteristics of streams should be simultaneously considered to improve the overall assessment of water resources u s epa 2011 u s epa 2015 woznicki et al 2015 this was achieved by the introduction of stream health indices which quantify the response of aquatic species to instream stressors herman and nejadhashemi 2015 van metre et al 2017 however monitoring stream health indices in a large area is both expensive and time consuming therefore modeling approaches have been used to estimate stream health indices woznicki et al 2016a the general inputs to these models are landscape features and in instream water quantity and water quality parameters miserendino et al 2011 einheuser et al 2012 traditionally linear regression frimpong et al 2005 pont et al 2009 moya et al 2011 and multivariate techniques simpson and norris 2000 aguiar et al 2011 were used for stream health model development later nonlinear techniques such as fuzzy logic adriaenssens et al 2006 marchini et al 2009 artificial neural network ann lencioni et al 2007 mathon et al 2013 and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis einheuser et al 2012 2013 were used to improve model predictabilities despite all of these improvements the predictive power of stream health models is moderate mainly due to the complexity of natural systems woznicki et al 2015 meanwhile further improvements were achieved when in the early 2010s poff and zimmerman 2010 highlighted the importance of flow alteration on ecological response in particular the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flow are master variables that affect aquatic species poff et al 1997 olden and poff 2003 poff and zimmerman 2010 therefore several tools such as the hydrological index tool hit usgs 2017 eflowstats archfield et al 2014 and matlab hydrological index tool mhit abouali et al 2016a were developed to incorporate ecologically relevant hydrological indices studies showed that these indices significantly improved the accuracy of stream health predictive models herman et al 2015 herman et al 2016 abouali et al 2016b one of the applications of steam health models is to describe the environmental conditions that impact human well being and therefore relate to the concept of environmental justice as a result the concept of biological integrity assessment has recently been introduced in environmental justice studies through integration of stream health models sanchez et al 2014 used spatial regression models and bivariate mapping to find vulnerable social communities they used four common stream health indices for fish and macroinvertebrates and nine socioeconomic indices representing education housing income population and race collected at the census tract level the results were promising and showed high correlations between regions with the lowest stream health status and vulnerable social communities sanchez et al 2014 sanchez et al 2015 also introduced spatial clustering which improved the predictability of environmental justice models daneshvar et al 2016 further improved the model predictabilities through the introduction of multilevel socioeconomic and physiographic census information however all three studies sanchez et al 2014 2015 daneshvar et al 2016 used the same nonlinear stream health modeling approach these studies showed relationships between stream health indices and socioeconomic variables however in several cases these relationships were either very weak or contradictory therefore there is a need to explore the cause of these deficiencies as described earlier the variability in the stream health model performance can introduce a large level of error on stream health based environmental justice models however new developments in stream health modeling such as the two phase approach abouali et al 2016b has resulted in significant improvement in the overall predictability for both fish and macroinvertebrate based stream health models therefore the goal of this study is to assess the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice models by comparing the results against previous studies our hypothesis was that more accurate stream health predictions would result in the development of more robust environmental justice models in which spatial dependencies among biological and socioeconomic characteristics at different spatial levels would be revealed in order to examine this hypothesis we tested three objectives considering results from former and current stream health models by comparing the level of 1 interdependence between stream health indices and socioeconomic and physiographical parameters 2 spatial dependency for single level environmental justice models and 3 improvement for multilevel environmental justice models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the saginaw river basin which is located in the state of michigan u s a was selected as the study area fig 1 with the total drainage area of more than 16 000 km2 it is the largest watershed in michigan and drains to lake huron agricultural lands are the dominant landuse 36 2 followed by forest 24 8 wetland lake 14 3 pasture 12 4 and urban 12 3 lands the u s epa identified the saginaw river and bay as an area of concern due to degraded fisheries sediment pollution and loss of recreational values u s epa 2017 agricultural and urban runoff industrial discharges and sewer overflows are some major sources of pollution in this region u s epa 2017 with more than 7 000 miles of streams the saginaw river basin provides a wide range of habitats for fish and other species win 2017 it also addresses the needs for drinking water electrical power generation and industrial consumption in this region win 2017 according to the u s census bureau 2010 the saginaw river basin is home of almost 1 5 million people where 49 are men and 51 are women the majority of residents are young and more than 52 of them are in the range of 25 to 65 years old 34 are under 25 years old while only 14 are senior above 65 years old more than 85 of population is white followed by african american 10 while other races are less than 5 the saginaw river is also a key shipping transit in mid michigan that connects two cities saginaw and bay city flint is another big city in this region that has faced water contamination problems u s epa 2013 2 2 stream health indices four common stream health indices including 1 the index of biotic integrity ibi for fish and 2 the hilsenhoff biotic intex hbi 3 family index of biotic integrity fibi and 4 ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera ept index for macroinvertebrates were used in order to assess the biological integrity of riverine ecosystems the ibi is a multi metric index first developed in the 1980 s that evaluates stream conditions by measuring 12 metrics that describe the species richness abundance and trophic composition of fish communities karr 1981 kerans and karr 1994 these metrics are given individual scores that are summed to calculate an overall measure of stream health with score ranges from zero poor condition to 100 pristine condition herman and nejadhashemi 2015 meanwhile the hbi first developed in the 1970 s evaluates stream conditions with respect to organic pollution by identifying all of the taxa found in the stream and determining their tolerances to organic pollution hilsenhoff 1987 after identifying all taxa present an average score is calculated with scores ranging from zero pristine condition to 10 poor condition which is used to classify organic pollution based stream degradation hilsenhoff 1987 the fibi first developed in the 1990 s is the third index used in this study and is a multi metric stream health index based on the ibi kerans and karr 1994 unlike the ibi though the fibi evaluates stream conditions by evaluating the response of macroinvertebrate communities to industrial pollutants by measuring 13 metrics that describe the species richness abundance and trophic composition of macroinvertebrate communities kerans and karr 1994 similar to the ibi these metrics are scored individually and then aggregated to produce an overall stream health score with scores ranging from zero poor condition to 45 pristine condition woznicki et al 2015 the final stream health index used in this study was the ept index which was first developed in the 1980s lenat 1988 this index utilizes the sensitivity of three macroinvertebrate orders namely ephemeroptera mayflies plecoptera stoneflies and trichoptera caddisflies to organic pollution to evaluate local instream degradations woznicki et al 2015 scores for the ept index are based on the abundance and richness of the ept taxa with zero scores representing high levels of degradation woznicki et al 2015 the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq has quantified the fish index ibi and the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept for 193 and 262 monitoring sites within the saginaw river basin respectively mdeq 1997 seelbach and wiley 1997 these monitoring sites are shown in fig 1 however since there are 13 831 stream segments in the basin stream health models need to be developed for both fish and macroinvertebrates indices to estimate the overall biological conditions of streams beyond the monitoring sites 2 3 socioeconomic physiographic indices socioeconomic indices representing concentrated disadvantages are commonly used for environmental justice assessments sampson et al 2008 in this study sixteen frequently used indices for population age race housing education and income disadvantages assessment are taken into account and are listed in table 1 brulle and pellow 2006 bullard et al 2008 sampson et al 2008 lin and morefield 2011 these indices are obtained from the u s census bureau for three census levels of county census tract and block group u s census bureau 2010 the saginaw river basin overlaps with 21 393 and 1076 census units of counties fig 2 a census tracts fig 2 b and block groups fig 2 c respectively in addition to sixteen socioeconomic indices one physiographic index called drainage density was also used to quantify the relative distance of population under study to waterbodies drainage density was calculated as the ratio of the total length of streams in a census unit of county census tract or block group to the unit area daneshvar et al 2016 2 4 modeling process fig 3 illustrates the modeling process used to predict the stream health indices beyond the monitoring sites and the analysis conducted for the stream health based environmental justice assessments a hydrologic water quality model was initially setup calibrated and validated for the study area to estimate streamflow and water quality parameters including sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for each stream segment on a daily time step the estimated flow and water quality parameters were used as inputs to the matlab hydrological index tool mhit that calculates ecologically relevant water quality and water quantity indices abouali et al 2016a these indices quantify the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change in flow and water quality parameters that can affect aquatic ecosystems poff et al 1997 henriksen et al 2006 mhit outputs were then used to develop stream health predictive models for this purpose a two phase approach abouali et al 2016b was implemented in which 1 partial least square regression plsr was used to predict the initial stream health indices and their associated errors and then 2 a fuzzy logic approach e g anfis was used to estimate the modified stream health indices based on the initial estimations and associated errors having the four predicted stream health measures along with 17 socioeconomic and physiographic indices at three census levels of county census tract and block group the individual correlations among indices were evaluated and the stream health based environmental justice models were developed since these two datasets are in different spatial units one at the stream level and one at the census levels scale adjustment was conducted first in which weighted average scores based on stream lengths falling in each census unit were used as their associated stream health scores the process is similar to the one performed by daneshvar et al 2016 except the highlighted sections in fig 3 in the former study a nonlinear one phase approach was used to build the stream health models using only water quality and quantity parameters obtained from the hydrological model while here the water quality and quantity parameters were first converted into ecologically relevant indices and then used to build stream health models using the two phase approach 2 4 1 hydrological water quality modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop a hydrologic water quality model for the study area swat is a physically based and semi distributed watershed and water quality model developed by u s department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars in order to evaluate the impact of land management practices on water quantity and water quality arnold et al 1998 swat delineates a watershed into subwatersheds with unique stream segments passing through them with each subwatershed being divided into several hydrologic response units hrus based on similarity in landuse soil and slope variations within the region neitsch et al 2011 in this study a pre delineated watershed developed by michigan institute of fisheries research was used in which the study area was divided into 13 831 subwatersheds with unique hrus the developed swat model was then calibrated based on three statistical criteria including 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 2 percent bias pbias and 3 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 nse ranges from one optimum value to minus infinity pbias ranges from minus infinity to infinity with optimum value of zero and rsr ranges from zero optimum value to infinity moriasi et al 2007 for both streamflow and water quality components nse above 0 5 and rsr below 0 7 are considered satisfactory while the satisfactory range for pbias varies based on the variable in question where absolute pbiass below 25 55 and 70 are called satisfactory for streamflow sediment and nutrients respectively moriasi et al 2007 streamflow was calibrated and validated based on daily streamflow data collected by the u s geological survey usgs for nine monitoring stations within the region while water quality including sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were calibrated and validated based on monthly observations provided by the u s epa daneshvar et al 2017 all three statistical criteria were met for streamflow nses ranging from 0 54 to 0 80 pbiass ranging from 16 34 to 1 53 and rsrs ranging from 0 68 to 0 45 and water quality nses ranging from 0 57 to 0 75 pbiass ranging from 35 52 to 10 00 and rsrs ranging from 0 65 to 0 50 components calibration and validation table a1 the calibrated swat model was then used to evaluate streamflow sediment total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for all stream segments on a daily basis 2 4 2 stream health model development 2 4 2 1 one phase approach fuzzy logic and anfis models developed by einheuser et al 2012 2013 were used in former stream health based environmental justice studies by sanchez et al 2014 2015 and daneshvar et al 2016 this technique is commonly used for ecological modeling woznicki et al 2016a however their inputs are limited due to computational resources and finite ecological observations hamaamin et al 2013 therefore parameter selection must be conducted first to limit models inputs woznicki et al 2015 einheuser et al 2012 2013 used spearman s rank correlation to find the most significant water quantity and water quality parameters with respect to stream health measures which reduced the number of inputs to four for each macroinvertebrates index einheuser et al 2012 and five for the fish index einheuser et al 2013 selected input parameters for this approach are listed in table a2 these input parameters were defined as membership functions in the fuzzy logic approach these functions were graphically represented and contain information about the importance weight of different input parameters at the start a partitioning technique was used to create fuzzy inference system parameters then the shape of the membership function was selected and rules for the training and testing of the models were established einheuser et al 2012 finally the 10 fold cross validation technique was used to examine the accuracy of all stream health predictive models and to identify the best model 2 4 2 2 two phase approach to address the drawback of limited input parameters a two phase approach abouali et al 2016b was used in this study where during the first phase all input parameters will be used to estimate the stream health index and associated error while during the second phase anfis will use these two predictions as inputs to estimate the final stream health score the general stream health model can be described as abouali et al 2016b 1 y y x ε where y is the observed stream health index y is the predicted stream health index as a function of set of x that represents stream health conditions e g water quality and quantity parameters and ε is the degree of error between the observed and the predictive values of the stream health index the degree of error in the stream health model can also be presented using eq 2 2 ε ε x ε where ε is the predicted error for the stream health index as a function of set of x that represents stream health conditions and ε is the degree of error between the observed and the predictive errors in the phase of the study two sets of linear models were developed t o p r e d i c t t h e s t r e a m h e a l t h i n d e x a n d t h e d e g r e e o f e r r o r i n e s t i m a t i n g t h e

e l i n t h e s e c o n d p h a s e o f s t u d y to predict the stream health index and the degree of error in estimating the stream health index then these two sets of models were used to develop the final nonlinear stream health predictive model in the second phase of study plsr was used for the first phase to project both the inputs and outputs into a mutually orthogonal coordinate system plsr is able to use all input parameters and unlike regular linear regressions it is not affected by multicollinearity that may exist among input parameters therefore all 171 ecologically relevant hydrologically indices introduced by poff et al 1997 in addition to the 78 water quality parameters representing annual and seasonal averages and coefficients of variations were used as input parameters for the first phase these plsr predictions of stream health indices and their associated errors were used as inputs for the anfis models in the second phase table a2 summarizes the two phase input parameters during the second phase two different sets of stream health predictive models were developed one set for all streams and then another set for different stream groups based on the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 instream species characteristics vary across different stream sizes that can be classified into three major groups of headwater stream orders 1 3 medium stream orders 4 7 and large stream orders 7 10 streams the maximum stream order within the saginaw river basin is 7 fig 1 therefore two stream groups of headwater streams orders 1 3 and medium and large streams orders 4 7 were defined and different stream health predictive models were developed for each group then the set of stream health predictive models with a better performance was used to calculate the four stream health measures for all 13 831 stream segments 2 5 data analysis scatter plot matrices were developed for each census level in which histograms pairwise distributions and pairwise correlation coefficients were evaluated for all indices including the four stream health measures and the seventeen socioeconomic physiographic indicators spearman s ranking was used for pairwise correlation coefficients evaluation lehmann 1998 in order to evaluate spatial dependencies among stream health measures and socioeconomic physiographic indices the spatial conditional autoregressive car technique banerjee et al 2004 was used to develop stream health based environmental justice models eq 3 represents the general form of car model used in this study 3 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 m i γ i w i 1 i 1 2 i census units in which y i and x i represent the stream health measure and the corresponding p covariates vector for the i th census unit e g county census tract or block group spatial neighborhood dependencies for the i census units are represented by w i and the number of neighbors are listed as diagonal entries of the m i matrix variation and spatial dependency are also measured by τ i 2 and γ i respectively in order to assess the significance of spatial dependency two simplified forms of the spatial car model were also developed as follows i assuming γ i 0 means no spatial dependence while the residual variance is weighted by the number of neighbors this simplifies the spatial model to a weighted regression model as shown in eq 4 4 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 m i 1 i 1 2 i census units i while setting γ i 0 and m i i i the identity matrix means no spatial information is implemented and the spatial model will be simplified to an ordinary regression model as shown in eq 5 5 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 i i i 1 2 i census units these three forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression were used to develop single level with no random effect and multilevel with random effect models at three census levels of county census tract and block group 2 5 1 single level with no random effect models assuming 1 2 i j 1 2 j and k 1 2 k represent the number of counties census tracts and block groups respectively the single level with no random effect car models at the three census levels are presented as follow 4 1 y i x i β ε i ε ñ 0 τ i 2 d i γ i i 1 2 i 4 2 y j x j β ε j ε ñ 0 τ j 2 d j γ j j 1 2 j 4 3 y k x k β ε k ε ñ 0 τ k 2 d k γ k k 1 2 k where using full forms of d i γ i m i γ i w i 1 d j γ j m j γ j w j 1 and d k γ k m k γ k w k 1 resulted in spatial models development while d i γ i m i 1 d j γ j m j 1 and d k γ k m k 1 implementations resulted in weighted regression models at three census levels of county census tract and block group respectively ordinary regression models are also developed by setting d i γ i i i d j γ j i j and d k γ k i k for the three levels of county census tract and block group respectively 2 5 2 multilevel with random effect models since the three census levels of county census tract and block group are nested the total number of census tracts is j i 1 i j i where j i is the number of census tracts in the i th county and the total number of block groups is k j 1 j k j i 1 i j 1 j i k j where k j is the number of block groups in the j th census tract to assess the nested effect of aggregated data at different spatial levels multilevel with random effect models were also developed for the census tract and block group levels as follows 1 multilevel with random effect models at the census tract level implementation of the random effects of data collected at the census tract and county levels resulted in the following form of the spatial car model at the census tract level 6 y ij x ij β u i ε ij ε ñ 0 τ j 2 d γ j u ñ 0 τ i 2 d γ i j 1 2 j i i 1 2 i where u and ε represent the residual terms at two levels of county and census tract respectively d γ i and d γ j can be either in spatial weighted regression or ordinary regression form and their combination will result in 3 3 9 different multilevel with random effect models 2 multilevel with random effect models at the block group level implementation of the random effects of data collected at the block group census tract and county levels resulted in the development of the following form of the spatial car model at the block group level 7 y ijk x ijk β u i v ij ε ijk ε ñ 0 τ k 2 d γ k k 1 2 k j v ñ 0 τ j 2 d γ j j 1 2 j i u ñ 0 τ i 2 d γ i i 1 2 i where u v and ε represent the residual terms at the three levels of county census tract and block group respectively combinations of the three forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression implementation of d γ i d γ j and d γ k will result in the development of 3 4 4 3 45 multilevel with random effect models while only one of d γ i or d γ j can be zero not both at the same time for both the single level with no random effect and multilevel with random effect analysis markov chain monte carlo mcmc was used to estimate parameters six chains with different initial values were used for each model and were run for 6000 iterations the last 1000 samples after convergence for each chain were then used as posterior samples deviance information criterion dic4 was used for model comparison celeux et al 2006 which measures both model simplicity and model fit at the same time and models with lower dics are preferred 3 results and discussion 3 1 stream health indices comparison of the stream health model performances when all streams were used for development of the predictive model reveals that the two phase approach used in this study has outperformed the former predictive models for all four stream health measures within all streams tables 2 and a3 present the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse of current two phase approach and former one phase approach developed stream health predictive models the fish index ibi has the highest improvement compared to previous approach where a r2 of 0 89 and rmse of 7 56 are achieved compared to the former r2 of 0 48 and rmse of 16 37 this shows that incorporating larger sets of ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters 249 and combining the two methods of plsr and anfis resulted in more accurate predictions of stream health measures rather than just using the one phase fuzzy logic model with a few water quantity and water quality parameters 4 5 especially for fish that are highly sensitive to ecologically relevant flow parameters poff and zimmerman 2010 the next two columns of tables 2 and a3 summarize the performance of the stream health predictive models developed for two stream classes of headwater streams and medium and large streams results show that for all stream health indices models developed for the two classes have better performances with r2 values ranging from 0 90 to 0 97 and rmse values ranging from 0 11 to 6 24 than models developed for all streams combined with r2 values ranging from 0 70 to 0 89 and rmse values ranging from 0 27 to 7 56 for instance r2 values of 0 97 and 0 91 were achieved for the ept predictive models for the two stream classes instead of the 0 72 obtained for the ept predictive model for all streams combined a similar trend was also observed for rmse for instance rmse values of 0 73 and 1 10 were achieved for the ept predictive models for the two stream classes instead of the 2 04 obtained for the ept predictive model for all streams combined this is due to the fact that species are often found in specific stream classes and have different responses to stressors mcmanamay et al 2014 herman et al 2015 so distinct models for different stream classes are preferred to models that are developed for all streams especially for macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept that are more sensitive to local impairment than fish kerans and karr 1994 the new developed stream health predictive models for two stream classes were then used to simulate the four stream health indices beyond the sampling points fig a1 and their predictions are compared with the one phase approach by calculating the absolute percent of change in prediction nejadhashemi et al 2011 as shown in table 3 results show that hbi scores have the lowest deviation from the results obtained in the one phase approach where 71 2 of headwater streams and 91 1 of medium and large streams have less than a 25 change in scores meanwhile the highest changes are found in the ibi prediction for headwater streams where 38 8 of streams in this class have more than a 75 change in score prediction the level of change in the models predictabilities one phase vs two phase is mainly related to the number of independent variables used to develop the models and the capabilities of the models to identify the true relationships between independent and dependent variables as explained earlier the number of independent variables that were used for development of the one phase models were limited meanwhile in the two phase approach this problem was solved and the model used all independent variables as a result the highest changes are found in the ibi prediction due to the high dependency of the fish index on ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters poff and zimmerman 2010 meanwhile the hbi is less sensitive to these parameters due to the fact that it measures the response of aquatic species to organic pollutants hilsenhoff 1987 similarly other macroinvertebrates indices fibi and ept are less sensitive to the new incorporated ecologically relevant hydrological indices tables 2 and a3 instead higher levels of improvement in model predictabilities occurred by introducing stream health grouping in which stream health predictive models for two classes of headwater streams and medium and large streams had better performance than models developed for all streams combined 3 2 variables distribution and pairwise correlations in this section the level of interdependence between stream health indices from one phase and two phase models and socioeconomic and physiographical parameters were evaluated in summary the modified stream health indices prediction has changed their distribution correlation with each other and correlation with independent variables s1 to s17 figs 4 a2 and a3 present the correlation matrices for all indices including the four stream health measures ibi hbi fibi and ept and the seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic variables s1 to s17 at three levels of county census tract and block group respectively the diagonals of the matrices represent the indices distribution while upper and lower parts represent pairwise correlation coefficients and scatterplots respectively compared to the previous study daneshvar et al 2016 that used one phase stream health modeling approach to construct the environmental justice models stream health indices distribution are more consistent among three levels of county census tract and block group while there was inconsistency among stream health scores distribution at the county level compared to the census tract and block group levels in the previous study for example using the results from the one phase approach ept had right skewness at the county level and left skewness at the census tract and block group levels while using the results from the two phase approach ept scores have close to normal distributions with slight skewness to the left among all three census levels figs 4 a2 and a3 this means that the new developed stream health scores are less sensitive to stream health score aggregation and more consistent at the different census levels the same consistency among the three levels exists in pairwise correlations where correlation coefficients have the same sign at all three levels while in the previous study correlation coefficients at the county level showed opposite correlations compared to the census tract and block group levels tables 4 6 for example aggregation of ibi scores from two phase modeling at county level blue numbers in table 4 resulted in similar correlation sign with the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept at the census tract and block group blue numbers in tables 5 and 6 while in the former study daneshvar et al 2016 aggregated ibi scores at the county level red numbers in table 4 had opposite correlations with the three macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept at the census tract and block group levels red numbers in tables 5 and 6 for the new developed stream health scores hbi had negative correlations with ibi fibi and ept at all three levels while these three had positive correlations with each other this is also in agreement with their definitions where higher values of ibi fibi and ept represent better stream health condition while for hbi it is reversed woznicki et al 2016b besides that pairwise correlation coefficients for each pair are almost the same at all three census levels which again reveals that the new developed stream health scores are not as sensitive to aggregation at different spatial levels 3 3 single level with no random effect stream health based environmental justice regression models in this section the level spatial dependency for single level environmental justice models were evaluated similar to the previous study using the one phase approach daneshvar et al 2016 spatial models had better performances with lower dics than the two non spatial models at the census tract and block group levels while at the county level the dics of the three models are close and in some cases e g hbi non spatial models had slightly lower dics than the spatial model in other words spatial models are preferred at the census tract and block group levels while at the county level there is no major preference tables a4 a15 summarize the outputs of the three single level with no random effect regression models including spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression developed for the four stream health measures of ibi hbi fibi and ept at three levels of county census tract and block group dics of the developed models are also shown in table 7 and lower dics representing better performances for each of the four stream health measures at all three census levels are boldfaced comparison of significant parameters selected for each model also resulted in the same conclusion for each regression model tables a4 a15 significant parameters meaning that their range does not cover zero are boldfaced table 8 summarizes all significant parameters for the three regression models developed for each of the four stream health measures like the previous study table a16 all three models of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression had similar significant parameters at the county level while moving to census tract and block group fewer and different parameters were identified as significant for the spatial models than the two non spatial models for instance three independent variables of s2 population density s16 households with public assistance income and s17 unemployed population over 16 years old were significant for ept prediction by all three regression models at the county level meanwhile at the census tract s1 drainage density and s11 percentage of occupied housing units and at the block group only s1 were significant for spatial models meanwhile for the two non spatial models significant parameters were s6 percentage of african american population and s11 at the census tract and s1 s5 percentage of population of or over 65 years old s6 and s11 at the block group levels this is also in agreement with the former study daneshvar et al 2016 showing that spatial dependencies are lost at the county level while census tract and block group levels can capture spatial dependencies among variables however comparison of current significant parameters table 8 with those from the previous study table a16 reveals that the modified stream health scores that used the two phase approach resulted in much fewer and different significant parameters for the same regression model overall 115 significant parameters are identified for all regression models tables a4 a15 while this number was 171 in the former study daneshvar et al 2016 especially at the county level the number of significant parameters have drastically dropped compared to the previous study for instance nine independent parameters s1 s3 s7 s11 s12 s13 s14 s16 and s17 identified by all regression models developed for the ibi at the county level has reduced to only two parameters s1 s3 this shows that using the two phase approach modified the regression models and removed redundancies that existed before especially at the county level this is also in agreement with the pairwise correlation results that showed that the new developed stream health scores improved the correlations at the county level while in the former study using the one phase approach aggregated stream health scores at the county level showed opposite correlations compared to the census tract and block group levels 3 4 multilevel with random effect stream health based environmental justice regression models the objective of this section is to evaluate the level of improvement in environmental justice models predictability in multilevel settings the combination of the three residual forms of spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression for data collected at the three census levels county census tract and block group resulted in 48 multilevel with random effect models among the three levels table a17 summarizes the dics of these models and the lowest dics are boldfaced the county level is the coarsest level used in this study with no nested upper level so only three regression models spatial weighted regression and ordinary regression are developed for each stream health measure at this level similar to the single level analysis there is no major preference among the three models developed for each stream health measure at the county level and the three dics are very close 2 meanwhile at the census tract and block group levels considering the nested effect of data collected at upper levels the models predictability outperformed the single level analysis for both census tract and block group analysis combinations of spatial models at the finest resolution and a mix of spatial and non spatial models for nested upper levels resulted in lower dics compared to the single level models table 9 summarizes the dics of the best selected single level and multilevel models developed for the four stream health based environmental justice analysis multilevel models have much lower dics compared to the single level models at the same level especially in the block group level where much lower dics are achieved for the multilevel models compared to the single level models ranging from 23 to 120 decrease in dics this is also in agreement with daneshvar et al 2016 results showing that multilevel models had better performance than single level models meanwhile the significant parameters of the best selected models are different from the former study using the single phase approach table 10 summarizes the significant parameters of the best selected models for each of the four stream health measures at all three census levels similar to the previous study both single level and multilevel models had the same significant parameters this shows that considering the nested effect of data collected in upper levels does not change the significant parameters while at the same time considering the nested effect of aggregated data at different levels will improve the model prediction however a totally different trend in significant parameters selected was observed in this study table 10 shows that for the fish index ibi only two significant parameters s1 and s3 are selected at the county level while moving to the census tract and block group levels resulted in a change in significant parameters selected as well as an increase in the total number of parameters selected to three s5 s9 and s11 and four s6 s8 s10 and s17 for the census tract and block group levels respectively however the trend is the opposite for the other three other macroinvertebrates indices hbi fibi and ept for instance three significant parameters s2 s16 and s17 are selected at the county level while moving to the census tract and block group levels resulted in a change in significant parameters selected as well as a decrease in the total number of parameters selected to only two s1 and s11 one s1 for the census tract and block group levels respectively the same trend of reduction is significant parameters is observed for the hbi and fibi when moving from county to census tract and block group levels respectively this dissimilarity in the trend of significant parameters among fish and macroinvertebrates indices can be explained by the fact that fish indices measure large scale impacts while macroinvertebrates are responding to local stressors flinders et al 2008 paller et al 2014 herman and nejadhashemi 2015 therefore for the ibi fish index less significant parameters are selected at the county level compared to the two detailed spatial levels of census tract and block group meanwhile for macroinvertebrates indices that are sensitive to local stressors more parameters are selected as significant at the coarser resolution compared to finer census levels this trend was not observed in the former study by daneshvar et al 2016 for instance six significant parameters s2 s3 s6 s10 s15 and s17 were reported for the fibi at the county level while at the census tract level the number of significant parameters was reduced to two s2 and s10 and again increased to four s2 s5 s6 and s7 at the block group level daneshvar et al 2016 therefore the modified stream health scores using the two phase approach improved model performances not only in terms of dics but also with regard to the type and number of significant parameters required for stream health based environmental justice models development this is especially true for the county level where the number of significant parameters was drastically reduced from 9 6 6 and 6 to 2 1 4 and 3 for ibi hbi fibi and ept respectively in summary comparison of single level and multilevel regression models showed that the multilevel models provide better prediction lower dics compared to the single level models especially at the block group level where dics were improved by 120 table 9 while in terms of significant parameters similar socioeconomic and physiographic indices were highlighted for both the single level and the multilevel models table 10 however using the modified stream health scores resulted in more meaningful trend and fewer number of significant parameters compared to the former study daneshvar et al 2016 especially at the county level table 10 regression models developed for ibi that is suitable for large scale stream health assessment required fewer significant parameters at the county level large scale compared to the census tract and block group levels small scale while for the three macroinvertebrates indices that are suitable for small scale stream health assessment the trend was reversed and fewer significant parameters were highlighted at the block group finest scale compared to the two upper levels table 10 4 conclusion the goal of this study was to assess the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice model development the results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant water quantity and water quality parameters and using a two phase approach will provide more reliable and consistent stream health predictions that are less sensitive to aggregation at different census levels besides that comparison of significant parameters selected for the development of stream health based environmental justice models for one and two phase approaches revealed that the modified stream health indices improve stream health based environmental justice models performance by reducing redundancies especially at the county level in addition more meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among fish and macroinvertebrates indices and socioeconomic physiographic components using the improved stream health models where more significant parameters were selected at the finest level block group compared to the coarsest level county for fish index while the trend was opposite for macroinvertebrates indices finally in order to better evaluate the robustness of the developed techniques in this study it is recommended that future studies will be implemented in other regions with different socioeconomic and physiographic characteristics acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the center for water science and environmental science

7136,efficient waste load allocation plays a critical role in improving water quality in this paper a pigovian tax based waste load allocation problem generalized from a prototype in the tuojiang river basin is proposed to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for waste load allocation is designed to provide an optimization method for water quality management that fully considers the stackelberg game between the environmental regulators and the river system dischargers the successful application of this model to the tuojiang river basin demonstrates its practicality and efficiency sensitivity analyses under different tax rate settings are given to provide the environmental regulators with insights into the impacts of a pigovian tax policy on the discharger s bod removal decisions as well as to identify the waste load allocation trade offs between costs and equity compared to conventional models the proposed method has the ability to reduce pollutants and achieve equitable waste load allocations the results demonstrated that as the proposed method can encourage dischargers to improve emissions performance it could be of significant assistance to environmental decision making keywords equilibrium strategy river system pigovian tax policy waste load allocation 1 introduction in recent years rapid industrialization and urbanization in many developing and developed countries has resulted in significant water pollution problems vörösmarty et al 2010 goel 2006 an estimated 1 2 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water and millions of people including 3 900 children a day die annually from the diseases transmitted in unsafe water grant et al 2012 in china because of the excessive pollution discharges from industrial municipal and agricultural sewage water pollution has become a more serious environmental problem than water resource scarcity li et al 2014 liu and diamond 2005 more than 40 of rivers and 80 of lakes have become severely polluted from human activities in china and as a result about 300 million rural residents lack access to safe drinking water chinese academy of sciences 2008 to control water quality and improve river basin environments the chinese government is developing water infrastructure and establishing and integrating wastewater treatment systems liu and yang 2012 turpin 2008 in addition various laws policies and regulations for water environmental protection have been promulgated for example in sichuan province an important region upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers in china the sichuan environmental protection agency scepa the environmental regulator er has imposed a pigovian tax policy to control water pollution and resolve the conflicts between the dischargers on the tuojiang and minjiang rivers the most important upper yangtze river tributaries sichuan environmental protection agency 2013 however river systems are coupled human and natural systems that is they are integrated systems in which people interact with natural components liu et al 2007 as human and natural system couplings vary across space time and organizational units a single water management strategy often fails to achieve water sustainability and can even cause unintended environmental and socioeconomic consequences liu and yang 2012 the tuojiang river basin for example is a microcosm of a typical river basin in developing countries where all subareas tend to use a greater quantity of natural resources to develop the local economy as a result the subareas efforts result in a greater quantity of discharge sewage into the river system while establishing stream standards at each checkpoint by the scepa can effectively control total sewage discharges into the river system the actual situation in the tuojiang river basin shows that setting stream standards can result in waste load allocation inequities sichuan province bulletin 2011 which consequently affects the subareas economic and social development therefore combined water policies that consider both the ecological and human components as well as their respective connections need to be developed for effective water quality management that is water quality management technologies combined with environmental economic policy are required with the aim of sustainable basin development this paper focuses on a waste load allocation problem with a pigovian tax policy that was generalized from a prototype in the tuojiang river basin waste load allocation wla has been found to be a significant water quality management method for river basins and is vital to controlling unconscionable river system discharges traditional wla methods have followed an agent based framework in which the wastewater loads are distributed based on the er s experience and statistical analysis krenkel 2012 however the use of these methods can cause unreasonable wlas consequently mathematical modeling has been used as an effective water quality management technique to resolve wla problems for which many different mathematical programming methods have been developed to model river system water quality management problems and minimize pollution costs toward the end of the 1960s loucks et al 1967 and revelle et al 1968 began building a linear programming model for water pollution control and liebman and lynn 1966 developed a dynamic programming model to deal with river system wla based on the results of the streeter and phelps equations to accurately estimate the sewage treatment cost curve a nonlinear model was developed to allocate treatment requirements ecker 1975 even though the above methods were able to quickly determine optimal wlas there were still many uncertainties such as the random nature of hydrological conditions climate change and temperature and humidity variations milly et al 2008 pallottino et al 2005 research began to focus on addressing these wla uncertainties using stochastic programming models tung and hathhorn 1990 employed random chance constrained programming to solve water quality management problems that considered the water quality parameter uncertainties using spatial and cross correlations cardwell and ellis 1993 presented stochastic dynamic programming models for wla that included both parameter type ii and model type i uncertainty other stochastic wla model formats have also been developed anderson et al 2000 mujumdar and subbarao vemula 2004 revelli and ridolfi 2004 huang and loucks 2000 and subsequently wla fuzzy and interval programming models were developed mujumdar and saxena 2004 karmakar and mujumdar 2006 li and huang 2009 qin et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 mujumdar and subbarao vemula 2004 introduced a fuzzy wla model that was extended to incorporate qual2e and used a simulation optimization approach for the calculations qin et al 2009 developed an interval fuzzy nonlinear programming model for water quality management under uncertainty and to address the uncertainties in the proposed model designed a general framework that included interval and fuzzy programming li et al 2014 established a large scale inexact two stage wla model to trade off economic development and environmental protection however using traditional wla models was found to result in wastewater load distribution inequalities sichuan province bulletin 2011 yandamuri et al 2006 as the upstream dischargers were able to impose pollution costs on the downstream water users because of the lower water quality krenkel 2012 despite these obvious inequalities very limited attention has been given to these types of wla equity problems brill et al 1976 started exploring equity measures in water quality management alternatives and hathhorn and tung 1989 built bi objective fuzzy linear programming to solve a multiple discharge wla problem that had waste discharge maximization and equity minimization as the two objectives three optimization model formulas were developed by burn and yulianti 2001 to examine different wla problems that included wla trade offs between cost effectiveness and fairness yandamuri et al 2006 proposed a multi objective optimization framework for wla that considered cost equity and dissolved oxygen violations as the optimal objectives nikoo et al 2012 presented a new game theory methodology for equitable wla in rivers by utilizing fuzzy bi matrix games gren and destouni 2012 presented a general framework for identifying the implications of a divergence between the different nutrient load quantification approaches that included both cost and fairness criteria outcomes while the above studies considered the cost and fairness conflicts in wla problems theory and applications the tuojiang river basin case is quite different because of the execution of a combined water strategy i e stream standards and a pigovian tax policy therefore it is necessary to focus on how environmental policy instruments can affect the cost and fairness in wla problems currently there are two types of environmental policy instruments for water quality management pigovian taxes and the pollution permit market baumol and oates 1988 stavins 2003 pigovian taxes which were first introduced by pigou 2013 are applied to market activities that generate negative externalities the most typical example of which is environmental pollution baumol 1972 for a wla problem gren et al 2000 built a theoretical model to calculate cost effective solutions for the reduction in nutrient and pollutant loads and to determine an associated design for the charges i e pigovian tax policy therefore as noted in gren et al 2000 pigovian tax policies can influence the wla in river systems however in the actual situation in the tuojiang river basin despite the insights provided by these studies a theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of pigovian tax policies on wla decision making needs further investigation especially when considering cases such as the tuojiang river basin similar to the eu water framework the scepa as the river basin er is in charge of allocating the existing waste assimilative capacity to the waste dischargers and setting the stream standards for each section of the tuojiang river however natural resource allocation inequity can adversely affect the subareas development plans therefore to resolve the conflicts between the dischargers and to control the tuojiang river basin water pollution the scepa has been considering a combined water strategy sichuan province bulletin 2011 through the implementation of a pigovian tax policy that can be integrated into the wla planning specifically the river basin er first specifies a constant tax rate then sets pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint when the contaminant concentration rises above this value at a checkpoint the corresponding dischargers must pay pollution taxes for the out of threshold contaminants see fig 1 in this decision process the er needs to decide on suitable relative low cost pigovian tax policy to ensure fairness in the river system however to date very few studies have addressed this aspect in equitable wla planning this process however involves multiple parties in contrast to the eu water framework as all dischargers are co located in the same river basin in sichuan province there are no complicated pollution transfer negotiations necessary between the river system dischargers which to some extent reduces the complexity of the problem dischargers are given permission to release a certain quantity of pollutants into the river therefore to minimize their own pollution costs the dischargers decide what fraction needs to be removed to maintain acceptable water body quality in the river as prescribed by the er however because of the pigovian tax policy limitations the discharger s pollution costs unlike in a traditional wla consist of sewage treatment costs and pollution taxes therefore each discharger needs to achieve reasonable contaminant removal to trade off the two costs to minimize their own pollution costs under the specified stream standards and the pigovian tax thresholds see fig 1 as can be seen because of these developmental issues a wla problem under a pigovian tax policy is a hierarchical decision making problem with two main decision makers the er and the dischargers each of whom have independent objectives wla equity and individual pollution cost in such a hierarchical decision as the er can impose a pigovian tax on the dischargers to control their emissions performance current multi objective models and bi level models are incapable of determining the optimal allocation of waste load under a pigovian tax setting with this focus in mind in this paper we examine the development of a wla model that is combined with a pigovian tax policy this paper was motivated by the combined water strategy being used in the tuojiang river basin therefore in this paper we focused on building a new effective method to solve wla problems under a pigovian tax policy i e a pigovian tax based waste load allocation pt wla problem this paper focuses on the hierarchical decision framework to solve a pt wla problem for river systems with the aim of achieving equitable wla and wastewater discharge reductions the key characteristics of the hierarchical decision framework are that there is a stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers and an analogous markovian decision process between the dischargers a cooperative bi level multi follower programming model was formulated based on these framework features we also used our models to assist the scepa develop a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla in the deyang jintang section of the tuojiang river basin china these results indicated that an appropriate pigovian tax policy is advisable both for dischargers with high discharge rates and to ensure an equitable wla process our proposed method was proven to be practical and efficient in solving the pt wla problem in the river system the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define and analyze the problem description and modeling challenges for the wla under a pigovian tax policy and present the mathematical formulation for the mentioned problem in section 3 we present a practical case of the tuojiang river basin to show the effectiveness of the proposed model in section 4 we discuss and analyze the results of the case study in this section we conduct sensitivity and comparative analyses and give some management recommendations finally conclusions limitations and future research directions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 problem description integrating a pigovian tax policy to allocate waste loads is a challenge as the pt wla process is no longer directly determined by the er conflicts between the involved stakeholders are inevitable making the wla more complex practical investigations and surveys indicated that there are two steps in the pt wla procedure pigovian tax setting and the removal of the wastewater contaminants in the pigovian tax setting step the er makes a decision on the pigovian tax thresholds for the entire river system to achieve equitable wla which is to minimize deviations in the unit pollution costs for each discharger in the removal of the wastewater contaminants step each discharger makes efficient contaminant removal decisions to minimize their unit pollution costs see fig 1 therefore both the er and the dischargers attempt to optimize their objective functions under the constraints and reactions of the other party in the specific decision rule for the er and the dischargers the er first specifies a decision and then each discharger makes a decision to optimize their own objective function with full knowledge of the er s decision the er also makes a decision to optimize its own objective function based on the rational dischargers reaction this type of decision making process is similar to a stackelberg game möller et al 1993 based on the upstream water quality conditions which are influenced by the upstream discharger and the downstream stream standards prescribed by the er each discharger makes efficient contaminant removal decisions waste removal efficiency in the river systems is a special sequential decision problem as the upstream dischargers decisions affect the decisions of the subsequent downstream dischargers because the pollutants are transported along the river in this system each checkpoint conveys the pollutants knowledge and all necessary information about the previous behavior so that the subsequent discharger can determine an optimal policy for their section of the river this decision process is known as a markovian decision bellman 1966 to determine the most reasonable solution the stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers can be abstracted as a bi level programming model problem and calculated sakawa and nishizaki 2009 with the markovian decision discharger process being described as a special type of multi stage problem bellman 1966 based on the described mathematical features the pt wla problem therefore can be modeled as a cooperative bi level multi follower decision li 2013 2 2 modelling in this section a cooperative bi level multi follower optimization model is discussed for the pt wla river system problem the mathematical description is as follows 2 2 1 assumptions and notations before model construction the fundamental assumptions and notations are given assumptions 1 all dischargers are considered pollution points along the river with all river tributaries also assumed to be dischargers 2 each pollution point and its corresponding er checkpoint are assumed to be in the same position 3 pollution transfers are

requires the er to set pigovian tax thresholds and make discharger sewage removal decisions therefore the model has two levels of objectives and constraints an er level and a discharger level both of which are discussed in detail in the following er level for setting the pigovian tax thresholds to control water pollution and achieve equitable wla in the river system the er as the leader specifies the stream quality standards at each checkpoint and sets the pigovian tax policy specifically the er first specifies the stream quality standards at each checkpoint and sets a series of pigovian tax thresholds if the discharger has out of threshold contaminant emissions then taxes are imposed stream quality standard constraints the er specifies the stream quality standards and pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint because water quality standards are mandatory regulations that are designed to limit sewage discharge the pigovian tax is considered an environmental policy instrument designed to influence discharger behavior therefore the pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint i e al bs cannot exceed the associated stream quality standards i e b us and cannot be negative 1 0 al bs b us equity objective the unit pollution costs i e upc s on the discharger level are considered to be the primary indicators for the evaluation of the sewage disposal price for discharger s therefore unit pollution cost variance i e dupc on the er level is used to assess the equity of the river system wla which is defined as dupc s 1 s upc s aupc 2 in this study the er equity objective is to minimize the unit pollution cost variance that is 2 min al bs dupc s 1 s upc s aupc 2 where aupc is the weighted average unit pollution cost value which is equal to 1 s upc s s discharger bod effluent removal level to minimize the pollution costs which are made up of sewage treatment costs and pollution taxes on the pt wla discharger level each discharger as the followers seeks to ensure adequate contaminant removal to meet both the stream quality standards and the pigovian tax thresholds however the dischargers are also affected by the upstream water conditions as a result of the upstream discharger behavior to model these multi discharger bod effluent removal decisions the river system state transition constraints and objective functions are presented river system state transition water withdrawal use and discharger emissions on the same river may cause various river constituents to change further because of the river ecosystems biological chemical biochemical and physical processes the stream states defined as flow rate and the bod and do concentrations are continually changing the stream state is transferred from one discharger to the next as the water moves downstream therefore decision making making for the multi discharger bod removal is a multi stage problem bellman 1966 fig 2 shows a simplified illustration of the stream state transition framework in a river system as can be seen in fig 2 there are s stages in the river system s dischargers and checkpoints and three stream states flow rate and the bod and do concentrations the stream state at each checkpoint is transferred to the next checkpoint as the water flows downstream the three stream state transitions flow rate bod concentration and do concentration are described in the following flow rate state transition the river system flow rate state transition is based on a mass balance assumption and the flow continuity conditions qin et al 2007 fig 2 shows that the flow rate q rs at checkpoint s is composed of the upstream flow rate q r s 1 water withdrawal q ws and effluent discharge q ds from discharger s which can be expressed as 3 q rs q r s 1 q ws q ds bod state transition the bod concentration state transition in a river system is based on a mass balance assumption qin et al 2007 as shown in fig 2 there is a bod volume equilibrium at each checkpoint and the bod volume is determined by the bod amount entering this checkpoint and the corresponding discharger s treated effluent as an example of checkpoint s the bod amount i e c bs q rs is made up of the discharger s s treated bod effluent i e c bs i 1 η s q ds and the amount of bod entering this checkpoint i e c bs q r s 1 q ws where c bs denotes the bod concentrations entering checkpoint s to estimate these parameters sp equations phelps and streeter 1958 with camp dobbins modifications are adopted to simulate the pollutant biodegradation and to map the waste loads into the downstream do concentrations modified sp equations are used to describe the processes that determine the bod and do concentrations in the stream in which various factors affecting the assimilation capacity of the stream are considered the bod and do concentrations the biological and physical characteristics of the stream that affect settling rates reaeration and the bod additions due to runoff and scour based on the results of the first equation for the modified sp equations we can calculate the bod concentrations entering checkpoint s i e c bs which is equivalent to c bs c b s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k

for the do change at reach s 1 therefore c bs can be written as 4 c bs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 integrating the above equations the bod equilibrium at checkpoint s can be expressed as c bs q rs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 q r s 1 q ws c bs i 1 η s q ds therefore the bod state transition at checkpoint s can be expressed as 5 c bs q r s 1 q ws q rs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 q ds q rs 1 η s c bs i to simplify the formula the ratio between the effluent discharge of discharger s and the stream flow at checkpoint s is defined as r s q ds q rs the bod state transition at checkpoint s is equivalent to 6 c bs 1 r s α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 r s 1 η s c bs i do state transition similar to the bod case there is a do volume equilibrium at each checkpoint because of the mass balance assumptions see fig 2 as an example at checkpoint s the do amount i e c os q rs consists of the do amount entering this checkpoint i e c os q r s 1 q ws and the do amount in the treated effluent from discharger s q ds c os i where c os represents the do concentrations entering checkpoint s from the results of the second equation for the modified sp equations the do concentrations entering checkpoint s are equivalent to c os c o s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 c b s 1 r s 1 k a s 1 k e s 1 k d s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 t s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 k a s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 k d s 1 k a s 1 a s 1 k d s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 c do 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 to simplify the expression let β s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 γ s 1 k d s 1 α s 1 β s 1 k a s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 δ s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 γ s 1 k d s 1 k a s 1 1 β s 1 a s 1 k d s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 c do be the conversion parameters for the do change at reach s which can be written as 7 c os β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 therefore after plugging eq 7 into the above do equilibrium at checkpoint s it can be written as c os q rs β s 1 c o s 1 γ s c b s 1 δ s 1 q r s 1 q ws c os i q ds and the do state transition at checkpoint s can be expressed as 8 c os q r s 1 q ws q rs β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 q ds q rs c os i similar to the bod case putting r s q ds q rs into eq 8 the do state transition equation is equivalent to 9 c os 1 r s β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 r s c os i in addition as the do concentration cannot exceed the saturated do of the river the do constraint state transition at checkpoint s is modified as 10 c os min 1 r s β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 r t c os i c do initial discharger conditions in this study it is assumed that the first discharger is not affected by an upstream discharger to simplify our model therefore the river headwater area is considered checkpoint 0 see fig 2 with the headwater area stream flow rate bod and do concentrations being equal to those at checkpoint 0 in the river system there are several uncertainties in the water management systems because of ecological environmental changes such as climate change and the anthropogenic changes caused by population growth and economic development milly et al 2008 for example river flows have generally been seen as typical uncertain parameters lansey et al 1989 huang and loucks 2000 pallottino et al 2005 that fluctuate each day because of influences such as air temperature rainfall and upstream water withdrawal further as the constituent volumes in the river also change frequently because of the constant stream flow it is very difficult to accurately measure these parameters based on previous studies in this study the headwater flow rate and the bod and do concentrations are assumed to be fuzzy random variables xu et al 2012 tu et al 2015 the headwater flow is used as an example to explain the motivation for characterizing these uncertainties as fuzzy random variables fig 3 illustrates the technological process for the discrete fuzzy random headstream flow construction first based on the historical flow rate data analysis in a specified river basin the upstream flow rate has one of three scenarios low level l medium level m or high level h the occurrence probability of the corresponding scenarios i e p l p m and p h are estimated then through detailed consultations with expert hydrologists who describe the situation in linguistic terms by giving an approximate range the data for each scenario are established for example the value range is between a k e and c k e with the most likely value being b k e where e is the index for the hydrologist for e 1 2 e and k is the index for the flow rate level for k l m h as the observed data are based on the hydrologists experience different hydrologists may have different conclusions therefore an owa operator is used to aggregate the linguistic information from all experts for each scenario xu and da 2002 that is the flow rate for scenario k a k e 1 e a k e e b k e 1 e b k e e and c k e 1 e c k e e in this way the upstream flow rate for each scenario can be conveniently described using triangular fuzzy numbers a k b k c k in summary the upstream flow rate can be constructed as a discrete fuzzy random variable q u a l b l c l with probability p l a m b m c m with probability p m a h b h c h with probability p h to deal with these discrete fuzzy random headstream flows first a kruse and meyer based transformation method is used to convert the fuzzy random variables into fuzzy numbers kruse and meyer 2012 that is the transformed fuzzy value e i q u a e b e c e where a e p l a l p m a m p h a h b e p l b l p m b m p h b h and c e p l c l p m c m p h c h then using the following equation an expected value operator with an optimistic pessimistic index i e 0 ε 1 as defined in xu and zhou 2011 is applied to convert the deterministic variables e ε e i q u 1 ε 2 a e 1 2 b e ε 2 c e where ε 0 1 is the optimistic pessimistic index that is based on the hydrological situation in the river basin e i in e ε e i q u is used to transform the fuzzy random variables into fuzzy variables the e ε in e ε e i q u is for the measure me for the expected value operator for the fuzzy variables similar to the headstream flow case the corresponding discrete fuzzy random bod and do concentrations are determined e ε e i c b u e ε e i c o u accordingly the flow rate the bod concentrations and the do concentrations at checkpoint 0 q r 0 c b 0 and c o 0 can be initialized as follows 11 q r 0 e ε e i q u c b 0 e ε e i c b u c o 0 e ε e i c o u stream quality standard constraints all dischargers on the discharger level must ensure that the specified constituents in the stream at the corresponding checkpoint do not exceed the prescribed stream quality standards set by the er therefore as an example at checkpoint s the corresponding discharger needs to make sure that the bod concentrations c bs do not exceed the specified bod river standards b us and in an actual situation are not below 0 namely 12 0 c bs b us at the same time the do concentrations c os at checkpoint s should not be less than the allowable do standards d ls which can be written as 13 d ls c os sewage treatment capacity constraint to meet the specified stream quality standards the dischargers generally have to remove a fraction of the total bod in our assumptions conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as primary and secondary sewage treatment processes are used to treat the dischargers wastewater the primary bod removal treatment is equal to η s min and the secondary treatment is η s max in china it is an er requirement that dischargers provide at least the primary treatment to ensure that there are no floating pollutants therefore the sewage treatment capacity constraint on discharger s is that the bod removal η s should not exceed the maximum bod removal capacity η s max and should be no less than the minimum bod removal capacity η s min which is mathematically expressed as 14 η s min η s η s max pollution cost objective in the pt wla process each discharger needs to minimize their own unit pollution costs by making effective bod effluent removal decisions therefore the pollution costs are made up of the sewage treatment costs and the pollution taxes which are defined in the following sewage treatment costs the discharger s sewage treatment involves amortization and operating costs sewage treatment cost curves indicate the relationship between the additional costs incurred by changes to the bod removal with the corresponding bod removal fraction being generated based on historical discharger data from previous studies lee and wen 1997 qin et al 2007 the power function used to fit the cost curve for each sewage treatment and the sewage treatment cost function c s for discharger s can be written as 15 c s k c 1 s q ds k c 3 s k c 2 s q ds k c 3 s η s k c 4 s pigovian tax cost in this study a pigovian tax must be imposed on dischargers when the bod concentrations in the stream exceed the specified tax threshold at the corresponding checkpoint it is assumed that a constant bod tax rate t b is set by the er for the river system and that a tax is only imposed on out of threshold bod concentrations therefore as an example for discharger s if the bod concentrations at checkpoint s do not exceed the tax threshold i e c bs al bs the tax is 0 however if the bod concentrations at checkpoint s exceed the quota i e c bs al bs a tax equal to q rs t b c bs al bs is imposed by integrating the above cases the pigovian tax cost p s for discharger s can be mathematically expressed as 16 p s q rs t b c bs al bs c bs al bs 2 in summary the pollution costs for discharger s are made up of the sewage treatment costs c s and the pollution taxes p s each discharger on the discharger level has to achieve reasonable bod removal to ensure a minimization of unit pollution costs upc s the dischargers objectives are described in the following 17 min η s upc s c s q ds p s q ds 2 2 3 pt wla model in our model solving the pt wla problem is an interactive decision making process between the er and the multiple dischargers in the river system based on the above analysis this process involves hierarchical decision rules for the leader and the multiple followers which is a stackelberg game however as the water flows downstream each subsequent discharger s bod removal decisions are restricted by the upstream water quality which is affected by the upstream dischargers behavior therefore as there are a series of stream state transitions that include the water flow and the bod and do concentrations for each discharger on the discharger level this is a special multi stage decision making problem bi level programming can therefore be formulated to describe the stackelberg game between the er and multiple dischargers and special multi stage programming constructed to reflect the state transitions for the multiple dischargers through the integration of the above decision models in this paper a pt wla model is developed as cooperative bi level multi follower programming as follows 18 min al bs dupc

and to ensure that the er can influence the dischargers decisions a pigovian tax policy is employed to enhance the model applicability in similar situations the following considerations are presented 1 for the river water quality model modified streeter and phelps equations eq 6 and 10 are adopted to simulate the oxygen demand and balance process in the river system there are several complex model formulas that are able to simulate river water quality such as the enhanced stream water quality model qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 and the water quality analysis simulation program version 6 0 wasp6 ambrose et al 1993 therefore the er can employ these models to replace eqs 6 and 10 in the pt wla model to obtain more precise results 2 in the proposed model t b represents the pigovian tax rate determined by the er environmental economic theory states that setting a pigovian tax rate can influence each discharger s pollution reduction decisions by employing specific tax rates the er s environmental economic policies are more flexible and in certain situations the er can control the pigovian tax rates to achieve equity at a low cost level for the pt wla problem 3 to make the pt wla model more pervasive some objectives and constraints can be changed added or removed eq 18 for example as there are effluent discharge limitations for a variety of pollutants it is possible to add specific constraints that change the discharger s objective functions to match this model to actual situations 3 case study in this section the deyang jintang section of the tuojiang river basin in sichuan province china is considered as a practical application example to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model 3 1 overview of the study system the tuojiang river 28 88 30 29 n 105 44 108 20 e is located in eastern sichuan province in southern china and is the main tributary of the upper yangtze river as shown in fig 4 the tuojiang river is 522 km long 324 miles with mianzhu as the source it flows in a northwest southeast direction through deyang jintang ziyang neijiang fushun and lushan to eventually meet the yangtze river the tuojiang river basin area is 3 29 10 4 km 2 8 13 10 6 acres and covers 41 counties 21 52 million people and had a gdp of us 73 70 billion in 2012 as it includes several large and medium sized cities such as chengdu chongqing and deyang and thousands of large and medium sized factories the tuojiang river basin has the highest population density and the highest industrial concentration in sichuan province the rapid development in the tuojiang river basin due to industrial expansion and urban development has resulted in greater energy and water consumption and increasing wastewater discharges in 2013 the total wastewater discharged into the tuojiang river basin was 17 226 800 m 3 with the amount of cod and nh 3 n discharged being 20 385 and 4301 tonnes in terms of water quality in the tuojiang river 2 6 is grade i 47 4 is grade iii 21 4 is grade iv 7 9 is grade v and 21 1 is worse than grade v sichuan environmental protection agency 2013 therefore the tuojiang river basin is at a great risk of severe water pollution for example because a plant continued to release untreated industrial wastewater upstream of the tuojiang river from late february to march 2004 over three million people in downstream ziyang zizhong and neijiang counties had water supply interruptions with the total damage caused estimated at 300 million rmb as river pollution issues have now become a key focus of the sustainable development aims in the study area to control tuojiang river s water pollution the scepa as the er has adopted a series of measures and since 2011 a pigovian tax policy has been enforced the detailed policies can be found on the official sichuan province website athttp www sc gov cn 10462 10883 11066 2011 9 13 10180449 shtml in our study as it receives significant sewage from deyang and jintang the deyang jintang section which is a 60 km long section in the upstream reaches of the tuojiang river is taken as a practical case deyang is an important industrial city in sichuan province and a major base for chinese equipment manufacturing jintang is a county in the eastern part of chengdu the provincial capital of sichuan province which is an economic development center on the chengdu plain fig 4 indicates that

the deyang section and the reach from the qinglong residential area s 5 to the yuelai residential area s 10 is in the jintang section to address the pt wla problems in the deyang jintang reaches of the tuojiang river a proposed model 18 is formulated 3 2 data collection the hydrologic data for this case was obtained from the tuojiang river basin hydrological almanac the reach and the parameters for the river water quality degradation factors deoxygenation sedimentation and recreation rate were taken from field surveys statistical data and related research and to simplify the computing the annual average value of the saturated do concentrations in the river 10 08 mg l was used as a reference for the saturated do concentrations in each reach table 1 summarizes the hydrologic parameters for the reaches as shown in fig 4 the hydrologic data at the cross section of zengjia mountain is the headwater stream parameter in our study area based on historical data and expert experience table 2 shows the three discrete fuzzy random parameters the headstream flow q u and the bod and do concentrations c b u and c o u from the proposed method in eq 11 the expected values for these parameters were calculated for which the optimistic pessimistic index ε was set at 0 5 they are e ε e i q u 12 10 m 3 s e ε e i c b u 3 2 mg l and e ε e i c b u 6 2 mg l respectively table 3 gives the basic parameters for the dischargers which were extracted from the statistical yearbook for the corresponding study area using eq 3 the flow rates q rs and the corresponding ratios r s were computed for each checkpoint from data for the headstream flow the water withdrawal and the dischargers effluent discharges the stream quality standards at each checkpoint that specify the bod and do concentrations were set by the environmental quality standard for surface water of the people s republic of china gb 3838 2002 table 4 gives the checkpoint parameters the sewage treatment cost curve was determined using historical sewage plant data from each discharger and the sewage treatment technological process characteristics the sewage treatment costs are expressed as power function models see eq 15 the associated cost coefficients for eq 15 i e k c 1 s k c 2 s k c 3 s and k c 4 s were estimated from actual data using a non linear least squares method marquardt 1963 table 5 summarizes the cost coefficients for each discharger 4 results and discussion with all parameters specified the pt wla model was built as presented in section 2 2 3 and then solved using a hybrid nested pso algorithm nh pso xu et al 2016 to conduct the sensitivity analyses for the nh pso parameter selection the following parameter settings were adopted population size 40 iteration number 100 inertia weights were set at 1 0 and 0 1 and the acceleration constants were set at 2 0 and 2 0 the optimization problem was conducted and run on a core 2 2 53 ghz clock pulse with 4 096 mb of memory 4 1 results under different scenarios the stackelberg solution is the optimal solution for bi level programming dempe 2002 based on the characteristics of the proposed model eq 18 the stackelberg equilibrium point between the er and the multiple dischargers for the pt wla problem is when both make the most rational decisions at each checkpoint or the pigovian tax equilibrium point ptep in the model the er prescribes the pigovian tax rate t b and the pigovian tax thresholds al bs with both and particularly the pigovian tax rate t b influencing the ptep to determine the reasonable equilibrium points in this study system and to analyze the effectiveness of the pigovian tax policies for wla sensitivity analyses were conducted under different tax rate settings in our study five scenarios with different pigovian tax rates t b 0 004 0 0045 0 005 0 0055 and 0 006 rmb l mg were considered for each scenario the ptep the average unit pollution cost deviations dupc the average unit pollution costs aupc the average unit sewage treatment costs astc the average unit pigovian tax costs aptc and the bod concentration at each checkpoint in the river system were calculated and compared to allow for comparability of all indicators the average unit pollution cost deviations dupc were replaced and the standard deviation of the average unit pollution costs sdupc was chosen to measure the pt wla equity indicator sdupc is defined as sdupc dupc the ptep was considered the baseline for the pigovian tax thresholds al bs and the parameter ω was set to describe the change ratios which were decreased by 10 20 and 30 and increased by 10 20 and 30 because of the pigovian tax threshold limitations see eq 1 if the changed pigovian tax threshold exceeded the stream quality standards at a checkpoint it was set as the corresponding stream quality standard in this section the results under the different scenarios are discussed 4 1 1 scenario i t b 0 004 in this scenario the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 004 rmb l mg fig 5 illustrates the standard deviation for the average unit pollution costs sdupc the average unit pollution costs aupc the average unit sewage treatment costs astc the average unit pigovian tax costs aptc and the bod concentrations at each checkpoint in the river system the different sdupc values under the different change ratios ω formed a u shape as shown in fig 5 up and the optimal sdupc was obtained when ω 0 which was equal to 0 0276 rmb l mg in addition the aupc and aptc curves tended to proportionally decrease and the astc remained constant as the ω increased with the corresponding aupc being 1 75 rmb l mg 4 1 2 scenario ii t b 0 0045 fig 6 gives the results from the scepa and multiple dischargers ω when the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 0045 rmb l mg similar to scenario i the sdupc curve was a u shaped and the aupc and aptc curves decreased as the ω increased the corresponding sdupc and aupc for the ptep were 0 0292 and 1 59 rmb l mg differing from the previous scenario the astc curve showed a slight change with a change in ω see fig 6 up in contrast to scenario i the bod concentrations were lower at checkpoints 1 2 and 10 when the change ratio did not exceed 0 therefore with a lower ω the bod concentrations would decrease further for example at checkpoint 10 the bod concentrations were 4 50 4 50 4 73 and 5 26 respectively when ω was 30 20 10 and 0 see fig 6 down 4 1 3 scenario iii t b 0 005 the curves for sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentration at each checkpoint in the river system under the changing ω when the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 005 rmb l mg are presented in fig 7 these curves were similar to the curves in scenario i and ii and the sdupc and aupc were 0 0297 and 1 60 rmb l mg at which point the pteps were achieved see fig 5 6 compared to scenario ii as the tax rate grew there were a greater number of checkpoints at which the bod concentrations decreased checkpoints 4 and 9 further at the same checkpoint the bod concentrations in this scenario were no larger than the above scenarios under the same ω for example the bod concentrations at checkpoint 10 were 4 12 4 12 4 59 and 5 10 respectively when ω 30 20 10 and 0 and were less than in scenario ii see fig 7 down 4 1 4 scenario iv t b 0 0055 fig 8 shows a series of results including sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentrations in the river system under a changing ω when the pigovian tax rate was 0 0055 rmb l mg these curves were similar to the previous case the sdupc and aupc were 0 0243 and 1 62 rmb l mg at the equilibrium point in contrast to scenario iii as shown in fig 8 down discharger 8 was influenced by the tax rate increase with the bod concentrations at the corresponding checkpoint decreasing when ω was changed from 30 to 20 further the equilibrium point i e ω 0 the sdupc 0 0243 rmb l mg under this scenario was significantly lower than in scenario iii 0 0297 rmb l mg 4 1 5 scenario v t b 0 006 when the pigovian tax was set at 0 006 rmb l mg the curves for sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentrations under the ω were similar to scenario iv as shown in fig 9 the sducp and aucp at the ptep were 0 0155 and 1 81 rmb l mg compared to the previous case except for dischargers 5 6 and 7 all other dischargers needed to improve their bod removal fractions to minimize their unit pollution costs therefore the corresponding bod concentrations were less than in scenario iv see fig 9 down further the sducp 0 0155 rmb l mg in this scenario was significantly lower than in the previous scenarios however the aucp 1 81 rmb l mg was higher which indicates that setting an overly high tax could lead to significant increases in the dischargers pollution costs fig 10 compares the results for sdupc and aupc from the ptep under different scenarios in fig 10 up there is an inverted u shaped curve for the sdupc when the pigovian tax rate increases sdupc reached a peak 0 0297 rmb l mg when the tax rate was t b 0 005 rmb l mg in contrast to the sdupc case the aupc curve was a u shaped curve and the lowest point 1 59 rmb l mg was when the tax rate was set at 0 0045 rmb l mg fig 10 down shows the scatter plot for sdupc and aupc with the blue curve describing the ptep change process in the pt wla model under the different scenarios in scenario iv the sdupc and aupc were 0 0243 and 1 62 rmb l mg and both these values were in the medium range in all scenarios as more than 50 percent of the dischargers were required to increase their bod removal to minimize their pollution costs in the study area it can be concluded from fig 10 down that the tradeoff between the equity and costs in the river system is considered more comprehensively when the tax rate is 0 0055 rmb l mg therefore t b 0 0055 rmb l mg was chosen as the basic parameter and the optimal solution for the pt wla model in the deyang jintang section of tuojiang river as shown in table 6 4 2 comparative analysis to further analyze the role of the pigovian tax in the river basin water quality management in this section a comparative analysis was conducted between a traditional wla model and the multi objective wla model 4 2 1 comparison with a traditional wla model to further examine how the pigovian tax policy affects discharger pollutant reduction behavior the model was compared with a traditional wla model when the pigovian tax policy was not considered in the wla process i e al bs b us for s 1 2 s the dischargers levels in the pt wla model were analogous to the traditional wla model cardwell and ellis 1993 qin et al 2007 qin et al 2009 the traditional wla model often uses dynamic programming with minimal total pollution costs as the objective which can be written as follows 19 min η s tpc s 1

using qin and huang s algorithm qin et al 2007 and the results compared to the proposed model as shown in table 7 the sdupc for the proposed and traditional models were 0 0243 and 0 1897 rmb l mg the aupc for the pt wla model was 1 62 rmb l mg which consisted of the astc 1 38 rmb l mg and aptc 0 19 rmb l mg and the aupc for the traditional wla model was 1 35 rmb l mg which only included the sewage treatment costs the comparisons for the bod removals η s for all dischargers were as follows for the pt wla model they were 0 73 0 31 0 85 0 77 0 86 0 49 0 48 0 30 0 88 and 0 87 and for the traditional model they were 0 61 0 44 0 86 0 66 0 90 0 49 0 48 0 30 0 88 and 0 77 the bod and do concentrations at all checkpoints for the proposed and traditional models are shown in figs 11 4 2 2 comparison with a multi objective wla model related studies brill et al 1976 yandamuri et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 have claimed that there is an equilibrium point between cost and equity in the multi objective wla the pt wla is a stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers with its optimal solution ptep also being an equilibrium point to determine the ptep under a given pigovian tax rate the er sets the most reasonable pigovian tax thresholds to achieve the wla equity objective based on a rational reaction from the dischargers at the same time each discharger makes the most rational bod removal decisions to achieve their own minimal pollution cost objective this means that at the ptep the er and dischargers both obtain relatively satisfactory solutions as all the dischargers decisions together determine the wla cost in the river system the ptep is also considered the trade off point between equity and cost for the whole decision making process therefore to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in solving pt wla problems based on the hierarchical decision making between the er and the dischargers the model was compared to a multi objective wla model which considers the trade off between cost and equity in the same decision making environment in general multi objective models that deal with trade offs between wla cost and equity problems have linear or nonlinear constraint conditions and two objective functions that measure the cost and the equity burn and yulianti 2001 yandamuri et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 to effectively demonstrate the differences between the proposed model and the multi objective model in solving pt wla problems a pigovian tax policy was integrated into the multi objective wla model and the objective function for the total pollution costs was considered in the equation cf s 1 s c s p s and the equation dupc 1 s s 1 s upc s aupc 2 was used to denote the equity measure to allow for a comparison of both indicators and the standard deviation of the average unit pollution costs sdupc was chosen defined as sdupc dupc as the indicator to measure the equity therefore the multi objective

yandamuri et al 2006 and the proposed model was calculated using a hybrid nested pso algorithm xu et al 2016 based on the study area data the deyang reaches of the tuojiang river the results were compared to the pt wla model as shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that for the pt wla model point 0 was the optimal solution as with the mo wla model there was a trade off relationship between the cost and equity with the preferred alternatives again being on the lower left portion of the curve points 1 2 and 3 were found to be non inferior solutions to the mo wla model points 1 and 3 were two extreme cases complete costs and equity priority and point 2 was the trade off solution between these two objectives the corresponding results for the pt wla model and the mo wla model are shown in table 8 note that the total pollution costs cf for the pt wla can be calculated using the following equation cf s 1 s q ds upc s 4 3 discussion in this section the results of the above sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed and some management recommendations given proposition 1 there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pigovian tax based wla decision making process fig 10 shows that a rational pigovian tax rate setting results in a tradeoff between equity and pollution costs in a river system the equity objective measured as sdupc is mainly focused on the scepa and the pollution costs measured as aupc are considered by the multiple dischargers it is critical to determine a reasonable level for the pigovian tax rate gren et al 2000 claimed that a tax policy could have a direct effect on the dischargers pollution costs and possibly influence their pollutant removal decision making low tax levels however may result in a failure of the pigovian tax policy as dischargers may ignore the pollution cost impact of the taxes in fig 10 up when the pigovian tax rate was set too low such as in scenario i there was no effect therefore the scepa can only achieve river system equilibrium by imposing an extra pigovian tax on the dischargers however this type of move could result in higher pollution costs for the dischargers aupc 1 75 and a higher pollution cost deviation for the scepa sdupc 0 0276 when the tax rate is too high i e t b 0 006 the pigovian tax policy effectively influences most dischargers pollution reduction decisions and is equitable for all dischargers sdupc 0 0155 however an overly high tax rate could result in the over treatment of waste water by the dischargers and the associated excessive pollution costs aupc 1 81 therefore to ensure higher quality waste water to meet their pollution cost goals the dischargers would need to unnecessarily raise their spending to improve the sewage treatment which would consume more energy and generate more greenhouse gases stokes and horvath 2009 which would be an unsustainable way to satisfy the river system water needs and preserve the aquatic ecosystems grant et al 2012 proposition 2 a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla has the potential to control water pollution and resolve the conflict between the dischargers the proposed model eq 18 was developed to describe a river s wla problems under a pigovian tax policy when the ptep is achieved a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy can be developed from the results of the comparative analysis between the pt wla and the traditional wla model as shown in table 7 it can be seen that the proposed model has a better potential to control water pollution and resolve the conflicts between the dischargers in table 7 the astc in the pt wla model is larger than in the traditional wla model indicating that because of the increasing sewage treatment costs and the need to pay a pigovian tax the discharger s pollution costs may increase under a pigovian tax policy in this situation similar to the results of gren et al 2000 dischargers would need to improve their bod removal levels to avoid paying excessive pollution taxes from table 7 the bod removals of dischargers 1 and 3 in the pt wla model were greater than in the traditional model however for dischargers 2 3 and 5 the situation was reversed which indicates that upstream dischargers i e dischargers 1 and 3 may obtain more waste loads which results in the subsequent downstream dischargers i e dischargers 2 3 and 5 needing to increase their bod removals to meet the specified stream quality standards this demonstrated that the pigovian tax policy can to some extent solve the problems caused by traditional methods that is upstream dischargers can impose a cost on downstream water users because of the lower water quality this may also be the reason river system inequities occur in the traditional model in fig 11 up the bod concentrations at almost all checkpoints in the traditional model were equal to the corresponding stream quality standards except for discharger 8 which had a minimum bod removal capacity limitation all bod concentrations in the pt wla model were no larger than those in the traditional model however an opposite situation for the do concentrations was shown in fig 11 down this indicates that if there were no pigovian tax policy all dischargers would seek to maximize the use of the er allocated waste load to ensure minimal sewage treatment costs implying that pollution emissions could be restricted the ecological environment improved and sustainable river basin development achieved if the er imposes pigovian taxes on the river system dischargers in conclusion the pt wla was able to effectively control the water pollution in the river system from table 7 it can be concluded that the sdupc in the proposed model was smaller than that in the traditional model and all dischargers upc s were almost equal this appears to suggest that using the traditional model to allocate waste load could lead to inequitable results for the dischargers in the pt wla model the er focuses on the need for wla equity in the river system and therefore imposes a pigovian tax on each discharger to encourage them to adjust their unit pollution costs therefore the pigovian tax policy can to some extent also alleviate the conflict between the dischargers proposition 3 dischargers have different reactions towards the given pigovian tax rates as the comparison results between the pt wla and the traditional wla in table 7 indicate when the er sets pigovian tax rates in the river system the dischargers have different reactions to the bod removal decisions when a pollution policy was considered at a tax rate of 0 0055 rmb l mg dischargers 1 and 3 increased their bod removals dischargers 2 3 and 5 decreased their bod removal and the other dischargers bod removals remained the same in the proposed model eq 18 each discharger made reasonable bod removal decisions to minimize their own pollution costs which were made up of waste treatment costs and pollution taxes a mathematical analysis of the discharger s objective function eq 17 shows that a pigovian tax rate t b affects the discharger s pollution cost function based on pigovian tax theory hanley and white 2002 in general a rational discharger makes bod removal decisions to ensure the marginal costs of the bod removals c η s are equal to the pigovian tax rate t b because each discharger faces some restrictions in terms of stream quality standards and sewage treatment capacity η t l η s η t u under a given pigovian tax rate t b there are three possible discharger bod removal decisions see fig 13 a reaction i tax rate is too low i e t b 1 c η s l in this situation the pigovian tax policy is ineffective and has no impact on the discharger s bod removal decisions rational dischargers such as dischargers 6 7 and 8 make bod removal decisions equal to η s l reaction ii tax rate is moderate i e c η s l t b 2 c η s u in this case the pigovian tax policy encourages the dischargers to change their decisions similar to the conclusion in gren et al 2000 the discharger such as dischargers 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 can achieve optimal bod removals η s at a marginal cost c η s equal to the pigovian tax rate t b 2 reaction iii tax rate is too high i e t b 3 c η s u the pigovian tax policy can also impact the dischargers bod removal decisions from fig 13 as a the abscissa values at the intersection point between the marginal cost curve of the bod removals and the pigovian tax rate curve are more than η s u the rational discharger has to accept a heavy pigovian tax fee so the bod removals are equal to η s u an illustration of the multiple discharger s bod removal decisions at a given tax rate are shown in fig 13 b in fig 13 b it can be seen that different dischargers in the river system have different reactions towards the pigovian tax rates because dischargers have varying bod removal cost curves they have different attitudes to the same pigovian tax rate some dischargers such as discharger 1 may not be affected while others such as the discharger 2 s s 1 see the tax rate as moderate and make bod removal decisions as described in ii the others feel that the tax rate is too high and therefore determine their bod removals based on reaction iii proposition 4 the equilibrium between cost and equity in the pt wla model is non inferior to that of the mo wla model for the pt wla problem from the above analysis both the pt wla and the mo wla models can reach a corresponding equilibrium point i e ptep between the cost objective and the equity objective for the pt wla problem as the pt wla and the mo wla comparison results in table 8 show points 0 and 3 had a similar equity objective value however the total pollution costs at point 0 cf 105 06 were smaller than at point 3 cf 108 74 therefore for the pt wla model point 0 was the optimal solution as the first priority was given to the scepa equity objective function for the mo wla model point 3 was a non inferior solution where the decision maker is seeking to achieve the equity objective therefore from these results it can be concluded that the pt wla model optimal solutions were better than the mo wla model optimal solutions for the pt wla problem a possible reason is that multi objective wla models ignore the stackelberg game between the different parties and assume that the scepa and the dischargers have completely consistent objectives when a complete equity priority is considered when solving the mo wla the corresponding cost objective function is ignored which leads to a high total pollution cost in the river system however as the aim of the pt wla model is to increase the equity without imposing too high a cost there is a recognition of the stackelberg game between the scepa and the dischargers when the scepa sets the pigovian tax thresholds to achieve the wla equity objective the rational reaction from the dischargers is fully considered to avoid too high a total pollution cost in summary the pt wla model was shown to be better able to match the actual circumstances and was proven to be more reasonable when setting pigovian tax standards and allocating waste load 4 4 management recommendations based on the above analysis and discussion in this section some management recommendations are proposed for river system wla 4 4 1 need for a combined water policy rational wla is the key to resolving the problems of unreasonable wastewater discharges into river systems as higher requirements are needed for wla conventional wla methods and technologies have obvious shortcomings when seeking to implement advanced water quality management therefore a combined water policy should be set and executed for example environmental economic measures such as pigovian tax policies can be integrated into wla planning without such a scheme dischargers would tend to pursue the lowest possible pollution costs and only ensure that their discharge behavior fulfilled the allowable water quality standards at the corresponding checkpoint therefore they would lack the motivation to continuously improve their wastewater removals using the proposed model in this paper a pigovian tax policy could be built for a river system which as discussed in proposition 2 could not only guide dischargers to reduce effluent discharges but could also go some way to resolving the conflicts between the dischargers and achieve wla equity 4 4 2 suitable pigovian tax rate setting the er can affect each discharger s effluent discharge behavior using a pigovian tax policy that is the er can fully consider the actual situation and choose a desirable water pollutant reduction scheme however as discussed in proposition 3 as dischargers have different reactions towards the tax rates the pigovian tax policy may be inefficient if the tax rate is too low or too high in addition as there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pt wla process a different tax rate can result in a different ptep see proposition 1 therefore for an efficient pigovian tax policy it is recommended that the er set a suitable tax rate when using the proposed model as river systems deteriorate the er can increase the pigovian tax rate that is when a river system is deteriorating the er could consider dynamic tax rate setting when using the proposed methodology to deal with wla problems for instance to encourage economic development in the river system at the beginning the er could use the pt wla model to set a lower pigovian tax rate and use the pigovian tax funds to assist dischargers improve their wastewater treatment capacities then after a period of time the er could gradually increase the pigovian tax rate to encourage dischargers to upgrade their wastewater treatments in the subsequent period the pigovian tax rate could be further increased until the strictest pigovian tax policy is applied to the river system 5 conclusions and future research the main purpose of this paper was to develop a mathematical model to solve a wla problem under a pigovian tax policy i e a pigovian tax based wla problem which was generalized from thetuojiang river basin prototype the application of the proposed model to the tuojiang river basin demonstrated its practicality and efficiency with the associated analyses demonstrating the influence of a pigovian tax policy on the multi stakeholder decisions to achieve equity at a low cost level for the pt wla problem to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers in river systems a cooperative bi level multi follower programming model was developed to solve the pt wla problem unlike conventional wla decisions the pt wla problem was considered to be a hierarchical decision problem with the er as the leader setting the pollution tax to achieve the wla equity objective and the dischargers as the followers making bod removal decisions to minimize their own pollution costs with full knowledge of the er s decisions based on the mathematical analysis the decision structure for the pt wla was shown to be a stackelberg game with its lower level process being similar to a markovian decision using the proposed model a pigovian tax based wla equilibrium strategy was achieved the application of the proposed model to the tuojiang river basin case demonstrated the following there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pt wla decision making process and the pigovian tax rate can significantly affect the dischargers decisions when the pollution tax rate is set too low there is no effect however an overly high tax rate could result in heavy costs to the dischargers and excessive pollution costs compared with the traditional wla model a model that includes a pigovian tax policy not only influences the dischargers pollution reduction behavior as in gren et al 2000 but because of the specific equity principle can also go some way to alleviating the conflicts between the dischargers compared with the multi objective wla model the cost and equity equilibrium in the pt wla model was non inferior to the mo wla model for the pt wla problem thereby providing indirect evidence for the superiority of our proposed method in solving pt wla problems the limitations of the present study are that only a single equity principle was considered and the model was general the single equity principle was used because we only selected an equity principle to measure the wla equity however there are many principles for measuring water quality management allocation equity sen 2001 ringius et al 2002 gren and destouni 2012 the main reason for not considering multiple principles in this study to measure the equity was that we hoped to further explore the influence of the policy instruments on the trade off between cost effectiveness and equity in wla decisions and it was considered very difficult to consider multiple principle based equity objectives for the er s objective function in the future a pt wla model based on different equity principles could be developed as the proposed model was general it is not suitable for solving related wla problems under the eu water framework as the transfer tax on water pollution across regional boundaries was not considered the main reason for neglecting the transfer tax was due to the specialization in the case and the location of the dischargers the model was simplified for computational efficiency in the case study therefore designing advanced wla models that include a transfer tax policy could be an interesting topic for future

7136,efficient waste load allocation plays a critical role in improving water quality in this paper a pigovian tax based waste load allocation problem generalized from a prototype in the tuojiang river basin is proposed to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for waste load allocation is designed to provide an optimization method for water quality management that fully considers the stackelberg game between the environmental regulators and the river system dischargers the successful application of this model to the tuojiang river basin demonstrates its practicality and efficiency sensitivity analyses under different tax rate settings are given to provide the environmental regulators with insights into the impacts of a pigovian tax policy on the discharger s bod removal decisions as well as to identify the waste load allocation trade offs between costs and equity compared to conventional models the proposed method has the ability to reduce pollutants and achieve equitable waste load allocations the results demonstrated that as the proposed method can encourage dischargers to improve emissions performance it could be of significant assistance to environmental decision making keywords equilibrium strategy river system pigovian tax policy waste load allocation 1 introduction in recent years rapid industrialization and urbanization in many developing and developed countries has resulted in significant water pollution problems vörösmarty et al 2010 goel 2006 an estimated 1 2 billion people currently lack access to safe drinking water and millions of people including 3 900 children a day die annually from the diseases transmitted in unsafe water grant et al 2012 in china because of the excessive pollution discharges from industrial municipal and agricultural sewage water pollution has become a more serious environmental problem than water resource scarcity li et al 2014 liu and diamond 2005 more than 40 of rivers and 80 of lakes have become severely polluted from human activities in china and as a result about 300 million rural residents lack access to safe drinking water chinese academy of sciences 2008 to control water quality and improve river basin environments the chinese government is developing water infrastructure and establishing and integrating wastewater treatment systems liu and yang 2012 turpin 2008 in addition various laws policies and regulations for water environmental protection have been promulgated for example in sichuan province an important region upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers in china the sichuan environmental protection agency scepa the environmental regulator er has imposed a pigovian tax policy to control water pollution and resolve the conflicts between the dischargers on the tuojiang and minjiang rivers the most important upper yangtze river tributaries sichuan environmental protection agency 2013 however river systems are coupled human and natural systems that is they are integrated systems in which people interact with natural components liu et al 2007 as human and natural system couplings vary across space time and organizational units a single water management strategy often fails to achieve water sustainability and can even cause unintended environmental and socioeconomic consequences liu and yang 2012 the tuojiang river basin for example is a microcosm of a typical river basin in developing countries where all subareas tend to use a greater quantity of natural resources to develop the local economy as a result the subareas efforts result in a greater quantity of discharge sewage into the river system while establishing stream standards at each checkpoint by the scepa can effectively control total sewage discharges into the river system the actual situation in the tuojiang river basin shows that setting stream standards can result in waste load allocation inequities sichuan province bulletin 2011 which consequently affects the subareas economic and social development therefore combined water policies that consider both the ecological and human components as well as their respective connections need to be developed for effective water quality management that is water quality management technologies combined with environmental economic policy are required with the aim of sustainable basin development this paper focuses on a waste load allocation problem with a pigovian tax policy that was generalized from a prototype in the tuojiang river basin waste load allocation wla has been found to be a significant water quality management method for river basins and is vital to controlling unconscionable river system discharges traditional wla methods have followed an agent based framework in which the wastewater loads are distributed based on the er s experience and statistical analysis krenkel 2012 however the use of these methods can cause unreasonable wlas consequently mathematical modeling has been used as an effective water quality management technique to resolve wla problems for which many different mathematical programming methods have been developed to model river system water quality management problems and minimize pollution costs toward the end of the 1960s loucks et al 1967 and revelle et al 1968 began building a linear programming model for water pollution control and liebman and lynn 1966 developed a dynamic programming model to deal with river system wla based on the results of the streeter and phelps equations to accurately estimate the sewage treatment cost curve a nonlinear model was developed to allocate treatment requirements ecker 1975 even though the above methods were able to quickly determine optimal wlas there were still many uncertainties such as the random nature of hydrological conditions climate change and temperature and humidity variations milly et al 2008 pallottino et al 2005 research began to focus on addressing these wla uncertainties using stochastic programming models tung and hathhorn 1990 employed random chance constrained programming to solve water quality management problems that considered the water quality parameter uncertainties using spatial and cross correlations cardwell and ellis 1993 presented stochastic dynamic programming models for wla that included both parameter type ii and model type i uncertainty other stochastic wla model formats have also been developed anderson et al 2000 mujumdar and subbarao vemula 2004 revelli and ridolfi 2004 huang and loucks 2000 and subsequently wla fuzzy and interval programming models were developed mujumdar and saxena 2004 karmakar and mujumdar 2006 li and huang 2009 qin et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 mujumdar and subbarao vemula 2004 introduced a fuzzy wla model that was extended to incorporate qual2e and used a simulation optimization approach for the calculations qin et al 2009 developed an interval fuzzy nonlinear programming model for water quality management under uncertainty and to address the uncertainties in the proposed model designed a general framework that included interval and fuzzy programming li et al 2014 established a large scale inexact two stage wla model to trade off economic development and environmental protection however using traditional wla models was found to result in wastewater load distribution inequalities sichuan province bulletin 2011 yandamuri et al 2006 as the upstream dischargers were able to impose pollution costs on the downstream water users because of the lower water quality krenkel 2012 despite these obvious inequalities very limited attention has been given to these types of wla equity problems brill et al 1976 started exploring equity measures in water quality management alternatives and hathhorn and tung 1989 built bi objective fuzzy linear programming to solve a multiple discharge wla problem that had waste discharge maximization and equity minimization as the two objectives three optimization model formulas were developed by burn and yulianti 2001 to examine different wla problems that included wla trade offs between cost effectiveness and fairness yandamuri et al 2006 proposed a multi objective optimization framework for wla that considered cost equity and dissolved oxygen violations as the optimal objectives nikoo et al 2012 presented a new game theory methodology for equitable wla in rivers by utilizing fuzzy bi matrix games gren and destouni 2012 presented a general framework for identifying the implications of a divergence between the different nutrient load quantification approaches that included both cost and fairness criteria outcomes while the above studies considered the cost and fairness conflicts in wla problems theory and applications the tuojiang river basin case is quite different because of the execution of a combined water strategy i e stream standards and a pigovian tax policy therefore it is necessary to focus on how environmental policy instruments can affect the cost and fairness in wla problems currently there are two types of environmental policy instruments for water quality management pigovian taxes and the pollution permit market baumol and oates 1988 stavins 2003 pigovian taxes which were first introduced by pigou 2013 are applied to market activities that generate negative externalities the most typical example of which is environmental pollution baumol 1972 for a wla problem gren et al 2000 built a theoretical model to calculate cost effective solutions for the reduction in nutrient and pollutant loads and to determine an associated design for the charges i e pigovian tax policy therefore as noted in gren et al 2000 pigovian tax policies can influence the wla in river systems however in the actual situation in the tuojiang river basin despite the insights provided by these studies a theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of pigovian tax policies on wla decision making needs further investigation especially when considering cases such as the tuojiang river basin similar to the eu water framework the scepa as the river basin er is in charge of allocating the existing waste assimilative capacity to the waste dischargers and setting the stream standards for each section of the tuojiang river however natural resource allocation inequity can adversely affect the subareas development plans therefore to resolve the conflicts between the dischargers and to control the tuojiang river basin water pollution the scepa has been considering a combined water strategy sichuan province bulletin 2011 through the implementation of a pigovian tax policy that can be integrated into the wla planning specifically the river basin er first specifies a constant tax rate then sets pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint when the contaminant concentration rises above this value at a checkpoint the corresponding dischargers must pay pollution taxes for the out of threshold contaminants see fig 1 in this decision process the er needs to decide on suitable relative low cost pigovian tax policy to ensure fairness in the river system however to date very few studies have addressed this aspect in equitable wla planning this process however involves multiple parties in contrast to the eu water framework as all dischargers are co located in the same river basin in sichuan province there are no complicated pollution transfer negotiations necessary between the river system dischargers which to some extent reduces the complexity of the problem dischargers are given permission to release a certain quantity of pollutants into the river therefore to minimize their own pollution costs the dischargers decide what fraction needs to be removed to maintain acceptable water body quality in the river as prescribed by the er however because of the pigovian tax policy limitations the discharger s pollution costs unlike in a traditional wla consist of sewage treatment costs and pollution taxes therefore each discharger needs to achieve reasonable contaminant removal to trade off the two costs to minimize their own pollution costs under the specified stream standards and the pigovian tax thresholds see fig 1 as can be seen because of these developmental issues a wla problem under a pigovian tax policy is a hierarchical decision making problem with two main decision makers the er and the dischargers each of whom have independent objectives wla equity and individual pollution cost in such a hierarchical decision as the er can impose a pigovian tax on the dischargers to control their emissions performance current multi objective models and bi level models are incapable of determining the optimal allocation of waste load under a pigovian tax setting with this focus in mind in this paper we examine the development of a wla model that is combined with a pigovian tax policy this paper was motivated by the combined water strategy being used in the tuojiang river basin therefore in this paper we focused on building a new effective method to solve wla problems under a pigovian tax policy i e a pigovian tax based waste load allocation pt wla problem this paper focuses on the hierarchical decision framework to solve a pt wla problem for river systems with the aim of achieving equitable wla and wastewater discharge reductions the key characteristics of the hierarchical decision framework are that there is a stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers and an analogous markovian decision process between the dischargers a cooperative bi level multi follower programming model was formulated based on these framework features we also used our models to assist the scepa develop a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla in the deyang jintang section of the tuojiang river basin china these results indicated that an appropriate pigovian tax policy is advisable both for dischargers with high discharge rates and to ensure an equitable wla process our proposed method was proven to be practical and efficient in solving the pt wla problem in the river system the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define and analyze the problem description and modeling challenges for the wla under a pigovian tax policy and present the mathematical formulation for the mentioned problem in section 3 we present a practical case of the tuojiang river basin to show the effectiveness of the proposed model in section 4 we discuss and analyze the results of the case study in this section we conduct sensitivity and comparative analyses and give some management recommendations finally conclusions limitations and future research directions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 problem description integrating a pigovian tax policy to allocate waste loads is a challenge as the pt wla process is no longer directly determined by the er conflicts between the involved stakeholders are inevitable making the wla more complex practical investigations and surveys indicated that there are two steps in the pt wla procedure pigovian tax setting and the removal of the wastewater contaminants in the pigovian tax setting step the er makes a decision on the pigovian tax thresholds for the entire river system to achieve equitable wla which is to minimize deviations in the unit pollution costs for each discharger in the removal of the wastewater contaminants step each discharger makes efficient contaminant removal decisions to minimize their unit pollution costs see fig 1 therefore both the er and the dischargers attempt to optimize their objective functions under the constraints and reactions of the other party in the specific decision rule for the er and the dischargers the er first specifies a decision and then each discharger makes a decision to optimize their own objective function with full knowledge of the er s decision the er also makes a decision to optimize its own objective function based on the rational dischargers reaction this type of decision making process is similar to a stackelberg game möller et al 1993 based on the upstream water quality conditions which are influenced by the upstream discharger and the downstream stream standards prescribed by the er each discharger makes efficient contaminant removal decisions waste removal efficiency in the river systems is a special sequential decision problem as the upstream dischargers decisions affect the decisions of the subsequent downstream dischargers because the pollutants are transported along the river in this system each checkpoint conveys the pollutants knowledge and all necessary information about the previous behavior so that the subsequent discharger can determine an optimal policy for their section of the river this decision process is known as a markovian decision bellman 1966 to determine the most reasonable solution the stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers can be abstracted as a bi level programming model problem and calculated sakawa and nishizaki 2009 with the markovian decision discharger process being described as a special type of multi stage problem bellman 1966 based on the described mathematical features the pt wla problem therefore can be modeled as a cooperative bi level multi follower decision li 2013 2 2 modelling in this section a cooperative bi level multi follower optimization model is discussed for the pt wla river system problem the mathematical description is as follows 2 2 1 assumptions and notations before model construction the fundamental assumptions and notations are given assumptions 1 all dischargers are considered pollution points

requires the er to set pigovian tax thresholds and make discharger sewage removal decisions therefore the model has two levels of objectives and constraints an er level and a discharger level both of which are discussed in detail in the following er level for setting the pigovian tax thresholds to control water pollution and achieve equitable wla in the river system the er as the leader specifies the stream quality standards at each checkpoint and sets the pigovian tax policy specifically the er first specifies the stream quality standards at each checkpoint and sets a series of pigovian tax thresholds if the discharger has out of threshold contaminant emissions then taxes are imposed stream quality standard constraints the er specifies the stream quality standards and pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint because water quality standards are mandatory regulations that are designed to limit sewage discharge the pigovian tax is considered an environmental policy instrument designed to influence discharger behavior therefore the pigovian tax thresholds at each checkpoint i e al bs cannot exceed the associated stream quality standards i e b us and cannot be negative 1 0 al bs b us equity objective the unit pollution costs i e upc s on the discharger level are considered to be the primary indicators for the evaluation of the sewage disposal price for discharger s therefore unit pollution cost variance i e dupc on the er level is used to assess the equity of the river system wla which is defined as dupc s 1 s upc s aupc 2 in this study the er equity objective is to minimize the unit pollution cost variance that is 2 min al bs dupc s 1 s upc s aupc 2 where aupc is the weighted average unit pollution cost value which is equal to 1 s upc s s discharger bod effluent removal level to minimize the pollution costs which are made up of sewage treatment costs and pollution taxes on the pt wla discharger level each discharger as the followers seeks to ensure adequate contaminant removal to meet both the stream quality standards and the pigovian tax thresholds however the dischargers are also affected by the upstream water conditions as a result of the upstream discharger behavior to model these multi discharger bod effluent removal decisions the river system state transition constraints and objective functions are presented river system state transition water withdrawal use and discharger emissions on the same river may cause various river constituents to change further because of the river ecosystems biological chemical biochemical and physical processes the stream states defined as flow rate and the bod and do concentrations are continually changing the stream state is transferred from one discharger to the next as the water moves downstream therefore decision making making for the multi discharger bod removal is a multi stage problem bellman 1966 fig 2 shows a simplified illustration of the stream state transition framework in a river system as can be seen in fig 2 there are s stages in the river system s dischargers and checkpoints and three stream states flow rate and the bod and do concentrations the stream state at each checkpoint is transferred to the next checkpoint as the water flows downstream the three stream state transitions flow rate bod concentration and do concentration are described in the following flow rate state transition the river system flow rate state transition is based on a mass balance assumption and the flow continuity conditions qin et al 2007 fig 2 shows that the flow rate q rs at checkpoint s is composed of the upstream flow rate q r s 1 water withdrawal q ws and effluent discharge q ds from discharger s which can be expressed as 3 q rs q r s 1 q ws q ds bod state transition the bod concentration state transition in a river system is based on a mass balance assumption qin et al 2007 as shown in fig 2 there is a bod volume equilibrium at each checkpoint and the bod volume is determined by the bod amount entering this checkpoint and the corresponding discharger s treated effluent as an example of checkpoint s the bod amount i e c bs q rs is made up of the discharger s s treated bod effluent i e c bs i 1 η s q ds and the amount of bod entering this checkpoint i e c bs q r s 1 q ws where c bs denotes the bod concentrations entering checkpoint s to estimate these parameters sp equations phelps and streeter 1958 with camp dobbins modifications are adopted to simulate the pollutant biodegradation and to map the waste loads into the downstream do concentrations modified sp equations are used to describe the processes that determine the bod and do concentrations in the stream in which various factors affecting the assimilation capacity of the stream are considered the bod and do concentrations the biological and physical characteristics of the stream that affect settling rates reaeration and the bod additions due to runoff and scour based on the results of the first equation for the modified sp equations we can calculate the bod concentrations entering checkpoint s i e c bs which is equivalent to c bs c b s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 t s 1 define α s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 t s 1 and ζ s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 let α s 1 and ζ s 1 represent the conversion parameters for the do change at reach s 1 therefore c bs can be written as 4 c bs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 integrating the above equations the bod equilibrium at checkpoint s can be expressed as c bs q rs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 q r s 1 q ws c bs i 1 η s q ds therefore the bod state transition at checkpoint s can be expressed as 5 c bs q r s 1 q ws q rs α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 q ds q rs 1 η s c bs i to simplify the formula the ratio between the effluent discharge of discharger s and the stream flow at checkpoint s is defined as r s q ds q rs the bod state transition at checkpoint s is equivalent to 6 c bs 1 r s α s 1 c b s 1 ζ s 1 r s 1 η s c bs i do state transition similar to the bod case there is a do volume equilibrium at each checkpoint because of the mass balance assumptions see fig 2 as an example at checkpoint s the do amount i e c os q rs consists of the do amount entering this checkpoint i e c os q r s 1 q ws and the do amount in the treated effluent from discharger s q ds c os i where c os represents the do concentrations entering checkpoint s from the results of the second equation for the modified sp equations the do concentrations entering checkpoint s are equivalent to c os c o s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 c b s 1 r s 1 k a s 1 k e s 1 k d s 1 e k d s 1 k e s 1 t s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 k a s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 k d s 1 k a s 1 a s 1 k d s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 c do 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 to simplify the expression let β s 1 e k a s 1 t s 1 γ s 1 k d s 1 α s 1 β s 1 k a s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 δ s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 γ s 1 k d s 1 k a s 1 1 β s 1 a s 1 k d s 1 r s 1 k d s 1 k e s 1 c do be the conversion parameters for the do change at reach s which can be written as 7 c os β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 therefore after plugging eq 7 into the above do equilibrium at checkpoint s it can be written as c os q rs β s 1 c o s 1 γ s c b s 1 δ s 1 q r s 1 q ws c os i q ds and the do state transition at checkpoint s can be expressed as 8 c os q r s 1 q ws q rs β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 q ds q rs c os i similar to the bod case putting r s q ds q rs into eq 8 the do state transition equation is equivalent to 9 c os 1 r s β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 r s c os i in addition as the do concentration cannot exceed the saturated do of the river the do constraint state transition at checkpoint s is modified as 10 c os min 1 r s β s 1 c o s 1 γ s 1 c b s 1 δ s 1 r t c os i c do initial discharger conditions in this study it is assumed that the first discharger is not affected by an upstream discharger to simplify our model therefore the river headwater area is considered checkpoint 0 see fig 2 with the headwater area stream flow rate bod and do concentrations being equal to those at checkpoint 0 in the river system there are several uncertainties in the water management systems because of ecological environmental changes such as climate change and the anthropogenic changes caused by population growth and economic development milly et al 2008 for example river flows have generally been seen as typical uncertain parameters lansey et al 1989 huang and loucks 2000 pallottino et al 2005 that fluctuate each day because of influences such as air temperature rainfall and upstream water withdrawal further as the constituent volumes in the river also change frequently because of the constant stream flow it is very difficult to accurately measure these parameters based on previous studies in this study the headwater flow rate and the bod and do concentrations are assumed to be fuzzy random variables xu et al 2012 tu et al 2015 the headwater flow is used as an example to explain the motivation for characterizing these uncertainties as fuzzy random variables fig 3 illustrates the technological process for the discrete fuzzy random headstream flow construction first based on the historical flow rate data analysis in a specified river basin the upstream flow rate has one of three scenarios low level l medium level m or high level h the occurrence probability of the corresponding scenarios i e p l p m and p h are estimated then through detailed consultations with expert hydrologists who describe the situation in linguistic terms by giving an approximate range the data for each scenario are established for example the value range is between a k e and c k e with the most likely value being b k e where e is the index for the hydrologist for e 1 2 e and k is the index for the flow rate level for k l m h as the observed data are based on the hydrologists experience different hydrologists may have different conclusions therefore an owa operator is used to aggregate the linguistic information from all experts for each scenario xu and da 2002 that is the flow rate for scenario k a k e 1 e a k e e b k e 1 e b k e e and c k e 1 e c k e e in this way the upstream flow rate for each scenario can be conveniently described using triangular fuzzy numbers a k b k c k in summary the upstream flow rate can be constructed as a discrete fuzzy random variable q u a l b l c l with probability p l a m b m c m with probability p m a h b h c h with probability p h to deal with these discrete fuzzy random headstream flows first a kruse and meyer based transformation method is used to convert the fuzzy random variables into fuzzy numbers kruse and meyer 2012 that is the transformed fuzzy value e i q u a e b e c e where a e p l a l p m a m p h a h b e p l b l p m b m p h b h and c e p l c l p m c m p h c h then using the following equation an expected value operator with an optimistic pessimistic index i e 0 ε 1 as defined in xu and zhou 2011 is applied to convert the deterministic variables e ε e i q u 1 ε 2 a e 1 2 b e ε 2 c e where ε 0 1 is the optimistic pessimistic index that is based on the hydrological situation in the river basin e i in e ε e i q u is used to transform the fuzzy random variables into fuzzy variables the e ε in e ε e i q u is for the measure me for the expected value operator for the fuzzy variables similar to the headstream flow case the corresponding discrete fuzzy random bod and do concentrations are determined e ε e i c b u e ε e i c o u accordingly the flow rate the bod concentrations and the do concentrations at checkpoint 0 q r 0 c b 0 and c o 0 can be initialized as follows 11 q r 0 e ε e i q u c b 0 e ε e i c b u c o 0 e ε e i c o u stream quality standard constraints all dischargers on the discharger level must ensure that the specified constituents in the stream at the corresponding checkpoint do not exceed the prescribed stream quality standards set by the er therefore as an example at checkpoint s the corresponding discharger needs to make sure that the bod concentrations c bs do not exceed the specified bod river standards b us and in an actual situation are not below 0 namely 12 0 c bs b us at the same time the do concentrations c os at checkpoint s should not be less than the allowable do standards d ls which can be written as 13 d ls c os sewage treatment capacity constraint to meet the specified stream quality standards the dischargers generally have to remove a fraction of the total bod in our assumptions conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as primary and secondary sewage treatment processes are used to treat the dischargers wastewater the primary bod removal treatment is equal to η s min and the secondary treatment is η s max in china it is an er requirement that dischargers provide at least the primary treatment to ensure that there are no floating pollutants therefore the sewage treatment capacity constraint on discharger s is that the bod removal η s should not exceed the maximum bod removal capacity η s max and should be no less than the minimum bod removal capacity η s min which is mathematically expressed as 14 η s min η s η s max pollution cost objective in the pt wla process each discharger needs to minimize their own unit pollution costs by making effective bod effluent removal decisions therefore the pollution costs are made up of the sewage treatment costs and the pollution taxes which are defined in the following sewage treatment costs the discharger s sewage treatment involves amortization and operating costs sewage treatment cost curves indicate the relationship between the additional costs incurred by changes to the bod removal with the corresponding bod removal fraction being generated based on historical discharger data from previous studies lee and wen 1997 qin et al 2007 the power function used to fit the cost curve for each sewage treatment and the sewage treatment cost function c s for discharger s can be written as 15 c s k c 1 s q ds k c 3 s k c 2 s q ds k c 3 s η s k c 4 s pigovian tax cost in this study a pigovian tax must be imposed on dischargers when the bod concentrations in the stream exceed the specified tax threshold at the corresponding checkpoint it is assumed that a constant bod tax rate t b is set by the er for the river system and that a tax is only imposed on out of threshold bod concentrations therefore as an example for discharger s if the bod concentrations at checkpoint s do not exceed the tax threshold i e c bs al bs the tax is 0 however if the bod concentrations at checkpoint s exceed the quota i e c bs al bs a tax equal to q rs t b c bs al bs is imposed by integrating the above cases the pigovian tax cost p s for discharger s can be mathematically expressed as 16 p s q rs t b c bs al bs c bs al bs 2 in summary the pollution costs for discharger s are made up of the sewage treatment costs c s and the pollution taxes p s each discharger on the discharger level has to achieve reasonable bod removal to ensure a minimization of unit pollution costs upc s the dischargers objectives are described in the following 17 min η s upc s c s q ds p s q ds 2 2 3 pt wla model in our model solving the pt wla problem is an interactive decision making process between the er and the multiple dischargers in the river system based on the above analysis this process involves hierarchical decision rules for the leader and the multiple followers which is a stackelberg game however as the water flows downstream each subsequent discharger s bod removal decisions are restricted by the upstream water quality which is affected by the upstream dischargers behavior therefore as there are a series of stream state transitions that include the water flow and the bod and do concentrations for each discharger on the discharger level this is a special multi stage decision making problem bi level programming can therefore be formulated to describe the stackelberg game between the er and multiple dischargers and special multi stage programming constructed to reflect the state transitions for the multiple dischargers through the integration of the above decision models in this paper a pt wla model is developed as cooperative bi level multi follower programming as follows 18 min al bs dupc

and to ensure that the er can influence the dischargers decisions a pigovian tax policy is employed to enhance the model applicability in similar situations the following considerations are presented 1 for the river water quality model modified streeter and phelps equations eq 6 and 10 are adopted to simulate the oxygen demand and balance process in the river system there are several complex model formulas that are able to simulate river water quality such as the enhanced stream water quality model qual2e brown and barnwell 1987 and the water quality analysis simulation program version 6 0 wasp6 ambrose et al 1993 therefore the er can employ these models to replace eqs 6 and 10 in the pt wla model to obtain more precise results 2 in the proposed model t b represents the pigovian tax rate determined by the er environmental economic theory states that setting a pigovian tax rate can influence each discharger s pollution reduction decisions by employing specific tax rates the er s environmental economic policies are more flexible and in certain situations the er can control the pigovian tax rates to achieve equity at a low cost level for the pt wla problem 3 to make the pt wla model more pervasive some objectives and constraints can be changed added or removed eq 18 for example as there are effluent discharge limitations for a variety of pollutants it is possible to add specific constraints that change the discharger s objective functions to match this model to actual situations 3 case study in this section the deyang jintang section of the tuojiang river basin in sichuan province china is considered as a practical application example to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model 3 1 overview of the study system the tuojiang river 28 88 30 29 n 105 44 108 20 e is located in eastern sichuan province in southern china and is the main tributary of the upper yangtze river as shown in fig 4 the tuojiang river is 522 km long 324 miles with mianzhu as the source it flows in a northwest southeast direction through deyang jintang ziyang neijiang fushun and lushan to eventually meet the yangtze river the tuojiang river basin area is 3 29 10 4 km 2 8 13 10 6 acres and covers 41 counties 21 52 million people and had a gdp of us 73 70 billion in 2012 as it includes several large and medium sized cities such as chengdu chongqing and deyang and thousands of large and medium sized factories the tuojiang river basin has the highest population density and the highest industrial concentration in sichuan province the rapid development in the tuojiang river basin due to industrial expansion and urban development has resulted in greater energy and water consumption and increasing wastewater discharges in 2013 the total wastewater discharged into the tuojiang river basin was 17 226 800 m 3 with the amount of cod and nh 3 n discharged being 20 385 and 4301 tonnes in terms of water quality in the tuojiang river 2 6 is grade i 47 4 is grade iii 21 4 is grade iv 7 9 is grade v and 21 1 is worse than grade v sichuan environmental protection agency 2013 therefore the tuojiang river basin is at a great risk of severe water pollution for example because a plant continued to release untreated industrial wastewater upstream of the tuojiang river from late february to march 2004 over three million people in downstream ziyang zizhong and neijiang counties had water supply interruptions with the total damage caused estimated at 300 million rmb as river pollution issues have now become a key focus of the sustainable development aims in the study area to control tuojiang river s water pollution the scepa as the er has adopted a series of measures and since 2011 a pigovian tax policy has been enforced the detailed policies can be found on the official sichuan province website athttp www sc gov cn 10462 10883 11066 2011 9 13 10180449 shtml in our study as it receives significant sewage from deyang and jintang the deyang jintang section which is a 60 km long section in the upstream reaches of the tuojiang river is taken as a practical case deyang is an important industrial city in sichuan province and a major base for chinese equipment manufacturing jintang is a county in the eastern part of chengdu the provincial capital of sichuan province which is an economic development center on the chengdu plain fig 4 indicates that

the tuojiang river a proposed model 18 is formulated 3 2 data collection the hydrologic data for this case was obtained from the tuojiang river basin hydrological almanac the reach and the parameters for the river water quality degradation factors deoxygenation sedimentation and recreation rate were taken from field surveys statistical data and related research and to simplify the computing the annual average value of the saturated do concentrations in the river 10 08 mg l was used as a reference for the saturated do concentrations in each reach table 1 summarizes the hydrologic parameters for the reaches as shown in fig 4 the hydrologic data at the cross section of zengjia mountain is the headwater stream parameter in our study area based on historical data and expert experience table

parameters for the dischargers which were extracted from the statistical yearbook for the corresponding study area using eq 3 the flow rates q rs and the corresponding ratios r s were computed for each checkpoint from data for the headstream flow the water withdrawal and the dischargers effluent discharges the stream quality standards at each checkpoint that specify the bod and do concentrations were set by the environmental quality standard for surface water of the people s republic of china gb 3838 2002 table 4 gives the checkpoint parameters the sewage treatment cost curve was determined using historical sewage plant data from each discharger and the sewage treatment technological process characteristics the sewage treatment costs are expressed as power function models see eq 15 the associated cost coefficients for eq 15 i e k c 1 s k c 2 s k c 3 s and k c 4 s were estimated from actual data using a non linear least squares method marquardt 1963 table 5 summarizes the cost coefficients for each discharger 4 results and discussion with all parameters specified the pt wla model was built as presented in section 2 2 3 and then solved using a hybrid nested pso algorithm nh pso xu et al 2016 to conduct the sensitivity analyses for the nh pso parameter selection the following parameter settings were adopted population size 40 iteration number 100 inertia

results under different scenarios the stackelberg solution is the optimal solution for bi level programming dempe 2002 based on the characteristics of the proposed model eq 18 the stackelberg equilibrium point between the er and the multiple dischargers for the pt wla problem is when both make the most rational decisions at each checkpoint or the pigovian tax equilibrium point ptep in the model the er prescribes the pigovian tax rate t b and the pigovian tax thresholds al bs with both and particularly the pigovian tax rate t b influencing the ptep to determine the reasonable

to allow for comparability of all indicators the average unit pollution cost deviations dupc were replaced and the standard deviation of the average unit pollution costs sdupc was chosen to measure the pt wla equity indicator sdupc is defined as sdupc dupc the ptep was considered the baseline for the pigovian tax thresholds al bs and the parameter ω was set to describe the change ratios which were decreased by 10 20 and 30 and increased by 10 20 and 30 because of the pigovian tax threshold limitations see eq 1 if the changed pigovian tax threshold exceeded the stream quality standards at a checkpoint it was set as the corresponding stream quality standard in this section the results under the different scenarios are discussed 4 1 1 scenario i t b 0 004 in this scenario the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 004 rmb l mg fig 5 illustrates the standard deviation for the average unit pollution costs sdupc the average unit pollution costs aupc the average unit sewage treatment costs astc the average unit pigovian tax costs aptc and the bod concentrations at each checkpoint in the river system the different sdupc values under the different change ratios ω formed a u shape as shown in fig 5 up and the optimal sdupc was obtained when ω 0 which was equal to 0 0276 rmb l mg in addition the aupc and aptc curves tended to proportionally decrease and the astc remained constant as the ω increased with the corresponding aupc being 1 75 rmb l mg 4 1 2 scenario ii t b 0 0045 fig 6 gives the results from the scepa and multiple dischargers ω when the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 0045 rmb l mg similar to scenario i the sdupc curve was a u shaped and the aupc and aptc curves decreased as the ω increased the corresponding sdupc and aupc for the ptep were 0 0292 and 1 59 rmb l mg differing from the previous scenario the astc curve showed a slight change with a change in ω see fig 6 up in contrast to scenario i the bod concentrations were lower at checkpoints 1 2 and 10 when the change ratio did not exceed 0 therefore with a lower ω the bod concentrations would decrease further for example at checkpoint 10 the bod concentrations were 4 50 4 50 4 73 and 5 26 respectively when ω was 30 20 10 and 0 see fig 6 down 4 1 3 scenario iii t b 0 005 the curves for sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentration at each checkpoint in the river system under the changing ω when the pigovian tax rate was set at 0 005 rmb l mg are presented in fig 7 these curves were similar to the curves in scenario i and ii and the sdupc and aupc were 0 0297 and 1 60 rmb l mg at which point the pteps were achieved see fig 5 6 compared to scenario ii as the tax rate grew there were a greater number of checkpoints at which the bod concentrations decreased checkpoints 4 and 9 further at the same checkpoint the bod concentrations in this scenario were no larger than the above scenarios under the same ω for example the bod concentrations at checkpoint 10 were 4 12 4 12 4 59 and 5 10 respectively when ω 30 20 10 and 0 and were less than in scenario ii see fig 7 down 4 1 4 scenario iv t b 0 0055 fig 8 shows a series of results including sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentrations in the river system under a changing ω when the pigovian tax rate was 0 0055 rmb l mg these curves were similar to the previous case the sdupc and aupc were 0 0243 and 1 62 rmb l mg at the equilibrium point in contrast to scenario iii as shown in fig 8 down discharger 8 was influenced by the tax rate increase with the bod concentrations at the corresponding checkpoint decreasing when ω was changed from 30 to 20 further the equilibrium point i e ω 0 the sdupc 0 0243 rmb l mg under this scenario was significantly lower than in scenario iii 0 0297 rmb l mg 4 1 5 scenario v t b 0 006 when the pigovian tax was set at 0 006 rmb l mg the curves for sdupc aupc astc aptc and the bod concentrations under the ω were similar to scenario iv as shown in fig 9 the sducp and aucp at the ptep were 0 0155 and 1 81 rmb l mg compared to the previous case except for dischargers 5 6 and 7 all other dischargers needed to improve their bod removal fractions to minimize their unit pollution costs therefore the corresponding bod concentrations were less than in scenario iv see fig 9 down further the sducp 0 0155 rmb l mg in this scenario was significantly lower than in the previous scenarios however the aucp 1 81 rmb l mg was higher which indicates that setting an overly high tax could lead to significant increases in the dischargers pollution costs fig 10 compares the results for sdupc and aupc from the ptep under different scenarios in fig 10 up there is an inverted u shaped curve for the sdupc when the pigovian tax rate increases sdupc reached a peak 0 0297 rmb l mg when the tax rate was t b 0 005 rmb l mg in contrast to the sdupc case the aupc curve was a u shaped curve and the lowest point 1 59 rmb l mg was when the tax rate was set at 0 0045 rmb l mg fig 10 down shows the scatter plot for sdupc and aupc with the blue curve describing the ptep change process in the pt wla model under the different scenarios in scenario iv the sdupc and aupc were 0 0243 and 1 62 rmb l mg and both these values were in the medium range in all scenarios as more than 50 percent of the dischargers were required to increase their bod removal to minimize their pollution costs in the study area it can be concluded from fig 10 down that the tradeoff between the equity and costs in the river system is considered more comprehensively when the tax rate is 0 0055 rmb l mg therefore t b 0 0055 rmb l mg was chosen as the basic parameter and the optimal solution for the pt wla model in the deyang jintang section of tuojiang river as shown in table 6 4 2 comparative analysis to further analyze the role of the pigovian tax in the river basin water quality management in this section a comparative analysis was conducted between a traditional wla model and the multi objective wla model 4 2 1 comparison with a traditional wla model to further examine how the pigovian tax policy affects discharger pollutant reduction behavior the model was compared with a traditional wla model when the pigovian tax policy was not considered in the wla process i e al bs b us for s 1 2 s the dischargers levels in the pt wla model were analogous to the traditional wla model cardwell and ellis 1993 qin et al 2007 qin et al 2009 the traditional wla model often uses dynamic programming with minimal total pollution costs as the objective which can be written as follows 19 min η s tpc s 1

using qin and huang s algorithm qin et al 2007 and the results compared to the proposed model as shown in table 7 the sdupc for the proposed and traditional models were 0 0243 and 0 1897 rmb l mg the aupc for the pt wla model was 1 62 rmb l mg which consisted of the astc 1 38 rmb l mg and aptc 0 19 rmb l mg and the aupc for the traditional wla model was 1 35 rmb l mg which only included the sewage treatment costs the comparisons for the bod removals η s for all dischargers were as follows for the pt wla model they were 0 73 0 31 0 85 0 77 0 86 0 49 0 48 0 30 0 88 and 0 87 and for the traditional model they were 0 61 0 44 0 86 0 66 0 90 0 49 0 48 0 30 0 88 and 0 77 the bod and do concentrations at all checkpoints for the proposed and traditional models are shown in figs 11 4 2 2 comparison with a multi objective wla model related studies brill et al 1976 yandamuri et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 have claimed that there is an equilibrium point between cost and equity in the multi objective wla the pt wla is a stackelberg game between the er and the dischargers with its optimal solution ptep also being an equilibrium point to determine the ptep under a given pigovian tax rate the er sets the most reasonable pigovian tax thresholds to achieve the wla equity objective based on a rational reaction from the dischargers at the same time each discharger makes the most rational bod removal decisions to achieve their own minimal pollution cost objective this means that at the ptep the er and dischargers both obtain relatively satisfactory solutions as all the dischargers decisions together determine the wla cost in the river system the ptep is also considered the trade off point between equity and cost for the whole decision making process therefore to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in solving pt wla problems based on the hierarchical decision making between the er and the dischargers the model was compared to a multi objective wla model which considers the trade off between cost and equity in the same decision making environment in general multi objective models that deal with trade offs between wla cost and equity problems have linear or nonlinear constraint conditions and two objective functions that measure the cost and the equity burn and yulianti 2001 yandamuri et al 2006 gren and destouni 2012 to effectively demonstrate the differences between the proposed model and the multi objective model in solving pt wla problems a pigovian tax policy was integrated into the multi objective wla model and the objective function for the total pollution costs was considered in the equation cf s 1 s c s p s and the equation dupc 1 s s 1 s upc s aupc 2 was used to denote the equity measure to allow for a comparison of both indicators and the standard deviation of the average unit pollution costs sdupc was chosen defined as sdupc dupc as the indicator to measure the equity therefore the multi objective

yandamuri et al 2006 and the proposed model was calculated using a hybrid nested pso algorithm xu et al 2016 based on the study area data the deyang reaches of the tuojiang river the results were compared to the pt wla model as shown in fig 12 fig 12 shows that for the pt wla model point 0 was the optimal solution as with the mo wla model there was a trade off relationship between the cost and equity with the preferred alternatives again being on the lower left portion of the curve points 1 2 and 3 were found to be non inferior solutions to the mo wla model points 1 and 3 were two extreme cases complete costs and equity priority and point 2 was the trade off solution between these two objectives the corresponding results for the pt wla model and the mo wla model are shown in table 8 note that the total pollution costs cf for the pt wla can be calculated using the following equation cf s 1 s q ds upc s 4 3 discussion in this section the results of the above sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed and some management recommendations given proposition 1 there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pigovian tax based wla decision making process fig 10 shows that a rational pigovian tax rate setting results in a tradeoff between equity and pollution costs in a river system the equity objective measured as sdupc is mainly focused on the scepa and the pollution costs measured as aupc are considered by the multiple dischargers it is critical to determine a reasonable level for the pigovian tax rate gren et al 2000 claimed that a tax policy could have a direct effect on the dischargers pollution costs and possibly influence their pollutant removal decision making low tax levels however may result in a failure of the pigovian tax policy as dischargers may ignore the pollution cost impact of the taxes in fig 10 up when the pigovian tax rate was set too low such as in scenario i there was no effect therefore the scepa can only achieve river system equilibrium by imposing an extra pigovian tax on the dischargers however this type of move could result in higher pollution costs for the dischargers aupc 1 75 and a higher pollution cost deviation for the scepa sdupc 0 0276 when the tax rate is too high i e t b 0 006 the pigovian tax policy effectively influences most dischargers pollution reduction decisions and is equitable for all dischargers sdupc 0 0155 however an overly high tax rate could result in the over treatment of waste water by the dischargers and the associated excessive pollution costs aupc 1 81 therefore to ensure higher quality waste water to meet their pollution cost goals the dischargers would need to unnecessarily raise their spending to improve the sewage treatment which would consume more energy and generate more greenhouse gases stokes and horvath 2009 which would be an unsustainable way to satisfy the river system water needs and preserve the aquatic ecosystems grant et al 2012 proposition 2 a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy for wla has the potential to control water pollution and resolve the conflict between the dischargers the proposed model eq 18 was developed to describe a river s wla problems under a pigovian tax policy when the ptep is achieved a pigovian tax based equilibrium strategy can be developed from the results of the comparative analysis between the pt wla and the traditional wla model as shown in table 7 it can be seen that the proposed model has a better potential to control water pollution and resolve the conflicts between the dischargers in table 7 the astc in the pt wla model is larger than in the traditional wla model indicating that because of the increasing sewage treatment costs and the need to pay a pigovian tax the discharger s pollution costs may increase under a pigovian tax policy in this situation similar to the results of gren et al 2000 dischargers would need to improve their bod removal levels to avoid paying excessive pollution taxes from table 7 the bod removals of dischargers 1 and 3 in the pt wla model were greater than in the traditional model however for dischargers 2 3 and 5 the situation was reversed which indicates that upstream dischargers i e dischargers 1 and 3 may obtain more waste loads which results in the subsequent downstream dischargers i e dischargers 2 3 and 5 needing to increase their bod removals to meet the specified stream quality standards this demonstrated that the pigovian tax policy can to some extent solve the problems caused by traditional methods that is upstream dischargers can impose a cost on downstream water users because of the lower water quality this may also be the reason river system inequities occur in the traditional model in fig 11 up the bod concentrations at almost all checkpoints in the traditional model were equal to the corresponding stream quality standards except for discharger 8 which had a minimum bod removal capacity limitation all bod concentrations in the pt wla model were no larger than those in the traditional model however an opposite situation for the do concentrations was shown in fig 11 down this indicates that if there were no pigovian tax policy all dischargers would seek to maximize the use of the er allocated waste load to ensure minimal sewage treatment costs implying that pollution emissions could be restricted the ecological environment improved and sustainable river basin development achieved if the er imposes pigovian taxes on the river system dischargers in conclusion the pt wla was able to effectively control the water pollution in the river system from table 7 it can be concluded that the sdupc in the proposed model was smaller than that in the traditional model and all dischargers upc s were almost equal this appears to suggest that using the traditional model to allocate waste load could lead to inequitable results for the dischargers in the pt wla model the er focuses on the need for wla equity in the river system and therefore imposes a pigovian tax on each discharger to encourage them to adjust their unit pollution costs therefore the pigovian tax policy can to some extent also alleviate the conflict between the dischargers proposition 3 dischargers have different reactions towards the given pigovian tax rates as the comparison results between the pt wla and the traditional wla in table 7 indicate when the er sets pigovian tax rates in the river system the dischargers have different reactions to the bod removal decisions when a pollution policy was considered at a tax rate of 0 0055 rmb l mg dischargers 1 and 3 increased their bod removals dischargers 2 3 and 5 decreased their bod removal and the other dischargers bod removals remained the same in the proposed model eq 18 each discharger made reasonable bod removal decisions to minimize their own pollution costs which were made up of waste treatment costs and pollution taxes a mathematical analysis of the discharger s objective function eq 17 shows that a pigovian tax rate t b affects the discharger s pollution cost function based on pigovian tax theory hanley and white 2002 in general a rational discharger makes bod removal decisions to ensure the marginal costs of the bod removals c η s are equal to the pigovian tax rate t b because each discharger faces some restrictions in terms of stream quality standards and sewage treatment capacity η t l η s η t u under a given pigovian tax rate t b there are three possible discharger bod removal decisions see fig 13 a reaction i tax rate is too low i e t b 1 c η s l in this situation the pigovian tax policy is ineffective and has no impact on the discharger s bod removal decisions rational dischargers such as dischargers 6 7 and 8 make bod removal decisions equal to η s l reaction ii tax rate is moderate i e c η s l t b 2 c η s u in this case the pigovian tax policy encourages the dischargers to change their decisions similar to the conclusion in gren et al 2000 the discharger such as dischargers 1 2 3 4 5 and 10 can achieve optimal bod removals η s at a marginal cost c η s equal to the pigovian tax rate t b 2 reaction iii tax rate is too high i e t b 3 c η s u the pigovian tax policy can also impact the dischargers bod removal decisions from fig 13 as a the abscissa values at the intersection point between the marginal cost curve of the bod removals and the pigovian tax rate curve are more than η s u the rational discharger has to accept a heavy pigovian tax fee so the bod removals are equal to η s u an illustration of the multiple discharger s bod removal decisions at a given tax rate are shown in fig 13 b in fig 13 b it can be seen that different dischargers in the river system have different reactions towards the pigovian tax rates because dischargers have varying bod removal cost curves they have different attitudes to the same pigovian tax rate some dischargers such as discharger 1 may not be affected while others such as the discharger 2 s s 1 see the tax rate as moderate and make bod removal decisions as described in ii the others feel that the tax rate is too high and therefore determine their bod removals based on reaction iii proposition 4 the equilibrium between cost and equity in the pt wla model is non inferior to that of the mo wla model for the pt wla problem from the above analysis both the pt wla and the mo wla models can reach a corresponding equilibrium point i e ptep between the cost objective and the equity objective for the pt wla problem as the pt wla and the mo wla comparison results in table 8 show points 0 and 3 had a similar equity objective value however the total pollution costs at point 0 cf 105 06 were smaller than at point 3 cf 108 74 therefore for the pt wla model point 0 was the optimal solution as the first priority was given to the scepa equity objective function for the mo wla model point 3 was a non inferior solution where the decision maker is seeking to achieve the equity objective therefore from these results it can be concluded that the pt wla model optimal solutions were better than the mo wla model optimal solutions for the pt wla problem a possible reason is that multi objective wla models ignore the stackelberg game between the different parties and assume that the scepa and the dischargers have completely consistent objectives when a complete equity priority is considered when solving the mo wla the corresponding cost objective function is ignored which leads to a high total pollution cost in the river system however as the aim of the pt wla model is to increase the equity without imposing too high a cost there is a recognition of the stackelberg game between the scepa and the dischargers when the scepa sets the pigovian tax thresholds to achieve the wla equity objective the rational reaction from the dischargers is fully considered to avoid too high a total pollution cost in summary the pt wla model was shown to be better able to match the actual circumstances and was proven to be more reasonable when setting pigovian tax standards and allocating waste load 4 4 management recommendations based on the above analysis and discussion in this section some management recommendations are proposed for river system wla 4 4 1 need for a combined water policy rational wla is the key to resolving the problems of unreasonable wastewater discharges into river systems as higher requirements are needed for wla conventional wla methods and technologies have obvious shortcomings when seeking to implement advanced water quality management therefore a combined water policy should be set and executed for example environmental economic measures such as pigovian tax policies can be integrated into wla planning without such a scheme dischargers would tend to pursue the lowest possible pollution costs and only ensure that their discharge behavior fulfilled the allowable water quality standards at the corresponding checkpoint therefore they would lack the motivation to continuously improve their wastewater removals using the proposed model in this paper a pigovian tax policy could be built for a river system which as discussed in proposition 2 could not only guide dischargers to reduce effluent discharges but could also go some way to resolving the conflicts between the dischargers and achieve wla equity 4 4 2 suitable pigovian tax rate setting the er can affect each discharger s effluent discharge behavior using a pigovian tax policy that is the er can fully consider the actual situation and choose a desirable water pollutant reduction scheme however as discussed in proposition 3 as dischargers have different reactions towards the tax rates the pigovian tax policy may be inefficient if the tax rate is too low or too high in addition as there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pt wla process a different tax rate can result in a different ptep see proposition 1 therefore for an efficient pigovian tax policy it is recommended that the er set a suitable tax rate when using the proposed model as river systems deteriorate the er can increase the pigovian tax rate that is when a river system is deteriorating the er could consider dynamic tax rate setting when using the proposed methodology to deal with wla problems for instance to encourage economic development in the river system at the beginning the er could use the pt wla model to set a lower pigovian tax rate and use the pigovian tax funds to assist dischargers improve their wastewater treatment capacities then after a period of time the er could gradually increase the pigovian tax rate to encourage dischargers to upgrade their wastewater treatments in the subsequent period the pigovian tax rate could be further increased until the strictest pigovian tax policy is applied to the river system 5 conclusions and future research the main purpose of this paper was to develop a mathematical model to solve a wla problem under a pigovian tax policy i e a pigovian tax based wla problem which was generalized from thetuojiang river basin prototype the application of the proposed model to the tuojiang river basin demonstrated its practicality and efficiency with the associated analyses demonstrating the influence of a pigovian tax policy on the multi stakeholder decisions to achieve equity at a low cost level for the pt wla problem to control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers in river systems a cooperative bi level multi follower programming model was developed to solve the pt wla problem unlike conventional wla decisions the pt wla problem was considered to be a hierarchical decision problem with the er as the leader setting the pollution tax to achieve the wla equity objective and the dischargers as the followers making bod removal decisions to minimize their own pollution costs with full knowledge of the er s decisions based on the mathematical analysis the decision structure for the pt wla was shown to be a stackelberg game with its lower level process being similar to a markovian decision using the proposed model a pigovian tax based wla equilibrium strategy was achieved the application of the proposed model to the tuojiang river basin case demonstrated the following there is a trade off between cost and equity in the pt wla decision making process and the pigovian tax rate can significantly affect the dischargers decisions when the pollution tax rate is set too low there is no effect however an overly high tax rate could result in heavy costs to the dischargers and excessive pollution costs compared with the traditional wla model a model that includes a pigovian tax policy not only influences the dischargers pollution reduction behavior as in gren et al 2000 but because of the specific equity principle can also go some way to alleviating the conflicts between the dischargers compared with the multi objective wla model the cost and equity equilibrium in the pt wla model was non inferior to the mo wla model for the pt wla problem thereby providing indirect evidence for the superiority of our proposed method in solving pt wla problems the limitations of the present study are that only a single equity principle was considered and the model was general the single equity principle was used because we only selected an equity principle to measure the wla equity however there are many principles for measuring water quality management allocation equity sen 2001 ringius et al 2002 gren and destouni 2012 the main reason for not considering multiple principles in this study to measure the equity was that we hoped to further explore the influence of the policy instruments on the trade off between cost effectiveness and equity in wla decisions and it was considered very difficult to consider multiple principle based equity objectives for the er s objective function in the future a pt wla model based on different equity principles could be developed as the proposed model was general it is not suitable for solving related wla problems under the eu water framework as the transfer tax on water pollution across regional boundaries was not considered the main reason for neglecting the transfer tax was due to the specialization in the case and the location of the dischargers the model was simplified for computational efficiency in the case study therefore designing advanced wla models that include a transfer tax policy could be an interesting topic for future

7137,the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties however the em generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves k h k and h are the hydraulic conductivity and the pressure head respectively in the wet low suction range when the hydraulic gradient within soil samples exceeds the minimum accuracy of the pressure transducer in this study we developed a new experimental device that uses the em to perform conductivity measurements in the wet range by making two major improvements we successfully expanded the measurable range of k h to cover the wet range enabling accurate and effective measurements firstly the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement was remarkably improved by the use of a differential pressure transducer assuming the minimum evaporation speed 0 18 cm day at the center of soil sample the estimated measurable range of k h is up to 27 cm day for any type of soil that is our device has expanded the range of k h measurable by the em by more than two orders of magnitude on the wet end secondly our device can execute the saturated unsaturated steady state infiltration method ssim usim and the em on the same sample this diminishes not only time and cost but also errors between different methods ensuring good accuracy and representativeness the range of k h measurable by the usim was determined to be more than 21 cm day which overlaps with the range measurable by the em as a result our device can obtain consecutive k h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range 500 h 0 cm for any type of soil keywords evaporation method steady state infiltration method experimental device hydraulic conductivity curve water retention curve wet range 1 introduction knowledge of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties is essential for predicting water movement in soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data in the wet low suction range are particularly crucial for the prediction of storm flow discharge and landslides in natural hillslopes macroporous natural soils show variable k in the near saturation range e g logsdon 2002 jarvis 2008 the value of k often rises by orders of magnitude in the range from 10 to 0 cm we express matric potential as pressure head h in length of water column hereafter this contributes to the threshold dependent initiation and sudden increase of slope discharge due to macropore pipe flow e g sidle et al 2000 uchida et al 2005 and to the increased connections between subsurface saturated areas e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 with accumulated soil wetness to correctly predict such drastic changes in hydrological conditions detailed data concerning k in the wet range are needed however conventional hydraulic experiments require expensive instruments and long measurement times to obtain continuous data from saturation to the dry range thus a time cost effective measurement system should be developed the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties the most widely used formulation of the em was first proposed by wind 1968 the value of h is measured within a vertical soil column as water evaporates from its surface using tensiometers installed at multiple depths this method can simultaneously quantify water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves in more recent studies wind s method has been modified and simplified e g schindler 1980 wendroth et al 1993 schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010 in the updated method tensiometers are installed at only two depths within a short soil column water content θ and flux are determined by weighing the column this method uses a simple device is easy to operate and requires a shorter measurement time compared to conventional hydraulic measurements while the simplified em is vulnerable to errors caused by linearization and quasi steady state assumptions schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 an investigation of the validity of these assumptions has shown that the error can be ignored over a wide range i e when h is above approximately 1000 cm for the medium to fine textured soils schindler et al 2010 peters et al 2015 however the em has an important limitation in the wet range when k is high compared to the water flux the hydraulic gradient becomes so small that it exceeds the accuracy of pressure transducer wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 thus for soils having high k much of the wet range is inaccessible to current instrumentation previous works proposed using steady state methods such as the double membrane method klute 1972 to complement the em k h data in the wet range boels et al 1978 wendroth et al 1999 schindler et al 2010 however the double membrane method requires another experimental setup leading to negative effects on accuracy and efficiency previous studies of the em have mostly focused on measurements in the dry range from a plant physiology viewpoint and measurements in the wet range have only rarely been discussed there remains a need for a simple and effective method of making continuous measurements of the hydraulic properties from saturation to the dry range the objective of this study was to develop a new experimental device that uses the em and is applicable to k h measurements in the wet range we achieved this by making two improvements over existing methods firstly we improved the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement by using a differential pressure transducer instead of two vacuum pressure transducers secondly we designed the device to be used with saturated unsaturated steady state infiltration methods ssim usim as well as the em these two improvements allowed us to expand the measurable range of k h curves to cover the wet range and enable accurate and effective measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device figs 1 and 2 show the experimental setup for the improved em device soil samples were collected using core samplers with a diameter of 5 cm a height of 5 1 cm and a volume of 100 cm3 the bottom edge of the sampler was sharpened to minimize soil disturbance during insertion two holes with a diameter of 0 7 cm were drilled at heights of 1 5 and 3 5 cm from the top edge of the sampler the ceramic cups of tensiometers with a diameter of 0 635 cm and a length of 2 cm were inserted in the holes these were connected to a vacuum pressure transducer and a differential pressure transducer pa 850 102v and pa 838 101d copal electronics through acrylic pipes and polyurethane tubes matric pressure head at the lower tensiometer h low was calculated by adding the elevation difference to the pressure head measured by the vacuum pressure transducer h vac 1 h low h vac z vac z low where z vac and z low are the elevations at the vacuum pressure transducer and the lower tensiometer respectively fig 2 the differential pressure transducer outputs the pressure head difference h diff between the left and right diaphragms 2 h diff h up z diff z up h low z diff z low h up h low z up z low h up h low δ z where h up is the matric pressure head at the upper tensiometer z diff and z up are the elevations at the differential pressure transducer and the upper tensiometer respectively and δ z is the distance between the two tensiometers δ z 2 0 cm thus the value of h diff is the same as the total head difference between upper and lower tensiometers eq 2 h up was calculated by substituting h low in eq 2 because the zero point of h diff slightly changes with air temperature the value of h diff was adjusted by an empirical linear expression that describes the relationship between the zero point of h diff and laboratory air temperature these measurement values were logged by using a voltage data logger lr8431 hioki e e corp our device improves on existing devices in two ways firstly the differential pressure transducer and the high resolution data logger were applied to improve in data resolution the differential pressure transducer has a measurement range of 0 to 10 kpa 101 97 cm and an output range of 4 to 20 ma which is converted into 960 4800 mv with the 240 ω resistor the data logger s resolution is 0 05 and 0 5 mv in the ranges 0 to 1000 and 1000 to 5000 mv respectively therefore the minimum resolution of h diff is 1 3 10 3 cm in the low pressure range as described below the minimum resolution of the hydraulic gradient is 6 6 10 4 cm cm which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than in previous devices e g peters and durner 2008 on the other hand the vacuum pressure transducer has a measurement range of 0 100 kpa 1019 7 cm and an output range of 1000 5000 mv therefore the minimum resolution of h low is 1 3 10 1 cm secondly the device can execute the saturated steady state infiltration method ssim as well as the em moreover the device can be used for the unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim with the addition of a porous plate attachment as shown in fig 1b to enable both the gravitational drainage and evaporation of water from the bottom surface the bottom surface of the sampler was open to the air soil runoff was prevented by using a filter that consists of a sheet of absorbent cotton and polypropylene net with a grid interval of 1 mm the details of the usim experiment are described below the device was assembled and degassed water was poured into pipes ceramic caps and pressure transducers with care taken to remove air bubbles the weight of the device without soil and sampler was measured to allow the calculation of the amount of soil water from the entire weight w then the core sampler was installed on the device to start experiments the device and the core sampler were placed on an electric balance fig 1a and c and w was recorded at a resolution of 0 01 g the transducers were connected to a battery powered data logger placed on a laboratory desk cables were fixed to the desk and not touched during experiments all measurement data were recorded at 1 min intervals 2 2 soil sample two soil samples tephra and loess taken from izu oshima island japan were used for the experiments each soil sample was packed into the sampler by mixing with water and pushing with a stick the saturated water content of tephra and loess measured by the weighing method were 0 48 and 0 61 respectively when the tensiometers were inserted enough soil was removed from the sampler to allow the insertion of the ceramic cup before starting actual experiments the preliminary em experiments were conducted four times for the tephra sample and twice for the loess sample to settle the packed soils 2 3 ks measurement before executing the em the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the tephra sample was measured by the ssim as shown in fig 1a water was supplied to the top surface with constant intensity using a pump the water supply rate was increased manually just until overflow initiates to match the infiltration rate at saturation a sheet of sponge with a thickness of 0 5 cm was put on the soil to reduce the drop impact of water and to distribute water homogeneously water discharged from the bottom surface and was caught by a pan so that the electric balance was not affected when h diff h low and w reached constant values the infiltration flux in the soil sample was regarded as being at steady state and ks was calculated by darcy s law approximately one hour was needed to confirm steady state for the tephra sample the maximum and minimum water supply rates of the pump are 570 and 32 cm day respectively the maximum rate can be easily increased by using a bigger pump or multiple pumps simultaneously but the minimum rate is difficult to decrease when a soil sample is completely saturated the hydraulic gradient is 1 0 cm cm thus only values of ks larger than 32 cm day are measurable by the ssim using our system for the loess sample ks was measured by the falling head test fht reynolds et al 2002 using a different device because the ks of the loess sample exceeded the lower limit of the ssim and water overflowed from the top surface 2 4 evaporation method em after the ssim experiment the em experiment was conducted for the tephra sample high ks sample the pump was turned off and the top lid was closed to prevent water flux through the top surface after discharge from the bottom surface had stopped the bottom lid was closed to ensure a zero flux condition in the sampler when the value of h diff reached zero indicating that water flux had completely stopped the bottom lid was opened an electric fan was used to accelerate evaporation from the bottom surface for the loess sample low ks sample the sample was saturated using a tray with water during the one day saturation the water level in the tray was kept level with the bottom of the sampler before starting the experiment the top and bottom lids were closed to ensure a zero flux condition after the value of h diff reached zero evaporation was started in the same way as for the tephra sample described above laboratory air temperature varied in the range of 3 c during each em experiment the calculation of a k h curve derives from the simplified em schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 the calculation is based on two assumptions the first is that the system is in a quasi steady state condition that is the flux and hydraulic gradient are approximately constant over the time interval the second is linearization θ and h are linearly distributed over the sample height based on the linearization assumption the mean pressure head in the soil sample h m cm was calculated by 3 h m 0 5 h up h low additionally the mean hydraulic gradient in the soil sample i m cm cm was calculated by dividing total head difference eq 2 by δ z 4 i m h diff δ z water flux at the measured plane fig 2 q m cm day was calculated from the variation of w g over a given time interval note that flux in a downward direction is represented as a positive value hereafter based on the quasi steady state assumption an averaged value of q m q m cm day was calculated by averaging over a given time interval the value of q m was calculated by 5 q m δ w ρ w δ t a l m l where δ w g is the loss of weight during a time interval ρ w is water density fixed to 1 0 g cm3 δ t day is the length of the time interval and a is the cross sectional area of the sampler 19 635 cm2 δ t was set to 0 021 or 0 042 day 30 or 60 min depending on the evaporation speed all measurement data are recorded at 1 min intervals l is the height of the sampler 5 1 cm and l m is the distance between the upper surface zero flux surface and the measured plane 2 5 cm fig 2 according to the darcy buckingham s law the hydraulic conductivity k cm day was calculated using average values over a time interval 6 k h m q m i m where h m cm and i m cm cm are averages of h m and i m over a time interval respectively the water retention curve θ h was obtained by mapping the mean volumetric water content of the sample θ m calculated from w to the corresponding h m at each measurement time 1 min interval the em experiment ended when h m fell below approximately 500 cm for each sample the experiment was repeated three times to verify reproducibility the evaporation times needed for all cases of the experiment are summarized in table 1 after finishing all experiments each sample was oven dried to determine the bulk soil density to be able to recalculate θ m at each time step 2 5 unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim for the tephra sample high ks sample k h was also measured by the usim using the same device as the em with the extra attachment as shown in fig 1b the lower shelf of the device holding the bottom edge of sampler in fig 1a was replaced with the attachment consisting of a porous plate glass filter 0 5 cm of thickness 70 cm of air entry pressure and 18 cm day of ks connected to a drain tube a paper filter was placed between the soil and the porous plate the plate and tube were filled with water the suction at the plate δ h was controlled by changing the height of tube outlet in a stepwise fashion from 5 to 60 cm fig 1b under fixed δ h water was supplied constantly from the top surface using the pump and discharged from the tube outlet when h diff and h low reached constant values indicating that a steady state had been reached k was calculated by the darcy buckingham s law δ h and water supply rate q were changed in a stepwise fashion to obtain k for h values between approximately 5 and 40 cm approximately a half to one hour was needed to confirm steady state at each step for the tephra sample all parameters for the usim cases are summarized in table 2 2 6 model for expressing k h in this study the lognormal distribution ln model kosugi 1996 was applied to characterize soil hydraulic properties the ln model is expressed as 7 s e θ θ r θ s θ r q ln h h md σ where se represents the effective saturation θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively h md is the pressure head at se 0 5 σ is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the width of the pore radius distribution and q is the complementary normal distribution function defined as 8 q x x 1 2 π 1 2 e x p u 2 2 d u the observed conductivity data k h relations were fitted by the generalized ln model kosugi 1999 9 k h k s s e α q l n h h md σ β σ γ where both α and β are parameters related to the soil pore tortuosity and γ is a parameter that depends on how to evaluate the effective pore radius raats 1992 according to kosugi 1999 both α and β are treated as fitting parameters whereas γ is fixed at unity determination of the parameter values of h md σ α and β requires eq 9 to be fitted to the observed k h relations this procedure involves minimizing the residual sum of squares computed using the measured and calculated values of log k at the same h to evaluate the precision of the k h measurement the absolute value of the residual error between measured and calculated k values ε abs log cm day was calculated as 10 ε abs log k h mea log k h cal where k h mea and k h cal represent the measured and calculated values of k respectively at the same h 3 results 3 1 results of the em and ssim results for all cases of the em experiment are summarized in table 1 evaporation times until h m falls below 500 cm in the tephra cases t1 to t3 were more than twice as long as those in the loess cases l1 to l3 mean evaporation rates in the tephra cases were slightly larger than those in the loess cases schindler and müller 2006 obtained mean evaporation rates of 0 06 to 0 58 cm day from measurements for 104 soil samples of various textures and bulk densities our results table 1 exhibited relatively large rates due to our use of an electric fan which accelerates evaporation evaporation rates varied slightly between cases that used the same sample due to variations in laboratory conditions temperature and humidity etc nonetheless the cases for each soil sample were almost same in evaporation times and rates 3 1 1 em device output the em device output used in the calculation of k eqs 3 6 is shown in fig 3 a to c for two representative cases t1 and l1 fig 3a shows the temporal variations in h up and h low both h up and h low in l1 decreased faster than those in t1 fig 3b shows temporal variations of i m and i m values of i m and i m increased logarithmically with time in both cases however the i m and i m of t1 was two orders of magnitude lower than that of l1 the i m of t1 and l1 increased from 9 0 10 4 to 1 6 cm cm and from 2 9 10 1 to 9 3 cm cm respectively moreover the i m of t1 fluctuated for approximately one day fig 3c shows the temporal variation of q m and laboratory air temperature in general the evaporation of water from wet soil proceeds at a constant speed potential evaporation rate burman and pochop 1994 however the q m of both t1 and l1 tended to decrease and fluctuated slightly during experiments roughly corresponding with the variation in air temperature 3 1 2 water retention curves the water retention curves θ h obtained for the tephra cases t1 to t3 and the loess cases l1 to l3 are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the tephra sample curves fig 4a exhibited steep declines with an inflection point at approximately 20 cm in contrast the loess sample curves fig 4b exhibited gentle declines with no clear inflection point for each soil sample the three replicates showed a high degree of reproducibility thus soil θ h curves were successfully obtained using the em with our device 3 1 3 hydraulic conductivity curves the hydraulic conductivity curves k h obtained for the tephra cases t1 to t3 and the loess cases l1 to l3 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively note that all the measured values i e fig 3a c were used in eqs 3 6 without any filtering applied to the fluctuated data e g the i m of t1 in fig 3b although evidently anomalous values were manually revised in each figure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks measured by ssim tephra or fht loess is also shown k h curves for tephra fig 5a were obtained as well the values of k were relatively high in the wet range and declined logarithmically with drying h m 500 cm although the wet range values fluctuated the reproducibility of the three cases over the entire range was mostly high the k h curves for loess fig 5b were obtained successfully the values of k in the wet range h m 80 cm were two orders of magnitude lower and the decline curves were gentler than those for tephra sample the reproducibility of the three cases was high and the values showed no fluctuation even in the wet range the accuracy of the k h curves in the wet range is shown in fig 6 a and b h m 80 cm the tephra curves by the em fig 6a were successfully obtained below approximately 35 cm however they showed large fluctuations in the wetter range and were not continuous with ks this indicates that the em failed due to uncertainties in the hydraulic gradient i m measurements in the near saturation range wendroth et al 1993 in contrast the loess curves generated by the em fig 6b showed smooth declines and high reproducibility even in the near saturation range and were continuous with ks thus k h curves were successfully obtained for loess over the entire range 500 h m 0 cm using the em and the fht 3 2 usim results ten k values for h values between 40 and 4 2 cm were obtained in the usim experiment for tephra denoted by crosses in fig 6a table 2 they showed good continuity with both ks ssim on the wet end and k h curves em on the dry end although they fluctuated somewhat in the range below 30 cm this indicates that the usim successfully compensates for the failure of the em in the near saturation range i e wetter than approximately 35 cm the validity of the usim measurement will be discussed below schindler et al 2010 proposed the combination of the double membrane method klute 1972 with the em to complement k h in the near saturation range however the double membrane method requires another experimental setup which can result in negative effects on accuracy and efficiency in contrast our device uses the same sample porous caps and pressure transducers for the em ssim and usim this diminishes not only the time and cost but also the potential for errors between different methods ensuring good accuracy and representativeness thus our device enables accurate and effective measurement of k h including in the near saturation range by using the simple usim attachment with the device 3 3 model fitting to k h curves in the wet range the functional k h model expressed by eq 9 was fitted to the observations over the entire range 500 h m 0 cm by optimizing the parameters h md σ α and β while ks was fixed at observed values 1 8 102 and 1 8 cm day for tephra and loess respectively note that the data in the near saturation range where the em failed i e wetter than approximately 35 cm were eliminated from the data used to fit the model for the tephra sample the parameters obtained from the fitting are summarized in table 3 functional curves for both tephra and loess fig 6a and b respectively show that the model eq 9 fit the observed data well in wet range h m 80 cm 4 discussion 4 1 precision of k h in the near saturation range the em failed to measure k h in the near saturation range for the tephra cases t1 to t3 as the values showed large fluctuations and poor reproducibility fig 6a here we verify the precision of the k h measurement by the em fig 7 shows the values of ε abs eq 10 for the tephra cases t1 to t3 the larger the value of ε abs the lower the precision of the k h measurement we set the limit of precision valid invalid as the point where ε abs exceeds 0 1 and the fluctuations become large valid k ranges denoted by solid symbols were similar but not identical between cases the maximum valid k values for t1 t2 and t3 were 52 47 and 44 cm day respectively in fact a limiting factor of the wet side em measurement is the hydraulic gradient i m that is the value of i m exceeds the accuracy of the pressure transducer when k is high compared to the water flux q m in eq 6 wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 the valid ranges of k fig 7 were slightly different from case to case because q m differed due to changes in laboratory conditions temperature and humidity etc which are difficult to control therefore the valid range of i m should be determined empirically to determine the validity of the measurements in the following section we tried to create an filter criterion of i m based on empirical data 4 2 determining the valid range of i m the value of i m is measured by the differential pressure transducer errors may introduced by not only the nominal accuracy of the transducer but also the device structure and the laboratory conditions at the time of measurement moreover i m is the average value over a time interval the nominal accuracy data are therefore insufficient to determine the valid range of i m peters and durner 2008 proposed an empirical filter criterion from stochastic analysis they reject i m data that are smaller than six times the minimum resolution of i m this criterion is applied in their subsequent works on the em e g peters et al 2015 in this study we also created an empirical filter criterion of i m for our device based on both the transducer resolution and empirical data fig 8 shows the relationship between q m and k h m during the experiments valid invalid of data were determined from fig 7 as described in the materials and methods section the minimum resolution of the differential pressure transducer used in our device h diff is 1 3 10 3 cm and the minimum resolution of i m is 6 6 10 4 cm cm eq 4 curves shown in fig 8 denote the darcy buckingham s law eq 6 where i m has been set to one ten and a hundred times the minimum i m resolution as shown in fig 8 the curve where i m is ten times the minimum resolution i m 6 6 10 3 cm cm coincided well with the boundary between the valid and invalid data this result indicates that i m measurements of more than 6 6 10 3 cm cm are valid for our device this empirical filter criterion can be applied to any measurement using our device regardless of the laboratory conditions that affect q m additionally all i m data for the loess cases l1 to l3 were valid fig 8 this confirms that the k h curves for the loess sample i e fig 5b were valid over the entire measurement range 500 h m 0 cm 4 3 validity of the usim measurement as shown in fig 6a the precision of k as measured by the usim seems to decrease in the dryer range to verify the precision of the usim the values of ε abs eq 10 are shown in fig 7 denoted by crosses the values of ε abs y axis are larger for low model k values x axis the values of ε abs are summarized in table 2 in case 7 which showed the largest ε abs 0 23 the hydraulic gradient i m also had the highest value 3 2 cm cm in sum high values of i m tended to be associated with large ε abs the vertical distributions of θ and h become nonlinear when i m is high this nonlinearity may cause errors in the calculation of i m h m and k h in steady state methods the ideal value of i m is 1 0 cm cm to avoid nonlinearity in the usim experiments i m should be brought as close to 1 0 cm cm as possible by controlling q and δ h from our results table 2 a reasonable range for i m seems to be from approximately 0 50 to 1 5 cm cm to diminish errors in the usim 4 4 measurable range of k from the em experiments conducted in this study q m in the early evaporation stage is assumed to be more than 0 18 cm day figs 3c and 8 when q m varies within the assumed range and i m is above the cutoff i m greater than 6 6 10 3 cm cm in eq 6 the range of k h m measurable by the em is estimated to be up to 27 cm day according to the latest research on the em e g schindler et al 2015 volk et al 2016 the measurable range of k is approximately up to 0 1 cm day in this study we succeeded in expanding the measurable range of k by more than two orders of magnitude by applying the high resolution differential pressure transducer and verifying the accuracy for the usim when using our device the minimum q i e the pump s water supply rate is 32 cm day assuming ideal conditions i m 1 0 cm cm the minimum value of k is 32 cm day the same as the ssim assuming the reasonable range shown in table 2 0 50 i m 1 5 cm cm the measurable range of k is more than 21 cm day q 32 cm day i m 1 5 cm cm fig 9 summarizes the range of k h measurable by using our device on the wet end the range measurable by the em k 27 cm day overlaps with that measurable by the reasonable range of usim k greater than 21 cm day denoted by the broken line in fig 9 this indicates that using our device continuous k h curves from the wet to the medium pressure range can be obtained for any type of soil the range of ks measurable by the ssim depends on the minimum supply rate of the pump being used ks greater than 32 cm day as discussed above for soils whose ks are below the range e g loess the fht or another method should be applied the ranges measurable by the ssim and usim can be extended if q is controlled over a broader range an increase in q can easily be achieved by using a bigger pump or multiple pumps simultaneously however fundamental improvements in the water supply system are required to make q smaller a possible solution to be investigated in future work is the application of a small sprinkler system such as the atomized water spray dirksen 1999 the application of a tension infiltrometer with a mariotte bottle to the top surface of the soil is also a possible solution to adjust q on the dry end however in the preliminary em experiments bubbles emerged inside the pipes when h m fell below approximately 600 cm the unexpected decline of h diff occasionally occurred in the pressure range indicating the lack of contact between the ceramic cup and the soil sample moreover the differential pressure transducer used in our device has a narrow measurement range h diff 101 97 cm that is unsuitable for measurements in the dryer range therefore we set the lower limit of h m to 500 cm on the dry end to maintain accuracy 5 summary and conclusions the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties however the em generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves k h in the wet low suction range when the hydraulic gradient within the soil sample exceeds the accuracy of the pressure transducer in this study we developed a new experimental device that uses the em and is capable of making conductivity measurements in the wet range by improving two aspects of the method and the device we successfully expanded the measurable range of k h to cover the wet range and enabled accurate and effective measurements the two avenues of improvement are as follows firstly the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient i m measurement was remarkably improved by using a differential pressure transducer fig 1a by verifying the accuracy through repeated experiments the valid range of i m the averaged value of i m over a time interval was empirically shown to be more than 6 6 10 3 cm cm which is ten times the minimum i m resolution this filter criterion can be applied to any measurement made using our device regardless of evaporation speed assuming the minimum evaporation speed the measurable range of k h is estimated to be up to 27 cm day that is our device expanded the range of k h measurable by the em by more than two orders of magnitude secondly our device can execute not only the em but also the saturated steady state infiltration method ssim to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks moreover the porous plate attachment fig 1b easily enables the use of the unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim in contrast to the conventional method which requires different experimental setups for each method our device uses the same sample porous caps and pressure transducers in the em ssim and usim this not only diminishes the time and cost associated with the measurement but also minimizes the errors between the different methods to ensure good accuracy and representativeness the range of k h measurable by the usim was more than 21 cm day which overlaps with that measurable by the em fig 9 as a result our device allows collection of continuous k h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range 500 h 0 cm for any type of soil our device requires only one sample to obtain a k h curve over the entire pressure range moreover the sampler size is relatively small 100 cm3 therefore our device is suitable for measuring the k h curves of undisturbed natural soil samples this time cost effective method will enable measurements of the spatial distribution of k h as well as water retention curves θ h in forest catchments such measurements are essential to improving the accuracy of predictions of rainfall infiltration and discharge by numerical simulations a few studies have measured the k h curves of undisturbed forest soils having aggregated structures and macropores e g nielsen et al 1973 shinomiya et al 2001 puhlmann et al 2009 although macroporous soils show variable k h in the near saturation range e g logsdon 2002 jarvis 2008 limited data are available to date parameters related to the soil pore tortuosity and effective pore radius in k h models i e α β and γ in eq 9 were proposed by burdine 1953 and mualem 1976 however these values were reported to be inadequate in some undisturbed natural soils e g kosugi 1999 shinomiya et al 2001 additionally very little is known about the k h properties of permeable weathered bedrock e g saprolite under forest soil layers katsura et al 2006 the use of our device will enable measurements of undisturbed forest soil properties leading to

7137,the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties however the em generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves k h k and h are the hydraulic conductivity and the pressure head respectively in the wet low suction range when the hydraulic gradient within soil samples exceeds the minimum accuracy of the pressure transducer in this study we developed a new experimental device that uses the em to perform conductivity measurements in the wet range by making two major improvements we successfully expanded the measurable range of k h to cover the wet range enabling accurate and effective measurements firstly the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement was remarkably improved by the use of a differential pressure transducer assuming the minimum evaporation speed 0 18 cm day at the center of soil sample the estimated measurable range of k h is up to 27 cm day for any type of soil that is our device has expanded the range of k h measurable by the em by more than two orders of magnitude on the wet end secondly our device can execute the saturated unsaturated steady state infiltration method ssim usim and the em on the same sample this diminishes not only time and cost but also errors between different methods ensuring good accuracy and representativeness the range of k h measurable by the usim was determined to be more than 21 cm day which overlaps with the range measurable by the em as a result our device can obtain consecutive k h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range 500 h 0 cm for any type of soil keywords evaporation method steady state infiltration method experimental device hydraulic conductivity curve water retention curve wet range 1 introduction knowledge of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties is essential for predicting water movement in soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data in the wet low suction range are particularly crucial for the prediction of storm flow discharge and landslides in natural hillslopes macroporous natural soils show variable k in the near saturation range e g logsdon 2002 jarvis 2008 the value of k often rises by orders of magnitude in the range from 10 to 0 cm we express matric potential as pressure head h in length of water column hereafter this contributes to the threshold dependent initiation and sudden increase of slope discharge due to macropore pipe flow e g sidle et al 2000 uchida et al 2005 and to the increased connections between subsurface saturated areas e g tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 with accumulated soil wetness to correctly predict such drastic changes in hydrological conditions detailed data concerning k in the wet range are needed however conventional hydraulic experiments require expensive instruments and long measurement times to obtain continuous data from saturation to the dry range thus a time cost effective measurement system should be developed the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties the most widely used formulation of the em was first proposed by wind 1968 the value of h is measured within a vertical soil column as water evaporates from its surface using tensiometers installed at multiple depths this method can simultaneously quantify water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves in more recent studies wind s method has been modified and simplified e g schindler 1980 wendroth et al 1993 schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 schindler et al 2010 in the updated method tensiometers are installed at only two depths within a short soil column water content θ and flux are determined by weighing the column this method uses a simple device is easy to operate and requires a shorter measurement time compared to conventional hydraulic measurements while the simplified em is vulnerable to errors caused by linearization and quasi steady state assumptions schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 an investigation of the validity of these assumptions has shown that the error can be ignored over a wide range i e when h is above approximately 1000 cm for the medium to fine textured soils schindler et al 2010 peters et al 2015 however the em has an important limitation in the wet range when k is high compared to the water flux the hydraulic gradient becomes so small that it exceeds the accuracy of pressure transducer wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 thus for soils having high k much of the wet range is inaccessible to current instrumentation previous works proposed using steady state methods such as the double membrane method klute 1972 to complement the em k h data in the wet range boels et al 1978 wendroth et al 1999 schindler et al 2010 however the double membrane method requires another experimental setup leading to negative effects on accuracy and efficiency previous studies of the em have mostly focused on measurements in the dry range from a plant physiology viewpoint and measurements in the wet range have only rarely been discussed there remains a need for a simple and effective method of making continuous measurements of the hydraulic properties from saturation to the dry range the objective of this study was to develop a new experimental device that uses the em and is applicable to k h measurements in the wet range we achieved this by making two improvements over existing methods firstly we improved the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement by using a differential pressure transducer instead of two vacuum pressure transducers secondly we designed the device to be used with saturated unsaturated steady state infiltration methods ssim usim as well as the em these two improvements allowed us to expand the measurable range of k h curves to cover the wet range and enable accurate and effective measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device figs 1 and 2 show the experimental setup for the improved em device soil samples were collected using core samplers with a diameter of 5 cm a height of 5 1 cm and a volume of 100 cm3 the bottom edge of the sampler was sharpened to minimize soil disturbance during insertion two holes with a diameter of 0 7 cm were drilled at heights of 1 5 and 3 5 cm from the top edge of the sampler the ceramic cups of tensiometers with a diameter of 0 635 cm and a length of 2 cm were inserted in the holes these were connected to a vacuum pressure transducer and a differential pressure transducer pa 850 102v and pa 838 101d copal electronics through acrylic pipes and polyurethane tubes matric pressure head at the lower tensiometer h low was calculated by adding the elevation difference to the pressure head measured by the vacuum pressure transducer h vac 1 h low h vac z vac z low where z vac and z low are the elevations at the vacuum pressure transducer and the lower tensiometer respectively fig 2 the differential pressure transducer outputs the pressure head difference h diff between the left and right diaphragms 2 h diff h up z diff z up h low z diff z low h up h low z up z low h up h low δ z where h up is the matric pressure head at the upper tensiometer z diff and z up are the elevations at the differential pressure transducer and the upper tensiometer respectively and δ z is the distance between the two tensiometers δ z 2 0 cm thus the value of h diff is the same as the total head difference between upper and lower tensiometers eq 2 h up was calculated by substituting h low in eq 2 because the zero point of h diff slightly changes with air temperature the value of h diff was adjusted by an empirical linear expression that describes the relationship between the zero point of h diff and laboratory air temperature these measurement values were logged by using a voltage data logger lr8431 hioki e e corp our device improves on existing devices in two ways firstly the differential pressure transducer and the high resolution data logger were applied to improve in data resolution the differential pressure transducer has a measurement range of 0 to 10 kpa 101 97 cm and an output range of 4 to 20 ma which is converted into 960 4800 mv with the 240 ω resistor the data logger s resolution is 0 05 and 0 5 mv in the ranges 0 to 1000 and 1000 to 5000 mv respectively therefore the minimum resolution of h diff is 1 3 10 3 cm in the low pressure range as described below the minimum resolution of the hydraulic gradient is 6 6 10 4 cm cm which is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than in previous devices e g peters and durner 2008 on the other hand the vacuum pressure transducer has a measurement range of 0 100 kpa 1019 7 cm and an output range of 1000 5000 mv therefore the minimum resolution of h low is 1 3 10 1 cm secondly the device can execute the saturated steady state infiltration method ssim as well as the em moreover the device can be used for the unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim with the addition of a porous plate attachment as shown in fig 1b to enable both the gravitational drainage and evaporation of water from the bottom surface the bottom surface of the sampler was open to the air soil runoff was prevented by using a filter that consists of a sheet of absorbent cotton and polypropylene net with a grid interval of 1 mm the details of the usim experiment are described below the device was assembled and degassed water was poured into pipes ceramic caps and pressure transducers with care taken to remove air bubbles the weight of the device without soil and sampler was measured to allow the calculation of the amount of soil water from the entire weight w then the core sampler was installed on the device to start experiments the device and the core sampler were placed on an electric balance fig 1a and c and w was recorded at a resolution of 0 01 g the transducers were connected to a battery powered data logger placed on a laboratory desk cables were fixed to the desk and not touched during experiments all measurement data were recorded at 1 min intervals 2 2 soil sample two soil samples tephra and loess taken from izu oshima island japan were used for the experiments each soil sample was packed into the sampler by mixing with water and pushing with a stick the saturated water content of tephra and loess measured by the weighing method were 0 48 and 0 61 respectively when the tensiometers were inserted enough soil was removed from the sampler to allow the insertion of the ceramic cup before starting actual experiments the preliminary em experiments were conducted four times for the tephra sample and twice for the loess sample to settle the packed soils 2 3 ks measurement before executing the em the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the tephra sample was measured by the ssim as shown in fig 1a water was supplied to the top surface with constant intensity using a pump the water supply rate was increased manually just until overflow initiates to match the infiltration rate at saturation a sheet of sponge with a thickness of 0 5 cm was put on the soil to reduce the drop impact of water and to distribute water homogeneously water discharged from the bottom surface and was caught by a pan so that the electric balance was not affected when h diff h low and w reached constant values the infiltration flux in the soil sample was regarded as being at steady state and ks was calculated by darcy s law approximately one hour was needed to confirm steady state for the tephra sample the maximum and minimum water supply rates of the pump are 570 and 32 cm day respectively the maximum rate can be easily increased by using a bigger pump or multiple pumps simultaneously but the minimum rate is difficult to decrease when a soil sample is completely saturated the hydraulic gradient is 1 0 cm cm thus only values of ks larger than 32 cm day are measurable by the ssim using our system for the loess sample ks was measured by the falling head test fht reynolds et al 2002 using a different device because the ks of the loess sample exceeded the lower limit of the ssim and water overflowed from the top surface 2 4 evaporation method em after the ssim experiment the em experiment was conducted for the tephra sample high ks sample the pump was turned off and the top lid was closed to prevent water flux through the top surface after discharge from the bottom surface had stopped the bottom lid was closed to ensure a zero flux condition in the sampler when the value of h diff reached zero indicating that water flux had completely stopped the bottom lid was opened an electric fan was used to accelerate evaporation from the bottom surface for the loess sample low ks sample the sample was saturated using a tray with water during the one day saturation the water level in the tray was kept level with the bottom of the sampler before starting the experiment the top and bottom lids were closed to ensure a zero flux condition after the value of h diff reached zero evaporation was started in the same way as for the tephra sample described above laboratory air temperature varied in the range of 3 c during each em experiment the calculation of a k h curve derives from the simplified em schindler and müller 2006 peters and durner 2008 the calculation is based on two assumptions the first is that the system is in a quasi steady state condition that is the flux and hydraulic gradient are approximately constant over the time interval the second is linearization θ and h are linearly distributed over the sample height based on the linearization assumption the mean pressure head in the soil sample h m cm was calculated by 3 h m 0 5 h up h low additionally the mean hydraulic gradient in the soil sample i m cm cm was calculated by dividing total head difference eq 2 by δ z 4 i m h diff δ z water flux at the measured plane fig 2 q m cm day was calculated from the variation of w g over a given time interval note that flux in a downward direction is represented as a positive value hereafter based on the quasi steady state assumption an averaged value of q m q m cm day was calculated by averaging over a given time interval the value of q m was calculated by 5 q m δ w ρ w δ t a l m l where δ w g is the loss of weight during a time interval ρ w is water density fixed to 1 0 g cm3 δ t day is the length of the time interval and a is the cross sectional area of the sampler 19 635 cm2 δ t was set to 0 021 or 0 042 day 30 or 60 min depending on the evaporation speed all measurement data are recorded at 1 min intervals l is the height of the sampler 5 1 cm and l m is the distance between the upper surface zero flux surface and the measured plane 2 5 cm fig 2 according to the darcy buckingham s law the hydraulic conductivity k cm day was calculated using average values over a time interval 6 k h m q m i m where h m cm and i m cm cm are averages of h m and i m over a time interval respectively the water retention curve θ h was obtained by mapping the mean volumetric water content of the sample θ m calculated from w to the corresponding h m at each measurement time 1 min interval the em experiment ended when h m fell below approximately 500 cm for each sample the experiment was repeated three times to verify reproducibility the evaporation times needed for all cases of the experiment are summarized in table 1 after finishing all experiments each sample was oven dried to determine the bulk soil density to be able to recalculate θ m at each time step 2 5 unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim for the tephra sample high ks sample k h was also measured by the usim using the same device as the em with the extra attachment as shown in fig 1b the lower shelf of the device holding the bottom edge of sampler in fig 1a was replaced with the attachment consisting of a porous plate glass filter 0 5 cm of thickness 70 cm of air entry pressure and 18 cm day of ks connected to a drain tube a paper filter was placed between the soil and the porous plate the plate and tube were filled with water the suction at the plate δ h was controlled by changing the height of tube outlet in a stepwise fashion from 5 to 60 cm fig 1b under fixed δ h water was supplied constantly from the top surface using the pump and discharged from the tube outlet when h diff and h low reached constant values indicating that a steady state had been reached k was calculated by the darcy buckingham s law δ h and water supply rate q were changed in a stepwise fashion to obtain k for h values between approximately 5 and 40 cm approximately a half to one hour was needed to confirm steady state at each step for the tephra sample all parameters for the usim cases are summarized in table 2 2 6 model for expressing k h in this study the lognormal distribution ln model kosugi 1996 was applied to characterize soil hydraulic properties the ln model is expressed as 7 s e θ θ r θ s θ r q ln h h md σ where se represents the effective saturation θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively h md is the pressure head at se 0 5 σ is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the width of the pore radius distribution and q is the complementary normal distribution function defined as 8 q x x 1 2 π 1 2 e x p u 2 2 d u the observed conductivity data k h relations were fitted by the generalized ln model kosugi 1999 9 k h k s s e α q l n h h md σ β σ γ where both α and β are parameters related to the soil pore tortuosity and γ is a parameter that depends on how to evaluate the effective pore radius raats 1992 according to kosugi 1999 both α and β are treated as fitting parameters whereas γ is fixed at unity determination of the parameter values of h md σ α and β requires eq 9 to be fitted to the observed k h relations this procedure involves minimizing the residual sum of squares computed using the measured and calculated values of log k at the same h to evaluate the precision of the k h measurement the absolute value of the residual error between measured and calculated k values ε abs log cm day was calculated as 10 ε abs log k h mea log k h cal where k h mea and k h cal represent the measured and calculated values of k respectively at the same h 3 results 3 1 results of the em and ssim results for all cases of the em experiment are summarized in table 1 evaporation times until h m falls below 500 cm in the tephra cases t1 to t3 were more than twice as long as those in the loess cases l1 to l3 mean evaporation rates in the tephra cases were slightly larger than those in the loess cases schindler and müller 2006 obtained mean evaporation rates of 0 06 to 0 58 cm day from measurements for 104 soil samples of various textures and bulk densities our results table 1 exhibited relatively large rates due to our use of an electric fan which accelerates evaporation evaporation rates varied slightly between cases that used the same sample due to variations in laboratory conditions temperature and humidity etc nonetheless the cases for each soil sample were almost same in evaporation times and rates 3 1 1 em device output the em device output used in the calculation of k eqs 3 6 is shown in fig 3 a to c for two representative cases t1 and l1 fig 3a shows the temporal variations in h up and h low both h up and h low in l1 decreased faster than those in t1 fig 3b shows temporal variations of i m and i m values of i m and i m increased logarithmically with time in both cases however the i m and i m of t1 was two orders of magnitude lower than that of l1 the i m of t1 and l1 increased from 9 0 10 4 to 1 6 cm cm and from 2 9 10 1 to 9 3 cm cm respectively moreover the i m of t1 fluctuated for approximately one day fig 3c shows the temporal variation of q m and laboratory air temperature in general the evaporation of water from wet soil proceeds at a constant speed potential evaporation rate burman and pochop 1994 however the q m of both t1 and l1 tended to decrease and fluctuated slightly during experiments roughly corresponding with the variation in air temperature 3 1 2 water retention curves the water retention curves θ h obtained for the tephra cases t1 to t3 and the loess cases l1 to l3 are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the tephra sample curves fig 4a exhibited steep declines with an inflection point at approximately 20 cm in contrast the loess sample curves fig 4b exhibited gentle declines with no clear inflection point for each soil sample the three replicates showed a high degree of reproducibility thus soil θ h curves were successfully obtained using the em with our device 3 1 3 hydraulic conductivity curves the hydraulic conductivity curves k h obtained for the tephra cases t1 to t3 and the loess cases l1 to l3 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively note that all the measured values i e fig 3a c were used in eqs 3 6 without any filtering applied to the fluctuated data e g the i m of t1 in fig 3b although evidently anomalous values were manually revised in each figure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks measured by ssim tephra or fht loess is also shown k h curves for tephra fig 5a were obtained as well the values of k were relatively high in the wet range and declined logarithmically with drying h m 500 cm although the wet range values fluctuated the reproducibility of the three cases over the entire range was mostly high the k h curves for loess fig 5b were obtained successfully the values of k in the wet range h m 80 cm were two orders of magnitude lower and the decline curves were gentler than those for tephra sample the reproducibility of the three cases was high and the values showed no fluctuation even in the wet range the accuracy of the k h curves in the wet range is shown in fig 6 a and b h m 80 cm the tephra curves by the em fig 6a were successfully obtained below approximately 35 cm however they showed large fluctuations in the wetter range and were not continuous with ks this indicates that the em failed due to uncertainties in the hydraulic gradient i m measurements in the near saturation range wendroth et al 1993 in contrast the loess curves generated by the em fig 6b showed smooth declines and high reproducibility even in the near saturation range and were continuous with ks thus k h curves were successfully obtained for loess over the entire range 500 h m 0 cm using the em and the fht 3 2 usim results ten k values for h values between 40 and 4 2 cm were obtained in the usim experiment for tephra denoted by crosses in fig 6a table 2 they showed good continuity with both ks ssim on the wet end and k h curves em on the dry end although they fluctuated somewhat in the range below 30 cm this indicates that the usim successfully compensates for the failure of the em in the near saturation range i e wetter than approximately 35 cm the validity of the usim measurement will be discussed below schindler et al 2010 proposed the combination of the double membrane method klute 1972 with the em to complement k h in the near saturation range however the double membrane method requires another experimental setup which can result in negative effects on accuracy and efficiency in contrast our device uses the same sample porous caps and pressure transducers for the em ssim and usim this diminishes not only the time and cost but also the potential for errors between different methods ensuring good accuracy and representativeness thus our device enables accurate and effective measurement of k h including in the near saturation range by using the simple usim attachment with the device 3 3 model fitting to k h curves in the wet range the functional k h model expressed by eq 9 was fitted to the observations over the entire range 500 h m 0 cm by optimizing the parameters h md σ α and β while ks was fixed at observed values 1 8 102 and 1 8 cm day for tephra and loess respectively note that the data in the near saturation range where the em failed i e wetter than approximately 35 cm were eliminated from the data used to fit the model for the tephra sample the parameters obtained from the fitting are summarized in table 3 functional curves for both tephra and loess fig 6a and b respectively show that the model eq 9 fit the observed data well in wet range h m 80 cm 4 discussion 4 1 precision of k h in the near saturation range the em failed to measure k h in the near saturation range for the tephra cases t1 to t3 as the values showed large fluctuations and poor reproducibility fig 6a here we verify the precision of the k h measurement by the em fig 7 shows the values of ε abs eq 10 for the tephra cases t1 to t3 the larger the value of ε abs the lower the precision of the k h measurement we set the limit of precision valid invalid as the point where ε abs exceeds 0 1 and the fluctuations become large valid k ranges denoted by solid symbols were similar but not identical between cases the maximum valid k values for t1 t2 and t3 were 52 47 and 44 cm day respectively in fact a limiting factor of the wet side em measurement is the hydraulic gradient i m that is the value of i m exceeds the accuracy of the pressure transducer when k is high compared to the water flux q m in eq 6 wendroth et al 1993 peters and durner 2008 the valid ranges of k fig 7 were slightly different from case to case because q m differed due to changes in laboratory conditions temperature and humidity etc which are difficult to control therefore the valid range of i m should be determined empirically to determine the validity of the measurements in the following section we tried to create an filter criterion of i m based on empirical data 4 2 determining the valid range of i m the value of i m is measured by the differential pressure transducer errors may introduced by not only the nominal accuracy of the transducer but also the device structure and the laboratory conditions at the time of measurement moreover i m is the average value over a time interval the nominal accuracy data are therefore insufficient to determine the valid range of i m peters and durner 2008 proposed an empirical filter criterion from stochastic analysis they reject i m data that are smaller than six times the minimum resolution of i m this criterion is applied in their subsequent works on the em e g peters et al 2015 in this study we also created an empirical filter criterion of i m for our device based on both the transducer resolution and empirical data fig 8 shows the relationship between q m and k h m during the experiments valid invalid of data were determined from fig 7 as described in the materials and methods section the minimum resolution of the differential pressure transducer used in our device h diff is 1 3 10 3 cm and the minimum resolution of i m is 6 6 10 4 cm cm eq 4 curves shown in fig 8 denote the darcy buckingham s law eq 6 where i m has been set to one ten and a hundred times the minimum i m resolution as shown in fig 8 the curve where i m is ten times the minimum resolution i m 6 6 10 3 cm cm coincided well with the boundary between the valid and invalid data this result indicates that i m measurements of more than 6 6 10 3 cm cm are valid for our device this empirical filter criterion can be applied to any measurement using our device regardless of the laboratory conditions that affect q m additionally all i m data for the loess cases l1 to l3 were valid fig 8 this confirms that the k h curves for the loess sample i e fig 5b were valid over the entire measurement range 500 h m 0 cm 4 3 validity of the usim measurement as shown in fig 6a the precision of k as measured by the usim seems to decrease in the dryer range to verify the precision of the usim the values of ε abs eq 10 are shown in fig 7 denoted by crosses the values of ε abs y axis are larger for low model k values x axis the values of ε abs are summarized in table 2 in case 7 which showed the largest ε abs 0 23 the hydraulic gradient i m also had the highest value 3 2 cm cm in sum high values of i m tended to be associated with large ε abs the vertical distributions of θ and h become nonlinear when i m is high this nonlinearity may cause errors in the calculation of i m h m and k h in steady state methods the ideal value of i m is 1 0 cm cm to avoid nonlinearity in the usim experiments i m should be brought as close to 1 0 cm cm as possible by controlling q and δ h from our results table 2 a reasonable range for i m seems to be from approximately 0 50 to 1 5 cm cm to diminish errors in the usim 4 4 measurable range of k from the em experiments conducted in this study q m in the early evaporation stage is assumed to be more than 0 18 cm day figs 3c and 8 when q m varies within the assumed range and i m is above the cutoff i m greater than 6 6 10 3 cm cm in eq 6 the range of k h m measurable by the em is estimated to be up to 27 cm day according to the latest research on the em e g schindler et al 2015 volk et al 2016 the measurable range of k is approximately up to 0 1 cm day in this study we succeeded in expanding the measurable range of k by more than two orders of magnitude by applying the high resolution differential pressure transducer and verifying the accuracy for the usim when using our device the minimum q i e the pump s water supply rate is 32 cm day assuming ideal conditions i m 1 0 cm cm the minimum value of k is 32 cm day the same as the ssim assuming the reasonable range shown in table 2 0 50 i m 1 5 cm cm the measurable range of k is more than 21 cm day q 32 cm day i m 1 5 cm cm fig 9 summarizes the range of k h measurable by using our device on the wet end the range measurable by the em k 27 cm day overlaps with that measurable by the reasonable range of usim k greater than 21 cm day denoted by the broken line in fig 9 this indicates that using our device continuous k h curves from the wet to the medium pressure range can be obtained for any type of soil the range of ks measurable by the ssim depends on the minimum supply rate of the pump being used ks greater than 32 cm day as discussed above for soils whose ks are below the range e g loess the fht or another method should be applied the ranges measurable by the ssim and usim can be extended if q is controlled over a broader range an increase in q can easily be achieved by using a bigger pump or multiple pumps simultaneously however fundamental improvements in the water supply system are required to make q smaller a possible solution to be investigated in future work is the application of a small sprinkler system such as the atomized water spray dirksen 1999 the application of a tension infiltrometer with a mariotte bottle to the top surface of the soil is also a possible solution to adjust q on the dry end however in the preliminary em experiments bubbles emerged inside the pipes when h m fell below approximately 600 cm the unexpected decline of h diff occasionally occurred in the pressure range indicating the lack of contact between the ceramic cup and the soil sample moreover the differential pressure transducer used in our device has a narrow measurement range h diff 101 97 cm that is unsuitable for measurements in the dryer range therefore we set the lower limit of h m to 500 cm on the dry end to maintain accuracy 5 summary and conclusions the evaporation method em is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties however the em generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves k h in the wet low suction range when the hydraulic gradient within the soil sample exceeds the accuracy of the pressure transducer in this study we developed a new experimental device that uses the em and is capable of making conductivity measurements in the wet range by improving two aspects of the method and the device we successfully expanded the measurable range of k h to cover the wet range and enabled accurate and effective measurements the two avenues of improvement are as follows firstly the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient i m measurement was remarkably improved by using a differential pressure transducer fig 1a by verifying the accuracy through repeated experiments the valid range of i m the averaged value of i m over a time interval was empirically shown to be more than 6 6 10 3 cm cm which is ten times the minimum i m resolution this filter criterion can be applied to any measurement made using our device regardless of evaporation speed assuming the minimum evaporation speed the measurable range of k h is estimated to be up to 27 cm day that is our device expanded the range of k h measurable by the em by more than two orders of magnitude secondly our device can execute not only the em but also the saturated steady state infiltration method ssim to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks moreover the porous plate attachment fig 1b easily enables the use of the unsaturated steady state infiltration method usim in contrast to the conventional method which requires different experimental setups for each method our device uses the same sample porous caps and pressure transducers in the em ssim and usim this not only diminishes the time and cost associated with the measurement but also minimizes the errors between the different methods to ensure good accuracy and representativeness the range of k h measurable by the usim was more than 21 cm day which overlaps with that measurable by the em fig 9 as a result our device allows collection of continuous k h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range 500 h 0 cm for any type of soil our device requires only one sample to obtain a k h curve over the entire pressure range moreover the sampler size is relatively small 100 cm3 therefore our device is suitable for measuring the k h curves of undisturbed natural soil samples this time cost effective method will enable measurements of the spatial distribution of k h as well as water retention curves θ h in forest catchments such measurements are essential to improving the accuracy of predictions of rainfall infiltration and discharge by numerical simulations a few studies have measured the k h curves of undisturbed forest soils having aggregated structures and macropores e g nielsen et al 1973 shinomiya et al 2001 puhlmann et al 2009 although macroporous soils show variable k h in the near saturation range e g logsdon 2002 jarvis 2008 limited data are available to date parameters related to the soil pore tortuosity and effective pore radius in k h models i e α β and γ in eq 9 were proposed by burdine 1953 and mualem 1976 however these values were reported to be inadequate in some undisturbed natural soils e g kosugi 1999 shinomiya et al 2001 additionally very little is known about the k h properties of permeable weathered bedrock e g saprolite under forest soil layers katsura et al 2006 the use of our device will enable measurements of undisturbed forest soil properties leading to improved parameterizations and better use of k h models in future acknowledgements this work was partly supported by a grant from ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan and jsps

7138,hyprop hydraulic property analyzer system works based on the simplified evaporation method which determines soil hydraulic properties in the laboratory this system simultaneously monitors the changes in weight of soil samples as well as the soil matric potential at two depths throughout a drying process governed by evaporation from the soil surface in this study we examined the performance of the pseudo continuous pedotranfer function pc ptf to estimate the soil water retention curve swrc using high resolution data measured by hyprop system the dataset consisted of 7963 measured water retention data points obtained from 81 turkish soil samples from which 60 20 and 20 were randomly selected for training cross validation and test subsets respectively the best pc ptf developed in this study with a mean absolute error of 0 023 m3 m 3 a root mean square error of 0 033 m3 m 3 and a correlation coefficient of 0 96 showed promising performance considering the typical performance range rmse 0 034 0 085 m3 m 3 for parametric ptfs estimating swrc the best pc ptf used soil textural information soil bulk density the percentage of stable aggregates soil organic matter content and the initial water content as the input attributes ptfs developed in this study also ranked high among previously developed pc ptfs with rmse ranging from 0 027 to 0 056 m3 m 3 using sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach i e sandbox apparatus pressure plates extractor we therefore recommend further application of the pc ptf approach for development of ptfs using high resolution data obtained by hyprop system keywords data mining evaporation method neural network pseudo continuous pedotranfer function soil water retention curve 1 introduction the soil water retention curve swrc is arguably the most important curve in the soil science which provides critical information regarding the unsaturated behavior of soils with a wide range of applications in the agro hydrological studies in addition it is often used to estimate the soil hydraulic conductivity by capillary bundle models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 which together are used to study the unsaturated water flow as the controlling components when applying richards equation as a result a significant body of research in the soil science literature has been devoted to the measurement modeling and estimation of swrc there is no single laboratory device available to measure water retention data over the entire range of swrc the standard equilibrium method to measure soil water retention of undisturbed samples in the laboratory is by using the sandbox apparatus the sand kaolin box and the pressure plate extractor with typical usage ranges of 0 10 10 50 and 100 1500 kpa respectively however it has been reported that the pressure plates are susceptible to substantial errors recent studies have demonstrated a lack of reliability of the pressure plates when measuring swrc in particular in the dry range due to low plate and soil conductance loss of soil plate contact due to the soil shrinkage blocking of the pores in the ceramic porous plate and soil dispersion bittelli and solone 2012 solone et al 2012 cresswell et al 2008 in addition the measurements via the equilibrium method are time consuming and it takes weeks if not months to reach the equilibrium at each soil matric potential moreover measurement campaigns based on the equilibrium methods typically yield only a limited number of water retention data points usually less than 10 per soil sample the evaporation method wind 1968 wendroth et al 1993 halbertsma 1996 is an alternative option which concurrently produces the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data through monitoring of the water content evaporation and matric potential dynamics at various heights of a soil sample exposed to evaporation schindler 1980 showed that the measurement of the soil matric potential at only two depths produces promising results for a wide range of soil textures schindler et al 1985 the range of typical tensiometers less than 70 kpa limits the operational range of the evaporation method the extended evaporation method schindler et al 2010a 2010b however extends the range up close to the wilting point using new cavitation tensiometers and by considering the air entry value as an additional matric potential measurement schindler et al 2016 schindler et al 2012 conducted a study to compare swrcs determined from the traditional equilibrium methods with those obtained with the extended evaporation method they found the results of the two approaches to be comparable reported no systematic deviation between the water retention data and only observed less than a 2 deviation in average water content between 0 and 1500 kpa hyprop system hydraulic property analyzer meter group inc pullman wa usa is a semi automated commercial laboratory instrument that works based on a simplification of the evaporation method proposed by schindler 1980 which was shown to adequately determine the hydraulic properties of the most soils peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 hyprop has two advantages over the traditional equilibrium method it generates high resolution water retention data over 100 water retention data points in the 0 100 kpa range and the measurement cycle for each sample is typically completed in a few days schelle et al 2013 evaluated and compared several water retention measurement methods on a wide range of soil texture classes including sand silt silt loam clay loam and clay they reported comparable water retention data between the hanging water column method and hyprop in the wet to moderate water content range yet noticed some tendency for the over estimation of the water content in the retention data measured by the pressure plate extractor zhuang et al 2017 observed an excellent agreement between the soil hydraulic properties measured by hyprop against the multistep flux and the hanging water column experiments pedotransfer functions ptfs are statistical models mostly developed to estimate soil hydraulic characteristics from readily available basic properties of the soil in many practical applications ptf estimated soil hydraulic characteristics are often used when adequate measured data are not available in general ptfs derived using artificial neural network ann models have been shown to outperform ptfs developed using regression models vereecken et al 2010 this superior performance is mainly attributed to the ability of anns to model ptf input output relationships without any a priori functional form vereecken et al 2010 ptfs are developed to either estimate the soil water content at a few predefined soil matric potentials i e point ptfs or to continuously estimate the soil water content at any desired soil matric potential typically parametric ptfs wösten et al 2001 parametric ptfs estimate parameters of soil hydraulic equations which are subsequently used to estimate water contents across a wide range of soil matric potentials the main disadvantage of parametric ptf is once the ptf is developed user cannot change the preselected soil hydraulic equation which may or may not adequately represent the real shape of swrcs for all samples in addition it is sometimes challenging to correlate the parameters of soil hydraulic equations to basic soil properties minasny and mcbratney 2002 in recent years the pseudo continuous ptf pc ptf haghverdi et al 2012 2014 and the k nearest neighbor k nn ptf haghverdi et al 2015a were proposed as two alternative approaches to estimate swrcs these approaches allow withdrawal and replacement of soil hydraulic equations by an appropriate data mining method pc ptf or potential concurrent use of multiple soil hydraulic equations k nn ptf jain et al 2004 showed that a three layer feed forward ann with one input predictor representing the soil matric potential and one output node for the soil water content provides equally or more accurate estimation of swrc as compared to some widely used soil hydraulic functions haghverdi et al 2012 combined the ann topology suggested by jain et al 2004 with the topology of ann point ptf to develop ann pc ptf they showed that pc ptf performed slightly better than parametric ptfs using datasets with limited water retention data per sample the unique topology of pc ptf allows to combine different datasets with various measured water retention points and to utilize datasets with uneven missing measured water retention points among soil samples pc ptf has shown promising results for soils from iran and australia haghverdi et al 2012 turkey and belgium haghverdi et al 2014 usa haghverdi et al 2015b and vietnam nguyen et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2014 and nguyen et al 2017 examined several statistical approaches e g ann support vector machines k nn and multiple linear regression and concluded ann to be the best modeling approach to derive pc ptfs in recent years hyprop system has been increasingly used by researchers from different parts of the world e g schwen et al 2014 grath et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2017 schindler et al 2012 zhuang et al 2017 fields et al 2016 therefore in the near future large datasets will likely be compiled to develop ptfs using hyprop data recently schindler and müller 2017 published a database of 173 soil hydrological data from 71 sites collected from all around the world via the common evaporation method the extended evaporation method and hyprop system there remains the opportunity to develop more performing ptfs when high resolution water retention data produced by hyprop system are used unlike parametric ptf pc ptf does not incorporate certain assumptions about the shape of the swrc and only utilizes measured water retention data and relies on the power of ann models to determine the real shape of the swrc therefore pc ptf has to cover more nonlinearity and more complex relationships among input input and input output attributes which in part is covered by soil hydraulic equations in parametric ptf haghverdi et al 2012 2014 consequently the number of soil samples the density of the measured water retention data and their distribution in wet moist midrange and dry ranges of the curve and the best combination of input predictors should be identified carefully when developing pc ptfs our main hypotheses for this study are that i pc ptf can accurately model swrc using high resolution data measured by hyprop and ii high resolution data provided by hyprop result in equally or more accurate estimations of swrc compared to sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach i e the sandbox apparatus along with the pressure plates extractor in addition we examined the following three key questions 1 what combination of input attributes provides the best estimation of swrc 2 how does abundant measured water retention data in wet and moist regions of the curve versus lack of data in the dry range of the curve affect the estimation of swrc by pc ptf 3 does adding an arbitrary oven dry water retention point improve the performance of pc ptf in the dry range of the curve 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and laboratory analyses a total of 135 undisturbed 100 cm3 stainless steel soil sampling cylinder and disturbed soil samples were collected from the soil surface 0 30 cm mainly from the areas surrounding ankara turkey in 2010 some basic soil properties were measured by using the disturbed soil samples in the soil physics laboratory at ankara university turkey soil organic matter content om and soil texture were determined by the modified method of walkley and black jackson 1958 and the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 respectively the percentage of stable aggregates sa was measured by the wet sieving apparatus eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands the undisturbed samples were brought up to saturation in the laboratory and subsequently were put in the sandbox apparatus and the pressure plate extractor eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment giesbeek the netherlands to measure the water content at 8 matric potentials ranging from 5 to 1500 kpa the soil cores were later used to determine bulk density bd blake and hartge 1986 more details about this soil dataset is outlined in haghverdi et al 2014 the remaining disturbed sieved samples were sent to the institute of environmental sciences at technical university of braunschweig in germany for additional analyses using hyprop system fig 1 the remaining soil materials were enough to successfully prepare 81 samples out of the original 135 soil samples for the measurement of soil hydraulic properties using hyprop system the samples were packed in stainless steel cylinders approximately 250 cm3 with an inside diameter of 8 cm and a height of 5 cm to bds close to the field condition and then were saturated a small auger was used to make two holes for the two vertically aligned tensiometers designed for the optimum implementation of the evaporation method the tensiometers were positioned such that the center of the soil sample 2 5 cm was in the middle between the tensiometers tips i e 1 25 cm and 3 75 cm then the bottom side of the sample was closed throughout the experiment but the upper part was open to the atmosphere for evaporation the soil matric potentials were recorded at different points of time approximately once a minute for the first hour and every ten minutes afterwards at the two depths and the weight of the sample were measured twice a day following the single balance mode described in hyprop operation manual meter group inc 2018 the measurement campaign lasted on average 9 days for each sample varying between 5 and 13 days for different samples depending on the soil type the data were post processed to construct swrc by relating the mean soil water content obtained from sample mass to the mean soil matric potential obtained from the tensiometers at the two depths the basic assumptions for the analytical approach were the linear distribution of the soil matric potential and the water content through the soil column and the linear changes of weighs and water tensions between any two evaluation points pertassek et al 2011 fig 1 illustrates the main components of hyprop system three distinct stages can be recognized in a typical dataset obtained during hyprop measurement campaigns fig 2 i the initial stage in which the measured soil matric potential reflects the real tension of the soil surrounding tensiometers ii the vapor pressure stage in which tensiometers readings are no longer representative of the real soil tension iii the air entry stage which takes place when the tension in the soil surrounding tensiometers becomes greater than the air entry pressure of the ceramic material and therefore the measured soil matric potential reduces to zero hyprop uses the initiation of the stage three as an extra soil matric potential measurement point which is the underlying idea behind the extended evaporation method pertassek et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the soils used in this study fig 3 illustrates the textural distribution of the samples and the water retention data measured by hyprop system on average 98 water retention data points were measured per soil sample in the range between saturation and close to the permanent wilting point with an average pf of 1 75 we observed some differences between swrcs obtained via the equilibrium and hyprop approaches öztürk et al 2013 which is mainly attributed to the differences in soil structures caused by the use of repacked soil samples for the evaporation experiment however the methodological approach of pc ptf as described next is not affected by the sample preparation method i e the undisturbed versus repacked cylinders hence its practical applicability is not hampered by the use of the repacked samples in this study 2 2 deriving pseudo continuous pedotransfer functions fig 4 shows the typical topology of ann pc ptf ann pc ptf has an extra input node compared to the traditional point and parametric ptfs the extra node provides the soil matric potential information to ann which allows ptf to estimate water retention at any given soil matric potential other input attributes are a set of basic soil properties which allows ptf to distinguish among soils and understand how differences among soil basic information impact the curves neurosolution 7 1 1 1 neurodimension inc gainesville fl usa was used to develop three layer feed forward perceptron ann models the transfer functions were the hyperbolic tangent and linear for the hidden and the output layers respectively the learning algorithm was levenberg marquardt bishop 1995 the maximum epoch was set to 1000 and the number of runs was set to 3 while the weights were updated after the presentation of the entire training set the best weights were loaded automatically for testing to eliminate the possibility of the over training training was terminated when the mean square error of the cross validation subset either began to increase or showed no improvement after 100 iterations the number of neurons of the hidden layer was changed from 1 to 20 soil samples were randomly partitioned into 5 folds three for training one for cross validation and one for test subsets the model development process was repeated 5 times in order to use all 5 folds as test subsets when using pc ptfs to estimate swrcs saturation h 0 kpa or pf 0 and the permanent wilting point h 1500 kpa or pf 4 18 were considered as the upper and lower bounds respectively two filters were designed and implemented using microsoft excel to convert raw outputs of ann models to final ptf outputs the first filter replaced negative estimations with zero while the second filter adjusted the curvature of swrcs to ensure that no increase in the water content occurs as the soil dried from fully saturated down to the permanent wilting point and the soil matric potential becomes more negative fig 5 for each soil the second filter was implemented twice from the dry to wet end and from the wet to dry end such that any incorrect water retention point was replaced with the water retention of the previous measured point i e a lower suction for the wet to dry end and a higher suction for the dry to wet end the final output was the average of the two implementations table 2 summarizes 6 models developed in this study using different combinations of input attributes hereafter referred to as m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 the first three combinations include the typical input attributes i e soil texture bd and om used in the literature to develop ptfs for swrc two additional inputs including the initial soil water content iwc and as were incorporated in the remaining models correlation among input attributes was assumed to have no negative impact on the performance of pc ptf due to the insensitive nature of anns to multicollinearity de veaux and ungar 1994 iwc represents the water content of the completely saturated samples which is calculated from the total loss of water by evaporation and oven drying note that bds of repacked soils in germany were highly correlated r 0 85 but not identical to bds of the original undisturbed soils collected in turkey therefore we used bds of repacked soils to develop ptfs a sensitivity analysis was performed on m6 which contained all input predictors to better understand the relative importance of each input and to illustrate how the estimated water content value varies in response to variation of an input best ann weights were loaded and sensitivity analysis was performed on the training data the process was repeated 5 times using all combinations of the training data each input predictor was varied in 50 steps above and below its mean upper limit mean sd lower limit mean sd while all other inputs kept fixed at their respective means this process was repeated for each input predictor and the standard deviation of the estimations was reported as sensitivity our initial modeling attempts revealed that lack of data in the dry part of the curve caused pc ptf estimated swrcs to quickly level off which resulted in a relatively high residual water content for some soils to address this issue we added the oven dry point water content 0 m3 m 3 and pf 6 8 as an additional arbitrary data point to all samples and derived a new set of m6 ptfs 2 3 evaluation statistics the mean absolute error mae and the correlation coefficient r were chosen as the main statistics to evaluate the accuracy of the models yet the root mean square error rmse was also calculated to allow comparison with those studies that did not report mae values 1 mae 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2 3 r i 1 n e i e m i m i 1 n e i e 2 i 1 n m i m 2 where e and m are the estimated and measured water content values m3 m 3 using ptf and hyprop system respectively e and m are the mean estimated and measured water content values and n is the total number of the measured water retention points for all samples n 7963 the evaluation statistics were calculated only for the test data for all the models outlined in table 2 3 results table 3 summarizes the performance evaluation statistics for all 6 models calculated during the test phase only the mae ranges from 0 023 to 0 105 m3 m 3 and the correlation coefficient varies from 0 15 to 0 96 m6 followed by m5 show the best performances the lowest estimation accuracy belongs to m3 and m1 fig 6 illustrates the estimated water content data by the best m6 and the worst m3 pc ptf models fig 7 depicts the results of the sensitivity analysis pc ptf is the most sensitive to input attributes iwc and pf it shows moderate sensitivity to the soil textural components i e percentages of sand silt and clay and bd the lowest relative sensitivity is observed to som and sa the variation in sensitivity among the 5 versions of m6 developed using different realizations of the input data is high for the soil textural components and low for som sa iwc and the soil matric potential fig 8 illustrates the performance of the ptfs across textural classes against the number of measured water retention points for each class the lowest number of data in our dataset belongs to the loamy sand 1 of data and the sandy clay loam 1 of data textural classes which shows a relatively higher error clay is the dominant class 47 of data followed by sandy loam 17 of data both showing the lowest error among all classes the error remarkably decreases as the number of the data points increases but levels off such that the performance of ptfs for the loam 13 of data the clay loam 16 and the sandy loam 17 classes only slightly differs from that for the clay class 47 of data fig 9 illustrates swrcs estimated by m6 across the textural classes using the original dataset and the modified dataset with the oven dry point included two fitted swrcs are also depicted for each sample using the van genuchten soil hydraulic model van genuchten 1980 i the original curve with the residual water content estimated during the curve fitting process and ii the modified curve which ensured the water content matched zero at the oven dry point pf 6 8 the ptf estimated swrcs for the clay texture as the dominant class in our dataset show a high agreement with the fitted curves while the differences between the curves increase for the textural classes with lower data percentage share impact of additional water retention point i e the oven dry point differs among the soil samples even for samples from the same textural class for instance incorporation of the oven dry point in the training process causes slight moderate and high changes in swrcs for the clay samples 21 10 and 13 respectively 4 discussion the typical rmse values for the parametric ptfs predicting swrc vary between 0 034 and 0 085 m3 m 3 vereecken et al 2010 which puts the best pc ptf developed in this study i e m6 with rmse equal to 0 033 m3 m 3 at a very high rank this verifies our first hypothesis on the ability of pc ptf to adequately model swrc using high resolution measured data via hyprop system m6 pc ptf also ranks high among previously developed pc ptfs considering the reported rmses for pc ptfs in the literature ranging from 0 027 to 0 056 m3 m 3 haghverdi et al 2012 2014 2015 nguyen et al 2017 this finding verifies our second hypothesis on the equal or superior performance of pc ptf developed using hyprop data compared to the performance of pc ptf developed using sandbox pressure plate data haghverdi et al 2014 emphasized on the high sensitivity of pc ptf as a data driven model to the number and the distribution of measured water retention data points hyprop system provides roughly 10 times more measured water retention data per sample compared to the traditional equilibrium approach and our results show that ann pc ptf gains a substantial benefit from this ample amount of data 4 1 effectiveness of input predictors the sensitivity analysis revealed a relatively low effect of som and sa on swrc suggesting that these attributes could be excluded from the modeling the low effect of som could be attributed to its low concentration and its narrow range for a majority of our samples which were composed of the soils of dry central anatolia region of turkey on average the soil textural components i e percentages of sand silt and clay had a medium effect on swrc but the sensitivity of pc ptf to these components varied among different versions of m6 developed using different realizations of the input data this indicates that the impact of soil textural components varies based on the types of soils used to train pc ptfs iwc and pf constantly showed a very high impact on pc ptf regardless of the training data characteristics the high effect of pf was expected because it is the main input attribute used by pc ptf to model the relationship between the soil matric potential and the water content for each soil sample pc ptf showed the highest performance when iwc was included as input attribute compare m5 with m6 in table 3 this is in line with the observed trend by vereecken et al 2010 in their review paper in which they showed the largest improvements in swrc estimations by parametric ptfs occurred when the water content information was incorporated as an additional input according to schaap and leij 1998 including one θ33 kpa and two θ10 and θ33 kpa water retention points as ann ptfs input predictors in addition to the soil textural components and bd improved the predictability of swrc by 18 and 26 respectively in another study when a larger dataset was used to develop ptfs schaap et al 1998 observed even higher improvement in the performance of ann ptfs due to inclusion of one θ33 kpa 31 more accurate and two θ10 and θ33 kpa 34 more accurate water retention points twarakavi et al 2009 reported 31 and 35 improvement in the performance of ann ptf i e rosetta software schaap et al 2001 when fc water content at h 330 cm water column and fc plus pwp water content at h 15000 cm water column were included as additional input predictors respectively although m5 also had a performance in the typical range for ptfs predicting swrc excluding iwc roughly doubled the error in the previous studies haghverdi et al 2012 2014 only typical input predictors were considered i e soil textural information bd and som yet high performance for pc ptfs was observed we attribute this to the differences between datasets in all previous studies data collected via the sandbox apparatus and or the pressure plate extractor were utilized this means pc ptfs were provided with a less complex dataset consisting of a limited number of water retention points per soil in comparison with a much higher number of water retention points per sample in this study including iwc as an extra input attribute provided anns a measure for the upper limit of the water content for each soil which substantially improved the overall predictability of swrcs more research is needed to see if this finding holds true for bigger datasets with a larger number of soil samples 4 2 performance across textural classes haghverdi et al 2014 showed the performance of the ptfs across textural classes was inversely proportional to the number of available samples for each class in the training dataset this trend was also observed and reported by vereecken et al 2010 who reviewed the accuracy of parametric ptfs from a handful of studies and showed that the percentage share of the textural classes in each dataset can affect the accuracy of ptfs our finding fig 8 also confirms this trend we observed that an acceptable performance over textural classes is expected to occur when a minimum adequate number of samples for each class is incorporated in the ptf develop process our results suggest including approximately 13 of data should be enough for each textural class yet further studies with larger datasets would be needed to confirm this threshold 4 3 impact of oven dry information on pc ptf estimated swrcs when actual measured water retention data by hyprop were used as a criterion the overall performance of m6 remained unchanged mae 0 023 m3 m 3 with and without addition of the oven dry water retention point this means the overall performance of pc ptf was not improved in wet and moist midrange regions of the curve by supplementing the arbitrary oven dry information to the dataset however when compared against fitted vg model over a wider range of water retention i e from saturation to pwp the addition of the over dry point slightly 7 lower mae improved the performance of the pc ptfs for most of the soils adding the oven dry point caused pc ptf to predict lower water content values moving towards the dry part of the curve examples illustrated in fig 9 therefore we recommend including the oven dry point as an extra data point note that ideally more measured data points from the dry range of the curve if available should be incorporated into the dataset to achieve the peak performance of pc ptf this is particularly important when the complete estimation of the curve form saturation to oven dryness in desired the extended evaporation technique cannot generate data on a very dry range of the curve yet a combination of this technique and dew point method wp4c instrument meter group inc pullman wa usa can be used to efficiently cover the entire range from saturation to oven dryness 5 conclusion a majority of available pedotransfer functions ptfs aiming to predict the soil water retention curve swrc have been developed using water retention data measured by the traditional equilibrium method i e sandbox apparatus and pressure plate extractor hyprop system generates water retention data in a dynamic process controlled by evaporation which is inherently different from the data collected using the traditional method when users set the target pressure and measure the water content as equilibrium is reached consequently hyprop system typically produces about ten times more water retention data in a much shorter measurement cycle relative to the traditional equilibrium approach the result of our study showed that artificial neural network ann pseudo continuous ptf pc ptf approach can successfully estimate swrc using high resolution data collected by hyprop system we realized adding an arbitrary oven dry point results in better estimations in the dry range of the curve for some samples yet it did not improve the overall performance of pc ptfs in the wet and the moist regions of the curve the initial water content saturated water content was required as an extra input attribute in addition to the basic soil properties to achieve the highest performance of pc ptfs we focused on the continuous estimation of the water content between saturation and the permanent wilting point in this study and the data generated by hyprop system appeared to be adequate for that range however if available we recommend including more measured data points at the dry range of the curve in the pc ptf development process particularly when estimation of the full curve from saturation to oven dryness is desired 
7138,hyprop hydraulic property analyzer system works based on the simplified evaporation method which determines soil hydraulic properties in the laboratory this system simultaneously monitors the changes in weight of soil samples as well as the soil matric potential at two depths throughout a drying process governed by evaporation from the soil surface in this study we examined the performance of the pseudo continuous pedotranfer function pc ptf to estimate the soil water retention curve swrc using high resolution data measured by hyprop system the dataset consisted of 7963 measured water retention data points obtained from 81 turkish soil samples from which 60 20 and 20 were randomly selected for training cross validation and test subsets respectively the best pc ptf developed in this study with a mean absolute error of 0 023 m3 m 3 a root mean square error of 0 033 m3 m 3 and a correlation coefficient of 0 96 showed promising performance considering the typical performance range rmse 0 034 0 085 m3 m 3 for parametric ptfs estimating swrc the best pc ptf used soil textural information soil bulk density the percentage of stable aggregates soil organic matter content and the initial water content as the input attributes ptfs developed in this study also ranked high among previously developed pc ptfs with rmse ranging from 0 027 to 0 056 m3 m 3 using sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach i e sandbox apparatus pressure plates extractor we therefore recommend further application of the pc ptf approach for development of ptfs using high resolution data obtained by hyprop system keywords data mining evaporation method neural network pseudo continuous pedotranfer function soil water retention curve 1 introduction the soil water retention curve swrc is arguably the most important curve in the soil science which provides critical information regarding the unsaturated behavior of soils with a wide range of applications in the agro hydrological studies in addition it is often used to estimate the soil hydraulic conductivity by capillary bundle models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 which together are used to study the unsaturated water flow as the controlling components when applying richards equation as a result a significant body of research in the soil science literature has been devoted to the measurement modeling and estimation of swrc there is no single laboratory device available to measure water retention data over the entire range of swrc the standard equilibrium method to measure soil water retention of undisturbed samples in the laboratory is by using the sandbox apparatus the sand kaolin box and the pressure plate extractor with typical usage ranges of 0 10 10 50 and 100 1500 kpa respectively however it has been reported that the pressure plates are susceptible to substantial errors recent studies have demonstrated a lack of reliability of the pressure plates when measuring swrc in particular in the dry range due to low plate and soil conductance loss of soil plate contact due to the soil shrinkage blocking of the pores in the ceramic porous plate and soil dispersion bittelli and solone 2012 solone et al 2012 cresswell et al 2008 in addition the measurements via the equilibrium method are time consuming and it takes weeks if not months to reach the equilibrium at each soil matric potential moreover measurement campaigns based on the equilibrium methods typically yield only a limited number of water retention data points usually less than 10 per soil sample the evaporation method wind 1968 wendroth et al 1993 halbertsma 1996 is an alternative option which concurrently produces the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data through monitoring of the water content evaporation and matric potential dynamics at various heights of a soil sample exposed to evaporation schindler 1980 showed that the measurement of the soil matric potential at only two depths produces promising results for a wide range of soil textures schindler et al 1985 the range of typical tensiometers less than 70 kpa limits the operational range of the evaporation method the extended evaporation method schindler et al 2010a 2010b however extends the range up close to the wilting point using new cavitation tensiometers and by considering the air entry value as an additional matric potential measurement schindler et al 2016 schindler et al 2012 conducted a study to compare swrcs determined from the traditional equilibrium methods with those obtained with the extended evaporation method they found the results of the two approaches to be comparable reported no systematic deviation between the water retention data and only observed less than a 2 deviation in average water content between 0 and 1500 kpa hyprop system hydraulic property analyzer meter group inc pullman wa usa is a semi automated commercial laboratory instrument that works based on a simplification of the evaporation method proposed by schindler 1980 which was shown to adequately determine the hydraulic properties of the most soils peters et al 2015 peters and durner 2008 hyprop has two advantages over the traditional equilibrium method it generates high resolution water retention data over 100 water retention data points in the 0 100 kpa range and the measurement cycle for each sample is typically completed in a few days schelle et al 2013 evaluated and compared several water retention measurement methods on a wide range of soil texture classes including sand silt silt loam clay loam and clay they reported comparable water retention data between the hanging water column method and hyprop in the wet to moderate water content range yet noticed some tendency for the over estimation of the water content in the retention data measured by the pressure plate extractor zhuang et al 2017 observed an excellent agreement between the soil hydraulic properties measured by hyprop against the multistep flux and the hanging water column experiments pedotransfer functions ptfs are statistical models mostly developed to estimate soil hydraulic characteristics from readily available basic properties of the soil in many practical applications ptf estimated soil hydraulic characteristics are often used when adequate measured data are not available in general ptfs derived using artificial neural network ann models have been shown to outperform ptfs developed using regression models vereecken et al 2010 this superior performance is mainly attributed to the ability of anns to model ptf input output relationships without any a priori functional form vereecken et al 2010 ptfs are developed to either estimate the soil water content at a few predefined soil matric potentials i e point ptfs or to continuously estimate the soil water content at any desired soil matric potential typically parametric ptfs wösten et al 2001 parametric ptfs estimate parameters of soil hydraulic equations which are subsequently used to estimate water contents across a wide range of soil matric potentials the main disadvantage of parametric ptf is once the ptf is developed user cannot change the preselected soil hydraulic equation which may or may not adequately represent the real shape of swrcs for all samples in addition it is sometimes challenging to correlate the parameters of soil hydraulic equations to basic soil properties minasny and mcbratney 2002 in recent years the pseudo continuous ptf pc ptf haghverdi et al 2012 2014 and the k nearest neighbor k nn ptf haghverdi et al 2015a were proposed as two alternative approaches to estimate swrcs these approaches allow withdrawal and replacement of soil hydraulic equations by an appropriate data mining method pc ptf or potential concurrent use of multiple soil hydraulic equations k nn ptf jain et al 2004 showed that a three layer feed forward ann with one input predictor representing the soil matric potential and one output node for the soil water content provides equally or more accurate estimation of swrc as compared to some widely used soil hydraulic functions haghverdi et al 2012 combined the ann topology suggested by jain et al 2004 with the topology of ann point ptf to develop ann pc ptf they showed that pc ptf performed slightly better than parametric ptfs using datasets with limited water retention data per sample the unique topology of pc ptf allows to combine different datasets with various measured water retention points and to utilize datasets with uneven missing measured water retention points among soil samples pc ptf has shown promising results for soils from iran and australia haghverdi et al 2012 turkey and belgium haghverdi et al 2014 usa haghverdi et al 2015b and vietnam nguyen et al 2017 haghverdi et al 2014 and nguyen et al 2017 examined several statistical approaches e g ann support vector machines k nn and multiple linear regression and concluded ann to be the best modeling approach to derive pc ptfs in recent years hyprop system has been increasingly used by researchers from different parts of the world e g schwen et al 2014 grath et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2017 schindler et al 2012 zhuang et al 2017 fields et al 2016 therefore in the near future large datasets will likely be compiled to develop ptfs using hyprop data recently schindler and müller 2017 published a database of 173 soil hydrological data from 71 sites collected from all around the world via the common evaporation method the extended evaporation method and hyprop system there remains the opportunity to develop more performing ptfs when high resolution water retention data produced by hyprop system are used unlike parametric ptf pc ptf does not incorporate certain assumptions about the shape of the swrc and only utilizes measured water retention data and relies on the power of ann models to determine the real shape of the swrc therefore pc ptf has to cover more nonlinearity and more complex relationships among input input and input output attributes which in part is covered by soil hydraulic equations in parametric ptf haghverdi et al 2012 2014 consequently the number of soil samples the density of the measured water retention data and their distribution in wet moist midrange and dry ranges of the curve and the best combination of input predictors should be identified carefully when developing pc ptfs our main hypotheses for this study are that i pc ptf can accurately model swrc using high resolution data measured by hyprop and ii high resolution data provided by hyprop result in equally or more accurate estimations of swrc compared to sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach i e the sandbox apparatus along with the pressure plates extractor in addition we examined the following three key questions 1 what combination of input attributes provides the best estimation of swrc 2 how does abundant measured water retention data in wet and moist regions of the curve versus lack of data in the dry range of the curve affect the estimation of swrc by pc ptf 3 does adding an arbitrary oven

blake and hartge 1986 more details about this soil dataset is outlined in haghverdi et al 2014 the remaining disturbed sieved samples were sent to the institute of environmental sciences at technical university of braunschweig in germany for additional analyses using hyprop system fig 1 the remaining soil materials were enough to successfully prepare 81 samples out of the original 135 soil samples for the measurement of soil hydraulic properties using hyprop system the samples were packed in stainless steel cylinders approximately 250 cm3 with an inside diameter of 8 cm and a height of 5 cm to bds close to the field condition and then were saturated a small auger was used to make two holes for the two vertically aligned tensiometers designed for the optimum implementation of the evaporation method the tensiometers were positioned such that the center of the soil sample 2 5 cm was in the middle between the tensiometers tips i e 1 25 cm and 3 75 cm then the bottom side of the sample was closed throughout the experiment but the upper part was open to the atmosphere for evaporation the soil matric potentials were recorded at different points of time approximately once a minute for the first hour and every ten minutes afterwards at the two depths and the weight of the sample were measured twice a day following the single balance mode described in hyprop operation manual meter group inc 2018 the measurement campaign lasted on average 9 days for each sample varying between 5 and 13 days for different samples depending on the soil type the data were post processed to construct swrc by relating the mean soil water content obtained from sample mass to the mean soil matric potential obtained from the tensiometers at the two depths the basic assumptions for the analytical approach were the linear distribution of the soil matric potential and the water content through the soil column and the linear changes of weighs and water tensions between any two evaluation points pertassek et al 2011 fig 1 illustrates the main components of hyprop system three distinct stages can be recognized in a typical dataset obtained during hyprop measurement campaigns fig 2 i the initial stage in which the measured soil matric potential reflects the real tension of the soil surrounding tensiometers ii the vapor pressure stage in which tensiometers readings are no longer representative of the real soil tension iii the air entry stage which takes place when the tension in the soil surrounding tensiometers becomes greater than the air entry pressure of the ceramic material and therefore the measured soil matric potential reduces to zero hyprop uses the initiation of the stage three as an extra soil matric potential measurement point which is the underlying idea behind the extended evaporation method pertassek et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the soils used in this study fig 3 illustrates the textural distribution of the samples and the water retention data measured by hyprop system on average 98 water retention data points were measured per soil sample in the range between saturation and close to the permanent wilting point with an average pf of 1 75 we observed some differences between swrcs obtained via the equilibrium and hyprop approaches öztürk et al 2013 which is mainly attributed to the differences in soil structures caused by the use of repacked soil samples for the evaporation experiment however the methodological approach of pc ptf as described next is not affected by the sample preparation method i e the undisturbed versus repacked cylinders hence its practical applicability is not hampered by the use of the repacked samples in this study 2 2 deriving pseudo continuous pedotransfer functions fig 4 shows the typical topology of ann pc ptf ann pc ptf has an extra input node compared to the traditional point and parametric ptfs the extra node provides the soil matric potential information to ann which allows ptf to estimate water retention at any given soil matric potential other input attributes are a set of basic soil properties which allows ptf to distinguish among soils and understand how differences among soil basic information impact the curves neurosolution 7 1 1 1 neurodimension inc gainesville fl usa was used to develop three layer feed forward perceptron ann models the transfer functions were the hyperbolic tangent and linear for the hidden and the output layers respectively the learning algorithm was levenberg marquardt bishop 1995 the maximum epoch was set to 1000 and the number of runs was set to 3 while the weights were updated after the presentation of the entire training set the best weights were loaded automatically for testing to eliminate the possibility of the over training training was terminated when the mean square error of the cross validation subset either began to increase or showed no improvement after 100 iterations the number of neurons of the hidden layer was changed from 1 to 20 soil samples were randomly partitioned into 5 folds three for training one for cross validation and one for test subsets the model development process was repeated 5 times in order to use all 5 folds as test subsets when using pc ptfs to estimate swrcs saturation h 0 kpa or pf 0 and the permanent wilting point h 1500 kpa or pf 4 18 were considered as the upper and lower bounds respectively two filters were designed and implemented using microsoft excel to convert raw outputs of ann models to final ptf outputs the first filter replaced negative estimations with zero while the second filter adjusted the curvature of swrcs to ensure that no increase in the water content occurs as the soil dried from fully saturated down to the permanent wilting point and the soil matric potential becomes more negative fig 5 for each soil the second filter was implemented twice from the dry to wet end and from the wet to dry end such that any incorrect water retention point was replaced with the water retention of the previous measured point i e a lower suction for the wet to dry end and a higher suction for the dry to wet end the final output was the average of the two implementations table 2 summarizes 6 models developed in this study using different combinations of input attributes hereafter referred to as m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 the first three combinations include the typical input attributes i e soil texture bd and om used in the literature to develop ptfs for swrc two additional inputs including the initial soil water content iwc and as were incorporated in the remaining models correlation among input attributes was assumed to have no negative impact on the performance of pc ptf due to the insensitive nature of anns to multicollinearity de veaux and ungar 1994 iwc represents the water content of the completely saturated samples which is calculated from the total loss of water by evaporation and oven drying note that bds of repacked soils in germany were highly correlated r 0 85 but not identical to bds of the original undisturbed soils collected in turkey therefore we used bds of repacked soils to develop ptfs a sensitivity analysis was performed on m6 which contained all input predictors to better understand the relative importance of each input and to illustrate how the estimated water content value varies in response to variation of an input best ann weights were loaded and sensitivity analysis was performed on the training data the process was repeated 5 times using all combinations of the training data each input predictor was varied in 50 steps above and below its mean upper limit mean sd lower limit mean sd while all other inputs kept fixed at their respective means this process was repeated for each input predictor and the standard deviation of the estimations was reported as sensitivity our initial modeling attempts revealed that lack of data in the dry part of the curve caused pc ptf estimated swrcs to quickly level off which resulted in a relatively high residual water content for some soils to address this issue we added the oven dry point water content 0 m3 m 3 and pf 6 8 as an additional arbitrary data point to all samples and derived a new set of m6 ptfs 2 3 evaluation statistics the mean absolute error mae and the correlation coefficient r were chosen as the main statistics to evaluate the accuracy of the models yet the root mean square error rmse was also calculated to allow comparison with those studies that did not report mae values 1 mae 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n e i m i 2

measured water content values and n is the total number of the measured water retention points for all samples n 7963 the evaluation statistics were calculated only for the test data for all the models outlined in table 2 3 results table 3 summarizes the performance evaluation statistics for all 6 models calculated during the test phase only the mae ranges from 0 023 to 0 105 m3 m 3 and the correlation coefficient varies from 0 15 to 0 96 m6 followed by m5 show the best performances the lowest estimation accuracy belongs to m3 and m1 fig 6 illustrates the estimated water content data by the best m6 and the worst m3 pc ptf models fig 7 depicts the results of the sensitivity analysis pc ptf is the most sensitive to input attributes iwc and pf it shows moderate sensitivity to the soil textural components i e percentages of sand silt and clay and bd the lowest relative sensitivity is observed to som and sa the variation in sensitivity among the 5 versions of m6 developed using different realizations of the input data is high for the soil textural components and low for som sa iwc and the soil matric potential fig 8 illustrates the performance of the ptfs across textural classes against the number of measured water retention points for each class the lowest number of data in our dataset belongs to the loamy sand 1 of data and the sandy clay loam 1 of data textural classes which shows a relatively higher error clay is the dominant class 47 of data followed by sandy loam 17 of data both showing the lowest error among all classes the error remarkably decreases as the number of the data points increases but levels off such that the performance of ptfs for the loam 13 of data the clay loam 16 and the sandy loam 17 classes only slightly differs from that for the clay class 47 of data fig 9 illustrates swrcs estimated by m6 across the textural classes using the original dataset and the modified dataset with the oven dry point included two fitted swrcs are also depicted for each sample using the van genuchten soil hydraulic model van genuchten 1980 i the original curve with the residual water content estimated during the curve fitting process and ii the modified curve which ensured the water content matched zero at the oven dry point pf 6 8 the ptf estimated swrcs for the clay texture as the dominant class in our dataset show a high agreement with the fitted curves while the differences between the curves increase for the textural classes with lower data percentage share impact of additional water retention point i e the oven dry point differs among the soil samples even for samples from the same textural class for instance incorporation of the oven dry point in the training process causes slight moderate and high changes in swrcs for the clay samples 21 10 and 13 respectively 4 discussion the typical rmse values for the parametric ptfs predicting swrc vary between 0 034 and 0 085 m3 m 3 vereecken et al 2010 which puts the best pc ptf developed in this study i e m6 with rmse equal to 0 033 m3 m 3 at a very high rank this verifies our first hypothesis on the ability of pc ptf to adequately model swrc using high resolution measured data via hyprop system m6 pc ptf also ranks high among previously developed pc ptfs considering the reported rmses for pc ptfs in the literature ranging from 0 027 to 0 056 m3 m 3 haghverdi et al 2012 2014 2015 nguyen et al 2017 this finding verifies our second hypothesis on the equal or superior performance of pc ptf developed using hyprop data compared to the performance of pc ptf developed using sandbox pressure plate data haghverdi et al 2014 emphasized on the high sensitivity of pc ptf as a data driven model to the number and the distribution of measured water retention data points hyprop system provides roughly 10 times more measured water retention data per sample compared to the traditional equilibrium approach and our results show that ann pc ptf gains a substantial benefit from this ample amount of data 4 1 effectiveness of input predictors the sensitivity analysis revealed a relatively low effect of som and sa on swrc suggesting that these attributes could be excluded from the modeling the low effect of som could be attributed to its low concentration and its narrow range for a majority of our samples which were composed of the soils of dry central anatolia region of turkey on average the soil textural components i e percentages of sand silt and clay had a medium effect on swrc but the sensitivity of pc ptf to these components varied among different versions of m6 developed using different realizations of the input data this indicates that the impact of soil textural components varies based on the types of soils used to train pc ptfs iwc and pf constantly showed a very high impact on pc ptf regardless of the training data characteristics the high effect of pf was expected because it is the main input attribute used by pc ptf to model the relationship between the soil matric potential and the water content for each soil sample pc ptf showed the highest performance when iwc was included as input attribute compare m5 with m6 in table 3 this is in line with the observed trend by vereecken et al 2010 in their review paper in which they showed the largest improvements in swrc estimations by parametric ptfs occurred when the water content information was incorporated as an additional input according to schaap and leij 1998 including one θ33 kpa and two θ10 and θ33 kpa water retention points as ann ptfs input predictors in addition to the soil textural components and bd improved the predictability of swrc by 18 and 26 respectively in another study when a larger dataset was used to develop ptfs schaap et al 1998 observed even higher improvement in the performance of ann ptfs due to inclusion of one θ33 kpa 31 more accurate and two θ10 and θ33 kpa 34 more accurate water retention points twarakavi et al 2009 reported 31 and 35 improvement in the performance of ann ptf i e rosetta software schaap et al 2001 when fc water content at h 330 cm water column and fc plus pwp water content at h 15000 cm water column were included as additional input predictors respectively although m5 also had a performance in the typical range for ptfs predicting swrc excluding iwc roughly doubled the error in the previous studies haghverdi et al 2012 2014 only typical input predictors were considered i e soil textural information bd and som yet high performance for pc ptfs was observed we attribute this to the differences between datasets in all previous studies data collected via the sandbox apparatus and or the pressure plate extractor were utilized this means pc ptfs were provided with a less complex dataset consisting of a limited number of water retention points per soil in comparison with a much higher number of water retention points per sample in this study including iwc as an extra input attribute provided anns a measure for the upper limit of the water content for each soil which substantially improved the overall predictability of swrcs more research is needed to see if this finding holds true for bigger datasets with a larger number of soil samples 4 2 performance across textural classes haghverdi et al 2014 showed the performance of the ptfs across textural classes was inversely proportional to the number of available samples for each class in the training dataset this trend was also observed and reported by vereecken et al 2010 who reviewed the accuracy of parametric ptfs from a handful of studies and showed that the percentage share of the textural classes in each dataset can affect the accuracy of ptfs our finding fig 8 also confirms this trend we observed that an acceptable performance over textural classes is expected to occur when a minimum adequate number of samples for each class is incorporated in the ptf develop process our results suggest including approximately 13 of data should be enough for each textural class yet further studies with larger datasets would be needed to confirm this threshold 4 3 impact of oven dry information on pc ptf estimated swrcs when actual measured water retention data by hyprop were used as a criterion the overall performance of m6 remained unchanged mae 0 023 m3 m 3 with and without addition of the oven dry water retention point this means the overall performance of pc ptf was not improved in wet and moist midrange regions of the curve by supplementing the arbitrary oven dry information to the dataset however when compared against fitted vg model over a wider range of water retention i e from saturation to pwp the addition of the over dry point slightly 7 lower mae improved the performance of the pc ptfs for most of the soils adding the oven dry point caused pc ptf to predict lower water content values moving towards the dry part of the curve examples illustrated in fig 9 therefore we recommend including the oven dry point as an extra data point note that ideally more measured data points from the dry range of the curve if available should be incorporated into the dataset to achieve the peak performance of pc ptf this is particularly important when the complete estimation of the curve form saturation to oven dryness in desired the extended evaporation technique cannot generate data on a very dry range of the curve yet a combination of this technique and dew point method wp4c instrument meter group inc pullman wa usa can be used to efficiently cover the entire range from saturation to oven dryness 5 conclusion a majority of available pedotransfer functions ptfs aiming to predict the soil water retention curve swrc have been developed using water retention data measured by the traditional equilibrium method i e sandbox apparatus and pressure plate extractor hyprop system generates water retention data in a dynamic process controlled by evaporation which is inherently different from the data collected using the traditional method when users set the target pressure and measure the water content as equilibrium is reached consequently hyprop system typically produces about ten times more water retention data in a much shorter measurement cycle relative to the traditional equilibrium approach the result of our study showed that artificial neural network ann pseudo continuous ptf pc ptf approach can successfully estimate swrc using high resolution data collected by hyprop system we realized adding an arbitrary oven dry point results in better estimations in the dry range of the curve for some samples yet it did not improve the overall performance of pc ptfs in the wet and the moist regions of the curve the initial water content saturated water content was required as an extra input attribute in addition to the basic soil properties to achieve the highest performance of pc ptfs we focused on the continuous estimation of the water content between saturation and the permanent wilting point in this study and the data generated by hyprop system appeared to be adequate for that range however if available we recommend including more measured data points at the dry range of the curve in the pc ptf development process particularly when estimation of the full curve from saturation to oven dryness is desired 
7139,riparian wetlands as both hydrological and biogeochemical hot spots often have a major impact on the release of solutes from headwater catchments numerous studies give some evidence of a rather complex interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes that is still poorly understood this study seeks to address this challenge using a multivariate solute concentration data set from a small riparian headwater wetland first a non linear variant of the principal component analysis isomap was performed in a preceding study to identify prevailing biogeochemical processes controlling water chemistry second the scores of the components of the stream draining the wetland were subjected to a cluster analysis to identify typical biogeochemical patterns for different biogeochemical and hydrological boundary conditions four different clusters could be identified which roughly followed a seasonal pattern although modified by hydrological boundary conditions in the short term during the first three months of the year cluster 3 prevailed indicating a discharge of rather unaltered shallow to mean depth groundwater cluster 3 was increasingly replaced by cluster 2 and then subsequently by cluster 1 indicating increasingly anoxic conditions increasing denitrification and desulphurization and increasing decomposition of organic carbon reflecting increasing biological activity and increasing water residence time within the wetland however stream water during stormflow after extended periods of low groundwater level in the second half of the growth season exhibited a very distinct pattern represented by the fourth cluster it indicated strong oxic conditions causing enhanced oxidation of sulphides a corresponding decrease in ph values and a substantial increase in the concentration of alkaline earth ions manganese and in electric conductivity during the dry period it is concluded that temporal variations in stream water chemistry clearly reflected the intensity of biological activity in the wetland interacting with water table dynamics our results provide strong evidence for major effects of single extreme events like drought periods which are expected to become more frequent because of climate change keywords stream water chemistry solute export riparian wetland biogeochemistry seasonality cluster analysis 1 introduction riparian wetlands are transition zones between the unsaturated zone groundwater and surface water casey and klaine 2001 zhao et al 2009 and are characterized by substantial nutrient and contaminant retention capacities

of storm events for solute export has been documented in numerous studies mitchell et al 2006 neal et al 2006 raymond and saiers 2010 ulen 1995 especially in small catchments a significant amount of annual stream runoff occurs during single runoff events accompanied by a change of surface water quality within a few hours kirchner 2003 systematic shifts of stream water solute concentration during stormflow periods were often ascribed to hydrological processes like changes in water flow paths christophersen et al 1982 davies et al 1992 hagedorn et al 2000 lyon et al 2011 the latter may be due to changes in riparian wetland water table depth leading to different types of runoff events bechtold et al 2003 emmett et al 1994 inamdar et al 2008 kerr et al 2008 this approach implies that the chemical composition within a single water flow path does not change with regard to time and space which presumably holds only at the time scale of single stormflow periods consequently the processes causing chemical signatures in runoff are still poorly understood aubert et al 2013b dhillon and inamdar 2014 kirchner 2003 in contrast to this hydrological perspective biogeochemists study wetland processes at the time scale of weeks or months and tend to ignore changing hydrological conditions and boundary fluxes with the exception of changing groundwater levels the focus of those studies is on internal processes and not on relating them to output fluxes via the discharging stream knorr et al 2009 pennington and watmough 2015 reiche et al 2009 thus little is known about the interplay between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in riparian wetlands so far various studies have provided anecdotal evidence sulphate e g was found to be exported episodically after summer droughts

a probabilistic clustering method inamdar et al 2013 highlighted the need to recognize temporal shifts in the end member chemistry as a function of catchment wetness to better characterize catchment flow paths and mixing responses knorr 2012 emphasized the importance of both hydrological and redox conditions in the wetlands for solute export in the catchment of this study water resources management must consider spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical and hydrological processes for assessing the impact of climate and land use change on solute export management practices are often based on results from biogeochemical modelling however non linear interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in catchments render the understanding and prediction of long term behaviour of surface water quality difficult thus the objective of this study was to elucidate the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes and to weight their respective relevance with regard to water quality in the receiving stream it was hypothesized that the temporal patterns of wetland stream water chemistry were not related to changes in hydrological flow paths but that stream water chemistry reflected varying antecedent biogeochemical boundary conditions in the wetland however it was assumed that biogeochemical processes in the wetland were affected by the groundwater level which determined the degree of anoxia in the uppermost soil layer this study builds upon a preceding study by weyer et al 2014 prevailing biogeochemical processes in the lehstenbach catchment were identified in a comprehensive data set comprising soil solution groundwater spring water and stream water solute concentration data from upslope and wetland sites using the isomap approach isometric feature mapping tenenbaum et al 2000 isomap can be considered a non linear variant of principal component analysis pca as different observables of the multivariate water quality data set exhibited numerous although partly non linear relationships a large fraction of the variance could be represented by a small number of isomap components as these components were independent they were used to identify the prevailing biogeochemical processes in addition the component scores were used as a proxy for quantifying the intensities of the respective biogeochemical processes this study focused on a subset of the data set used by weyer et al 2014 comprising data from 280 samples taken in a stream that drained a small wetland in the lehstenbach catchment in addition to solute concentration values the isomap component scores of the samples as a quantitative assessment of the intensity of the prevailing processes were included this study aims at a better understanding of the observed pronounced temporal variability of stream water quality i e at differentiating between biogeochemical and hydrological drivers to that end a cluster analysis ca was used to classify stream water samples as that classification was based on the scores of the independent isomap components it does not only solve the problem of collinearity as is often recommended fröhlich et al 2008 menció and mas pla 2008 woocay and walton 2008 moreover it allowed interpreting the clusters in terms of intensities of identified biogeochemical processes which would not be possible by using solute concentration data a time series of cluster assignment of the stream water samples was related to the respective meteorological and hydrological boundary conditions and conclusions were drawn with respect to the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes in addition the classification of stream water samples was compared to the well known schöller and piper classification of water samples piper 1944 schoeller 1962 finally implications for explaining temporal patterns of single solutes in stream water quality are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 data the current investigation involved samples of a wetland stream within the lehstenbach watershed 50 08 n and 11 52 e in the fichtelgebirge mountains in southeast germany extensive monitoring programs have been run in this catchment since the end of the 1980s including several studies on groundwater and stream water chemistry the watershed area is 4 19 km2 and elevation ranges from 690 to 877 m a s l fig 1 the bedrock consists of variscan granite of two different facies stettner 1964 which show very similar mineralogical compositions significant differences between the two facies with respect to geochemistry weyer et al 2008 or hydrogeology partington et al 2013 have not been observed the thickness of the regolith is up to 40 m and more dystric cambisols and podzols predominate in the riparian zone fibric histosols and dystric gleysols are present representing about one third of the watershed area the area is drained by a dense network of natural streams and artificial channels dense norway spruce stands picea abies cover more than 95 of the watershed area annual mean air temperature is 5 8 c annual mean precipitation is between 950 and 1250 mm annual mean runoff of the lehstenbach stream i e the catchment outlet was 470 mm during the period from 1991 to 2001 lischeid et al 2010 snowpack usually develops in december or january and final snowmelt occurs in march or april the site has been severely impacted by sulphate deposition that peaked in the 1970s and has decreased by more than 80 since then matzner et al 2004 this study focused on the ephemeral moorbach stream that drains the slightly acidic schlöppnerbrunnen fen later referred to as wetland near the catchment outlet fig 1 the fen area is 0 08 km2 the thickness of the peat layer on top of the mineral soil ranges between 30 and 70 cm reiche et al 2009 the runoff of the moorbach stream is exclusively composed of wetland waters i e by waters that originate in the wetland or by groundwater that has passed through the wetland area discharge of the moorbach stream was between 0 and 4l s during most of the study period during discharge peaks up to 439l s were observed three plots of 7 2 m 5 m each were subjected to two drying rewetting experiments from august to september 2006 and from may to july 2007 for more details see reiche et al 2009 the rest of the wetland was not manipulated more than 600 stream water samples from the moorbach stream were taken between april 2005 and november 2007 with an isco automatic sampler at daily intervals no samples could be taken during the frost period or when the moorbach stream fell dry samples were filled in thoroughly rinsed polyethylene bottles in the automatic sampler the filled bottles were at least collected every three weeks and directly transported to the central laboratory of the bayreuth center of ecology and ecological research bayceer in all collected samples electric conductivity ec and ph values were measured directly after collection with a tetracon 325 conductivity cell wtw and with a sentix 41 3 electrode wtw respectively initially from april to june 2005 daily stream water samples were analysed afterwards only samples taken during runoff events were selected according to stream discharge and electric conductivity values in total 280 stream water samples were selected to be analysed as described below

graphics 2 2 1 statistical analysis different non linear multivariate statistical methods were used sequentially to analyse water solution data a global flowchart of the different steps of statistical analysis is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 1 preceding analysis of water quality data the data set used for this study is a subset of the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 comprising soil solution groundwater spring water and stream water samples from various sites within the catchment including upslope soils weyer et al 2014 applied a non linear version of a principal component analysis the isometric feature mapping isomap approach to the original data set in order to identify the prevailing biogeochemical hot spots along different subsurface flow paths from the soil surface to the catchment outlet the approach reduced the dimensionality of the original data set comprising 1686 single samples with 16 parameters each down to three components fig 2 the three components explained 89 of the total variance 48 30 and 11 respectively the first component was positively correlated with so4 no3 mn k mg and ca concentrations and electric conductivity but was negatively correlated with fe and si concentrations and ph values the second component was associated with high doc fe and al concentrations but low so4 and na concentrations and low ph values the third component was characterized by positive loadings of cl si nh4 k na and ph values and negative loadings of al and so4 the first component was ascribed to redox processes the second to acid induced podsolization and the third to weathering processes in the subsurface weyer et al 2014 every sample of the data set was assigned a score of the respective components as a quantitative measure for the strength of the respective effects on that water sample it could be shown that for all three components the uppermost 10 cm of the riparian wetland as well as the uppermost 1 m of upslope soils played a crucial role for solute concentration in the receiving streams for this study a subset of data from a small wetland stream was used as described above it was assumed that the three biogeochemical processes identified with the isomap approach prevailed in the whole catchment including the wetland site thus the cluster analysis was performed on the scores of the first three components of the moorbach stream samples rather than on the values of the 16 solutes this was done as it was recommended to perform a cluster analysis on whitened data in order to not give too much weight to parameters that were strongly correlated to each other on the other hand the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 contained chemical information from various water sources including soil solution and groundwater from upslope and wetland sites it was therefore expected that it would reflect to a larger degree processes that are more visible in other parts of the catchment like acid induced podsolization in addition results of this study can be directly related to that of the weyer et al 2014 study 2 2 1 2 cluster analysis ca a cluster analysis was performed using the scores of the first three isomap components of 280 moorbach stream water samples selected from the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 in order to group water samples that were influenced by the same biogeochemical processes fig 2 cluster analysis aims at classifying samples according to a similarity measure and a grouping algorithm agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis uses the distance between samples as a measure of similarity vega et al 1998 at different distances different clusters will form which can be represented using a dendrogram in contrast the k means clustering aims at finding the cluster centroids for a given number of clusters objects are assigned to the nearest cluster centroid by minimizing the squared distances from the latter the isomap scores of the moorbach stream water samples were first normalized to zero mean and unit variance for each component separately first a hierarchical clustering agglomerative nesting was performed fig 2 to assess an adequate number of clusters using the knee criterion dubes and jain 1979 tibshirani et al 2001 i e a compromise between a minimum number of clusters and a minimum sum of squared errors of assignment to clusters the sum of squared errors is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member of a cluster and its cluster centroid using the number of clusters found in this manner in a second step a k means clustering was performed fig 2 the centroids of each cluster and the distances between the observations and the cluster centroids were calculated observations with a smaller distance to another centroid than to the own centroid were then relocated to the other cluster in an iterative procedure the cluster analysis yielded a classification of the 280 water samples in a next step the clusters were analysed for significant differences with respect to component scores as well as to solute concentration to that end the wilcoxon test with bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used for pairwise comparison between different clusters in contrast to e g the well known t test the applied test can handle strongly differing numbers of samples per group and does not require any specific distribution level of significance was 5 in all cases the same test was used to test for significant differences between the clusters with respect to the boundary conditions of the sampling dates boundary conditions were characterized by daily mean values of discharge groundwater level precipitation air temperature and julian day of the sampling dates discharge was logarithmised after adding a constant offset of 1l s in order to avoid logarithmising of zero values precipitation was summed up for a period of 30 days before each sampling date respectively in addition a rough proxy for water residence time in the riparian wetland was used by determining the number of preceding days since the last exceedance of a discharge threshold of 1l s determination of that proxy variable was possible only for periods without data missing from the hydrograph thus part of the water samples could not be assigned a value of that proxy variable for visualization of differences between clusters box percentile plots were used they can be regarded as approximations of the probability density of the respective variable but rotated by 90 more precisely the width of the figure is proportional to the percentile of that height up to the 50th percentile above the 50th percentile the width is proportional to 100 minus the percentile thus the width at any given height is proportional to the percent of observations that are more extreme in that direction in addition the first second and third quartile is marked by horizontal lines esty and banfield 2003 2 2 2 schöller and piper classification of stream water samples to allow for comparison with standard methods of multivariate water quality visualisation stream water quality and cluster means were plotted in schöller and piper diagrams fig 2 for the schöller diagram mean values the 10th and the 90th percentiles of solute concentration of the stream water samples were plotted for each of the four clusters for the piper diagram charge equivalents of ca mg na k cl no3 so4 and hydrogencarbonate and bicarbonate hco3 and co3 2 were calculated then the percentage of each cation and anion with respect to the total sum of cations and anions respectively was calculated stream water samples assigned to the same cluster were plotted using the same symbol in order to differentiate between the four clusters 3 results 3 1 identification of clusters the appropriate number of clusters was chosen using the sum of squared errors within a group plotted against the number of clusters fig 3 at the point where the reduction of sum of squared errors with increasing number of clusters slowed down markedly this point was found at four clusters subsequently named cluster 1 to cluster 4 each of the 280 water samples was assigned to one of these four clusters 56 samples to cluster 1 101 to cluster 2 and 93 and 30 to cluster 3 and 4 respectively fig 4 gives the scores of the first three isomap components fig 5 shows the ph values electric conductivity and concentration of selected solutes for each of the four clusters different letters a b c and d denote the significantly different median values of the respective isomap component scores and the respective variables between the respective clusters in figs 4 and 5 respectively all clusters differed significantly with respect to the scores of all three components and for most of the solutes as well except for nh4 not shown scores of the first component increased systematically from cluster 1 to 4 indicating increasingly oxic conditions in contrast scores of the second component decreased systematically pointing to decreasing acid induced podsolization a different pattern was exhibited by the scores of the third component scores increased from cluster 1 to 3 and decreased for cluster 4 again fig 4 peak values for the third cluster indicated the strongest effect of weathering processes for these samples which was typical for groundwater at greater depths weyer et al 2014 these patterns were reflected by three different groups of solutes the first group comprising of electric conductivity so4 ca mg mn and s not shown exhibited an increase from cluster 1 to 4 similar to the scores of the first component the opposite was true for the second group including ph doc al and fe similar to the scores of the second component the pattern of the third component was mimicked by the third group i e by si k and no3 the same held for na and cl not shown 3 2 time series and typical boundary conditions time series of cluster assignment of the 280 stream water samples during the 2005 2007 sampling period are shown in fig 6 and were compared to that of discharge and groundwater levels in the riparian wetland in addition julian day and the respective meteorological and hydrological boundary conditions during sampling days are compared to cluster assignments in fig 7 on average samples were taken every 3 4 days however sampling intervals differed widely between one hour and 99 days partly due to the stream occasionally drying up in general assignment to clusters exhibited considerable persistency in more than 80 of all cases consecutive samples were assigned to the same cluster a systematic change of cluster occurrence before during or after runoff events could not be observed thus pronounced changes of stream water solute concentration could be ascribed in the first place to slowly modifying conditions within the wetland rather than to short term hydrological processes time series of assignment to clusters roughly followed a seasonal pattern although with considerable modification within and between the years samples taken during the first three months of the year were exclusively ascribed to cluster 3 figs 6 and 7 correspondingly air temperature during sampling was the lowest groundwater level the highest and time since last preceding discharge peak as a rough proxy for water residence time within the wetland the shortest compared to all clusters fig 7 later in the year cluster 3 was subsequently replaced by cluster 2 and then by cluster 1 fig 6 along with rising air temperature and lower groundwater level fig 7 likewise cumulative precipitation for a 30 day period was the lowest for cluster 2 correspondingly scores of the first component decreased indicating increasingly anoxic conditions groundwater level and cumulative precipitation for cluster 1 was significantly higher than for cluster 2 representing recovering of the groundwater level after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm increasing scores of the second component pointed to increasing effects of acid induced podsolization and decreasing scores of the third component to decreasing effects of weathering processes thus stream water became increasingly dissimilar compared to groundwater solute concentration four samples in early july 2005 and another 26 samples in 2006 mostly in august and october were assigned to cluster 4 fig 6 during all of these three periods groundwater level was low fig 7 but recovered from preceding extensive drawdown fig 6 correspondingly water residence time within the riparian wetland was on average the largest for cluster 4 fig 7 cumulative precipitation was intermediate in contrast to 2005 and 2006 there was no similar drawdown of groundwater level after mid may in summer 2007 and no sample was assigned to cluster 4 fig 6 although samples of cluster 4 usually followed immediately after those of cluster 1 or 2 fig 6 they differed to a maximum extent with respect to scores of components 1 and 2 fig 4 and with respect to most solutes fig 5 scores of the first and of the second component of cluster 4 compared to those of cluster 1 fig 4 indicate that this change came along with a drastic reoxidation and a strong decrease of acid induced podsolization depending on the respective hydrological conditions cluster 4 was then either rapidly replaced by cluster 1 2005 or by cluster 2 or 3 2006 fig 6 cluster occurrence did not vary between base flow and storm flow conditions as long as the water table was near the soil surface runoff events april and may 2005 january 2007 fig 6 furthermore there seemed to be no dependence of cluster occurrence on the magnitude of the runoff event for example discharge of the moorbach stream after two comparable periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown more than 20 cm was 1 76l s 1 and 20 22l s 1 in july 2005 and october 2006 respectively with a comparable cluster occurrence similarly discharge of the moorbach stream after three periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm was near 0l s 1 43 10l s 1 and 12 84l s 1 in june 2005 june 2007 and august 2007 respectively also with a comparable cluster occurrence correspondingly there was no significant difference between average discharge values for cluster 1 and 4 fig 7 the most differing clusters with respect to water chemistry figs 4 and 5 the two drying rewetting experiments conducted from august to september 2006 and from may to july 2007 in three of the six sampling plots in the wetland under study did not seem to have an influence on stream water quality indeed cluster occurrence in the moorbach stream water samples taken during and after the experiments could be explained by naturally occurring hydrological conditions 3 3 schöller and piper classification of cluster means and stream water samples all of the four clusters showed comparable patterns in the schöller diagram fig 8 highest mean concentrations were observed for so4 followed by si and na lowest mean concentrations were observed for mn and nh4 mean solute concentrations differed for the different clusters with respect to ca mg fe no3 so4 and doc corresponding to the results of the ca cluster 4 showed the highest mean so4 concentration using the piper diagram fig 9 stream water samples can be classified as sodium potassium type and as chloride to sulfate type water samples assigned to cluster 4 showed considerably higher so4 and ca but lower cl concentrations than water samples assigned to the other clusters in contrast water samples assigned to cluster 3 showed remarkably lower so4 concentrations but higher co3 2 hco3 concentrations water samples assigned to cluster 1 showed the lowest so4 concentrations but higher cl concentrations compared to the other water samples 4 discussion this study aimed at elucidating the interplay between internal biogeochemical processes in a riparian wetland and hydrological processes at the time scale of days to months the samples are regarded as representative samples of the wetland water being mobilized especially during single runoff peaks clustering necessarily implies ignoring within cluster variability and overemphasizing differences between clusters although the knee criterion applied here for selection of an adequate number of clusters is widely accepted dubes and jain 1979 tibshirani et al 2001 any clustering of a presumably more or less continuous data set is to a certain degree arbitrary consequently assignment of single samples to certain clusters can always be questioned however clustering can help identify certain structures in large data sets in this study samples were clustered based on the scores of an isomap analysis that determined the independent components each of these components had been interpreted as a quantitative measure of the strength of the effect of single processes in a preceding study weyer et al 2014 however this interpretation is not a necessary prerequisite for this study and the inferences drawn from the results as has been illustrated in fig 5 clusters can be equally well analyzed and interpreted in terms of solute concentration different clusters can be distinguished in the piper and the schöller diagrams as well figs 8 and 9 although observable differences between clusters in the two diagrams were less clear compared to the classification by the ca however in general results of the piper and schöller classification were in line with the results of the ca for example clusters 1 3 and 4 could be distinguished in the piper diagram mainly with respect to ca and so4 fig 9 the sampled stream had its only source in the wetland the wetland is a discharge area of groundwater that had been recharged further uphill partington et al 2013 this groundwater is characterized by very low scores of the second isomap component that is low acid induced podsolization and high scores of the third component indicating strong effects of weathering lischeid and bittersohl 2008 weyer et al 2014 temporal variability of these effects is very low thus taking groundwater solute concentration as a background any modification observed in the wetland stream has to be ascribed to wetland internal processes the stream was sampled roughly 50 m downstream from its source thus in stream processes do not need to be accounted for due to a very short residence time within the stream in the following the four different clusters are first discussed emphasizing the interplay between the typical biogeochemical processes represented by the clusters with the different hydrological and seasonal boundary conditions respectively corresponding to the results section clusters are discussed in chronological order of occurrence during the course of the year then implications for the temporal variability of stream water chemistry during runoff events and for the temporal patterns of single solutes in the moorbach stream water are discussed 4 1 cluster 3 discharging unaltered groundwater in winter and early spring when the temperatures and the microbial activity are low only cluster 3 was observed fig 6 anoxic redox processes first component seemed to play a minor role reflected by low negative mean component scores although the wetland is completely water saturated due to low evapotranspiration obviously microbial oxygen consumption and subsequent reduction of the redox potential in the wetland was very low in winter and early spring due to low temperatures and did hardly alter the quality of the groundwater discharging into the wetland stream in addition residence time of water within the wetland was the shortest for samples of cluster 3 fig 7 which adds to the effect of slow kinetics of biogeochemical processes during the winter months correspondingly the highest no3 and relatively high so4 and doc values were observed in the schöller diagram fig 8 4 2 clusters 2 and 1 enhanced microbial activity and anoxic conditions cluster 2 ranges between cluster 3 and 1 with respect to all isomap components and to all solutes figs 4 and 5 in the piper diagram as well cluster 2 is placed between cluster 3 and cluster 1 fig 9 cluster 2 is considered a transitional stage between the two this holds for the temporal order of cluster occurrence as well although with some minor exceptions fig 6 thus both clusters are discussed in a common section simultaneously with rising temperatures in spring and early summer cluster 3 was subsequently replaced by clusters 2 and 1 in every year of the study period figs 6 and 7 rising air and soil temperature likely led to a considerable increase of microbial activity and thus to more rapid kinetics of the respective processes on the other hand increasing transpiration lowered the groundwater level in the wetland and thus decreased the frequency of runoff peaks the data of another riparian wetland in the lehstenbach catchment presented by frei et al 2010 illustrated the relationship between groundwater level and discharge decreasing frequency of runoff events in turn resulted in increased mean residence time of water within the wetland figs 6 and 7 thus the effects of microbial activity became even more pronounced consequently oxygen depletion set in and the scores of the first isomap component decreased indicating increasingly anoxic conditions as was observed in other studies as well kull et al 2008 olivie lauquet et al 2001 please note that scores of that component reflect conditions in the wetland rather than conditions in the wetland stream which in fact was oxic due to being exposed to the atmosphere instead very low no3 and so4 concentrations in stream water samples fig 5 were indicative of denitrification and desulphurication in the wetland anaerobic mineralization could be stimulated by regeneration of electron acceptors due to frequent fluctuations in the water table and thus drought and rewetting events blodau and moore 2003 deppe et al 2010 knorr et al 2008 knorr et al 2009 such fluctuations were observed within the uppermost 15 cm in the wetland of the study site during the period of august to september 2007 when most of the samples were ascribed to cluster 1 correspondingly on average the highest cumulative precipitation for a 30 day period as well as a higher groundwater level for cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 was observed because so4 was by far the dominating anion concentration of alkaline earth cations and of mn in the stream decreased as well fig 5 contrary to common expectations mn concentration in the lehstenbach catchment is obviously more closely related to ionic strength rather than to redox processes lischeid and bittersohl 2008 similarly increasing mn concentration with increasing redox potential was observed by frohne et al 2011 in soils instead of the expected precipitation of mn oxides presumably due to an equally low ph as in this study and to precipitation of mn sulphides increasing residence time increased the effect of other biogeochemical processes in the wetland as well these processes are not necessarily related to temperature clusters 2 and 1 exhibited enhanced effects of acid induced podsolization processes higher mean scores of the second component and al releasing weathering reactions lower mean scores of the third component discharging to the moorbach stream when compared to cluster 3 similar observations were found by olivie lauquet et al 2001 they suggest that the microorganisms which use soil iron and manganese oxy hydroxides as electron acceptors catalyzed the change of redox conditions and induced an increase of doc concentration the close relationship between fe reducing conditions and doc release corresponds to the findings of knorr 2012 at the wetland site of our study and with the results of lambert et al 2013 concomitantly trace elements like al adsorbed to the fe hydr oxides are released stumm and sulzberger 1992 trolard et al 1995 these processes likely produce a chemical composition of water samples similar to that produced by acid induced podsolization processes associated with the second component and likely add to the latter in addition the enhanced podsolization processes in the wetland compared to cluster 3 could be explained by aeration of the top of the small hummocks in the wetland cf frei et al 2010 in fact the top of the small hummocks were water saturated during both the snowmelt period and single rainstorms and subsequently fell dry leading to a chemical signature comparable to that of the soil solution at upslope sites as was observed for the uppermost soil layer in another wetland of the same catchment lischeid et al 2007 with respect to the third component a high affinity of al for doc has been demonstrated in numerous studies helmer et al 1990 kerr et al 2008 olivie lauquet et al 2001 szkokan emilson et al 2013 in waters with doc 15 mg l 1 as was the case for the wetland and the moorbach stream in our study up to 100 of total al was present as humate complexes viers et al 1997 thus decomposition of these humate al complexes could have resulted in a seasonally variable export of both doc and trace elements like al from wetlands to streams higher al concentration in stream water due to higher microbial activity in summer was also observed by other authors muller and tankéré muller 2012 to summarize clusters 1 and 2 seem to represent wetland waters discharging into the moorbach stream influenced by more pronounced biogeochemical processes as compared to those influencing cluster 3 in spring and early summer this pattern was reflected in the schöller classification mainly by decreasing no3 so4 and doc and also by increasing fe concentration fig 8 4 3 cluster 4 rewetting after extensive groundwater level drawdown cluster 4 was observed after periods of extended groundwater level drawdown by more than 20 cm in summer and autumn samples taken in early july 2005 august and october 2006 fig 6 the significant lower groundwater level and a significant lower antecedent cumulative precipitation 30 days period seemed to be the most important differences as compared to cluster 1 because there were no significant differences between these two clusters with respect to discharge air temperature and residence time for the sampling dates fig 7 in spite of that the hydrochemical status in terms of the scores of the first two isomap components and of most solutes figs 4 and 5 differed the most between these two clusters which was reflected in the schöller and piper classification as well figs 8 and 9 in 2007 not a single stream water sample was assigned to cluster 4 although a similar drawdown of the groundwater level occurred in 2007 when compared to 2005 and 2006 however groundwater drawdown and subsequent rewetting in 2007 occurred in early may i e much earlier in the course of the year when compared to 2005 and 2006 this might indicate that microbial activity in april and in early may 2007 might not have been high enough to provide the conditions necessary for generating the stream water quality of cluster 4 obviously memory effects have to be taken into account here moorbach stream water samples characterized by this cluster reflected wetland water being highly influenced by oxic conditions high scores of the first component i e high no3 and so4 concentration low fe concentration and by acidifying effects of historical so4 deposition low scores of the second component i e low doc and fe concentration high so4 and na concentration concurrently a low influence of cation exchange or silicate weathering was observed low scores of the third component the results of the piper and schöller classification were in line with these findings figs 8 and 9 similar observations after drought periods were made e g by lamers et al 1998 szkokan emilson et al 2013 and watmough et al 2016 water level drawdown during drought periods can lead to oxidation of nitrogen n sulphur s and iron fe species and to the concomitant release of protons in the upper soil layers in the wetland consequently the upper soil layers can be acidified oxidized species like so4 and no3 could accumulate during the dry period in the upper soil layers and would be washed out during heavy rainstorms bechtold et al 2003 dillon and lazerte 1992 eimers et al 2007 szkokan emilson et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 reoxidation of reduced s species was demonstrated for the wetland site in the lehstenbach catchment alewell et al 2006 oxidizable sulphur originating from historical so4 deposition can lead to intensified acidification the wetland receives anoxic groundwater from intermittent seeps and fens resulting in high amounts of fe in the upper soil layers küsel and alewell 2004 in areas with a large fe pool in the soil historical so4 deposition strongly enhances fesx storage an increased pool of fesx stimulates drought related soil acidification which influences the ph and causes an increase of potentially toxic metals like al in pore water lamers et al 1998 this relationship between acidification and al release has been extensively investigated e g smolders et al 2006 szkokan emilson et al 2013 tipping et al 2003 watmough and orlovskaya 2015 and was in line with the high influence of al releasing weathering reactions found for cluster 4 4 4 role of hydrological processes in more than 80 of all cases consecutive samples were assigned to the same cluster pointing to rather stable biogeochemical conditions and only minor effects of hydrological processes in the short term i e within single stormflow events this is in striking contrast to pronounced short term chemical responses during stormflows observed in other streams of the catchment lischeid and bittersohl 2008 lischeid et al 2002 strohmeier et al 2013 however in contrast to those streams there is no well buffered deep groundwater recharging the wetland stream that could be mixed in varying portions with near surface runoff in winter spring and early summer runoff peaks did not change the cluster occurrence i e the moorbach stream water quality this was true for a wide range of hydrological boundary conditions in the wetland i e during water saturation conditions april may 2005 january 2007 april 2007 and after periods of extensive water level drawdown 20 cm april 2007 fig 6 once the water level had recovered to complete saturation thus the magnitude of discharge and base flow or storm flow conditions seemed to play a negligible role as illustrated by the wide range of discharge during sampling for clusters 1 2 and 3 fig 7 this observation pointed to rather stable chemical conditions in the wetland due to low microbial activity which was in line with the results of olivie lauquet et al 2001 runoff events after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm in summer and autumn did not have a systematic influence on the cluster occurrence during or after the event on stream water quality in some events a shift from either cluster 2 to cluster 1 or vice versa with a quick shift back was observed thus precipitation events after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown can result in a decline or a peak of solute concentration of only short duration in contrast stormflow after periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown more than 20 cm in summer and autumn systematically induced cluster changes from either cluster 2 or 3 to cluster 4 i e a substantial change of the stream water chemistry due to flushing of solutes that accumulated during the preceding drought period cluster 4 was observed for up to 28 days or longer after the precipitation event thus extensive drought periods seem to have generated a high no3 and so4 export from the wetland to the moorbach stream despite reduced sulphur deposition combined with al release these non linear relationships between biogeochemical and hydrological processes have to be taken into account to produce reliable predictions of solute export with hydrochemical models used for water management purposes especially with regard to the expected increasing frequency of drought periods due to climate change the residence time of the water seems to play an important role for the biogeochemical transformation within the wetland indeed biogeochemical transformation rates are discussed to depend on the ratio between residence and reaction time scales oldham et al 2013 this needs to be taken into account with regard to the impact of wetlands on water quality in the receiving streams 4 5 implications for single solutes the interplay between the hydrological boundary conditions and the biogeochemical processes in the wetland via the microbial activity in the wetland turned out to determine the different types of moorbach stream water samples this interplay will be demonstrated below for no3 positively correlated with the first isomap component doc and so4 positively and negatively correlated with the second isomap component respectively and al negatively correlated with the third isomap component no3 concentration usually follows the annual cycle of water table depth with a spring maximum and an autumn minimum aubert et al 2013a prior and johnes 2002 sponseller et al 2014 however no3 export in our catchment showed a much more complex pattern this was presumably due to the interplay between water table position and microbial activity as reflected by the change from cluster 3 to cluster 2 no3 export decreased from april to may 2005 although the water table remained near the soil surface figs 5 and 6 likely due to enhanced microbial activity no3 concentration near the detection limit represented by cluster 1 was not limited to autumn runoff events as observed by prior and johnes 2002 but occurred e g in june or august due to enhanced microbial activity during periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown in the wetland fig 6 and consequently longer water residence time fig 7 periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown cluster 4 however led to no3 concentrations similar to those in early summer cluster 2 even in the autumn months fig 6 similarly lupon et al 2016 observed that no3 release from riparian wetlands was correlated with riparian evapotranspiration thus the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes has important implications for estimating the effect of wetlands for no3 retention and its no3 removing capacity and has to be taken into account in water management strategies doc peaks in storm flow were ascribed to near surface runoff during storms hagedorn et al 2000 hornberger et al 1994 inamdar et al 2011 mitchell et al 2006 i e in the layer of highest doc production cole et al 2002 in the wetland studied here however doc concentration in runoff showed high variation although runoff was generated mainly in the topsoil layer the highest doc concentration was found for stream water samples represented by cluster 1 followed by those represented by cluster 2 fig 5 cluster 1 was characterized by discharge of wetland waters with the highest influence of anoxic redox processes followed by cluster 2 fig 4 in contrast declining doc concentration and high so4 concentration occurred after periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown as reflected by the shift to cluster 4 runoff events beginning in july 2005 august september and october 2006 fig 6 despite the water table rising up to the soil surface and topsoil water discharging to the moorbach stream in fact during phases of high water tables iron reduction was favoured and led to a concomitant doc release in contrast during drought periods doc concentration declined in the pore waters of the riparian wetland under study knorr 2012 and elsewhere juckers and watmough 2014 a pattern inverse to that for doc was observed for so4 knorr 2012 these observations for the pore waters seem to be reflected in the moorbach stream water samples as well indicating that solute export from the wetland to the moorbach stream depends on the antecedent moisture conditions controlling biogeochemical processes like redox reactions in the wetland it is remarkable that a corresponding anticorrelation between the historical so4 deposition and doc has been found elsewhere ledesma et al 2016 and on a larger scale monteith et al 2007 a positive correlation between al concentration and discharge was described in several studies kirchner 2003 piatek et al 2009 stutter et al 2001 however in our study no such correlation could be observed aluminum concentration differed significantly between clusters 1 and 4 fig 5 although discharge did not fig 7 in addition clusters 1 and 3 represented the highest and the lowest al concentration coming along with low and high discharge values respectively the al concentration increased from cluster 3 to cluster 1 figs 5 and 8 i e from winter to the summer months following a seasonal pattern rather than discharge patterns a similar seasonal pattern was observed by muller and tankéré muller 2012 and was related to higher microbial activity in summer thus biogeochemical conditions related to water table position and season rather than discharge were essential for al release to the moorbach stream consequently in catchments with a high proportion of wetland area high al concentration can be expected not only episodically during runoff peaks after drought periods but over a longer period during the summer months higher air temperatures due to climate change will likely amplify al release from wetlands to streams with consequences for water management strategies 5 conclusions a cluster analysis of water quality data from a small stream draining a riparian wetland helped better understand the interplay between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the wetland cluster analysis allowed a more detailed classification then the general classification using the piper and schöller diagrams solute export seemed to depend on the interplay between water table position and seasonally varying biological activity and thus varying biogeochemical conditions in the wetland temporal variability of stream water quality during single runoff events was negligible minimum biological activity and short residence time in the wetland hardly altered the quality of the groundwater that discharged into the stream during the dormant season in contrast increasing biological activity and increasing residence time in spring and summer had a major impact on wetland and stream water quality periods with extensive groundwater level drawdown of more than 20 cm and subsequent rewetting led to a substantial increase of solute concentration and load no3 so4 na al that lasted for up to 28 days or longer however that effect seemed to depend crucially on the intensity of microbial activity during the preceding period of groundwater level drawdown pointing to a substantial biogeochemical memory effect similar results are expected with respect to the cluster analysis for catchments with comparable geology climate land use and wetland proportion i e for catchments with comparable biogeochemical processes and residence time in the wetland however each factor or process influencing the biogeochemical processes in a catchment like another geology or land use can also influence the results of the cluster analysis in addition further research would be required to investigate the effect of different catchment sizes on the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes in order to improve the understanding of biogeochemical and hydrological dynamics on different scales of interest it is concluded that biological activity in the riparian wetland interacting with water table dynamics proved to be a primary determinant of stream water quality and solute export these non linear relationships should be taken into account in biogeochemical modelling for improving predictions of stream water chemistry in water resources management more than a shift of annual mean values single dry and warm periods are likely to predominate the dynamics and thus limit the retention capacity of wetlands and enhance solute export to the streams a sound understanding of these dynamics is a necessary prerequisite for assessing the impact of both climate and land use change on stream water quality nutrient export

7139,riparian wetlands as both hydrological and biogeochemical hot spots often have a major impact on the release of solutes from headwater catchments numerous studies give some evidence of a rather complex interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes that is still poorly understood this study seeks to address this challenge using a multivariate solute concentration data set from a small riparian headwater wetland first a non linear variant of the principal component analysis isomap was performed in a preceding study to identify prevailing biogeochemical processes controlling water chemistry second the scores of the components of the stream draining the wetland were subjected to a cluster analysis to identify typical biogeochemical patterns for different biogeochemical and hydrological boundary conditions four different clusters could be identified which roughly followed a seasonal pattern although modified by hydrological boundary conditions in the short term during the first three months of the year cluster 3 prevailed indicating a discharge of rather unaltered shallow to mean depth groundwater cluster 3 was increasingly replaced by cluster 2 and then subsequently by cluster 1 indicating increasingly anoxic conditions increasing denitrification and desulphurization and increasing decomposition of organic carbon reflecting increasing biological activity and increasing water residence time within the wetland however stream water during stormflow after extended periods of low groundwater level in the second half of the growth season exhibited a very distinct pattern represented by the fourth cluster it indicated strong oxic conditions causing enhanced oxidation of sulphides a corresponding decrease in ph values and a substantial increase in the concentration of alkaline earth ions manganese and in electric conductivity during the dry period it is concluded that temporal variations in stream water chemistry clearly reflected the intensity of biological activity in the wetland interacting with water table dynamics our results provide strong evidence for major effects of single extreme events like drought periods which are expected to become more frequent because of climate change keywords stream water chemistry solute export riparian wetland biogeochemistry seasonality cluster analysis 1 introduction riparian wetlands are transition zones between the unsaturated zone groundwater and surface water casey and klaine 2001 zhao et al 2009 and are characterized by substantial nutrient and contaminant retention capacities fisher and acreman 2004 solute concentration in wetland groundwater and adjacent streams often exhibits remarkable temporal and spatial variance due to varying contributions of soil solution shallow and deep groundwater as well as highly heterogeneous patterns of biological and hydrochemical processes within the respective catchment e g emmett et al 1994 kerr et al 2008 kull et al 2008 processes in the riparian wetlands often superimpose the influence of the hill slope area of the catchment upon surface water quality hooper 2001 o brien et al 2013 piatek et al 2009 prior and johnes 2002 a change in biogeochemical processes in the riparian wetlands e g because of increasing intensity and frequency of hydrological extreme events long dry periods heavy rainstorms predicted to become more frequent because of climate change will thus be likely to affect stream water quality directly emmett et al 1994 kull et al 2008 szkokan emilson et al 2013 watmough and orlovskaya 2015 the importance of storm events for solute export has been documented in numerous studies mitchell et al 2006 neal et al 2006 raymond and saiers 2010 ulen 1995 especially in small catchments a significant amount of annual stream runoff occurs during single runoff events accompanied by a change of surface water quality within a few hours kirchner 2003 systematic shifts of stream water solute concentration during stormflow periods were often ascribed to hydrological processes like changes in water flow paths christophersen et al 1982 davies et al 1992 hagedorn et al 2000 lyon et al 2011 the latter may be due to changes in riparian wetland water table depth leading to different types of runoff events bechtold et al 2003 emmett et al 1994 inamdar et al 2008 kerr et al 2008 this approach implies that the chemical composition within a single water flow path does not change with regard to time and space which presumably holds only at the time scale of single stormflow periods consequently the processes causing chemical signatures in runoff are still poorly understood aubert et al 2013b dhillon and inamdar 2014 kirchner 2003 in contrast to this hydrological perspective biogeochemists study wetland processes at the time scale of weeks or months and tend to ignore changing hydrological conditions and boundary fluxes with the exception of changing groundwater levels the focus of those studies is on internal processes and not on relating them to output fluxes via the discharging stream knorr et al 2009 pennington and watmough 2015 reiche et al 2009 thus little is known about the interplay between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in riparian wetlands so far various studies have provided anecdotal evidence sulphate e g was found to be exported episodically after summer droughts due to oxidation of reduced sulphur s compounds eimers et al 2007 inamdar et al 2008 tipping et al 2003 zhang et al 2010 the modelling study by frei et al 2012 illustrated how small scale spatial heterogeneity of flow paths and biogeochemical processes could yield a complex pattern of stream solute concentration during stormflow various studies elucidated the interplay between hydrological and biogeochemical processes affecting solute export from riparian wetlands arnold et al 2015 piatek et al 2009 vidon et al 2014 including fluctuating climatic conditions kull et al 2008 seasonal factors muller and tankéré muller 2012 including seasonal hydrologic events kerr et al 2008 changes in the water flow pathways christophersen et al 1982 kerr et al 2008 mitchell et al 2006 antecedent moisture

flushing of solutes after drought periods emmett et al 1994 szkokan emilson et al 2013 aubert et al 2013b investigated seasonal patterns of flood induced variability in stream water chemistry by using a probabilistic clustering method inamdar et al 2013 highlighted the need to recognize temporal shifts in the end member chemistry as a function of catchment wetness to better characterize catchment flow paths and mixing responses knorr 2012 emphasized the importance of both hydrological and redox conditions in the wetlands for solute export in the catchment of this study water resources management must consider spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical and hydrological processes for assessing the impact of climate and land use change on solute export management practices are often based on results from biogeochemical modelling however non linear interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in catchments render the understanding and prediction of long term behaviour of surface water quality difficult thus the objective of this study was to elucidate the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes and to weight their respective relevance with regard to water quality in the receiving stream it was hypothesized that the temporal patterns of wetland stream water chemistry were not related to changes in hydrological flow paths but that stream water chemistry reflected varying antecedent biogeochemical boundary conditions in the wetland however it was assumed that biogeochemical processes in the wetland were affected by the groundwater level which determined the degree of anoxia in the uppermost soil layer this study builds upon a preceding study by weyer et al 2014 prevailing biogeochemical processes in the lehstenbach catchment were identified in a comprehensive data set comprising soil solution groundwater spring water and stream water solute concentration data from upslope and wetland sites using the isomap approach isometric feature mapping tenenbaum et al 2000 isomap can be considered a non linear variant of principal component analysis pca as different observables of the multivariate water quality data set exhibited numerous although partly non linear relationships a large fraction of the variance could be represented by a small number of isomap components as these components were independent they were used to identify the prevailing biogeochemical processes in addition the component scores were used as a proxy for quantifying the intensities of the respective biogeochemical processes this study focused on a subset of the data set used by weyer et al 2014 comprising data from 280 samples taken in a stream that drained a small wetland in the lehstenbach catchment in addition to solute concentration values the isomap component scores of the samples as a quantitative assessment of the intensity of the prevailing processes were included this study aims at a better understanding of the observed pronounced temporal variability of stream water quality i e at differentiating between biogeochemical and hydrological drivers to that end a cluster analysis ca was used to classify stream water samples as that classification was based on the scores of the independent isomap components it does not only solve the problem of collinearity as is often recommended fröhlich et al 2008 menció and mas pla 2008 woocay and walton 2008 moreover it allowed interpreting the clusters in terms of intensities of identified biogeochemical processes which would not be possible by using solute concentration data a time series of cluster assignment of the stream water samples was related to the respective meteorological and hydrological boundary conditions and conclusions were drawn with respect to the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes in addition the classification of stream water samples was compared to the well known schöller and piper classification of water samples piper 1944 schoeller 1962 finally implications for explaining temporal patterns of single solutes in stream water quality are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 data the current investigation involved samples of a wetland stream within the lehstenbach watershed 50 08 n and 11 52 e in the fichtelgebirge mountains in southeast germany extensive monitoring programs have been run in this catchment since the end of the 1980s including several studies on groundwater and stream water chemistry the watershed area is 4 19 km2 and elevation ranges from 690 to 877 m a s l fig 1 the bedrock consists of variscan granite of two different facies stettner 1964 which show very similar mineralogical compositions significant differences between the two facies with respect to geochemistry weyer et al 2008 or hydrogeology partington et al 2013 have not been observed the thickness of the regolith is up to 40 m and more dystric cambisols and podzols predominate in the riparian zone fibric histosols and dystric gleysols are present representing about one third of the watershed area the area is drained by a dense network of natural streams and artificial channels dense norway spruce stands picea abies cover more than 95 of the watershed area annual mean air temperature is 5 8 c annual mean precipitation is between 950 and 1250 mm annual mean runoff of the lehstenbach stream i e the catchment outlet was 470 mm during the period from 1991 to 2001 lischeid et al 2010 snowpack usually develops in december or january and final snowmelt occurs in march or april the site has been severely impacted by sulphate deposition that peaked in the 1970s and has decreased by more than 80 since then matzner et al 2004 this study focused on the ephemeral moorbach stream that drains the slightly acidic schlöppnerbrunnen fen later referred to as wetland near the catchment outlet fig 1 the fen area is 0 08 km2 the thickness of the peat layer on top of the mineral soil ranges between 30 and 70 cm reiche et al 2009 the runoff of the moorbach stream is exclusively composed of wetland waters i e by waters that originate in the wetland or by groundwater that has passed through the wetland area discharge of the moorbach stream was between 0 and 4l s during most of the study period during discharge peaks up to 439l s were observed three plots of 7 2 m 5 m each were subjected to two drying rewetting experiments from august to september 2006 and from may to july 2007 for more details see reiche et al 2009 the rest of the wetland was not manipulated more than 600 stream water samples from the moorbach stream were taken between april 2005 and november 2007 with an isco automatic sampler at daily intervals no samples could be taken during the frost period or when the moorbach stream fell dry samples were filled in thoroughly rinsed polyethylene bottles in the automatic sampler the filled bottles were at least collected every three weeks and directly transported to the central laboratory of the bayreuth center of ecology and ecological research bayceer in all collected samples electric conductivity ec and ph values were measured directly after collection with a tetracon 325 conductivity cell wtw and with a sentix 41 3 electrode wtw respectively initially from april to june 2005 daily stream water samples were analysed afterwards only samples taken during runoff events were selected according to stream discharge and electric conductivity values in total 280 stream water samples were selected to be analysed as described below selected water samples were filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane filter with 0 45 µm pore size they were stored in thoroughly rinsed polyethylene bottles in the dark at 2 c until further

cluster analysis was performed with the package cluster maechler et al 2007 the packages hmisc harrell et al 2014 multcompview graves et al 2012 and hydrogeo english 2017 were used to produce the graphics 2 2 1 statistical analysis different non linear multivariate statistical methods were used sequentially to analyse water solution data a global flowchart of the different steps of statistical analysis is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 1 preceding analysis of water quality data the data set used for this study is a subset of the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 comprising soil solution groundwater spring water and stream water samples from various sites within the catchment including upslope soils weyer et al 2014 applied a non linear version of a principal component analysis the isometric feature mapping isomap approach to the original data set in order to identify the prevailing biogeochemical hot spots along different subsurface flow paths from the soil surface to the catchment outlet the approach reduced the dimensionality of the original data set comprising 1686 single samples with 16 parameters each down to three components fig 2 the three components explained 89 of the total variance 48 30 and 11 respectively the first component was positively correlated with so4 no3 mn k mg and ca concentrations and electric conductivity but was negatively correlated with fe and si concentrations and ph values the second component was associated with high doc fe and al concentrations but low so4 and na concentrations and low ph values the third component was characterized by positive loadings of cl si nh4 k na and ph values and negative loadings of al and so4 the first component was ascribed to redox processes the second to acid induced podsolization and the third to weathering processes in the subsurface weyer et al 2014 every sample of the data set was assigned a score of the respective components as a quantitative measure for the strength of the respective effects on that water sample it could be shown that for all three components the uppermost 10 cm of the riparian wetland as well as the uppermost 1 m of upslope soils played a crucial role for solute concentration in the receiving streams for this study a subset of data from a small wetland stream was used as described above it was assumed that the three biogeochemical processes identified with the isomap approach prevailed in the whole catchment including the wetland site thus the cluster analysis was performed on the scores of the first three components of the moorbach stream samples rather than on the values of the 16 solutes this was done as it was recommended to perform a cluster analysis on whitened data in order to not give too much weight to parameters that were strongly correlated to each other on the other hand the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 contained chemical information from various water sources including soil solution and groundwater from upslope and wetland sites it was therefore expected that it would reflect to a larger degree processes that are more visible in other parts of the catchment like acid induced podsolization in addition results of this study can be directly related to that of the weyer et al 2014 study 2 2 1 2 cluster analysis ca a cluster analysis was performed using the scores of the first three isomap components of 280 moorbach stream water samples selected from the original data set used by weyer et al 2014 in order to group water samples that were influenced by the same biogeochemical processes fig 2 cluster analysis aims at classifying samples according to a similarity measure and a grouping algorithm agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis uses the distance between samples as a measure of similarity vega et al 1998 at different distances different clusters will form which can be represented using a dendrogram in contrast the k means clustering aims at finding the cluster centroids for a given number of clusters objects are assigned to the nearest cluster centroid by minimizing the squared distances from the latter the isomap scores of the moorbach stream water samples were first normalized to zero mean and unit variance for each component separately first a hierarchical clustering agglomerative nesting was performed fig 2 to assess an adequate number of clusters using the knee criterion dubes and jain 1979 tibshirani et al 2001 i e a compromise between a minimum number of clusters and a minimum sum of squared errors of assignment to clusters the sum of squared errors is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member of a cluster and its cluster centroid using the number of clusters found in this manner in a second step a k means clustering was performed fig 2 the centroids of each cluster and the distances between the observations and the cluster centroids were calculated observations with a smaller distance to another centroid than to the own centroid were then relocated to the other cluster in an iterative procedure the cluster analysis yielded a classification of the 280 water samples in a next step the clusters were analysed for significant differences with respect to component scores as well as to solute concentration to that end the wilcoxon test with bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used for pairwise comparison between different clusters in contrast to e g the well known t test the applied test can handle strongly differing numbers of samples per group and does not require any specific distribution level of significance was 5 in all cases the same test was used to test for significant differences between the clusters with respect to the boundary conditions of the sampling dates boundary conditions were characterized by daily mean values of discharge groundwater level precipitation air temperature and julian day of the sampling dates discharge was logarithmised after adding a constant offset of 1l s in order to avoid logarithmising of zero values precipitation was summed up for a period of 30 days before each sampling date respectively in addition a rough proxy for water residence time in the riparian wetland was used by determining the number of preceding days since the last exceedance of a discharge threshold of 1l s determination of that proxy variable was possible only for periods without data missing from the hydrograph thus part of the water samples could not be assigned a value of that proxy variable for visualization of differences between clusters box percentile plots were used they can be regarded as approximations of the probability density of the respective variable but rotated by 90 more precisely the width of the figure is proportional to the percentile of that height up to the 50th percentile above the 50th percentile the width is proportional to 100 minus the percentile thus the width at any given height is proportional to the percent of observations that are more extreme in that direction in addition the first second and third quartile is marked by horizontal lines esty and banfield 2003 2 2 2 schöller and piper classification of stream water samples to allow for comparison with standard methods of multivariate water quality visualisation stream water quality and cluster means were plotted in schöller and piper diagrams fig 2 for the schöller diagram mean values the 10th and the 90th percentiles of solute concentration of the stream water samples were plotted for each of the four clusters for the piper diagram charge equivalents of ca mg na k cl no3 so4 and hydrogencarbonate and bicarbonate hco3 and co3 2 were calculated then the percentage of each cation and anion with respect to the total sum of cations and anions respectively was calculated stream water samples assigned to the same cluster were plotted using the same symbol in order to differentiate between the four clusters 3 results 3 1 identification of clusters the appropriate number of clusters was chosen using the sum of squared errors within a group plotted against the number of clusters fig 3 at the point where the reduction of sum of squared errors with increasing number of clusters slowed down markedly this point was found at four clusters subsequently named cluster 1 to cluster 4 each of the 280 water samples was assigned to one of these four clusters 56 samples to cluster 1 101 to cluster 2 and 93 and 30 to cluster 3 and 4 respectively fig 4 gives the scores of the first three isomap components fig 5 shows the ph values electric conductivity and concentration of selected solutes for each of the four clusters different letters a b c and d denote the significantly different median values of the respective isomap component scores and the respective variables between the respective clusters in figs 4 and 5 respectively all clusters differed significantly with respect to the scores of all three components and for most of the solutes as well except for nh4 not shown scores of the first component increased systematically from cluster 1 to 4 indicating increasingly oxic conditions in contrast scores of the second component decreased systematically pointing to decreasing acid induced podsolization a different pattern was exhibited by the scores of the third component scores increased from cluster 1 to 3 and decreased for cluster 4 again fig 4 peak values for the third cluster indicated the strongest effect of weathering processes for these samples which was typical for groundwater at greater depths weyer et al 2014 these patterns were reflected by three different groups of solutes the first group comprising of electric conductivity so4 ca mg mn and s not shown exhibited an increase from cluster 1 to 4 similar to the scores of the first component the opposite was true for the second group including ph doc al and fe similar to the scores of the second component the pattern of the third component was mimicked by the third group i e by si k and no3 the same held for na and cl not shown 3 2 time series and typical boundary conditions time series of cluster assignment of the 280 stream water samples during the 2005 2007 sampling period are shown in fig 6 and were compared to that of discharge and groundwater levels in the riparian wetland in addition julian day and the respective meteorological and hydrological boundary conditions during sampling days are compared to cluster assignments in fig 7 on average samples were taken every 3 4 days however sampling intervals differed widely between one hour and 99 days partly due to the stream occasionally drying up in general assignment to clusters exhibited considerable persistency in more than 80 of all cases consecutive samples were assigned to the same cluster a systematic change of cluster occurrence before during or after runoff events could not be observed thus pronounced changes of stream water solute concentration could be ascribed in the first place to slowly modifying conditions within the wetland rather than to short term hydrological processes time series of assignment to clusters roughly followed a seasonal pattern although with considerable modification within and between the years samples taken during the first three months of the year were exclusively ascribed to cluster 3 figs 6 and 7 correspondingly air temperature during sampling was the lowest groundwater level the highest and time since last preceding discharge peak as a rough proxy for water residence time within the wetland the shortest compared to all clusters fig 7 later in the year cluster 3 was subsequently replaced by cluster 2 and then by cluster 1 fig 6 along with rising air temperature and lower groundwater level fig 7 likewise cumulative precipitation for a 30 day period was the lowest for cluster 2 correspondingly scores of the first component decreased indicating increasingly anoxic conditions groundwater level and cumulative precipitation for cluster 1 was significantly higher than for cluster 2 representing recovering of the groundwater level after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm increasing scores of the second component pointed to increasing effects of acid induced podsolization and decreasing scores of the third component to decreasing effects of weathering processes thus stream water became increasingly dissimilar compared to groundwater solute concentration four samples in early july 2005 and another 26 samples in 2006 mostly in august and october were assigned to cluster 4 fig 6 during all of these three periods groundwater level was low fig 7 but recovered from preceding extensive drawdown fig 6 correspondingly water residence time within the riparian wetland was on average the largest for cluster 4 fig 7 cumulative precipitation was intermediate in contrast to 2005 and 2006 there was no similar drawdown of groundwater level after mid may in summer 2007 and no sample was assigned to cluster 4 fig 6 although samples of cluster 4 usually followed immediately after those of cluster 1 or 2 fig 6 they differed to a maximum extent with respect to scores of components 1 and 2 fig 4 and with respect to most solutes fig 5 scores of the first and of the second component of cluster 4 compared to those of cluster 1 fig 4 indicate that this change came along with a drastic reoxidation and a strong decrease of acid induced podsolization depending on the respective hydrological conditions cluster 4 was then either rapidly replaced by cluster 1 2005 or by cluster 2 or 3 2006 fig 6 cluster occurrence did not vary between base flow and storm flow conditions as long as the water table was near the soil surface runoff events april and may 2005 january 2007 fig 6 furthermore there seemed to be no dependence of cluster occurrence on the magnitude of the runoff event for example discharge of the moorbach stream after two comparable periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown more than 20 cm was 1 76l s 1 and 20 22l s 1 in july 2005 and october 2006 respectively with a comparable cluster occurrence similarly discharge of the moorbach stream after three periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm was near 0l s 1 43 10l s 1 and 12 84l s 1 in june 2005 june 2007 and august 2007 respectively also with a comparable cluster occurrence correspondingly there was no significant difference between average discharge values for cluster 1 and 4 fig 7 the most differing clusters with respect to water chemistry figs 4 and 5 the two drying rewetting experiments conducted from august to september 2006 and from may to july 2007 in three of the six sampling plots in the wetland under study did not seem to have an influence on stream water quality indeed cluster occurrence in the moorbach stream water samples taken during and after the experiments could be explained by naturally occurring hydrological conditions 3 3 schöller and piper classification of cluster means and stream water samples all of the four clusters showed comparable patterns in the schöller diagram fig 8 highest mean concentrations were observed for so4 followed by si and na lowest mean concentrations were observed for mn and nh4 mean solute concentrations differed for the different clusters with respect to ca mg fe no3 so4 and doc corresponding to the results of the ca cluster 4 showed the highest mean so4 concentration using the piper diagram fig 9 stream water samples can be classified as sodium potassium type and as chloride to sulfate type water samples assigned to cluster 4 showed considerably higher so4 and ca but lower cl concentrations than water samples assigned to the other clusters in contrast water samples assigned to cluster 3 showed remarkably lower so4 concentrations but higher co3 2 hco3 concentrations water samples assigned to cluster 1 showed the lowest so4 concentrations but higher cl concentrations compared to the other water samples 4 discussion this study aimed at elucidating the interplay between internal biogeochemical processes in a riparian wetland and hydrological processes at the time scale of days to months the samples are regarded as representative samples of the wetland water being mobilized especially during single runoff peaks clustering necessarily implies ignoring within cluster variability and overemphasizing differences between clusters although the knee criterion applied here for selection of an adequate number of clusters is widely accepted dubes and jain 1979 tibshirani et al 2001 any clustering of a presumably more or less continuous data set is to a certain degree arbitrary consequently assignment of single samples to certain clusters can always be questioned however clustering can help identify certain structures in large data sets in this study samples were clustered based on the scores of an isomap analysis that determined the independent components each of these components had been interpreted as a quantitative measure of the strength of the effect of single processes in a preceding study weyer et al 2014 however this interpretation is not a necessary prerequisite for this study and the inferences drawn from the results as has been illustrated in fig 5 clusters can be equally well analyzed and interpreted in terms of solute concentration different clusters can be distinguished in the piper and the schöller diagrams as well figs 8 and 9 although observable differences between clusters in the two diagrams were less clear compared to the classification by the ca however in general results of the piper and schöller classification were in line with the results of the ca for example clusters 1 3 and 4 could be distinguished in the piper diagram mainly with respect to ca and so4 fig 9 the sampled stream had its only source in the wetland the wetland is a discharge area of groundwater that had been recharged further uphill partington et al 2013 this groundwater is characterized by very low scores of the second isomap component that is low acid induced podsolization and high scores of the third component indicating strong effects of weathering lischeid and bittersohl 2008 weyer et al 2014 temporal variability of these effects is very low thus taking groundwater solute concentration as a background any modification observed in the wetland stream has to be ascribed to wetland internal processes the stream was sampled roughly 50 m downstream from its source thus in stream processes do not need to be accounted for due to a very short residence time within the stream in the following the four different clusters are first discussed emphasizing the interplay between the typical biogeochemical processes represented by the clusters with the different hydrological and seasonal boundary conditions respectively corresponding to the results section clusters are discussed in chronological order of occurrence during the course of the year then implications for the temporal variability of stream water chemistry during runoff events and for the temporal patterns of single solutes in the moorbach stream water are discussed 4 1 cluster 3 discharging unaltered groundwater in winter and early spring when the temperatures and the microbial activity are low only cluster 3 was observed fig 6 anoxic redox processes first component seemed to play a minor role reflected by low negative mean component scores although the wetland is completely water saturated due to low evapotranspiration obviously microbial oxygen consumption and subsequent reduction of the redox potential in the wetland was very low in winter and early spring due to low temperatures and did hardly alter the quality of the groundwater discharging into the wetland stream in addition residence time of water within the wetland was the shortest for samples of cluster 3 fig 7 which adds to the effect of slow kinetics of biogeochemical processes during the winter months correspondingly the highest no3 and relatively high so4 and doc values were observed in the schöller diagram fig 8 4 2 clusters 2 and 1 enhanced microbial activity and anoxic conditions cluster 2 ranges between cluster 3 and 1 with respect to all isomap components and to all solutes figs 4 and 5 in the piper diagram as well cluster 2 is placed between cluster 3 and cluster 1 fig 9 cluster 2 is considered a transitional stage between the two this holds for the temporal order of cluster occurrence as well although with some minor exceptions fig 6 thus both clusters are discussed in a common section simultaneously with rising temperatures in spring and early summer cluster 3 was subsequently replaced by clusters 2 and 1 in every year of the study period figs 6 and 7 rising air and soil temperature likely led to a considerable increase of microbial activity and thus to more rapid kinetics of the respective processes on the other hand increasing transpiration lowered the groundwater level in the wetland and thus decreased the frequency of runoff peaks the data of another riparian wetland in the lehstenbach catchment presented by frei et al 2010 illustrated the relationship between groundwater level and discharge decreasing frequency of runoff events in turn resulted in increased mean residence time of water within the wetland figs 6 and 7 thus the effects of microbial activity became even more pronounced consequently oxygen depletion set in and the scores of the first isomap component decreased indicating increasingly anoxic conditions as was observed in other studies as well kull et al 2008 olivie lauquet et al 2001 please note that scores of that component reflect conditions in the wetland rather than conditions in the wetland stream which in fact was oxic due to being exposed to the atmosphere instead very low no3 and so4 concentrations in stream water samples fig 5 were indicative of denitrification and desulphurication in the wetland anaerobic mineralization could be stimulated by regeneration of electron acceptors due to frequent fluctuations in the water table and thus drought and rewetting events blodau and moore 2003 deppe et al 2010 knorr et al 2008 knorr et al 2009 such fluctuations were observed within the uppermost 15 cm in the wetland of the study site during the period of august to september 2007 when most of the samples were ascribed to cluster 1 correspondingly on average the highest cumulative precipitation for a 30 day period as well as a higher groundwater level for cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 was observed because so4 was by far the dominating anion concentration of alkaline earth cations and of mn in the stream decreased as well fig 5 contrary to common expectations mn concentration in the lehstenbach catchment is obviously more closely related to ionic strength rather than to redox processes lischeid and bittersohl 2008 similarly increasing mn concentration with increasing redox potential was observed by frohne et al 2011 in soils instead of the expected precipitation of mn oxides presumably due to an equally low ph as in this study and to precipitation of mn sulphides increasing residence time increased the effect of other biogeochemical processes in the wetland as well these processes are not necessarily related to temperature clusters 2 and 1 exhibited enhanced effects of acid induced podsolization processes higher mean scores of the second component and al releasing weathering reactions lower mean scores of the third component discharging to the moorbach stream when compared to cluster 3 similar observations were found by olivie lauquet et al 2001 they suggest that the microorganisms which use soil iron and manganese oxy hydroxides as electron acceptors catalyzed the change of redox conditions and induced an increase of doc concentration the close relationship between fe reducing conditions and doc release corresponds to the findings of knorr 2012 at the wetland site of our study and with the results of lambert et al 2013 concomitantly trace elements like al adsorbed to the fe hydr oxides are released stumm and sulzberger 1992 trolard et al 1995 these processes likely produce a chemical composition of water samples similar to that produced by acid induced podsolization processes associated with the second component and likely add to the latter in addition the enhanced podsolization processes in the wetland compared to cluster 3 could be explained by aeration of the top of the small hummocks in the wetland cf frei et al 2010 in fact the top of the small hummocks were water saturated during both the snowmelt period and single rainstorms and subsequently fell dry leading to a chemical signature comparable to that of the soil solution at upslope sites as was observed for the uppermost soil layer in another wetland of the same catchment lischeid et al 2007 with respect to the third component a high affinity of al for doc has been demonstrated in numerous studies helmer et al 1990 kerr et al 2008 olivie lauquet et al 2001 szkokan emilson et al 2013 in waters with doc 15 mg l 1 as was the case for the wetland and the moorbach stream in our study up to 100 of total al was present as humate complexes viers et al 1997 thus decomposition of these humate al complexes could have resulted in a seasonally variable export of both doc and trace elements like al from wetlands to streams higher al concentration in stream water due to higher microbial activity in summer was also observed by other authors muller and tankéré muller 2012 to summarize clusters 1 and 2 seem to represent wetland waters discharging into the moorbach stream influenced by more pronounced biogeochemical processes as compared to those influencing cluster 3 in spring and early summer this pattern was reflected in the schöller classification mainly by decreasing no3 so4 and doc and also by increasing fe concentration fig 8 4 3 cluster 4 rewetting after extensive groundwater level drawdown cluster 4 was observed after periods of extended groundwater level drawdown by more than 20 cm in summer and autumn samples taken in early july 2005 august and october 2006 fig 6 the significant lower groundwater level and a significant lower antecedent cumulative precipitation 30 days period seemed to be the most important differences as compared to cluster 1 because there were no significant differences between these two clusters with respect to discharge air temperature and residence time for the sampling dates fig 7 in spite of that the hydrochemical status in terms of the scores of the first two isomap components and of most solutes figs 4 and 5 differed the most between these two clusters which was reflected in the schöller and piper classification as well figs 8 and 9 in 2007 not a single stream water sample was assigned to cluster 4 although a similar drawdown of the groundwater level occurred in 2007 when compared to 2005 and 2006 however groundwater drawdown and subsequent rewetting in 2007 occurred in early may i e much earlier in the course of the year when compared to 2005 and 2006 this might indicate that microbial activity in april and in early may 2007 might not have been high enough to provide the conditions necessary for generating the stream water quality of cluster 4 obviously memory effects have to be taken into account here moorbach stream water samples characterized by this cluster reflected wetland water being highly influenced by oxic conditions high scores of the first component i e high no3 and so4 concentration low fe concentration and by acidifying effects of historical so4 deposition low scores of the second component i e low doc and fe concentration high so4 and na concentration concurrently a low influence of cation exchange or silicate weathering was observed low scores of the third component the results of the piper and schöller classification were in line with these findings figs 8 and 9 similar observations after drought periods were made e g by lamers et al 1998 szkokan emilson et al 2013 and watmough et al 2016 water level drawdown during drought periods can lead to oxidation of nitrogen n sulphur s and iron fe species and to the concomitant release of protons in the upper soil layers in the wetland consequently the upper soil layers can be acidified oxidized species like so4 and no3 could accumulate during the dry period in the upper soil layers and would be washed out during heavy rainstorms bechtold et al 2003 dillon and lazerte 1992 eimers et al 2007 szkokan emilson et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 reoxidation of reduced s species was demonstrated for the wetland site in the lehstenbach catchment alewell et al 2006 oxidizable sulphur originating from historical so4 deposition can lead to intensified acidification the wetland receives anoxic groundwater from intermittent seeps and fens resulting in high amounts of fe in the upper soil layers küsel and alewell 2004 in areas with a large fe pool in the soil historical so4 deposition strongly enhances fesx storage an increased pool of fesx stimulates drought related soil acidification which influences the ph and causes an increase of potentially toxic metals like al in pore water lamers et al 1998 this relationship between acidification and al release has been extensively investigated e g smolders et al 2006 szkokan emilson et al 2013 tipping et al 2003 watmough and orlovskaya 2015 and was in line with the high influence of al releasing weathering reactions found for cluster 4 4 4 role of hydrological processes in more than 80 of all cases consecutive samples were assigned to the same cluster pointing to rather stable biogeochemical conditions and only minor effects of hydrological processes in the short term i e within single stormflow events this is in striking contrast to pronounced short term chemical responses during stormflows observed in other streams of the catchment lischeid and bittersohl 2008 lischeid et al 2002 strohmeier et al 2013 however in contrast to those streams there is no well buffered deep groundwater recharging the wetland stream that could be mixed in varying portions with near surface runoff in winter spring and early summer runoff peaks did not change the cluster occurrence i e the moorbach stream water quality this was true for a wide range of hydrological boundary conditions in the wetland i e during water saturation conditions april may 2005 january 2007 april 2007 and after periods of extensive water level drawdown 20 cm april 2007 fig 6 once the water level had recovered to complete saturation thus the magnitude of discharge and base flow or storm flow conditions seemed to play a negligible role as illustrated by the wide range of discharge during sampling for clusters 1 2 and 3 fig 7 this observation pointed to rather stable chemical conditions in the wetland due to low microbial activity which was in line with the results of olivie lauquet et al 2001 runoff events after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown less than 15 cm in summer and autumn did not have a systematic influence on the cluster occurrence during or after the event on stream water quality in some events a shift from either cluster 2 to cluster 1 or vice versa with a quick shift back was observed thus precipitation events after periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown can result in a decline or a peak of solute concentration of only short duration in contrast stormflow after periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown more than 20 cm in summer and autumn systematically induced cluster changes from either cluster 2 or 3 to cluster 4 i e a substantial change of the stream water chemistry due to flushing of solutes that accumulated during the preceding drought period cluster 4 was observed for up to 28 days or longer after the precipitation event thus extensive drought periods seem to have generated a high no3 and so4 export from the wetland to the moorbach stream despite reduced sulphur deposition combined with al release these non linear relationships between biogeochemical and hydrological processes have to be taken into account to produce reliable predictions of solute export with hydrochemical models used for water management purposes especially with regard to the expected increasing frequency of drought periods due to climate change the residence time of the water seems to play an important role for the biogeochemical transformation within the wetland indeed biogeochemical transformation rates are discussed to depend on the ratio between residence and reaction time scales oldham et al 2013 this needs to be taken into account with regard to the impact of wetlands on water quality in the receiving streams 4 5 implications for single solutes the interplay between the hydrological boundary conditions and the biogeochemical processes in the wetland via the microbial activity in the wetland turned out to determine the different types of moorbach stream water samples this interplay will be demonstrated below for no3 positively correlated with the first isomap component doc and so4 positively and negatively correlated with the second isomap component respectively and al negatively correlated with the third isomap component no3 concentration usually follows the annual cycle of water table depth with a spring maximum and an autumn minimum aubert et al 2013a prior and johnes 2002 sponseller et al 2014 however no3 export in our catchment showed a much more complex pattern this was presumably due to the interplay between water table position and microbial activity as reflected by the change from cluster 3 to cluster 2 no3 export decreased from april to may 2005 although the water table remained near the soil surface figs 5 and 6 likely due to enhanced microbial activity no3 concentration near the detection limit represented by cluster 1 was not limited to autumn runoff events as observed by prior and johnes 2002 but occurred e g in june or august due to enhanced microbial activity during periods of moderate groundwater level drawdown in the wetland fig 6 and consequently longer water residence time fig 7 periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown cluster 4 however led to no3 concentrations similar to those in early summer cluster 2 even in the autumn months fig 6 similarly lupon et al 2016 observed that no3 release from riparian wetlands was correlated with riparian evapotranspiration thus the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes has important implications for estimating the effect of wetlands for no3 retention and its no3 removing capacity and has to be taken into account in water management strategies doc peaks in storm flow were ascribed to near surface runoff during storms hagedorn et al 2000 hornberger et al 1994 inamdar et al 2011 mitchell et al 2006 i e in the layer of highest doc production cole et al 2002 in the wetland studied here however doc concentration in runoff showed high variation although runoff was generated mainly in the topsoil layer the highest doc concentration was found for stream water samples represented by cluster 1 followed by those represented by cluster 2 fig 5 cluster 1 was characterized by discharge of wetland waters with the highest influence of anoxic redox processes followed by cluster 2 fig 4 in contrast declining doc concentration and high so4 concentration occurred after periods of extensive groundwater level drawdown as reflected by the shift to cluster 4 runoff events beginning in july 2005 august september and october 2006 fig 6 despite the water table rising up to the soil surface and topsoil water discharging to the moorbach stream in fact during phases of high water tables iron reduction was favoured and led to a concomitant doc release in contrast during drought periods doc concentration declined in the pore waters of the riparian wetland under study knorr 2012 and elsewhere juckers and watmough 2014 a pattern inverse to that for doc was observed for so4 knorr 2012 these observations for the pore waters seem to be reflected in the moorbach stream water samples as well indicating that solute export from the wetland to the moorbach stream depends on the antecedent moisture conditions controlling biogeochemical processes like redox reactions in the wetland it is remarkable that a corresponding anticorrelation between the historical so4 deposition and doc has been found elsewhere ledesma et al 2016 and on a larger scale monteith et al 2007 a positive correlation between al concentration and discharge was described in several studies kirchner 2003 piatek et al 2009 stutter et al 2001 however in our study no such correlation could be observed aluminum concentration differed significantly between clusters 1 and 4 fig 5 although discharge did not fig 7 in addition clusters 1 and 3 represented the highest and the lowest al concentration coming along with low and high discharge values respectively the al concentration increased from cluster 3 to cluster 1 figs 5 and 8 i e from winter to the summer months following a seasonal pattern rather than discharge patterns a similar seasonal pattern was observed by muller and tankéré muller 2012 and was related to higher microbial activity in summer thus biogeochemical conditions related to water table position and season rather than discharge were essential for al release to the moorbach stream consequently in catchments with a high proportion of wetland area high al concentration can be expected not only episodically during runoff peaks after drought periods but over a longer period during the summer months higher air temperatures due to climate change will likely amplify al release from wetlands to streams with consequences for water management strategies 5 conclusions a cluster analysis of water quality data from a small stream draining a riparian wetland helped better understand the interplay between hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the wetland cluster analysis allowed a more detailed classification then the general classification using the piper and schöller diagrams solute export seemed to depend on the interplay between water table position and seasonally varying biological activity and thus varying biogeochemical conditions in the wetland temporal variability of stream water quality during single runoff events was negligible minimum biological activity and short residence time in the wetland hardly altered the quality of the groundwater that discharged into the stream during the dormant season in contrast increasing biological activity and increasing residence time in spring and summer had a major impact on wetland and stream water quality periods with extensive groundwater level drawdown of more than 20 cm and subsequent rewetting led to a substantial increase of solute concentration and load no3 so4 na al that lasted for up to 28 days or longer however that effect seemed to depend crucially on the intensity of microbial activity during the preceding period of groundwater level drawdown pointing to a substantial biogeochemical memory effect similar results are expected with respect to the cluster analysis for catchments with comparable geology climate land use and wetland proportion i e for catchments with comparable biogeochemical processes and residence time in the wetland however each factor or process influencing the biogeochemical processes in a catchment like another geology or land use can also influence the results of the cluster analysis in addition further research would be required to investigate the effect of different catchment sizes on the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes in order to improve the understanding of biogeochemical and hydrological dynamics on different scales of interest it is concluded that biological activity in the riparian wetland interacting with water table dynamics proved to be a primary determinant of stream water quality and solute export these non linear relationships should be taken into account in biogeochemical modelling for improving predictions of stream water chemistry in water resources management more than a shift of annual mean values single dry and warm periods are likely to predominate the dynamics and thus limit the retention capacity of wetlands and enhance solute export to the streams a sound understanding of these dynamics is a necessary prerequisite for assessing the impact of both climate and land use change on stream water quality nutrient export
