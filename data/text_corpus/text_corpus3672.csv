18360,novel wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to be more energy efficient than conventional plants one approach to becoming more energy efficient is the pre concentration of organic carbon through chemically enhanced primary treatment cept or high rate activated sludge hras this study compares these approaches in terms of energy demand operational costs organic micropollutants omp and virus removal efficiency a cept pilot scale plant was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 30 min and a lab scale hras reactor was operated at an hrt of 2 h and a solid retention time srt of 1 d in continuous mode a minimum dose of 150 mg l ferric chloride fecl3 was required to achieve a threshold chemical oxygen demand cod to ammonium ratio below 2 g cod to 1 g of nh4 n fulfilling the requirement for a partial nitritation anammox reactor reaching high phosphate po4 3 removal efficiency 99 a slightly lower cod recovery was attained in the hras reactor due to the partial oxidation of the influent cod 15 the lower po4 3 removal efficiency achieved in the hras configuration 13 was enhanced to a comparable value of that achieved in cept by the addition of 30 mg l fecl3 at the clarifier the cept configuration was less energy intensive 0 07 vs 0 13 kwh m3 of wastewater but had significantly higher operational costs than the hras based configuration 6 0 vs 3 8 c m3 of wastewater for omps with kbiol 10 l gvss d considerably higher removal efficiencies were achieved in hras 80 90 than in cept 4 55 for the remaining omps the biotransformation efficiencies were generally higher in hras than in cept but were below 55 in both configurations finally cept was less efficient than hras for virus removal hras followed by fecl3 post treatment appeared to be a more effective alternative than cept for cod pre concentration in novel wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords chemically enhanced primary treatment energy demand high rate activated sludge operational costs organic micropollutants virus removal 1 introduction conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been successfully used for decades to remove pollutants present in urban wastewater such as organic matter suspended solids and nutrients thus preventing the pollution of surface waters however there is the potential to develop a new generation of more energetically efficient wwtps gikas 2017 siegrist et al 2008 the new generation of wwtps known as novel wwtps offers up to 60 reduction in aeration requirements gu et al 2017 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 wan et al 2016 with these novel strategies the recovery of organic carbon is proposed to be maximised in the first stage followed by a partial nitritation anammox pn amx unit for ammonium nh4 removal the organic carbon is recovered as sludge and is subsequently used to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion ad various pre concentration alternatives for maximum chemical oxygen demand cod recovery such as chemically enhanced primary treatment cept jang et al 2017 li et al 2017 or high rate activated sludge hras ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 can be applied however the design of novel wwtps should consider not only energy usage and costs but also environmental and health aspects the 2030 agenda for sustainable development was adopted by the member states of the united nations in 2015 to address the social economic and environmental aspects of development one of the 17 goals included in the agenda refers to clean water and sanitation and specifically to improving water quality by reducing pollution eliminating dumping and minimising the release of hazardous chemicals similarly the european innovation partnership on water water 2015 identified eight priority areas in the water sector within its strategic implementation plan eip water 2015 water and wastewater treatment is one of these priority areas and the elimination of emerging pollutants is among its objectives hence some countries such as switzerland have already established organic micropollutant omp discharge thresholds for wwtp effluents gschvschweiz 2016 likewise other countries such as austria germany and the netherlands are considering initiatives to enhance the removal of omps during wastewater treatment to achieve an overall elimination of 80 benstoem et al 2017 there have been many studies on the removal of omps under aerobic conditions and factors such as the hydraulic retention time hrt and the solid retention time srt have been identified as key factors governing omp removal efficiency clara et al 2005 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 radjenović et al 2009 santos et al 2009 the hras technology is characterised by much lower hrt 0 25 4 h and srt 0 5 2 d ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 than those applied in conventional activated sludge cas reactors 12 24 h hrt and more than 10 d srt santos et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 which is expected to result in significantly lower omp removal efficiency regarding cept the reported omp removal efficiencies are fairly controversial some authors found that cept contributes to the removal of certain compounds which are precipitated in the flocs during the process asakura and matsuto 2009 carballa et al 2005 suarez et al 2009 while others reported no significant removal taboada santos et al 2019a westerhoff et al 2005 the causes of the discrepancies are still under discussion and wastewater physicochemical characteristics such as ph alkalinity temperature fats or dissolved organic matter might have positive or negative effects on omp removal luo et al 2014 suarez et al 2009 another emerging topic is the presence of viruses in wwtp effluent since conventional wwtps fail to adequately remove viral pathogens da silva et al 2007 norovirus nov family caliciviridae is considered a major etiological agent of acute sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide atmar and estes 2006 koopmans and duizer 2004 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 likewise viruses such as sapovirus family caliciviridae sav have also emerged as important enteric pathogens oka et al 2015 the hepatitis a virus hav family picornaviridae is less common in countries with a high standard of hygiene although this pathogen may be more harmful hollinger and emerson 2007 pathogens transmitted via the faecal oral route such as hav nov and sav are shed in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals atmar and estes 2006 and are common in high numbers in sewage sassi et al 2018 removing or inactivating viruses in wwtps is still challenging despite improvements in relevant secondary and tertiary processes schmitz et al 2016 this study aims to compare two novel wwtps that utilise cept and hras for organic carbon pre concentration considering energy demand operational costs and omp and virus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and sludge samples the wastewater used in this work was collected from an urban wwtp located in santiago de compostela north western spain the wwtp is designed for a population of 184 000 with an average wastewater flowrate of approximately 55 000 m3 d wastewater was characterised in terms of ph total suspended solids tss g tss kg volatile suspended solids vss g vss kg total chemical oxygen demand codtot g o2 l and soluble codsol g o2 l ammonium g nh4 n l and phosphate g po4 3 p l according to standard methods apha 2005 inorganic carbon ic was determined using a shimadzu analyser toc 5000 2 2 cept 2 2 1 jar test experiments the cept tests assays were carried out in a jar test device using 1 l vessels following the protocol described by carballa et al 2005 but in this case without ph neutralisation two coagulants widely used for coagulation processes namely ferric chloride fecl3 sigma aldrich cas number 10025 77 1 and ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 sigma aldrich cas number 15244 10 7 jang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 were evaluated the test included an initial 3 min period of rapid stirring 150 rpm after the addition of the coagulant followed by 5 min of slow mixing 50 rpm for emulsion breaking and floc formation and finally 30 min without mixing for floc separation after which 500 ml of supernatant was collected for characterisation the influence of the dose of coagulant 0 300 mg l on ph and the removal of tss vss codtot codsol ic nh4 n and po4 3 p was studied at 25 c 2 2 2 continuous pilot plant the pilot plant used described by suarez et al 2009 consists of three main sections i a 4 4 l coagulation tank with a fixed speed stirrer ii a 15 l flocculation tank provided with a speed regulated stirrer and iii a 35 l lamellar settler with 10 stainless steel aisi 304 plates the optimum coagulant and dose were selected from the results of batch experiments the wastewater flow rate was fixed at 70 l min to achieve an hrt of 30 min in the lamellar settler section with continuous addition of fecl3 selected from the jar test results after 90 min of steady operation of the pilot plant corresponding to 3 hrt the effluent was sampled and characterised in terms of ph codtot codsol tss vss nh4 n po4 3 p ic omp and virus concentrations the cod removal was calculated from eq

reactor from a wwtp in madrid spain with a 2 5 3 d srt it was operated at an hrt of 2 h plus 1 h in the settling tank the target srt was 1 d this being controlled by the purge of sludge from the bottom of the settler 10 times per day the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained between 3 and 3 5 mg o2 l ge et al 2017 without temperature or ph control after inoculation the reactor was operated for 80 d 15 d of biomass adaptation 65 d of steady state operation the biomass concentration in the reactor was maintained between 2 and 3 g vss l the reactor walls were scraped every day to remove biofilm formations that could eventually increase the effective srt the influent and effluent of the reactor were sampled daily and characterised in terms of ph codtot codsol tss vss nh4 n po4

effluent was carried out on days 18 33 48 and 63 of operation sampling of viruses was carried out on days 18 and 48 on day 18 the effluent from the hras reactor was collected and treated with fecl3 0 30 mg l in jar test devices as explained in section 2 4 1 to assess the influence on po4 3 omp and virus removal efficiency sludge was also sampled every day and characterised in terms of codtot tss and vss the fraction of cod that oxidised to co2 was calculated from the cod balance considering the cod fed to the reactor the cod recovered in the sludge and the cod in the effluent 2 4 energetic evaluation a typical medium strength urban wastewater with a codtot of 500 mg l and nh4 concentration of 25 30 mg nh4 n l was considered as the basis for the analysis metcalf and eddy 2003 wan et al 2016 in the biogas line a methane heat combustion of 11 kwh m3 n ch4 perry 1984 and electrical efficiency η of 0 35 in the co generation motor mills et al 2014 were assumed the energy consumption of the different technologies is presented in table 1 to determine the expected methane production in each configuration biomethane potential bmp tests of the different sludges sludge from the continuous operation of the cept pilot plant and from the purge of the hras reactor were conducted using ampts ii equipment bioprocess control the tests were conducted in 2 l bottles 1 9 l of working volume in triplicate using an isr inoculum to substrate ratio in terms of vss of 2 following the protocol described by taboada santos et al 2019b the inoculum was anaerobic flocculant biomass 15 20 g vs l from a mesophilic sewage sludge anaerobic digester anaerobic biodegradability ab was expressed as the percentage of the initial cod of the substrate converted to methane at the end of the test the bottles were opened and the ph and volatile fatty acid vfa concentration were measured to confirm whether acidification had occurred 2 5 economic evaluation the costs of fecl3 and electricity of 220 ton and 0 12 kwh respectively were considered in the economic evaluation de feo et al 2008 stowa 2010 and a hygienisation cost for composting of digested sludge of 80 ton ts was assumed management company 2019

17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 to ensure their presence in the wastewater these omps were spiked at the influent stream in the range of the values reported by luo et al 2014 and verlicchi et al 2012 20 ppb for musk fragrances 1 ppb for hormones and 10 ppb for the others the liquid phase of the samples was pre filtered ap4004705 millipore and filtered to 0 45 mm hawp04700

levels were quantified using an agilent g1312a lc with a binary pump and automatic injector htc pai ctc analytics connected to a mass spectrometer api 4000 triple quadrupole applied biosystems the concentrated volume was 250 ml and the final volume of extract was 3 ml leading to an enrichment factor of 83 lsupernatant lextract the procedure is explained in detail by gonzalez gil et al 2016 the solid phase was frozen and lyophilised to perform ultrasonic solvent extraction three sequential extractions with methanol and two with acetone were performed on the freeze dried samples 0 5 g in each extraction the samples were sonicated for 15 min and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min the resulting supernatants were combined and filtered through glass wool and the resulting volume was evaporated to 1 ml turbovap lv biotage flowing nitrogen 200 kpa 30 c and resuspended in 100 ml of milli q water prior to spe finally quantification of spe and omps was performed as previously described for the liquid phase the enrichment factor was 500 gsludge lextract the total omp concentration was considered in the analysis of the influent eq 7 whereas for the effluent only the soluble concentration was

using the skimmed milk flocculation smf method described by fernandez cassi et al 2018 briefly wastewater 5 l was preconditioned to a ph of 3 5 and 50 ml of a pre flocculated skim milk solution at ph 3 5 and a conductivity greater than 1 5 ms cm2 was added to each sample after 8 h of stirring the flocs were centrifuged at 8000 g for 40 min and the pellet was suspended in 15 ml of po4 3 buffer v v 0 2 m na2hpo4 and 0 2 m nah2po4 the viral concentrates were kept at 80 c for further analysis the viral rna from each sample was extracted in duplicate using the commercial nucleospin rna virus kit macherey nagel dürem germany according to the manufacturer s protocols following the iso 15216 1 2017 standard method iso 2017 a mengovirus clone vmc0 and external controls were employed to determine the extraction and amplification efficiencies respectively as previously described varela et al 2018 according to this standard procedure samples with 5 extraction efficiency or 25 reverse transcription pcr rt qpcr efficiency were re extracted and re tested the rt qpcr for hav nov gi and gii and sav was performed using an mx3005p qpcr system stratagene usa thermocycler the primers and probes used for virus detection and quantification are described in the literature costafreda et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 svraka et al 2007 kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 oka et al 2006 varela et al 2018 the amplification conditions were reverse transcription at 55 c for 30 min denaturation at 95 c for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification with denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c 50 c for sav for 1 min and extension at 65 c for 1 min the viral rna was tested undiluted and at ten fold dilution to reduce the effect of potential rt pcr inhibitors negative controls containing no nucleic acid as well as positive controls were introduced in each run viral rna was quantified using standard curves constructed with serial dilutions of rna in the case of hav and rna transcripts for nov gi gii and sav plotting the number of genome copies against the ct the results were expressed as the number of rna viral genome copies per l of wastewater sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater physicochemical characterisation the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater in the typical range for urban wwtps influent metcalf and eddy 2003 are shown in table 2 fluctuations of the measured parameters are primarily due to the dilution by rainfall since the city does not have a separate sewer system carballa et al 2005 3 2 performance of cept jar test and pilot plant operation the selected coagulants fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were compared in the jar test and fecl3 was selected due to its higher removal efficiency under the same coagulant dose a detailed discussion is included in section s1 in the supplementary information fig 1 a shows the influence of the fecl3 dose on effluent ph and on codsol and codpart calculated as codtot minus codsol removal efficiency the codpart was completely removed with a dose of 150 mg l which was similar to the concentration used by other authors studying urban wwtps mbamba et al 2019 under these conditions a codtot removal efficiency of 88 was achieved and higher doses barely enhanced the codtot a noticeable decrease in ph from 7 8 to 6 8 was observed under these conditions which increased with higher fecl3 doses fig 1b displays the influence of fecl3 on po4 3 ic and nh4 concentration whereas po4 3 removal efficiency was above 99 with doses from 100 mg l of fecl3 in accordance with diamantis et al 2013 reaching a discharge limit of 0 2 mg po4 3 p l mbamba et al 2019 the ic showed a total concentration decrease of 22 mg l the results from the jar test experiments were validated in a continuous pilot plant under different wastewater characteristics but maintaining a fecl3 dose of 125 150 mg l achieving comparable results to those of the batch tests detailed information of the results is presented in section s2 in the supplementary information the required doses during continuous operation might be decreased with a proper design of the cept elements such as the flocculation box lamellas or unit geometry patziger et al 2016 patziger and kiss 2015 under these conditions a codtot to nh4 n ratio close to 1 was achieved indicating suitability for a pn amx unit according to jin et al 2012 who reported system failure with a codtot to nh4 n ratio above 2 due to the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers which compete for nitrite however a minimum alkalinity to nh4 ratio of 1 1 25 g ic to 1 g nh4 n was reported as the threshold to protect the pn amx unit from acidification pedrouso et al 2017 and subsequent inhibition due to the formation of free nitrous acid jin et al 2012 depending on the alkalinity and nh4 concentration in wastewater an external alkalinity dose could be required substantially increasing the treatment costs 3 3 performance of hras reactor the results of the operation of the hras reactor are summarised in table 3 the cod removal efficiency averaged 90 fig 2 however the cod recovery as sludge was slightly lower than in the cept based configuration 71 due to the partial oxidation of the wastewater cod average of 17 which might be reduced with lower hrt and or srt to maximise cod capture ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 the nh4 and po4 3 removal efficiency was 19 and 13 table 3 respectively and was attributed to biomass growth these results are in the range of previous studies ge et al 2017 laureni et al 2016 and also in accordance with chan et al 2017 who found that a minimum srt of 3 6 4 d is needed to obtain effective phosphorus removal an average decrease of approximately 5 mg ic l was observed much lower than in the cept based configuration therefore the effluent of the hras reactor would satisfy the requirements for a pn amx unit jin et al 2012 pedrouso et al 2017 in terms of both the ic to nh4 ratio and cod to nh4 ratio however the effluent does not fulfil the discharge limit of 0 2 mg po4 3 p l mbamba et al 2019 so further treatment through chemical precipitation in the clarifier was required according to the recommendations of longo et al 2017 with the addition of 10 20 and 30 mg l of fecl3 the po4 3 concentration in the effluent decreased to 1 1 mg po4 3 p l 0 5 mg po4 3 p l and 0 2 mg po4 3 p l respectively thus 30 mg l was selected as the required fecl3 dose for economic evaluation and to assess the omp and virus removal efficiency 3 4 energetic evaluation fig 3 represents the energy flow in the wwtp based on cept a and hras b the hras based configuration had a higher energy demand for cod removal 0 1 kwh m3 wastewater due to aeration 0 07 kwh m3 wastewater and sludge recirculation 0 03 kwh m3 wastewater moreover considering that partial nh4 removal is achieved in this unit the energy demand of the pn amx unit was 0 20 kwh m3 wastewater whereas the energy consumption in the pn amx unit of the cept based configuration was higher 0 25 kwh m3 wastewater for the hras based configuration an additional 0 01 kwh m3 wastewater was required to dose the coagulant to enhance po4 3 removal efficiency finally in both alternatives 0 05 kwh m3 of wastewater was needed for i sludge thickening before ad 0 02 kwh m3 of wastewater and ii further sludge dewatering 0 03 kwh m3 of wastewater therefore considering all the energy inputs both configurations presented a comparable energy demand cept 0 36 kwh m3 wastewater fig 3a and hras 0 39 kwh m3 wastewater fig 3b the results of the bmp test were comparable 51 and 52 for cept and hras sludges respectively results of the bmp test are discussed in detail in section s3 in the supporting information since higher cod recovery from wastewater was obtained in the cept based configuration higher methane production was achieved 0 29 kwh m3 of wastewater in comparison with the hras based configuration 0 25 kwh m3 of wastewater the overall wwtp energy balance shows that the cept based wwtp had a lower energy demand 0 07 kwh m3 of wastewater than the hras based wwtp 0 13 kwh m3 of wastewater 3 5 economic evaluation the operational costs include electricity chemicals and sludge management as explained in section 3 4 the cept based wwtp needs up to 0 8 c m3 of wastewater while the hras based wwtp consumes 1 7 c m3 of wastewater fig 4 a 20 higher digested solids production was achieved in the cept alternative 0 23 kg tss m3 of wastewater than in the hras configuration 0 18 kg tss m3 of wastewater due to the higher cod recovery and the presence of higher concentrations of inorganics in cept sludge detailed information for solid production is presented in section s4 in the supplementary information this results in 1 9 and 1 4 c m3 of wastewater for cept and hras based wwtps respectively fig 4 finally the coagulant contributes 3 3 and 0 7 c m3 of wastewater to the cept and hras configurations respectively considering all costs the cept alternative had significantly higher operational costs 6 0 c m3 of wastewater in comparison with the hras based configuration 3 8 c m3 of wastewater note that the most optimistic situation for the cept based configuration was evaluated and operational costs would be higher if an external alkalinity supply was required 3 6 fate of omps 3 6 1 cept most omps are poorly removed during cept however some authors reported that the different compositions of wastewater can play a major role in omp elimination for example high fat content in wastewater was reported to improve the removal of hydrophobic compounds kd 2000 l kg tss table 4 in contrast the presence of codsol might inhibit the omp removal efficiency due to the preference of the coagulant for codsol choi et al 2008 vieno et al 2006 a medium low removal efficiency 38 55 of hydrophobic omps adbi ahtn hhcb and tcs was obtained fig 5 this was attributed to the sorbed fraction of these omps into tss in accordance with suarez et al 2009 for hydrophilic compounds including anti inflammatories antibiotics neurodrugs and hormones the removal efficiencies were below 31 in accordance with other authors bodzek and dudziak 2006 suarez et al 2009 westerhoff et al 2005 however these results were in contrast to others who suggest that omps with pka close to 7 such as ibp smx or npx are removed efficiently in the cept process by precipitation metal salts are added to the wastewater carballa et al 2005 luo et al 2014 suarez et al 2009 3 6 2 hras fig 5 compares the removal efficiency of omps achieved in the hras reactor with that in the cept process the omps were classified into three groups according to their behaviour in this biological unit the omps with kbiol values 10 l kg vss d table 5 such as e1 e2 ibp adbi ahtn hhcb and tcs group i are much better removed in the hras 80 unit than in the cept one for musk fragrances and tcs biotransformation and sorption onto sludge significantly contributed to their removal due to the high kd values table 4 even though the applied hrt in this work is much lower than in cas reactors and the kbiol for this group of omps are generally lower than those reported by other authors under nitrifying conditions table 5 these omps are efficiently removed under heterotrophic conditions group ii includes omps such as npx rox dzp ee2 smx and flx presenting kinetic constants in the range 1 10 l gvss d and biotransformation efficiencies between 20 and 55 fig 5 these removal efficiencies were in general lower than those found in cas reactors and attributed to i the lower kbiol values in comparison with those reported in cas reactors for omps such as rox ee2 and flx table 5 indicating the role of nitrifiers in the biotransformation of most omps fernandez fontaina et al 2016 men et al 2017 and ii the low hrt that kinetically limits the biotransformation of omps such as npx or dzp which present comparable or higher kbiol values under heterotrophic conditions finally the group iii omps such as ery ctl dcf tmp and cbz have kbiol values lower than 1 l gvss d table 5 and subsequent biotransformation efficiencies below 25 fig 5 for ery and ctl the kbiol values are much lower than those reported in cas systems table 5 in contrast dcf tmp and cbz are not removed in the hras or the cas reactors moreover there was no noticeable reduction in omp concentration 15 after treating the hras reactor effluent with 30 mg l fecl3 data not shown this was attributed to an analytical deviation and the addition of chemicals in the secondary clarifiers did not improve omp removal efficiency the comparison between the reactor types showed that group i omps exhibited considerably higher biotransformation efficiency in the hras reactor while the elimination efficiencies of group ii and iii were comparable this study shows that hras is a more effective technology than cept in terms of omps removal but further research is needed to evaluate the fate of omps in novel wwtps 3 7 virus removal recovery efficiencies were generally high demonstrating minimal viral genome loss during the extraction rt qpcr process with the exception of hav all the other enteric viruses were detected in the untreated and treated wastewater fig 6 gi and gii nov were found at mean concentrations of 6 70 log10 copies l and 6 05 log10 copies l respectively whereas sav was detected at a mean concentration of 4 52 log10 copies l these values are in the range of those found in wastewater in different geographic areas including usa japan and tunisia ito et al 2017 schmitz et al 2016 varela et al 2018 3 7 1 cept the results show that nov gi exhibited the greatest reduction 1 3 log units 94 5 followed by nov gii 0 5 log units 66 5 and sav 0 4 log units 62 2 fig 6 these removal efficiencies were similar to those reported by other authors in wwtps based on cas reactors or trickling filters for a variety of viruses including nov sav and aichi virus schmitz et al 2016 varela et al 2018 3 7 2 hras the viral reductions in the hras were in general higher than those in the cept unit fig 6 the mean reductions for nov gi nov gii and sav were 1 3 log units 1 4 log units and 1 2 log units respectively these values are similar to those reported for advanced wwtps such as the five stage bardenpho treatment schmitz et al 2016 the hras system was originally designed to enhance nutrient removal and viral reduction could be attributed to greater virus adsorption to suspended particles some differences in the removal efficiencies of viruses in the hras reactor were observed between the sampling campaigns indicating that slight variations in the physicochemical parameters ph tss cod divalent cations srt etc may affect virus removal likewise for omps a reduction in virus concentration was not observed after treating the hras reactor effluent with 30 mg l fecl3 the influence of the wwtp configurations and operational conditions on the efficiency of viral removal has studied previously li et al 2011 schmitz et al 2016 and virus aggregation disaggregation is cited as one of the main causes for viral resistance to diverse chemical compounds gerba and betancourt 2017 viral aggregation could be responsible for inaccurate estimations of removal during different treatment processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis which are generally considered more efficient than cas this study is limited in that we could not differentiate live viruses or whether the reductions are due to physical removal or damage to the nucleic acid affecting detection by qpcr further studies are needed to clarify these aspects 4 conclusions similar cod removal efficiencies were achieved in hras and cept although the former has lower recovery due to the partial oxidation of the influent cod the concentration of nh4 was not affected in the cept process and there was a minimum po4 3 removal of 99 in the hras reactor both compounds are poorly eliminated 20 although with post treatment with 30 mg l fecl3 comparable results for po4 3 removal to those of the cept unit were attained under these conditions the hras based configuration had higher energy demand than cept however the former had lower operational costs in general higher omp removal efficiencies were achieved in the hras system although results were comparable and low for recalcitrant compounds 25 the hras configuration presents a higher potential for viral removal than cept but significant variations in performance in terms of virus type were observed therefore hras had slightly higher energy demand than cept but considerably lower operational costs and greater omp and virus removal and appears a

18360,novel wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to be more energy efficient than conventional plants one approach to becoming more energy efficient is the pre concentration of organic carbon through chemically enhanced primary treatment cept or high rate activated sludge hras this study compares these approaches in terms of energy demand operational costs organic micropollutants omp and virus removal efficiency a cept pilot scale plant was operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 30 min and a lab scale hras reactor was operated at an hrt of 2 h and a solid retention time srt of 1 d in continuous mode a minimum dose of 150 mg l ferric chloride fecl3 was required to achieve a threshold chemical oxygen demand cod to ammonium ratio below 2 g cod to 1 g of nh4 n fulfilling the requirement for a partial nitritation anammox reactor reaching high phosphate po4 3 removal efficiency 99 a slightly lower cod recovery was attained in the hras reactor due to the partial oxidation of the influent cod 15 the lower po4 3 removal efficiency achieved in the hras configuration 13 was enhanced to a comparable value of that achieved in cept by the addition of 30 mg l fecl3 at the clarifier the cept configuration was less energy intensive 0 07 vs 0 13 kwh m3 of wastewater but had significantly higher operational costs than the hras based configuration 6 0 vs 3 8 c m3 of wastewater for omps with kbiol 10 l gvss d considerably higher removal efficiencies were achieved in hras 80 90 than in cept 4 55 for the remaining omps the biotransformation efficiencies were generally higher in hras than in cept but were below 55 in both configurations finally cept was less efficient than hras for virus removal hras followed by fecl3 post treatment appeared to be a more effective alternative than cept for cod pre concentration in novel wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords chemically enhanced primary treatment energy demand high rate activated sludge operational costs organic micropollutants virus removal 1 introduction conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been successfully used for decades to remove pollutants present in urban wastewater such as organic matter suspended solids and nutrients thus preventing the pollution of surface waters however there is the potential to develop a new generation of more energetically efficient wwtps gikas 2017 siegrist et al 2008 the new generation of wwtps known as novel wwtps offers up to 60 reduction in aeration requirements gu et al 2017 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 wan et al 2016 with these novel strategies the recovery of organic carbon is proposed to be maximised in the first stage followed by a partial nitritation anammox pn amx unit for ammonium nh4 removal the organic carbon is recovered as sludge and is subsequently used to produce biogas in anaerobic digestion ad various pre concentration alternatives for maximum chemical oxygen demand cod recovery such as chemically enhanced primary treatment cept jang et al 2017 li et al 2017 or high rate activated sludge hras ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 can be applied however the design of novel wwtps should consider not only energy usage and costs but also environmental and health aspects the 2030 agenda for sustainable development was adopted by the member states of the united nations in 2015 to address the social economic and environmental aspects of development one of the 17 goals included in the agenda refers to clean water and sanitation and specifically to improving water quality by reducing pollution eliminating dumping and minimising the release of hazardous chemicals similarly the european innovation partnership on water water 2015 identified eight priority areas in the water sector within its strategic implementation plan eip water 2015 water and wastewater treatment is one of these priority areas and the elimination of emerging pollutants is among its objectives hence some countries such as switzerland have already established organic micropollutant omp discharge thresholds for wwtp effluents gschvschweiz 2016 likewise other countries such as austria germany and the netherlands are considering initiatives to enhance the removal of omps during wastewater treatment to achieve an overall elimination of 80 benstoem et al 2017 there have been many studies on the removal of omps under aerobic conditions and factors such as the hydraulic retention time hrt and the solid retention time srt have been identified as key factors governing omp removal efficiency clara et al 2005 fernandez fontaina et al 2016 radjenović et al 2009 santos et al 2009 the hras technology is characterised by much lower hrt 0 25 4 h and srt 0 5 2 d ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 than those applied in conventional activated sludge cas reactors 12 24 h hrt and more than 10 d srt santos et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 which is expected to result in significantly lower omp removal efficiency regarding cept the reported omp removal efficiencies are fairly controversial some authors found that cept contributes to the removal of certain compounds which are precipitated in the flocs during the process asakura and matsuto 2009 carballa et al 2005 suarez et al 2009 while others reported no significant removal taboada santos et al 2019a westerhoff et al 2005 the causes of the discrepancies are still under discussion and wastewater physicochemical characteristics such as ph alkalinity temperature fats or dissolved organic matter might have positive or negative effects on omp removal luo et al 2014 suarez et al 2009 another emerging topic is the presence of viruses in wwtp effluent since conventional wwtps fail to adequately remove viral pathogens da silva et al 2007 norovirus nov family caliciviridae is considered a major etiological agent of acute sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide atmar and estes 2006 koopmans and duizer 2004 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 likewise viruses such as sapovirus family caliciviridae sav have also emerged as important enteric pathogens oka et al 2015 the hepatitis a virus hav family picornaviridae is less common in countries with a high standard of hygiene although this pathogen may be more harmful hollinger and emerson 2007 pathogens transmitted via the faecal oral route such as hav nov and sav are shed in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals atmar and estes 2006 and are common in high numbers in sewage sassi et al 2018 removing or inactivating viruses in wwtps is still challenging despite improvements in relevant secondary and tertiary processes schmitz et al 2016 this study aims to compare two novel wwtps that utilise cept and hras for organic carbon pre concentration considering energy demand operational costs and omp and virus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater and sludge samples the wastewater used in this work was collected from an urban wwtp located in santiago de compostela north western spain the wwtp is designed for a population of 184 000 with an average wastewater flowrate of approximately 55 000 m3 d wastewater was characterised in terms of ph total

standard methods apha 2005 inorganic carbon ic was determined using a shimadzu analyser toc 5000 2 2 cept 2 2 1 jar test experiments the cept tests assays were carried out in a jar test device using 1 l vessels following the protocol described by carballa et al 2005 but in this case without ph neutralisation two coagulants widely used for coagulation processes namely ferric chloride fecl3 sigma aldrich cas number 10025 77 1 and ferric sulphate fe2 so4 3 sigma aldrich cas number 15244 10 7 jang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 were evaluated the test included an initial 3 min period of rapid stirring 150 rpm after the addition of the coagulant followed by 5 min of slow mixing 50 rpm for emulsion breaking and floc formation and finally 30 min without mixing for floc separation after which 500 ml of supernatant was collected for characterisation the influence of the dose of coagulant 0 300 mg l on ph and the removal of tss vss codtot codsol ic nh4 n and po4 3 p was studied at 25 c 2 2 2 continuous pilot plant the pilot plant used described by suarez et al 2009 consists of three main sections i a 4 4 l coagulation tank with a fixed speed stirrer ii a 15 l flocculation tank provided with a speed regulated stirrer and iii a 35 l lamellar settler with 10 stainless steel aisi 304 plates the optimum coagulant and dose were selected from the results of batch experiments the wastewater flow rate was fixed at 70 l min to achieve an hrt of 30 min in the lamellar settler section with continuous addition of fecl3 selected from the jar test results after 90 min of steady operation of the pilot plant corresponding to 3 hrt the effluent was sampled and characterised in terms of ph codtot codsol tss vss nh4 n po4 3 p ic omp and virus concentrations the cod removal was calculated from eq

bottom of the settler 10 times per day the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained between 3 and 3 5 mg o2 l ge et al 2017 without temperature or ph control after inoculation the reactor was

effluent was carried out on days 18 33 48 and 63 of operation sampling of viruses was carried out on days 18 and 48 on day 18 the effluent from the hras reactor was collected and treated with fecl3 0 30 mg l in jar test devices as explained in section 2 4 1 to assess the influence on po4 3 omp and virus removal efficiency sludge was also sampled every day and characterised in terms of codtot tss and vss the fraction of cod that oxidised to co2 was calculated from the cod balance considering the cod fed to the reactor the cod recovered in the sludge and the cod in the effluent 2 4 energetic evaluation a typical medium strength urban wastewater with a codtot of 500 mg l and nh4 concentration of 25 30 mg nh4 n l was considered as the basis for the analysis metcalf and eddy 2003 wan et al

the different technologies is presented in table 1 to determine the expected methane production in each configuration biomethane potential bmp tests of the different sludges sludge from the continuous operation of the cept pilot plant and from the purge of the hras reactor were conducted using ampts ii equipment bioprocess control the tests were conducted in 2 l bottles 1 9 l of working volume in

17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 to ensure their presence in the wastewater these omps were spiked at the influent stream in the range of the values reported by luo et al 2014 and verlicchi et al 2012 20 ppb for musk fragrances 1 ppb for hormones and 10 ppb for the others the liquid phase of the samples was pre filtered ap4004705 millipore and filtered to 0 45 mm hawp04700

concentrated volume was 250 ml and the final volume of extract was 3 ml leading to an enrichment factor of 83 lsupernatant lextract the procedure is explained in detail by gonzalez gil et al 2016 the solid phase was frozen and lyophilised to perform ultrasonic solvent extraction three sequential extractions with methanol and two with acetone were performed on the freeze dried samples 0 5 g in each extraction the samples were sonicated for 15 min and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min the resulting supernatants were combined and filtered through glass wool and the resulting volume was evaporated

liquid phase the enrichment factor was 500 gsludge lextract the total omp concentration was considered in the analysis of the influent eq 7 whereas for the effluent only the soluble concentration was

using the skimmed milk flocculation smf method described by fernandez cassi et al 2018 briefly wastewater 5 l was preconditioned to a ph of 3 5 and 50 ml of a pre flocculated skim milk solution at ph 3 5 and a conductivity greater than 1 5 ms cm2 was added to each sample after 8 h of stirring the flocs were centrifuged at 8000 g for 40 min and the pellet was suspended in 15 ml of po4 3 buffer v v 0 2 m na2hpo4 and 0 2 m nah2po4 the viral concentrates were kept at 80 c for further analysis the viral rna from each sample was extracted in duplicate using the commercial nucleospin rna virus kit macherey nagel dürem germany according to the manufacturer s protocols following the iso 15216 1 2017 standard method iso 2017 a mengovirus clone vmc0 and external controls were employed to determine the extraction and amplification efficiencies respectively as previously described varela et al 2018 according to this standard procedure samples with 5 extraction efficiency or 25 reverse transcription pcr rt qpcr efficiency were re extracted and re tested the rt qpcr for hav nov gi and gii and sav was performed using an mx3005p qpcr system stratagene usa thermocycler the primers and probes used for virus detection and quantification are described in the literature costafreda et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 svraka et al 2007 kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 oka et al 2006 varela et al 2018 the amplification conditions were reverse transcription at 55 c for 30 min denaturation at 95 c for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification with denaturation at 95 c for 15 s annealing at 60 c 50 c for sav for 1 min and extension at 65 c for 1 min the viral rna was tested undiluted and at ten fold dilution to reduce the effect of potential rt pcr inhibitors negative controls containing no nucleic acid as well as positive controls were introduced in each run viral rna was quantified using standard curves constructed with serial dilutions of rna in the case of hav and rna transcripts for nov gi gii and sav plotting the number of genome copies against the ct the results were expressed as the number of rna viral genome copies per l of wastewater sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater physicochemical characterisation the physicochemical characteristics of wastewater in the typical range for urban wwtps influent metcalf and eddy 2003 are shown in table 2 fluctuations of the measured parameters are primarily due to the dilution by rainfall since the city does not have a separate sewer system carballa et al 2005 3 2 performance of cept jar test and pilot plant operation the selected coagulants fecl3 and fe2 so4 3 were compared in the jar test and fecl3 was selected due to its higher removal efficiency under the same coagulant dose a detailed discussion is included in section s1 in the supplementary information fig 1 a shows the influence of the fecl3 dose on effluent ph and on codsol and codpart calculated as codtot minus codsol removal efficiency the codpart was completely removed with a dose of 150 mg l which was similar to the concentration used by other authors studying urban wwtps mbamba et al 2019 under these conditions a codtot removal efficiency of 88 was achieved and higher doses barely enhanced the codtot a noticeable decrease in ph from 7 8 to 6 8 was observed under these conditions which increased with higher fecl3 doses fig 1b displays the influence of fecl3 on po4 3 ic and nh4 concentration whereas po4 3 removal efficiency was above 99 with doses from 100 mg l of fecl3 in accordance with diamantis et al 2013 reaching a discharge limit of 0 2 mg po4 3 p l mbamba et al 2019 the ic showed a total concentration decrease of 22 mg l the results from the jar test experiments were validated in a continuous pilot plant under different wastewater characteristics but maintaining a fecl3 dose of 125 150 mg l achieving comparable results to those of the batch tests detailed information of the results is presented in section s2 in the supplementary information the required doses during continuous operation might be decreased with a proper design of the cept elements such as the flocculation box lamellas or unit geometry patziger et al 2016 patziger and kiss 2015 under these conditions a codtot to nh4 n ratio close to 1 was achieved indicating suitability for a pn amx unit according to jin et al 2012 who reported system failure with a codtot to nh4 n ratio above 2 due to the growth of heterotrophic denitrifiers which compete for nitrite however a minimum alkalinity to nh4 ratio of 1 1 25 g ic to 1 g nh4 n was reported as the threshold to protect the pn amx unit from acidification pedrouso et al 2017 and subsequent inhibition due to the formation of free nitrous acid jin et al 2012 depending on the alkalinity and nh4 concentration in wastewater an external alkalinity dose could be required substantially increasing the treatment costs 3 3 performance of hras reactor the results of the operation of the hras reactor are summarised in table 3 the cod removal efficiency averaged 90 fig 2 however the cod recovery as sludge was slightly lower than in the cept based configuration 71 due to the partial oxidation of the wastewater cod average of 17 which might be reduced with lower hrt and or srt to maximise cod capture ge et al 2017 jimenez et al 2015 the nh4 and po4 3 removal efficiency was 19 and 13 table 3 respectively and was attributed to biomass growth these results are in the range of previous studies ge et al 2017 laureni et al 2016 and also in accordance with chan et al 2017 who found that a minimum srt of 3 6 4 d is needed to obtain effective phosphorus removal an average decrease of approximately 5 mg ic l was observed much lower than in the cept based configuration therefore the effluent of the hras reactor would satisfy the requirements for a pn amx unit jin et al 2012 pedrouso et al 2017 in terms of both the ic to nh4 ratio and cod to nh4 ratio however the effluent does not fulfil the discharge limit of 0 2 mg po4 3 p l mbamba et al 2019 so further treatment through chemical precipitation in the clarifier was required according to the recommendations of longo et al 2017 with the addition of 10 20 and 30 mg l of fecl3 the po4 3 concentration in the effluent decreased to 1 1 mg po4 3 p l 0 5 mg po4 3 p l and 0 2 mg po4 3 p l respectively thus 30 mg l was selected as the required fecl3 dose for economic evaluation and to assess the omp and virus removal efficiency 3 4 energetic evaluation fig 3 represents the energy flow in the wwtp based on cept a and hras b the hras based configuration had a higher energy demand for cod removal 0 1 kwh m3 wastewater due to aeration 0 07 kwh m3 wastewater and sludge recirculation 0 03 kwh m3 wastewater moreover considering that partial nh4 removal is achieved in this unit the energy demand of the pn amx unit was 0 20 kwh m3 wastewater whereas the energy consumption in the pn amx unit of the cept based configuration was higher 0 25 kwh m3 wastewater for the hras based configuration an additional 0 01 kwh m3 wastewater was required to dose the coagulant to enhance po4 3 removal efficiency finally in both alternatives 0 05 kwh m3 of wastewater was needed for i sludge thickening before ad 0 02 kwh m3 of wastewater and ii further sludge dewatering 0 03 kwh m3 of wastewater therefore considering all the energy inputs both configurations presented a comparable energy demand cept 0 36 kwh m3 wastewater fig 3a and hras 0 39 kwh m3 wastewater fig 3b the results of the bmp test were comparable 51 and 52 for cept and hras sludges respectively results of the bmp test are discussed in detail in section s3 in the supporting information since higher cod recovery from wastewater was obtained in the cept based configuration higher methane production was achieved 0 29 kwh m3 of wastewater in comparison with the hras based configuration 0 25 kwh m3 of wastewater the overall wwtp energy balance shows that the cept based wwtp had a lower energy demand 0 07 kwh m3 of wastewater than the hras based wwtp 0 13 kwh m3 of wastewater 3 5 economic evaluation the operational costs include electricity chemicals and sludge management as explained in section 3 4 the cept based wwtp needs up to 0 8 c m3 of wastewater while the hras based wwtp consumes 1 7 c m3 of wastewater fig 4 a 20 higher digested solids production was achieved in the cept alternative 0 23 kg tss m3 of wastewater than in the hras configuration 0 18 kg tss m3 of wastewater due to the higher cod recovery and the presence of higher concentrations of inorganics in cept sludge detailed information for solid production is presented in section s4 in the supplementary information this results in 1 9 and 1 4 c m3 of wastewater for cept and hras based wwtps respectively fig 4 finally the coagulant contributes 3 3 and 0 7 c m3 of wastewater to the cept and hras configurations respectively considering all costs the cept alternative had significantly higher operational costs 6 0 c m3 of wastewater in comparison with the hras based configuration 3 8 c m3 of wastewater note that the most optimistic situation for the cept based configuration was evaluated and operational costs would be higher if an external alkalinity supply was required 3 6 fate of omps 3 6 1 cept most omps are poorly removed during cept however some authors reported that the different compositions of wastewater can play a major role in omp elimination for example high fat content in wastewater was reported to improve the removal of hydrophobic compounds kd 2000 l kg tss table 4 in contrast the presence of codsol might inhibit the omp removal efficiency due to the preference of the coagulant for codsol choi et al 2008 vieno et al 2006 a medium low removal efficiency 38 55 of hydrophobic omps adbi ahtn hhcb and tcs was obtained fig 5 this was attributed to the sorbed fraction of these omps into tss in accordance with suarez et al 2009 for hydrophilic compounds including anti inflammatories antibiotics neurodrugs and hormones the removal efficiencies were below 31 in accordance with other authors bodzek and dudziak 2006 suarez et al 2009 westerhoff et al 2005 however these results were in contrast to others who suggest that omps with pka close to 7 such as ibp smx or npx are removed efficiently in the cept process by precipitation metal salts are added to the wastewater carballa et al 2005 luo et al 2014 suarez et al 2009 3 6 2 hras fig 5 compares the removal efficiency of omps achieved in the hras reactor with that in the cept process the omps were classified into three groups according to their behaviour in this biological unit the omps with kbiol values 10 l kg vss d table 5 such as e1 e2 ibp adbi ahtn hhcb and tcs group i are much better removed in the hras 80 unit than in the cept one for musk fragrances and tcs biotransformation and sorption onto sludge significantly contributed to their removal due to the high kd values table 4 even though the applied hrt in this work is much lower than in cas reactors and the kbiol for this group of omps are generally lower than those reported by other authors under nitrifying conditions table 5 these omps are efficiently removed under heterotrophic conditions group ii includes omps such as npx rox dzp ee2 smx and flx presenting kinetic constants in the range 1 10 l gvss d and biotransformation efficiencies between 20 and 55 fig 5 these removal efficiencies were in general lower than those found in cas reactors and attributed to i the lower kbiol values in comparison with those reported in cas reactors for omps such as rox ee2 and flx table 5 indicating the role of nitrifiers in the biotransformation of most omps fernandez fontaina et al 2016 men et al 2017 and ii the low hrt that kinetically limits the biotransformation of omps such as npx or dzp which present comparable or higher kbiol values under heterotrophic conditions finally the group iii omps such as ery ctl dcf tmp and cbz have kbiol values lower than 1 l gvss d table 5 and subsequent biotransformation efficiencies below 25 fig 5 for ery and ctl the kbiol values are much lower than those reported in cas systems table 5 in contrast dcf tmp and cbz are not removed in the hras or the cas reactors moreover there was no noticeable reduction in omp concentration 15 after treating the hras reactor effluent with 30 mg l fecl3 data not shown this was attributed to an analytical deviation and the addition of chemicals in the secondary clarifiers did not improve omp removal efficiency the comparison between the reactor types showed that group i omps exhibited considerably higher biotransformation efficiency in the hras reactor while the elimination efficiencies of group ii and iii were comparable this study shows that hras is a more effective technology than cept in terms of omps removal but further research is needed to evaluate the fate of omps in novel wwtps 3 7 virus removal recovery efficiencies were generally high demonstrating minimal viral genome loss during the extraction rt qpcr process with the exception of hav all the other enteric viruses were detected in the untreated and treated wastewater fig 6 gi and gii nov were found at mean concentrations of 6 70 log10 copies l and 6 05 log10 copies l respectively whereas sav was detected at a mean concentration of 4 52 log10 copies l these values are in the range of those found in wastewater in different geographic areas including usa japan and tunisia ito et al 2017 schmitz et al 2016 varela et al 2018 3 7 1 cept the results show that nov gi exhibited the greatest reduction 1 3 log units 94 5 followed by nov gii 0 5 log units 66 5 and sav 0 4 log units 62 2 fig 6 these removal efficiencies were similar to those reported by other authors in wwtps based on cas reactors or trickling filters for a variety of viruses including nov sav and aichi virus schmitz et al 2016 varela et al 2018 3 7 2 hras the viral reductions in the hras were in general higher than those in the cept unit fig 6 the mean reductions for nov gi nov gii and sav were 1 3 log units 1 4 log units and 1 2 log units respectively these values are similar to those reported for advanced wwtps such as the five stage bardenpho treatment schmitz et al 2016 the hras system was originally designed to enhance nutrient removal and viral reduction could be attributed to greater virus adsorption to suspended particles some differences in the removal efficiencies of viruses in the hras reactor were observed between the sampling campaigns indicating that slight variations in the physicochemical parameters ph tss cod divalent cations srt etc may affect virus removal likewise for omps a reduction in virus concentration was not observed after treating the hras reactor effluent with 30 mg l fecl3 the influence of the wwtp configurations and operational conditions on the efficiency of viral removal has studied previously li et al 2011 schmitz et al 2016 and virus aggregation disaggregation is cited as one of the main causes for viral resistance to diverse chemical compounds gerba and betancourt 2017 viral aggregation could be responsible for inaccurate estimations of removal during different treatment processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis which are generally considered more efficient than cas this study is limited in that we could not differentiate live viruses or whether the reductions are due to physical removal or damage to the nucleic acid affecting detection by qpcr further studies are needed to clarify these aspects 4 conclusions similar cod removal efficiencies were achieved in hras and cept although the former has lower recovery due to the partial oxidation of the influent cod the concentration of nh4 was not affected in the cept process and there was a minimum po4 3 removal of 99 in the hras reactor both compounds are poorly eliminated 20 although with post treatment with 30 mg l fecl3 comparable results for po4 3 removal to those of the cept unit were attained under these conditions the hras based configuration had higher energy demand than cept however the former had lower operational costs in general higher omp removal efficiencies were achieved in the hras system although results were comparable and low for recalcitrant compounds 25 the hras configuration presents a higher potential for viral removal than cept but significant variations in performance in terms of virus type were observed therefore hras had slightly higher energy demand than cept but considerably lower operational costs and greater omp and virus removal and appears a

18361,stormwater biofilters have great potential to treat stormwater for harvesting and reuse but their variable performance in pathogen removal requires further optimisation prior to widespread uptake this paper provides the first evidence that real time control rtc of stormwater biofilters can mitigate the impact of operational characteristics that result in poor microbial removal we developed two rtc strategies and validated them using long term laboratory experiments utilising biofilters with a raised outlet pipe that creates a submerged zone the first rtc strategy focuses on delivering the best water quality for harvesting and reuse or for recreational waterways it has two components which ensure adequate treatment microbial die off 1 it retains water in the biofilter for at least two days before allowing any further inputs into the system and 2 the input volume is restricted to the submerged zone s pore volume this strategy was effective and significantly improved water quality in the biofilter effluent however since the system favours bypassing influent to ensure good quality effluent only 28 4 of the stormwater was treated this still resulted in a 62 3 reduction in the influent e coli load because the system was effective at removing e coli under controlled conditions the second rtc strategy builds upon the first strategy and focuses on delivering a balance between good water quality for harvesting and protecting the environment i e lower bypass three hours before the next rainfall event begins the water that has remained in the biofilter s submerged zone for at least two days is drained and collected for harvesting through a bottom pipe when stormwater inflow begins the bottom pipe is closed and the biofilter operates without control with water leaving the biofilter to the environment via the raised outlet pipe the harvested effluent of this rtc strategy met the australian stormwater harvesting guideline requirements for dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use and irrigation of commercial food crops although only 5 4 of stormwater was collected for harvesting in this strategy the environment was better protected because of a significantly reduced bypass volume our experiments also showed that the nutrient and sediment removal was high for both rtc strategies this study presents the first stepping stone toward rtc of stormwater biofilters demonstrating that these systems can deliver safe stormwater for harvesting and reuse and for active recreational uses graphical abstract image 1 keywords stormwater biofilters real time control stormwater harvesting stormwater reuse microbial removal e coli 1 introduction stormwater runoff could serve as an alternative water resource for local communities mitchell et al 2007 however the wide range of pollutants it contains limit the application of stormwater harvesting and reuse fletcher et al 2008 in particular faecal microbes contained in stormwater are a major concern as they could pose considerable risks to human health meng et al 2018 murphy et al 2017 as such several guidelines of stormwater harvesting and reuse have been established in australia and globally to strictly control the risk posed by faecal microbes under different end uses nhmrc 2008 nhmrc 2009 one way to control the risks during stormwater harvesting and reuse is to treat stormwater prior to reuse and stormwater biofilters have been widely adopted to achieve this aim bratieres et al 2008 hathaway et al 2011 hatt et al 2009 zinger et al 2011 stormwater biofilters are soil plant systems with enhanced infiltration and evapotranspiration and have been proved effective in the control of nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorous microbes and heavy metals fawb 2009 the major processes for microbial removal in biofilters include adsorption desorption straining and die off and these processes are governed by various factors such as temperature moisture content and sunlight exposure chandrasena et al 2014a stevik et al 2004 biofilters achieve higher faecal microbial removal rates compared to other passive treatment systems e g wetlands and green roofs chandrasena et al 2012 czemiel berndtsson 2010 davies and bavor 2000 hathaway and hunt 2010 somewhat owing to the level of research dedicated to optimise their design features for example microbial removal can be enhanced through careful plant and media selection chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2012 2016 as well as through the presence of a submerged anoxic zone i e a submerged waterbody at the base of a biofilter to help plants survive in dry weather periods and to enhance microbe contact time with media and plant rhizosphere chandrasena et al 2014b however even with optimal design features stormwater biofilters still experience variable performance for example e coli reductions between inlet and outlet could vary between 99 to net leaching 0 under challenging operational conditions chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 2011 further examples exist for other reference pathogens such as campylobacter spp chandrasena et al 2016 reported its removal rate ranging from 90 5 to 99 1 even with optimised design parameters the negative impact of some operational conditions could not be mitigated explaining the high variability in treatment performance according to previous studies three types of operational conditions mainly contributed to poor pathogen removal via stormwater biofilters short dry weather periods between wet weather events e g 12 h can result in insufficient time for the die off of microbes trapped in the system thereby causing detachment and leaching of viable organisms to the outlet even if the influent is clean chandrasena et al 2012 long dry weather periods between events e g 14 days can impact biological and mechanical removal processes biologically the fact that clean submerged zone water is taken up by plants during dry days results in poor plant health due to insufficient water and can therefore negatively affect microbial removal performance li et al 2012 naumburg et al 2005 in addition this will also lead to a higher pollutant concentration in effluent during the subsequent event due to a high proportion of new influent with limited retention time chandrasena et al 2014b mechanically the occurrence of soil cracks during extended dry periods can cause preferential flow in the next wet event and therefore jeopardise the removal performance rusciano and obropta 2007 and large inflow volumes e g biofilters pore volume can result in full occupation of straining and adsorption sites in biofilters thereby leading to the breakthrough of microbes zhang et al 2010 this can be further exacerbated by diluting the clean submerged zone water with newly applied influent resulting in lower removal rates chandrasena et al 2014b the operational conditions described above are recognised as governing much of the microbial removal performance of biofilters given that biofilters were primarily designed as passive treatment systems they have so far mostly been implemented for environmental protection purposes rather than harvesting and reuse as a result very little has been done to date to control operational conditions and eliminate minimise their negative effects real time control rtc is a technique that offers the opportunity to actively influence these operational conditions the general concept of rtc is defined as monitoring the functioning of a system in real time and using collected data to optimise performance through the control of certain aspects of the system schütze et al 2004 rtc has been widely used and proved to be effective in other areas such as flooding control capacity enlargement of sewer systems and wastewater treatment optimisation hsu et al 2015 leon et al 2014 schilling et al 1996 schütze et al 2004 however no research has been published on the application of rtc in stormwater biofilters this study aims to further improve the effluent water quality of biofilters in order to reduce the human health risks posed by faecal microbes during stormwater harvesting and reuse its main objective was to develop and validate the first reported rtc strategies for the optimisation of stormwater biofilters with our key hypothesis being that the regulation and control of certain operational conditions can lead to enhanced faecal microbe removal in particular we hypothesise that controlling the total amount of stormwater filtered during each wet weather event combined with controlling the frequency of inflow can yield significantly improved treatment of faecal microbes in this study two different rtc strategies were developed and tested using laboratory experiments mimicking real rainfall events and drying patterns that were recorded in melbourne australia this study presents the first attempt of employing rtc to optimise the operation of stormwater biofilters revealing the potential of exploring this novel application 2 methods 2 1 key design features of biofilters a typical biofilter with submerged zone consists of three main parts fig 1 1 the ponding zone creating a temporary store for incoming stormwater 2 the unsaturated zone that consists of filter media with plants grown on the top and 3 the submerged zone saturated zone sz which is created by a raised outflow pipe raised outflow pipe and also consists of filter media and gravel zinger et al 2013 a typical biofilter has three main types of pipes a the inflow pipe that connects to the ponding zone to convey inflow to biofilters b the raised outflow pipe that discharges treated stormwater and c the bottom outflow pipe that is available for maintenance purposes and normally locked by a valve during normal operation a bypass pipe might also be included to convey excess stormwater to the receiving waterbodies 2 2 rtc strategy development the major objective of rtc strategies is to deliver on both stormwater harvesting outcomes i e better water quality for different end uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing and environmental protection e g minimum pathogens for swimming in waterbodies and low nutrients for ecosystem health to achieve this objective we need to mitigate the negative effects caused by the three main operational characteristics leading to poor pathogen removal performance in biofilters as previously described short dry weather periods long dry weather periods and large inflow volume events another objective of rtc strategy development is to ensure the implementation solutions for the strategies are simple and flexible both for new systems and for retrofit scenarios i e favour strategies that require low maintenance and are low cost based on these objectives two possible rtc strategies were developed and tested in this study a rtc strategy 1 harvesting and b rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment we anticipate that other strategies exist and the objectives presented here can be used to further test and explore other rtc strategies including those that have different objectives 2 2 1 rtc strategy 1 harvesting the rtc strategy 1 harvesting shown in fig 2 collects as much clean water as possible for the purpose of harvesting and reuse this strategy allows for easy retrofits with no below surface amendments nor any within system monitoring the only equipment required for this strategy includes fig 2 top left 1 a flow meter or depth gauge with weir to estimate inflow volumes v in 2 a valve in the inflow pipe inlet valve to control stormwater entering bypassing the system and 3 a timer to monitor the time the water from a previous event has remained in system t time monitoring could be achieved via a number of ways e g a logger with a timer which is reset when a certain level increase is detected in the submerged zone by a pressure sensor or moisture sensor to ensure adequate microbial die off which is linked to sufficient detention time this strategy controls the inflow by passing it around the system if the water from the previous event has not remained in biofilters for at least t min minimum required retention time for sufficient die off if t t min the inlet valve is kept closed and all the stormwater is bypassed fig 2 top right if t sz t min the inlet valve is opened to allow inflow and v in is recorded fig 2 bottom left to further enhance the water quality it is important to collect only the water that has been sufficiently treated and avoid mixing it with incoming newly treated water which is normally of high pollutant concentration due to short contact time this strategy therefore restricts the incoming volume of water during an event by bypassing water once the pore volume of the submerged zone v sz has been exceeded to achieve this when inflow is allowed t sz t min and v in v sz i e submerged zone s pore volume has been fully replaced with newly entered stormwater the inlet valve is closed and the rest of the stormwater is bypassed fig 2 bottom right it is noted that this strategy focuses on the stormwater harvesting outcomes by aiming to maximise the volume and quality of collected water for harvesting purposes it places moderate emphasis on environmental protection as part of the incoming water is bypassed without treatment 2 2 2 rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment the rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment builds upon the first strategy enhancing it by avoiding the bypass of large volumes of untreated stormwater into receiving waterbodies i e this strategy is focussing on balancing both harvesting outcomes and environmental protection this strategy proposes a two outlet system using both the raised outflow pipe and the bottom outflow pipe during operation fig 3 top left the implementation solutions are still simple and flexible as the system does not require flow monitoring equipment for inflow instead it requires a sensor e g water level sensor to provide a binary yes no regarding the occurrence of inflows a timer to record retention time t and a valve in the bottom outflow pipe bottom outlet valve fig 3 top left the only other information required for this strategy is rainfall forecast in melbourne and many other cities around the globe forecasts are freely available from local weather bureaus e g http www bom gov au australia meteye this information can be communicated to biofilters via telemetry in this study the rainfall forecast information was set to be 3 hourly according to the available data in melbourne this could be changed in another study the water is harvested from the bottom outflow pipe only if it has been held for more than t min and inflow is forecast to occur in the near future three hours in this study to be more specific once rainfall forecast informs that the next wet event will occur in three hours 3 h if t t min the bottom outlet valve is kept closed and the treated stormwater continues to be discharged through the raised outflow pipe fig 3 top right or if t t min the bottom outlet valve is opened and the water that is contained within the sz is allowed to drain out the bottom outflow pipe as harvested water fig 3 bottom left it is noted that 3 h is generally long enough to discharge the water retained in biofilters through the bottom outflow pipe fawb 2009 as soon as stormwater inflow begins the bottom outlet valve is closed again and the influent will fill the system and the biofilter operates without real time control with treated effluent leaving via the raised outlet and being delivered to receiving waterbodies fig 3 bottom right 2 3 laboratory set up 2 3 1 experimental biofilter columns both rtc strategies were assessed using a laboratory column study ten biofilter columns were planted with carex appressa using washed sand as the filter media carex appressa is the most common plant type for biofilters in australia and has been proved effective in microbial removal chandrasena et al 2014b while washed sand is also a widely adopted filter media type and favoured for plant growth fawb 2009 the columns all had an identical size fig 1 ponding zone depth h pz 280 mm unsaturated zone depth h usz 500 mm submerged zone depth h sz 440 mm pore volume v pore 20 l submerged zone volume v sz 10 l diameter of bottom area 240 mm these columns were matured for approximately three years prior to use in this project with all columns receiving the same amount and type of input additional details can be found in supplementary material these ten columns were divided into two groups with five replicates each 1 rtc biofilters on which the two rtc strategies were implemented and 2 non rtc biofilters which were operated as typical biofilters i e without any real time control and where the effluent is discharged through the raised outflow pipe 2 3 2 semi natural stormwater mix preparation and pre dosage in this experiment semi natural stormwater was used for dosing it was prepared by mixing de chlorinated tap water with sediments collected from a local stormwater wetland supplementing this mixture with laboratory grade chemicals and spiking it with escherichia coli e coli as a faecal microbial indicator to mimic pollutant concentrations reported in a worldwide review of stormwater quality duncan 1999 mccarthy et al 2008 nhmrc 2009 the processes and recipe for semi natural stormwater preparation are described in chandrasena et al 2017 just prior to the sampling events in this experiment all the biofilters were dosed with the semi natural stormwater mix twice a week corresponding to the rainfall frequency in melbourne for three months ensuring the plants were healthy and acclimatised to this experiment s operational conditions each time the dosed volume for each column was 13 l representing the average rainfall event size 5 75 mm in melbourne and assuming the biofilters are sized to 2 of their impervious catchment area fawb 2009 2 3 3 design of dosing sampling events eleven events were designed to simulate 11 selected historical rainfall events in melbourne from 2007 to 2016 to fully assess the use of rtc under different operational conditions we selected events of different sizes antecedent weather conditions and pollution levels table 1 three typical event sizes were selected large size l with around 17 68 mm per event equivalent to 40 l dosing volume twice the pore volume of a column which represents a 1 in 3 month average recurrence interval ari small size s with around 4 42 mm per event 10 l dosing volume same as the submerged zone volume and median size m with around 8 84 mm per event 20 l dosing volume 1 pore volume representing 1 in 1 month ari the 11 events also have three different lengths of antecedent dry weather periods long dry l with 14 antecedent dry days short dry s with 2 antecedent dry days 2 days is shorter than the average rainfall interval in melbourne and die off was considered as insufficient if the retention time 2 days as per chandrasena 2014 and median dry m in which 2 days antecedent dry days 14 days finally three types of inflow concentrations were designed when spiking the semi natural stormwater with e coli high large concentration l with a magnitude of 105 mpn 100 ml low small concentration s with a magnitude of 102 mpn 100 ml and median concentration m with a magnitude of 104 mpn 100 ml 2 3 4 implementation of rtc strategies and sampling regime to assess the two rtc strategies two rounds of experiments were conducted table 1 in round 1 rtc strategy 1 harvesting was implemented for all 11 sampling events subsequently in round 2 these sampling events were repeated with the implementation of rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment as previously mentioned in this study for both rtc strategies 1 the minimum required retention time for the water contained in biofilters t min was set as two days according to the findings reported in chandrasena 2014 and 2 the rainfall forecast information was set to 3 hourly according to local availability of information and taking into account that 3 h is generally long enough to discharge the water retained in biofilters through the bottom outflow pipe fawb 2009 it is noted that different set points could be applied in other studies to balance competing objectives for both rounds the rtc biofilters were operated according to the rules described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 in round 1 harvesting for rtc biofilters in each sampling event with normal or extended dry period t min i e 2 days dosing was stopped when the inflow volume v in reached the submerged zone volume v sz 10 l to simulate bypass flow in round 2 it was assumed that perfect rainfall forecasting information was available i e no uncertainties were caused by inaccurate forecast this assumption is based on 1 previous research on biofilters without a sz which show that they still perform adequately during dry weather periods chandrasena et al 2012 and 2 the local rainfall pattern with an average of 3 rainfall events per week this assumption allowed simplicity in implementation and could fully reveal the benefits of rtc strategy 2 no historical rainfall forecast archive was available for this study and future work will be conducted to explore the uncertainties caused by inaccurate rainfall forecast for sampling events that had an antecedent dry weather period of t min or greater the water retained in rtc biofilters was discharged in advance through the bottom outflow pipe and this discharge started 3 h prior to dosing during both rounds non rtc biofilters were operated as typical biofilters without real time control as that showed in fig 1 receiving and treating all the dosed stormwater these served as experiment controls for comparison to the rtc biofilters during each dosing sampling event inflow was sampled at the beginning middle and end of the dosing period these were mixed to create a composite inflow sample to estimate infiltration rates a ruler in each column was used to record the instantaneous water depths in the ponding zone at regular intervals 3 75 min the outflow sampling regime varied between different types of biofilters and strategies for rtc biofilters two types of composite outflow samples were collected in each sampling event rtc harvesting outflow i e the outflow harvested for different end uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing and rtc environment outflow i e the outflow discharged to the environment e g to waterbodies and ecosystems in round 1 rtc1 harvesting outflow stands for rtc harvesting outflow in round 1 similarly hereinafter was collected from the raised outflow pipe during stage 2 a in fig 2 while rtc1 environment outflow was the stormwater that bypassed to the environment without treatment same quality as inflow during stage 1 and 2b in in round 2 rtc2 harvesting outflow was the water that discharged from the bottom outflow pipe prior to a rainfall event during stage 2 a in fig 3 while rtc2 environment outflow was the treated outflow that discharged via the raised outflow pipe when rtc biofilters were operated without real time control during stage 1 and 2b in fig 3 for non rtc biofilters the composite sample collected from the raised outflow pipe was labelled non rtc outflow non rtc1 outflow for round 1 and non rtc2 outflow for round 2 non rtc outflow could initially be considered as either being harvested or discharged to the environment depending on the results for the water quality please refer to fig a 1 round 1 and fig a 2 round 2 in the supplementary material to see the above described outflow samples in relation to the biofilter set up 2 4 sample and data analysis all inflow and outflow samples were transported on ice to the environmental and public health microbiology laboratory ephm lab for enumeration of e coli using the colilert method idexx laboratories 2007 within 8 h of dosing according to mccarthy et al 2008 this storage time would cause no significant difference in e coli concentrations the analysis results were considered as the event mean concentrations to analyse the impact of rtc and operational conditions on the removal of sediment and nutrients important for environmental protection purposes the above samples were also tested for tss total suspended solids tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen for the last three events of each round of experiments events 9 10 and 11 these three events had the same levels of inflow concentrations and volumes but different antecedent dry lengths as we assumed that the dry weather length impacts the removal of tss tp and tn most bratieres et al 2008 zinger et al 2013 the samples were tested in nata national association of testing authorities australia accredited laboratories using standard methods tss method 2540 d in apha awwa wef 2005 tp and tn method 4500 p j in apha awwa wef 2005 removal of e coli is presented both in the form of concentration removal and log reduction which is the difference between the logarithmic base 10 inflow concentration and the logarithmic outflow concentration the microbial concentrations in the outflow were compared with two harvesting reuse guidelines in australia the guidelines for managing risks in recreational water nhmrc 2008 and the australian guidelines for water recycling nhmrc 2009 the impact of sediment and nutrients on the environment was assessed using the urban stormwater best practice environmental management bpem guidelines csiro 1999 which ensure that stormwater management meets the state environment protection policy waters objectives for victoria australia analysis of variance anova was adopted for pollutant removal and infiltration rate comparisons before the analysis the data of e coli log reduction and infiltration rate were analysed for normality using the shapiro wilk test the results showed that while the infiltration rate data and the e coli log reduction data for rtc biofilters were all normally distributed the e coli log reduction data for non rtc biofilters were non normally distributed although non parametric analysis is generally recommended for non normally distributed data the available non parametric analytical methods are limited to testing the influence of a single factor rather than the possible interactions between different individual factors kirk 2008 in addition even when the normality assumption is not verified anova is still considered a robust test if a low p value e g p 0 001 can be achieved kirk 2008 therefore a series of anova along with post hoc tests tukey hsd was still performed a three way anova was conducted to study whether the observed e coli log reductions were affected by dry period length event size or inflow concentration two more three way anova were carried out to analyse whether the e coli concentrations log reductions were affected by the biofilter type i e rtc or non rtc round and event in this study we used unadjusted p values were used rather than correcting for multiple comparisons indeed it has been shown that the probability of type ii errors might be increased by correcting for multiple comparisons e g using bonferroni adjustment o brien 1983 perneger 1998 1999 and adjustment was considered inappropriate because specific a priori hypotheses were formed about which parameters are significant mccarthy et al 2013 in each round for each type of biofilters several water balance calculations were made stormwater volume harvested v harvest v in

strategy 1 harvesting for rtc strategy 1 harvesting the treated stormwater from rtc biofilters rtc1 harvesting outflow met the requirement for secondary contact recreation in australia median concentration 1000 e coli 100 ml as per nhmrc 2008 however the outflow from non rtc biofilters non rtc1 outflow had more microbial pollution median log reduction was 2 7 times lower and did not meet the guidelines table 2 non rtc1 outflow was therefore assumed to be discharged to the environment the 5th percentile log reduction of rtc1 harvesting outflow was 1 01 meaning that in the vast majority cases at least 1 log reduction could be achieved for rtc biofilters the negative value of the 5th percentile log reduction for non rtc1 outflow 1 75 occurred during the short dry events during which no water was collected for harvesting for rtc biofilters in which the trapped microbes were flushed out by the inflow with low microbial concentrations before experiencing sufficient die off similar to what chandrasena et al 2012 found all these results indicate the effectiveness of rtc strategy 1 harvesting in increasing harvesting benefits however for rtc biofilters 60 of the stormwater volume directly bypassed the biofilter without treatment median e coli of 2 68 104 mpn 100 ml while 100 of the stormwater was treated by non rtc biofilters median e coli of 6 87 103 mpn 100 ml this explains why the e coli load reduction in the rtc biofilters was 62 3 as compared to 83 1 for the non rtc biofilters the impact of antecedent dry length event size and inflow concentration on harvesting was also analysed based on the detailed experimental results for each event fig a 3 and fig a 4 supplementary material as expected due to the design of the strategy event size did not impact the volume or quality of rtc1 harvesting outflow p 0 481 three way anova in each event the volume of inflow that allowed to enter rtc biofilters was exactly the submerged zone volume however both antecedent dry length and the inflow concentration impacted the water quality for harvesting p 0 003 and 0 023 respectively three way anova the pollutant concentrations of rtc1 harvesting outflow samples collected after long dry periods were higher than those collected after median dry periods by design no stormwater was harvested after short dry periods indeed the low moisture content in biofilters after long dry periods increases potential preferential flow paths hatt et al 2007 this hypothesis was confirmed by increased infiltration rates that shown in fig a 5 in supplementary material and accordingly the likelihood of the retained stormwater being mixed with newly applied stormwater similarly rtc1 harvesting outflow was of lower quality i e higher pollutant concentration in the effluent during high concentration inflow events compared to median concentration inflow events mainly due to the mixing of old and new water 3 1 2 round 2 rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment for rtc strategy 2 rtc2 harvesting outflow collected prior to dosing from the bottom outflow pipe of rtc biofilters was extremely clean it could meet both the requirement of dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use or irrigation of commercial food crops median concentration 1 e coli 100 ml as per nhmrc 2009 and the requirement for secondary contact recreation in australia nhmrc 2008 table 2 non rtc2 outflow met neither meaning that it is also assumed for round 2 that non rtc outflows2 is discharged to the environment since this rtc strategy continues to treat the incoming stormwater after the harvesting has finished the water quality released to the environment rtc2 environment outflow was similar to that of the non rtc outflow p 0 926 one way anova indicating that the biofilters operated with rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment would not cause any additional pollution compared to the biofilters without real time control non rtc furthermore 100 of the stormwater was treated by both rtc and non rtc biofilters in round 2 meaning that the load reductions were comparable 93 7 vs 92 8 table 2 neither event size nor inflow concentration were significant factors for rtc2 harvesting outflow p 0 761 and 0 179 respectively three way anova this was to be expected due to the fact that rtc2 harvesting outflow entirely came from the previous event s water it mainly depended on 1 the water volume and quality in previous events and 2 the length of the antecedent dry weather period the detailed results fig a 6 and fig a 7 supplementary material show that harvesting water was collected only from events with median dry periods no rtc harvesting outflow was collected after short dry periods by design and after long dry periods biofilters had very low moisture content due to the extensive evapotranspiration resulting in the water contained in the pores being held by the filter media this explains why only 5 4 of the total stormwater volume was harvested from rtc biofilters in round 2 table 2 whilst this amount is a lot less than anticipated and drastically affects the cost effectiveness of this solution this volume is not completely insignificant and could still partly supply the residential indoor water use for low density residential areas e g 31 2 of the residential indoor use water volume in melbourne and 62 8 of that in brisbane as per mitchell et al 2008 3 1 3 comparison of two rtc strategies we propose that the improved microbial removal rates observed in the rtc columns compared to removal rates observed in the non rtc columns in round 1 and round 2 were both mainly derived from the implementation of rtc strategies rather than the inherent differences between biofilters this was because 1 at the start of each round there was no significant difference between the infiltration rates of rtc biofilters and those of non rtc biofilters p 0 518 two way anova round and biofilter type and 2 compared to the type of biofilters time was a much more significant factor to the change of infiltration rates through the experiments with much lower p value and p 0 001 in three way anova round biofilter type and time it is also proposed that the fact that we implemented the two strategies in series instead of in parallel caused no significant impact to the performance of rtc biofilters in round 1 and in round 2 although in the three way anova of the log reductions of e coli concentration round is a significant factor p 0 001 significant interaction was found between round and biofilter type p 0 001 and between round and event p 0 001 similar results were found in the three way anova of e coli concentrations actually when comparing the overall performance of non rtc biofilters in round 1 with that in round 2 after the elimination of the interactive factors i e one way anova round as the only factor there was no significant difference as comparable e coli log reductions p 0 353 one way anova and concentrations p 0 394 one way anova in non rtc outflow were observed in the rounds in addition there were no significant differences between the inflow concentrations of e coli in the two rounds p 0 187 one way anova although they were not exactly the same due to the continuous e coli growth die off during spiking these results enabled a comparison between the two strategies compared to strategy 1 harvesting strategy 2 harvesting environment delivered both higher quality of harvested water median e coli concentration 1 mpn 100 ml vs 740 mpn 100 ml and higher quality of environmental discharges total load removal 93 7 vs 62 3 table 2 the lower quality of rtc1 harvesting outflow can be explained by the desorption of microbes trapped in the biofilter media and plant roots due to the hydraulic head created on top of the filter media by the incoming water vs free draining water for round 2 chandrasena et al 2014b while this in turn also means that the resident water was more likely to be mixed with newly entered stormwater whereas rtc1 harvesting outflow only contained old clean water however as a sacrifice the total volume of harvested water collected in round 2 is much lower than that in round 1 5 4 vs 28 4 table 2 due to the amount and load of untreated bypassed water in round 1 3 2 impact of rtc on tss tp and tn removal fig 4 shows that total load removal patterns for tss tn and tp in the outflows that discharged to the environment i e rtc environment outflow for rtc biofilters non rtc outflow for non rtc biofilters followed the e coli removal patterns discussed above for events 9 10 and 11 in round 1 since rtc1 environment outflow only consisted of bypassed stormwater it was of zero treatment as opposed to non rtc biofilters therefore the total load removal rate of tss tp or tn was respectively much lower than non rtc1 outflow and was failed to meet the requirements in the urban stormwater bpem guidelines csiro 1999 however in round 2 rtc2 environment outflow still met these requirements and had similar total removal rates as non rtc2 outflow given that all the inflow of rtc biofilters was treated it should be noted that since only three events were selected to test for tss tn and tp the total removal rates could be different if all events were included the detailed performance of each type of biofilters in tss tp and tn removal during each tested event of each round can be found in supplementary material regarding the water collected for harvesting rtc1 harvesting outflows for tss and tp were negatively impacted by long dry weather periods with higher pollutant concentrations event 11 indeed the filter media can remobilise under low moisture conditions and be flushed out in the next event also releasing mainly particulate bound phosphorous bratieres et al 2008 payne et al 2014 for rtc2 harvesting outflow it was only collected in event 9 median dry event and was of similar quality compared to non rtc2 outflow no rtc2 harvesting outflow was available in event 10 short dry event insufficient retention time or event 11 long dry event all the clean sz water was held by the filter media 3 3 future strategies and practical implementation future strategies should be explored for the use of rtc with stormwater biofilters including for use in areas that have different contexts drivers and objectives we believe future application and research in this area should consider the following the set points of the two strategies used in this experiment e g minimum required retention time t min 2 days might be different when the strategies are applied in another biofilter and or with different climate conditions and inflow features the set points may need to be adjusted in newly developed rtc strategies to increase the harvested water volume in rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment a possible method in practice could be to enlarge the submerged zone sz volume of biofilters during the design process a larger sz could also supply plants with more water to resist extended dry weather periods the cost effectiveness of enlarging sz volumes should be evaluated in future work during the implementation of rtc strategy 1 harvesting the maximum volume of stormwater that entered biofilters in a single event was the submerged zone volume however we underestimated the water holding capacity of the soil and suggest that additional stormwater could be allowed to enter biofilters without causing any discharge of newly entered water we know that extended retention time t min is crucial for microbial and nutrient removal but we suggest that a maximum retention time t max could help with mitigating the impact of extended antecedent dry weather periods depending on the particular end uses and other pollutants of concern the impact of rtc strategies on other pollutants such as heavy metals needs to be further investigated finally no historical rainfall forecast archive was available in this study and future work should be conducted to explore the potential uncertainties caused by inaccurate rainfall forecast these uncertainties would be differently affected depending on the local rainfall patterns for areas with less frequent rain events for example where biofilters would experience a long dry period without any water in the sz future work could explore the potential use of other sources of water to maintain treatment performance 4 conclusion this study presents the first attempt to apply rtc in stormwater biofilters assessing two strategies that are easy and cheap to implement both in newly developed systems and for the retrofit of existing systems the work confirmed our key hypotheses demonstrating that active control of stormwater biofilters can mitigate the detrimental effects that short dry weather periods long dry weather periods and large inflow volumes have on the treatment of faecal microbes indeed both rtc strategies were effective in reducing the risks posed by faecal microbes during stormwater harvesting and reuse although rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment provided less volume of water for harvesting as compared to rtc strategy 1 harvesting it was able to 1 provide treated harvested water that meets both the requirement of dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use or irrigation of commercial food crops nhmrc 2009 and the requirement for secondary contact recreation in australia nhmrc 2008 and 2 discharge water to the environment which met the urban stormwater best practice environmental management guidelines csiro 1999 this being the first reported rtc of

18361,stormwater biofilters have great potential to treat stormwater for harvesting and reuse but their variable performance in pathogen removal requires further optimisation prior to widespread uptake this paper provides the first evidence that real time control rtc of stormwater biofilters can mitigate the impact of operational characteristics that result in poor microbial removal we developed two rtc strategies and validated them using long term laboratory experiments utilising biofilters with a raised outlet pipe that creates a submerged zone the first rtc strategy focuses on delivering the best water quality for harvesting and reuse or for recreational waterways it has two components which ensure adequate treatment microbial die off 1 it retains water in the biofilter for at least two days before allowing any further inputs into the system and 2 the input volume is restricted to the submerged zone s pore volume this strategy was effective and significantly improved water quality in the biofilter effluent however since the system favours bypassing influent to ensure good quality effluent only 28 4 of the stormwater was treated this still resulted in a 62 3 reduction in the influent e coli load because the system was effective at removing e coli under controlled conditions the second rtc strategy builds upon the first strategy and focuses on delivering a balance between good water quality for harvesting and protecting the environment i e lower bypass three hours before the next rainfall event begins the water that has remained in the biofilter s submerged zone for at least two days is drained and collected for harvesting through a bottom pipe when stormwater inflow begins the bottom pipe is closed and the biofilter operates without control with water leaving the biofilter to the environment via the raised outlet pipe the harvested effluent of this rtc strategy met the australian stormwater harvesting guideline requirements for dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use and irrigation of commercial food crops although only 5 4 of stormwater was collected for harvesting in this strategy the environment was better protected because of a significantly reduced bypass volume our experiments also showed that the nutrient and sediment removal was high for both rtc strategies this study presents the first stepping stone toward rtc of stormwater biofilters demonstrating that these systems can deliver safe stormwater for harvesting and reuse and for active recreational uses graphical abstract image 1 keywords stormwater biofilters real time control stormwater harvesting stormwater reuse microbial removal e coli 1 introduction stormwater runoff could serve as an alternative water resource for local communities mitchell et al 2007 however the wide range of pollutants it contains limit the application of stormwater harvesting and reuse fletcher et al 2008 in particular faecal microbes contained in stormwater are a major concern as they could pose considerable risks to human health meng et al 2018 murphy et al 2017 as such several guidelines of stormwater harvesting and reuse have been established in australia and globally to strictly control the risk posed by faecal microbes under different end uses nhmrc 2008 nhmrc 2009 one way to control the risks during stormwater harvesting and reuse is to treat stormwater prior to reuse and stormwater biofilters have been widely adopted to achieve this aim bratieres et al 2008 hathaway et al 2011 hatt et al 2009 zinger et al 2011 stormwater biofilters are soil plant systems with enhanced infiltration and evapotranspiration and have been proved effective in the control of nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorous microbes and heavy metals fawb 2009 the major processes for microbial removal in biofilters include adsorption desorption straining and die off and these processes are governed by various factors such as temperature moisture content and sunlight exposure chandrasena et al 2014a stevik et al 2004 biofilters achieve higher faecal microbial removal rates compared to other passive treatment systems e g wetlands and green roofs chandrasena et al 2012 czemiel berndtsson 2010 davies and bavor 2000 hathaway and hunt 2010 somewhat owing to the level of research dedicated to optimise their design features for example microbial removal can be enhanced through careful plant and media selection chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2012 2016 as well as through the presence of a submerged anoxic zone i e a submerged waterbody at the base of a biofilter to help plants survive in dry weather periods and to enhance microbe contact time with media and plant rhizosphere chandrasena et al 2014b however even with optimal design features stormwater biofilters still experience variable performance for example e coli reductions between inlet and outlet could vary between 99 to net leaching 0 under challenging operational conditions chandrasena et al 2014b li et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 2011 further examples exist for other reference pathogens such as campylobacter spp chandrasena et al 2016 reported its removal rate ranging from 90 5 to 99 1 even with optimised design parameters the negative impact of some operational conditions could not be mitigated explaining the high variability in treatment performance according to previous studies three types of operational conditions mainly contributed to poor pathogen removal via stormwater biofilters short dry weather periods between wet weather events e g 12 h can result in insufficient time for the die off of microbes trapped in the system thereby causing detachment and leaching of viable organisms to the outlet even if the influent is clean chandrasena et al 2012 long dry weather periods between events e g 14 days can impact biological and mechanical removal processes biologically the fact that clean submerged zone water is taken up by plants during dry days results in poor plant health due to insufficient water and can therefore negatively affect microbial removal performance li et al 2012 naumburg et al 2005 in addition this will also lead to a higher pollutant concentration in effluent during the subsequent event due to a high proportion of new influent with limited retention time chandrasena et al 2014b mechanically the occurrence of soil cracks during extended dry periods can cause preferential flow in the next wet event and therefore jeopardise the removal performance rusciano and obropta 2007 and large inflow volumes e g biofilters pore volume can result in full occupation of straining and adsorption sites in biofilters thereby leading to the breakthrough of microbes zhang et al 2010 this can be further exacerbated by diluting the clean submerged zone water with newly applied influent resulting in lower removal rates chandrasena et al 2014b the operational conditions described above are recognised as governing much of the microbial removal performance of biofilters given that biofilters were primarily designed as passive treatment systems they have so far mostly been implemented for environmental protection purposes rather than harvesting and reuse as a result very little has been done to date to control operational conditions and eliminate minimise their negative effects real time control rtc is a technique that offers the opportunity to actively influence these operational conditions the general concept of rtc is defined as monitoring the functioning of a system in real time and using collected data to optimise performance through the control of certain aspects of the system schütze et al 2004 rtc has been widely used and proved to be effective in other areas such as flooding control capacity enlargement of sewer systems and wastewater treatment optimisation hsu et al 2015 leon et al 2014 schilling et al 1996 schütze et al 2004 however no research has been published on the application of rtc in stormwater biofilters this study aims to further improve the effluent water quality of biofilters in order to reduce the human health risks posed by faecal microbes during stormwater harvesting and reuse its main objective was to develop and validate the first reported rtc strategies for the optimisation of stormwater biofilters with our key hypothesis being that the regulation and control of certain operational conditions can lead to enhanced faecal microbe removal in particular we hypothesise that controlling the total amount of stormwater filtered during each wet weather event combined with controlling the frequency of inflow can yield significantly improved treatment of faecal microbes in this study two different rtc strategies were developed and tested using laboratory experiments mimicking real rainfall events and drying patterns that were recorded in melbourne australia this study presents the first attempt of employing rtc to optimise the operation of stormwater biofilters revealing the potential of exploring this novel application 2 methods 2 1 key design features of biofilters a typical biofilter with submerged zone consists of three main parts fig 1 1 the ponding zone creating a temporary store for incoming stormwater 2 the unsaturated zone that consists of filter media with plants grown on the top and 3 the submerged zone saturated zone sz which is created by a raised outflow pipe raised outflow pipe and also consists of filter media and gravel zinger et al 2013 a typical biofilter has three main types of pipes a the inflow pipe that connects to the ponding zone to convey inflow to biofilters b the raised outflow pipe that discharges treated stormwater and c the bottom outflow pipe that is available for maintenance purposes and normally locked by a valve during normal operation a bypass pipe might also be included to convey excess stormwater to the receiving waterbodies 2 2 rtc strategy development the major objective of rtc strategies is to deliver on both stormwater harvesting outcomes i e better water quality for different end uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing and environmental protection e g minimum pathogens for swimming in waterbodies and low nutrients for ecosystem health to achieve this objective we need to mitigate the negative effects caused by the three main operational characteristics leading to poor pathogen removal performance in biofilters as previously described short dry weather periods long dry weather periods and large inflow volume events another objective of rtc strategy development is to ensure the implementation solutions for the strategies are simple and flexible both for new systems and for retrofit scenarios i e favour strategies that require low maintenance and are low cost based on these objectives two possible rtc strategies were developed and tested in this study a rtc strategy 1 harvesting and b rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment we anticipate that other strategies exist and the objectives presented here can be used to further test and explore other rtc strategies including those that have different objectives 2 2 1 rtc strategy 1 harvesting the rtc strategy 1 harvesting shown in fig 2 collects as much clean water as possible for the purpose of harvesting and reuse this strategy allows for easy retrofits with no below surface amendments nor any within system monitoring the only equipment required for this strategy includes fig 2 top left 1 a flow meter or depth gauge with weir to estimate inflow volumes v in 2 a valve in the inflow pipe inlet valve to control stormwater entering bypassing the system and 3 a timer to monitor the time the water from a previous event has remained in system t time monitoring could be achieved via a number of ways e g a logger with a timer which is reset when a certain level increase is detected in the submerged zone by a pressure sensor or moisture sensor to ensure adequate microbial die off which is linked to sufficient detention time this strategy controls the inflow by passing it around the system if the water from the previous event has not remained in biofilters for at least t min minimum required retention time for sufficient die off if t t min the inlet valve is kept closed and all the stormwater is bypassed fig 2 top right if t sz t min the inlet valve is opened to allow inflow and v in is recorded fig 2 bottom left to further enhance the water quality it is important to collect only the water that has been sufficiently treated and avoid mixing it with incoming newly treated water which is normally of high pollutant concentration due to short contact time this strategy therefore restricts the incoming volume of water during an event by bypassing water once the pore volume of the submerged zone v sz has been exceeded to achieve this when inflow is allowed t sz t min and v in v sz i e submerged zone s pore volume has been fully replaced with newly entered stormwater the inlet valve is closed and the rest of the stormwater is bypassed fig 2 bottom right it is noted that this strategy focuses on the stormwater harvesting outcomes by aiming to maximise the volume and quality of collected water for harvesting purposes it places moderate emphasis on environmental protection as part of the incoming water is bypassed without treatment 2 2 2 rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment the rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment builds upon the first strategy enhancing it by avoiding the bypass of large volumes of untreated stormwater into receiving waterbodies i e this strategy is focussing on balancing both harvesting outcomes and environmental protection this strategy proposes a two outlet system using both the raised outflow pipe and the bottom outflow pipe during operation fig 3 top left the implementation solutions are still simple and flexible as the system does not require flow monitoring equipment for inflow instead it requires a sensor e g water level sensor to provide a binary yes no regarding the occurrence of inflows a timer to record retention time t and a valve in the bottom outflow pipe bottom outlet valve fig 3 top left the only other information required for this strategy is rainfall forecast in melbourne and many other cities around the globe forecasts are freely available from local weather bureaus e g http www bom gov au australia meteye this information can be communicated to biofilters via telemetry in this study the rainfall forecast information was set to be 3 hourly according to the available data in melbourne this could be changed in another study the water is harvested from the bottom outflow pipe only if it has been held for more than t min and inflow is forecast to occur in the near future three hours in this study to be more specific once rainfall forecast informs that the next wet event will occur in three hours 3 h if t t min the bottom outlet valve is kept closed and the treated stormwater continues to be discharged through the raised outflow pipe fig 3 top right or if t t min the bottom outlet valve is opened and the water that is contained within the sz is allowed to drain out the bottom outflow pipe as harvested water fig 3 bottom left it is noted that 3 h is generally long enough to discharge the water retained in biofilters through the bottom outflow pipe fawb 2009 as soon as stormwater inflow begins the bottom outlet valve is closed again and the influent will fill the system and the biofilter operates without real time control with treated effluent leaving via the raised outlet and being delivered to receiving waterbodies fig 3 bottom right 2 3 laboratory set up 2 3 1 experimental biofilter columns both rtc strategies were assessed using a laboratory column study ten biofilter columns were planted with carex appressa using washed sand as the filter media carex appressa is the most common plant type for biofilters in australia and has been proved effective in microbial removal chandrasena et al 2014b while washed sand is also a widely adopted filter media type and favoured for plant growth fawb 2009 the columns all had an identical size fig 1 ponding zone depth h pz 280 mm unsaturated zone depth h usz 500 mm submerged zone depth h sz 440 mm pore volume v pore 20 l submerged zone volume v sz 10 l diameter of bottom area 240 mm these columns were matured for approximately three years prior to use in this project with all columns receiving the same amount and type of input additional details can be found in supplementary material these ten columns were divided into two groups with five replicates each 1 rtc biofilters on which the two rtc strategies were implemented and 2 non rtc biofilters which were operated as typical biofilters i e without any real time control and where the effluent is discharged through the raised outflow pipe 2 3 2 semi natural stormwater mix preparation and pre dosage in this experiment semi natural stormwater was used for dosing it was prepared by mixing de chlorinated tap water with sediments collected from a local stormwater wetland supplementing this mixture with laboratory grade chemicals and spiking it with escherichia coli e coli as a faecal microbial indicator to mimic pollutant concentrations reported in a worldwide review of stormwater quality duncan 1999 mccarthy et al 2008 nhmrc 2009 the processes and recipe for semi natural stormwater preparation are described in chandrasena et al 2017 just prior to the sampling events in this experiment all the biofilters were dosed with the semi natural stormwater mix twice a week corresponding to the rainfall frequency in melbourne for three months ensuring the plants were healthy and acclimatised to this experiment s operational conditions each time the dosed volume for each column was 13 l representing the average rainfall event size 5 75 mm in melbourne and assuming the biofilters are sized to 2 of their impervious catchment area fawb 2009 2 3 3 design of dosing sampling events eleven events were designed to simulate 11 selected historical rainfall events in melbourne from 2007 to 2016 to fully assess the use of rtc under different operational conditions we selected events of different sizes antecedent weather conditions and pollution levels table 1 three typical event sizes were selected large size l with around 17 68 mm per event equivalent to 40 l dosing volume twice the pore volume of a column which represents a 1 in 3 month average recurrence interval ari small size s with around 4 42 mm per event 10 l dosing volume same as the submerged zone volume and median size m with around 8 84 mm per event 20 l dosing volume 1 pore volume representing 1 in 1 month ari the 11 events also have three different lengths of antecedent dry weather periods long dry l with 14 antecedent dry days short dry s with 2 antecedent dry days 2 days is shorter than the average rainfall interval in melbourne and die off was considered as insufficient if the retention time 2 days as per chandrasena 2014 and median dry m in which 2 days antecedent dry days 14 days finally three types of inflow concentrations were designed when spiking the semi natural stormwater with e coli high large concentration l with a magnitude of 105 mpn 100 ml low small concentration s with a magnitude of 102 mpn 100 ml and median concentration m with a magnitude of 104 mpn 100 ml 2 3 4 implementation of rtc strategies and sampling regime to assess the two rtc strategies two rounds of experiments were conducted table 1 in round 1 rtc strategy 1 harvesting was implemented for all 11 sampling events subsequently in round 2 these sampling events were repeated with the implementation of rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment as previously mentioned in this study for both rtc strategies 1 the minimum required retention time for the water contained in biofilters t min was set as two days according to the findings reported in chandrasena 2014 and 2 the rainfall forecast information was set to 3 hourly according to local availability of information and taking into account that 3 h is generally long enough to discharge the water retained in biofilters through the bottom outflow pipe fawb 2009 it is noted that different set points could be applied in other studies to balance competing objectives for both rounds the rtc biofilters were operated according to the rules described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 in round 1 harvesting for rtc biofilters in each sampling event with normal or extended dry period t min i e 2 days dosing was stopped when the inflow volume v in reached the submerged zone volume v sz 10 l to simulate bypass flow in round 2 it was assumed that perfect rainfall forecasting information was available i e no uncertainties were caused by inaccurate forecast this assumption is based on 1 previous research on biofilters without a sz which show that they still perform adequately during dry weather periods chandrasena et al 2012 and 2 the local rainfall pattern with an average of 3 rainfall events per week this assumption allowed simplicity in implementation and could fully reveal the benefits of rtc strategy 2 no historical rainfall forecast archive was available for this study and future work will be conducted to explore the uncertainties caused by inaccurate rainfall forecast for sampling events that had an antecedent dry weather period of t min or greater the water retained in rtc biofilters was discharged in advance through the bottom outflow pipe and this discharge started 3 h prior to dosing during both rounds non rtc biofilters were operated as typical biofilters without real time control as that showed in fig 1 receiving and treating all the dosed stormwater these served as experiment controls for comparison to the rtc biofilters during each dosing sampling event inflow was sampled at the beginning middle and end of the dosing period these were mixed to create a composite inflow sample to estimate infiltration rates a ruler in each column was used to record the instantaneous water depths in the ponding zone at regular intervals 3 75 min the outflow sampling regime varied between different types of biofilters and strategies for rtc biofilters two types of composite outflow samples were collected in each sampling event rtc harvesting outflow i e the outflow harvested for different end uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing and rtc environment outflow i e the outflow discharged to the environment e g to waterbodies and ecosystems in round 1 rtc1 harvesting outflow stands for rtc harvesting outflow in round 1 similarly hereinafter was collected from the raised outflow pipe during stage 2 a in fig 2 while rtc1 environment outflow was the stormwater that bypassed to the environment without treatment same quality as inflow during stage 1 and 2b in in round 2 rtc2 harvesting outflow was the water that discharged from the bottom outflow pipe prior to a rainfall event during stage 2 a in fig 3 while rtc2 environment outflow was the treated outflow that discharged via the raised outflow pipe when rtc biofilters were operated without real time control during stage 1 and 2b in fig 3 for non rtc biofilters the composite sample collected from the raised outflow pipe was labelled non rtc outflow non rtc1 outflow for round 1 and non rtc2 outflow for round 2 non rtc outflow could initially be considered as either being harvested or discharged to the environment depending on the results for the water quality please refer to fig a 1 round 1 and fig a 2 round 2 in the supplementary material to see the above described outflow samples in relation to the biofilter set up 2 4 sample and data analysis all inflow and outflow samples were transported on ice to the environmental and public health microbiology laboratory ephm lab for enumeration of e coli using the colilert method idexx laboratories 2007 within 8 h of dosing according to mccarthy et al 2008 this storage time would cause no significant difference in e coli concentrations the analysis results were considered as the event mean concentrations to analyse the impact of rtc and operational conditions on the removal of sediment and nutrients important for environmental protection purposes the above samples were also tested for tss total suspended solids tp total phosphorus and tn total nitrogen for the last three events of each round of experiments events 9 10 and 11 these three events had the same levels of inflow concentrations and volumes but different antecedent dry lengths as we assumed that the dry weather length impacts the removal of tss tp and tn most bratieres et al 2008 zinger et al 2013 the samples were tested in nata national association of testing authorities australia accredited laboratories using standard methods tss method 2540 d in apha awwa wef 2005 tp and tn method 4500 p j in apha awwa wef 2005 removal of e coli is presented both in the form of concentration removal and log reduction which is the difference between the logarithmic base 10 inflow concentration and the logarithmic outflow concentration the microbial concentrations in the outflow were compared with two harvesting reuse guidelines in australia the guidelines for managing risks in recreational water nhmrc 2008 and the australian guidelines for water recycling nhmrc 2009 the impact of sediment and nutrients on the environment was assessed using the urban stormwater best practice environmental management bpem guidelines csiro 1999 which ensure that stormwater management meets the state environment protection policy waters objectives for victoria australia analysis of variance anova was adopted for pollutant removal and infiltration rate comparisons before the analysis the data of e coli log reduction and infiltration rate were analysed for normality using the shapiro wilk test the results showed that while the infiltration rate data and the e coli log reduction data for rtc biofilters were all normally distributed the e coli log reduction data for non rtc biofilters were non normally distributed although non parametric analysis is generally recommended for non normally distributed data the available non parametric analytical methods are limited to testing the influence of a single factor rather than the possible interactions between different individual factors kirk 2008 in addition even when the normality assumption is not verified anova is still considered a robust test if a low p value e g p 0 001 can be achieved kirk 2008 therefore a series of anova along with post hoc tests tukey hsd was still performed a three way anova was conducted to study whether the observed e coli log reductions were affected by dry period length event size or inflow concentration two more three way anova were carried out to analyse whether the e coli concentrations log reductions were affected by the biofilter type i e rtc or non rtc round and event in this study we used unadjusted p values were used rather than correcting for multiple comparisons indeed it has been shown that the probability of type ii errors might be increased by correcting for multiple comparisons e g using bonferroni adjustment o brien 1983 perneger 1998 1999 and adjustment was considered inappropriate because specific a priori hypotheses were formed about which parameters are significant mccarthy et al 2013 in each round for each type of biofilters several water balance calculations were made stormwater volume harvested v harvest v in

cases at least 1 log reduction could be achieved for rtc biofilters the negative value of the 5th percentile log reduction for non rtc1 outflow 1 75 occurred during the short dry events during which no water was collected for harvesting for rtc biofilters in which the trapped microbes were flushed out by the inflow with low microbial concentrations before experiencing sufficient die off similar to what chandrasena et al 2012 found all these results indicate the effectiveness of rtc strategy 1 harvesting in increasing harvesting benefits however for rtc biofilters 60 of the stormwater volume directly bypassed the biofilter without treatment median e coli of 2 68 104 mpn 100 ml while 100 of the stormwater was treated by non rtc biofilters median e coli of 6 87 103 mpn 100 ml this explains why the e coli load reduction in the rtc biofilters was 62 3 as compared to 83 1 for the non rtc biofilters the impact of antecedent dry length event size and inflow concentration on harvesting was also analysed based on the detailed experimental results for each event fig a 3 and fig a 4 supplementary material as expected due to the design of the strategy event size did not impact the volume or quality of rtc1 harvesting outflow p 0 481 three way anova in each event the volume of inflow that allowed to enter rtc biofilters was exactly the submerged zone volume however both antecedent dry length and the inflow concentration impacted the water quality for harvesting p 0 003 and 0 023 respectively three way anova the pollutant concentrations of rtc1 harvesting outflow samples collected after long dry periods were higher than those collected after median dry periods by design no stormwater was harvested after short dry periods indeed the low moisture content in biofilters after long dry periods increases potential preferential flow paths hatt et al 2007 this hypothesis was confirmed by increased infiltration rates that shown in fig a 5 in supplementary material and accordingly the likelihood of the retained stormwater being mixed with newly applied stormwater similarly rtc1 harvesting outflow was of lower quality i e higher pollutant concentration in the effluent during high concentration inflow events compared to median concentration inflow events mainly due to the mixing of old and new water 3 1 2 round 2 rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment for rtc strategy 2 rtc2 harvesting outflow collected prior to dosing from the bottom outflow pipe of rtc biofilters was extremely clean it could meet both the requirement of dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use or irrigation of commercial food crops median concentration 1 e coli 100 ml as per nhmrc 2009 and the requirement for secondary contact recreation in australia nhmrc 2008 table 2 non rtc2 outflow met neither meaning that it is also assumed for round 2 that non rtc outflows2 is discharged to the environment since this rtc strategy continues to treat the incoming stormwater after the harvesting has finished the water quality released to the environment rtc2 environment outflow was similar to that of the non rtc outflow p 0 926 one way anova indicating that the biofilters operated with rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment would not cause any additional pollution compared to the biofilters without real time control non rtc furthermore 100 of the stormwater was treated by both rtc and non rtc biofilters in round 2 meaning that the load reductions were comparable 93 7 vs 92 8 table 2 neither event size nor inflow concentration were significant factors for rtc2 harvesting outflow p 0 761 and 0 179 respectively three way anova this was to be expected due to the fact that rtc2 harvesting outflow entirely came from the previous event s water it mainly depended on 1 the water volume and quality in previous events and 2 the length of the antecedent dry weather period the detailed results fig a 6 and fig a 7 supplementary material show that harvesting water was collected only from events with median dry periods no rtc harvesting outflow was collected after short dry periods by design and after long dry periods biofilters had very low moisture content due to the extensive evapotranspiration resulting in the water contained in the pores being held by the filter media this explains why only 5 4 of the total stormwater volume was harvested from rtc biofilters in round 2 table 2 whilst this amount is a lot less than anticipated and drastically affects the cost effectiveness of this solution this volume is not completely insignificant and could still partly supply the residential indoor water use for low density residential areas e g 31 2 of the residential indoor use water volume in melbourne and 62 8 of that in brisbane as per mitchell et al 2008 3 1 3 comparison of two rtc strategies we propose that the improved microbial removal rates observed in the rtc columns compared to removal rates observed in the non rtc columns in round 1 and round 2 were both mainly derived from the implementation of rtc strategies rather than the inherent differences between biofilters this was because 1 at the start of each round there was no significant difference between the infiltration rates of rtc biofilters and those of non rtc biofilters p 0 518 two way anova round and biofilter type and 2 compared to the type of biofilters time was a much more significant factor to the change of infiltration rates through the experiments with much lower p value and p 0 001 in three way anova round biofilter type and time it is also proposed that the fact that we implemented the two strategies in series instead of in parallel caused no significant impact to the performance of rtc biofilters in round 1 and in round 2 although in the three way anova of the log reductions of e coli concentration round is a significant factor p 0 001 significant interaction was found between round and biofilter type p 0 001 and between round and event p 0 001 similar results were found in the three way anova of e coli concentrations actually when comparing the overall performance of non rtc biofilters in round 1 with that in round 2 after the elimination of the interactive factors i e one way anova round as the only factor there was no significant difference as comparable e coli log reductions p 0 353 one way anova and concentrations p 0 394 one way anova in non rtc outflow were observed in the rounds in addition there were no significant differences between the inflow concentrations of e coli in the two rounds p 0 187 one way anova although they were not exactly the same due to the continuous e coli growth die off during spiking these results enabled a comparison between the two strategies compared to strategy 1 harvesting strategy 2 harvesting environment delivered both higher quality of harvested water median e coli concentration 1 mpn 100 ml vs 740 mpn 100 ml and higher quality of environmental discharges total load removal 93 7 vs 62 3 table 2 the lower quality of rtc1 harvesting outflow can be explained by the desorption of microbes trapped in the biofilter media and plant roots due to the hydraulic head created on top of the filter media by the incoming water vs free draining water for round 2 chandrasena et al 2014b while this in turn also means that the resident water was more likely to be mixed with newly entered stormwater whereas rtc1 harvesting outflow only contained old clean water however as a sacrifice the total volume of harvested water collected in round 2 is much lower than that in round 1 5 4 vs 28 4 table 2 due to the amount and load of untreated bypassed water in round 1 3 2 impact of rtc on tss tp and tn removal fig 4 shows that total load removal patterns for tss tn and tp in the outflows that discharged to the environment i e rtc environment outflow for rtc biofilters non rtc outflow for non rtc biofilters followed the e coli removal patterns discussed above for events 9 10 and 11 in round 1 since rtc1 environment outflow only consisted of bypassed stormwater it was of zero treatment as opposed to non rtc biofilters therefore the total load removal rate of tss tp or tn was respectively much lower than non rtc1 outflow and was failed to meet the requirements in the urban stormwater bpem guidelines csiro 1999 however in round 2 rtc2 environment outflow still met these requirements and had similar total removal rates as non rtc2 outflow given that all the inflow of rtc biofilters was treated it should be noted that since only three events were selected to test for tss tn and tp the total removal rates could be different if all events were included the detailed performance of each type of biofilters in tss tp and tn removal during each tested event of each round can be found in supplementary material regarding the water collected for harvesting rtc1 harvesting outflows for tss and tp were negatively impacted by long dry weather periods with higher pollutant concentrations event 11 indeed the filter media can remobilise under low moisture conditions and be flushed out in the next event also releasing mainly particulate bound phosphorous bratieres et al 2008 payne et al 2014 for rtc2 harvesting outflow it was only collected in event 9 median dry event and was of similar quality compared to non rtc2 outflow no rtc2 harvesting outflow was available in event 10 short dry event insufficient retention time or event 11 long dry event all the clean sz water was held by the filter media 3 3 future strategies and practical implementation future strategies should be explored for the use of rtc with stormwater biofilters including for use in areas that have different contexts drivers and objectives we believe future application and research in this area should consider the following the set points of the two strategies used in this experiment e g minimum required retention time t min 2 days might be different when the strategies are applied in another biofilter and or with different climate conditions and inflow features the set points may need to be adjusted in newly developed rtc strategies to increase the harvested water volume in rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment a possible method in practice could be to enlarge the submerged zone sz volume of biofilters during the design process a larger sz could also supply plants with more water to resist extended dry weather periods the cost effectiveness of enlarging sz volumes should be evaluated in future work during the implementation of rtc strategy 1 harvesting the maximum volume of stormwater that entered biofilters in a single event was the submerged zone volume however we underestimated the water holding capacity of the soil and suggest that additional stormwater could be allowed to enter biofilters without causing any discharge of newly entered water we know that extended retention time t min is crucial for microbial and nutrient removal but we suggest that a maximum retention time t max could help with mitigating the impact of extended antecedent dry weather periods depending on the particular end uses and other pollutants of concern the impact of rtc strategies on other pollutants such as heavy metals needs to be further investigated finally no historical rainfall forecast archive was available in this study and future work should be conducted to explore the potential uncertainties caused by inaccurate rainfall forecast these uncertainties would be differently affected depending on the local rainfall patterns for areas with less frequent rain events for example where biofilters would experience a long dry period without any water in the sz future work could explore the potential use of other sources of water to maintain treatment performance 4 conclusion this study presents the first attempt to apply rtc in stormwater biofilters assessing two strategies that are easy and cheap to implement both in newly developed systems and for the retrofit of existing systems the work confirmed our key hypotheses demonstrating that active control of stormwater biofilters can mitigate the detrimental effects that short dry weather periods long dry weather periods and large inflow volumes have on the treatment of faecal microbes indeed both rtc strategies were effective in reducing the risks posed by faecal microbes during stormwater harvesting and reuse although rtc strategy 2 harvesting environment provided less volume of water for harvesting as compared to rtc strategy 1 harvesting it was able to 1 provide treated harvested water that meets both the requirement of dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use or irrigation of commercial food crops nhmrc 2009 and the requirement for secondary contact recreation in australia nhmrc 2008 and 2 discharge water to the environment which met the urban stormwater best practice environmental management guidelines csiro 1999 this being the first reported rtc of stormwater biofilters future rtc strategies should be explored and tested beginning with the optimisation of the many variables and parameters presented in this paper declaration of competing interest

18362,in a one year october 2014 october 2015 pilot study we assessed wastewater monitoring with sustained sampling for analysis of global enterovirus ev infections in an urban community wastewater was analysed by ultra deep sequencing uds after pcr amplification of the partial vp1 capsid protein gene the nucleotide sequence analysis showed an unprecedented diversity of 48 ev types within the community which were assigned to the taxonomic species a n 13 b n 23 and c n 12 during the same period 26 ev types of which 22 were detected in wastewater were identified in patients referred to the teaching hospital serving the same urban population wastewater surveillance detected a silent circulation of 26 ev types including viruses reported in clinically rare respiratory diseases wastewater monitoring as a supplementary procedure can complement clinical surveillance of severe diseases related to non polio evs and contribute to the final stages of poliomyelitis eradication graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental surveillance public health communicable diseases community infections wastewater effluents enteroviruses 1 introduction enteroviruses evs are small non enveloped rna viruses within the picornaviridae family evs involved in human infections include polioviruses pvs n 3 coxsackieviruses cvs a n 21 and b n 6 echoviruses es n 29 and 49 other types numbered 68 121 which are grouped among four taxonomic species ev a to ev d ev b types are the most frequent causes of aseptic meningitis outbreaks and have been occasionally reported in other central nervous system syndromes mirand et al 2008 several ev types have been observed in sporadic encephalitis cases in particular infections caused by ev a71 that are marked by utmost severity xing et al 2014 the analysis of environmental and wastewater samples collected from defined communities has been used to estimate the prevalence of specific enteric pathogens in populations for which no clinical data are available including evs berchenko et al 2017 the world health organization has included environmental pv surveillance in the new strategic plan of the global polio eradication initiative as a supplement to the surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis afp polio eradication endgame strategic plan 2013 2018 2013 environmental surveillance has detected infections with wild or vaccine derived recombinant pvs without observation of paralysis cases and the early introduction of virulent strains within communities cowger et al 2017 manor et al 2014 as circulation of wild pvs has been virtually interrupted poliomyelitis is becoming a rare cause of afp worldwide tangermann et al 2017 however non polio evs are increasingly reported in diseases with similar manifestations in this respect the ev types ev a71 and ev d68 have emerged as a growing cause of concern in children casas alba et al 2017 holm hansen et al 2016 most evs replicate in the small intestine mucosa and are excreted in the faeces for 3 4 weeks regardless of whether infections are symptomatic or not health risks to susceptible individuals can stem from poor sanitation and the release of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater effluents which increase the risk of exposure to disease causing evs and virus transmission in the community accordingly systematic environmental sampling could provide important supplementary surveillance data for non polio evs adeniji and faleye 2014 we previously performed studies combining surveillance of clinical ev manifestations and virological data to investigate the epidemiologic patterns of ev diseases in france antona et al 2016 lang et al 2014 mirand et al 2016 2010 2008 in other studies we recorded changing patterns of several ev types each year among patients finding a wide genetic diversity of virus lineages within a same epidemic ev type and described the circulation of ev strains between countries hassel et al 2017 2015 henquell et al 2013 othman et al 2015 the findings suggested that susceptible individuals are exposed to a wide array of ev strains and that the epidemiological patterns of clinical manifestations are driven by constant flows of virus strains from different countries regardless of whether they are neighbouring or distant countries we hypothesized that yearly outbreaks caused by a given ev type result not only from the transmission of one epidemic virus strain within the community but also from the exposure of individuals to multiple viruses of distinct lineages and geographic origins to investigate how environmental surveillance could be implemented to complement clinical surveillance and improve public health monitoring and evaluation we performed a one year pilot study of municipal wastewater effluents of the city of clermont ferrand france to analyse enteric infections bisseux et al 2018 in the present study we analysed wastewater samples by ultra deep sequencing uds to determine the pattern of ev infections of the whole community and compared the data with those derived from clinical surveillance of the same population and the entire french population we discuss the relevance and limitations of the present pilot study and the lessons learnt in terms of epidemiologic surveillance and future applications 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and virus concentration sampling procedure and virus concentration steps have been previously described bisseux et al 2018 briefly from october 2014 to october 2015 we sampled 20 l of raw wastewater every 2 weeks at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the urban area of clermont ferrand that currently treats the waste of 250 000 people a total of 27 samples were collected from the influent of wwtp they were immediately filtered under gravity through a 50 μm filter and transferred to the laboratory within 1 h after collection after a second gravity filtration stage 20 μm samples were concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a hallow fibre filter molecular cut off 30 kda inner diameter 200 μm and a transmembrane pressure of 0 07 0 1 bar after the addition of 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate and sonication samples were centrifuged at 8 000 x g for 20 min the ph of supernatants was neutralised to ph 7 virus precipitation was further performed with polyethylene glycol peg peg 8000 and sodium chloride were added to the supernatant at a final concentration of respectively 10 and 0 6 w v and incubated at 4 c for 24 48 h the white phase containing viruses was centrifuged at 8 000 x g at 4 c for 20 min pellets were suspended in buffer 0 1 m nacl 8 mm msso 7h2o 50 mm tris hcl and 0 005 w v glycerol ph 7 after addition of 1 m kcl the mixture was incubated on ice for 40 min to precipitate peg leaving purified virus particles in suspension after centrifugation 12 000 x g 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was stored at 20 c the raw wastewater samples were concentrated to an average of 60 ml concentration factor 333 total nucleic acids were extracted from 1 ml of viral concentrates with the nuclisens easymag platform biomérieux marcy l etoile france and eluates were immediately aliquoted and stored at 80 c until analysis 2 2 target gene amplification and deep sequencing all the 27 samples tested positive for ev arn enterovirus ceeram biomérieux france and quantified as previously reported bisseux et al 2018 with an in house assay volle et al 2012 and were subjected to deep sequencing two manipulators in two distant laboratories performed all reactions in duplicate independently following standard precautions to prevent pcr contamination the partial gene 360 390 nucleotides encoding the major vp1 capsid protein was amplified with pan ev rt nested pcr nix et al 2006 after the first amplification 40 cycles first set of nix primers the second round 40 cycles used the second set of nix primers tagged with a single sequence of eight nucleotides for each replicate of each sample the positive control was a stool collected from a healthy child containing a mixture of echovirus 13 e 13 and coxsackievirus a2 cv a2 identified in a specific illumina sequencing run the negative control was dna and rna free sterile water pcr products and controls were checked on standard 1 agarose gel and purified with the minelute gel extraction kit qiagen paris france all purified dna samples were quantified with agilent d1000 screen tape system and mixed in the same quantity sequencing was performed with the illumina miseq sequencing platform which uses 2 x 300 bp paired end chemistry at the gatc platform germany the sequencing run contained 58 tagged amplicons from 27 wwtp samples the positive and negative controls all in duplicate 2 3 reference databases for ev identification from partial 1dvp1 two different databases were built for the bio informatics analysis the first database named database i was built by aligning sequences from all human and non human ev reference strains downloaded from the ncbi genbank database sequences of sapelovirus were added as an outgroup the second database database ii was built to span intratypic ev diversity the partial vp1 gene sequences targeted by the pcr primers used in this study were recovered from all nucleotide sequences for each human ev type available in genbank as of march 2015 these published sequences were compiled with those determined in our laboratory all the sequence data sets were constructed with the bioedit software version 7 1 9 http www mbio ncsu edu bioedit bioedit html assignment and sequence quality were checked with phylogenetic trees reconstructed by the neighbour joining method implemented in mega software v5 01 tamura et al 2011 the sequences with assignment error or with suspected sequencing error were discarded for each type we selected sequences representing each cluster defined as sequences with less than 1 of nucleic acid differences the final database contained 3 256 2 4 bioinformatic analysis and quality control of sequence data the vsearch open source tool for metagenomics https github com torognes vsearch was used for processing and preparing sequence data after assembly of paired end reads sequences were aligned and those containing ambiguous bases n or mismatches in primers were removed putative chimaeras were identified and removed with the vsearch tool the remaining sequences that shared 98 nucleotide sequence identity were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit otu the taxonomic assignment of the sequence representing each otu was performed by similarity and phylogeny using the two reference databases described above for each otu the closest sequences in database ii were selected by similarity for a first assignment these sequences were then added to the phylogenetic tree reconstructed with fasttree price et al 2010 from sequences of database i for a second phylogenetic assignment the consistency of the results provided by the two methods was verified this process was performed with a modified version of the pipeline panam phylogenetic analysis of next generation amplicons https github com panammeb taib et al 2013 we checked the data for detecting eventual mistagging effect esling et al 2015 schnell et al 2015 by removing sequences representing less 0 5 of the total abundance we eliminated the spurious ones technical appendix a supplementary data duplicates were then pooled for the final analysis we normalised the wwtp samples using the vegan package of r software which consists in a random selection of the same number of sequences in each sample this number was defined as the number of sequences present in the sample containing the lowest sequence number 16 250 sequences in our run 2 5 ev sequences from clinical infections over the same period between october 2014 and october 2015 3191 ev infections were reported to the french national laboratory network of enterovirus surveillance rse coordinated by the agency santé publique france and the national reference centre for enteroviruses and parechoviruses evs were detected by molecular typing in 2124 patients of whom 122 were seen at the teaching hospital of clermont ferrand typing was performed prospectively in all clinical samples cerebrospinal fluid csf blood respiratory stool and throat nucleotide sequences were obtained after complete vp1 gene amplification with species specific primers mirand et al 2016 2006 schuffenecker et al 2016 or with pan ev primers nix et al 2006 targeting a partial region of the vp1 gene the amplicons were sequenced by the sanger technique using the bigdye terminator kit applied biosystems 2 6 phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic analysis based on the partial vp1 gene sequences was performed with the maximum parsimony method implemented in the bionumerics software biomérieux marcy l etoile france the sequences that shared 98 nucleotide identity were clustered in a single sphere 2 7 accession numbers the partial vp1 gene sequences have been deposited in the genbank sequence database under accession numbers mk086267 to mk086510 and mk086163 to mk086266 for wastewater otus and clinical sequences respectively 3 results 3 1 sequencing data of the merged sequences assembly of forward and reverse reads 33 were discarded by the quality control analyses of the remaining sequences assigned to an ev type 0 4 were removed because of incorrect or inaccurate assignment the sequences assigned to rhinovirus types 0 7 were also excluded leaving a set of 2 001 179 sequences for further analyses the cleaning analyses applied to the entire dataset left 1 546 641 sequences in the wastewater samples and 438 750 sequences after the normalisation of data table 1 3 2 diversity of ev types in the wwtp samples otus were assigned to 3 taxonomic species ev a b and c table 1 no sequences were allocated to the ev d species a total of 48 ev types were

level some such as ev a119 and ev a76 were detected sporadically in the wastewater samples and others such as cv a11 and cv a22 were present over time in several consecutive samples a set of 16 sequences clustered in a single otu and shared 99 4 nucleotide identity with the sabin pv 1 vaccine sequence accession number v01150 1 and accordingly were classified as sabin like pv 1 after cleaning and normalisation sequences were clustered into 180 otus which were assigned to 33 ev types table 1 the sequences were distributed among ev b 60 1 ev a 26 and ev c 13 9 species four ev types accounted

represented by a handful of sequences less than 0 5 of the sequences from a respective sample 2 to 703 sequences by type in the whole sequence set were removed during mistagging cleaning and were excluded from the temporal analysis because their allocation to a given sampling date was unreliable however they were included in the analysis of the global diversity of evs within the community

and c n 1 but only half were detected in wastewater during the third period september 2015 the mean viral load was the highest determined over the year 17 046 range 2769 17046 copies ml the proportion of all the ev b types including cv b5 dropped to 64 of the total number of sequences two other ev types ev c99 and cv a22 accounted for 21 4 of the total number of sequences the number of clinical cases dropped to 10 9 of which were associated with 5 types of ev b species and 1 with cv a6 a species the total viral load mean 2 107 range 138 4075 genome copies ml decreased over the fourth period from 14 october 26 october 2015 and the distribution of ev types shifted again with 89 7 and 10 3 of sequences being assigned to ev species b and a respectively cv b5 was once again predominant in wastewater 74 8 of viral sequences while the number of clinical cases remained low 4 discussion this one year pilot study to analyse wastewater sampled from a wwtp serving an urban community showed a highly dynamic co circulation of 48 ev types assigned to the taxonomic species a b and c our results were consistent with those of a previous american study brinkman et al 2017 that described a similar seasonal distribution of ev species with an alternative predominance of ev a and ev b a major peak of ev b during summer and fall and the circulation of ev c throughout the year unlike in our study the highest viral concentration in the sewage from the two wwtp analysed was observed in july to our knowledge our study yields the first environmental and clinical data on the surveillance of non polio ev infections without cell culture bias concomitantly obtained in a same urban population the results showed the consistency between the two surveillance systems 22 26 ev types identified in patients referred to the teaching hospital serving the population under study were also detected in wastewater monitoring there were close phylogenetic relationships between virus sequences detected in patients and wastewater yet analysis of the wastewater showed that evs associated with community acquired infections in the urban population were much more diverse than those associated with infections reported in the clinical setting during the same period the net number of ev types intertype diversity was higher in the whole urban population than in patients notably the intertype diversity within the urban population was actually similar to that reported in patients admitted to hospitals nationwide during the same period these findings support the conclusion that uds with a multiplexed amplicon approach can be used in raw urban wastewater to investigate the ecology and transmission of evs and assess the burden of these enteric viruses in the general population the epidemiology of ev infections in 2014 2015 was marked by the epidemic circulation of cv b5 which accounted for 44 of the sequences in wastewater and 28 5 15 52 of meningitis cases the abrupt upsurge of cv b5 was clearly identified in march 2015 by wastewater analysis the large circulation of cv b5 was also observed by the national network for ev surveillance which recorded this virus type as the second most frequent in france in 2015 ten other ev b types were co detected with cv b5 during the winter 2014 2015 by environmental surveillance notably e 11 3 of all sequences over the winter and e 6 2 4 these viruses were also detected during the meningitis outbreak in the summer in contrast ev types e 33 6 3 and cv b2 5 2 were only detected in wastewater accordingly the winter pattern of ev diversity in wastewater was not completely predictive of the pattern during the following seasonal outbreak longer follow up studies including wwtps serving distinct urban communities are required to provide a complete description of viral circulation dynamics striking differences in the distribution pattern of ev a and ev c types were also observed few infections associated with ev a types required hospitalization but the viruses circulated widely in the community 26 of reads in wastewater indicating that most infected individuals had subclinical infections or self limited illnesses managed in ambulatory settings cv a16 is an example in this respect conversely while cv a6 accounted for 0 03 reads in wastewater the virus was detected in four patients reported with meningitis myocarditis and hfmd including a case of atypical hfmd clinical presentation our data are consistent with the emergence of cv a6 as a cause of worldwide disease concern bian et al 2015 environmental and clinical surveillance revealed the unexpected epidemiologic pattern of the ev c types large circulation in the urban community and few disease cases apostol et al 2012 benschop et al 2017 harvala et al 2014 all the three ev c types identified in patients were traced back to wastewater ev c109 was detected in two patients referred for respiratory diseases and clustered close to viruses in wastewater in contrast cv a13 and ev c99 detected in the stools of two adopted children and in wastewater did not cluster based on the structure of the sequence database and phylogenetic techniques used in our study the sequence assignment rate was high 99 6 and enabled us to detect less abundant viruses two ev types with direct public health relevance ev a71 and pv 1 sabin were detected in wastewater and identified down to the strain level by analysis of sequence data the low nucleotide variation in the wastewater pv 1 sequence compared with that of the vaccine strain suggested no or limited circulation in the population our french data are consistent with earlier results from the united states and other european countries showing the importation of vaccine pv strains into polio free countries benschop et al 2017 delogu et al 2018 the findings clearly show the need to maintain a high immunization coverage to avoid the occurrence of an outbreak associated with the circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses vdpv as reported in 2015 in ukraine khetsuriani et al 2017 cv a11 and cv a22 were among the five most abundant types in this study these unexpectedly prevalent non polio ev c types could be a gene reservoir for the emergence of recombinant vdpv bessaud et al 2011 we also evidenced the circulation of rare ev a eg a76 a89 ev b eg b78 and ev c eg c105 c116 types previously unreported in the french population and for which few epidemiological and genomic data are available notably our environmental surveillance identified new ev c types associated with severe respiratory diseases and neurological disease conditions whose detection in the faeces was considered to be difficult holm hansen et al 2016 our findings suggest that the circulation of these viruses in the community could be higher than anticipated from the number of reported clinical infections and are consistent with suggestions to enhance the surveillance of ev c species in respiratory specimens barnadas et al 2017 van leer buter et al 2016 our study has two limitations first although the pan ev primers used included a high number of degenerate positions variations in the levels of pcr amplification exist among ev types and could explain why we did not detect ev d68 this virus was previously detected however by type specific amplification confirmed by direct sanger sequencing in 7 27 samples bisseux et al 2018 second we showed that incorrect assignment of reads caused the random spread of signals within multiplexed samples and artificially inflated the diversity detected in each sample this bias referred to as mistagging esling et al 2015 or tag jump schnell et al 2015 has been rarely documented and taken into account in uds analyses despite its critical impact on the quality of data collected for ecological and epidemiological studies minimising incorrect assignments and obtaining reliable results is a real challenge for metabarcoding studies on illumina sequencing platforms strategies including controls must be incorporated into the experimental design to perform sequence data filtering esling et al 2015 galan et al 2016 despite these limits amplicon deep sequencing in wastewater for surveillance and epidemiological studies clearly surpasses earlier techniques used in this field with the implementation of robust quality controls monitoring evs in wastewater can be implemented as a supplementary surveillance system of the community at large to complement clinical surveillance 5 conclusion the combination of temporal wastewater sampling efficient virus concentration from samples analysis with amplicon deep sequencing and robust sequence assignment allow the detection of a large array of ev types while avoiding the bias caused by cell culture sustained environmental surveillance is an advanced approach for a better understanding of the diversity of the ev landscape within an urban community the environmental findings of this study show the circulation of clinically uncommon evs including respiratory ev c species strains and sabin like pv 1 and provide a powerful complement to the clinical data declaration of competing interest

18362,in a one year october 2014 october 2015 pilot study we assessed wastewater monitoring with sustained sampling for analysis of global enterovirus ev infections in an urban community wastewater was analysed by ultra deep sequencing uds after pcr amplification of the partial vp1 capsid protein gene the nucleotide sequence analysis showed an unprecedented diversity of 48 ev types within the community which were assigned to the taxonomic species a n 13 b n 23 and c n 12 during the same period 26 ev types of which 22 were detected in wastewater were identified in patients referred to the teaching hospital serving the same urban population wastewater surveillance detected a silent circulation of 26 ev types including viruses reported in clinically rare respiratory diseases wastewater monitoring as a supplementary procedure can complement clinical surveillance of severe diseases related to non polio evs and contribute to the final stages of poliomyelitis eradication graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental surveillance public health communicable diseases community infections wastewater effluents enteroviruses 1 introduction enteroviruses evs are small non enveloped rna viruses within the picornaviridae family evs involved in human infections include polioviruses pvs n 3 coxsackieviruses cvs a n 21 and b n 6 echoviruses es n 29 and 49 other types numbered 68 121 which are grouped among four taxonomic species ev a to ev d ev b types are the most frequent causes of aseptic meningitis outbreaks and have been occasionally reported in other central nervous system syndromes mirand et al 2008 several ev types have been observed in sporadic encephalitis cases in particular infections caused by ev a71 that are marked by utmost severity xing et al 2014 the analysis of environmental and wastewater samples collected from defined communities has been used to estimate the prevalence of specific enteric pathogens in populations for which no clinical data are available including evs berchenko et al 2017 the world health organization has included environmental pv surveillance in the new strategic plan of the global polio eradication initiative as a supplement to the surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis afp polio eradication endgame strategic plan 2013 2018 2013 environmental surveillance has detected infections with wild or vaccine derived recombinant pvs without observation of paralysis cases and the early introduction of virulent strains within communities cowger et al 2017 manor et al 2014 as circulation of wild pvs has been virtually interrupted poliomyelitis is becoming a rare cause of afp worldwide tangermann et al 2017 however non polio evs are increasingly reported in diseases with similar manifestations in this respect the ev types ev a71 and ev d68 have emerged as a growing cause of concern in children casas alba et al 2017 holm hansen et al 2016 most evs replicate in the small intestine mucosa and are excreted in the faeces for 3 4 weeks regardless of whether infections are symptomatic or not health risks to susceptible individuals can stem from poor sanitation and the release of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater effluents which increase the risk of exposure to disease causing evs and virus transmission in the community accordingly systematic environmental sampling could provide important supplementary surveillance data for non polio evs adeniji and faleye 2014 we previously performed studies combining surveillance of clinical ev manifestations and virological data to investigate the epidemiologic patterns of ev diseases in france antona et al 2016 lang et al 2014 mirand et al 2016 2010 2008 in other studies we recorded changing patterns of several ev types each year among patients finding a wide genetic diversity of virus lineages within a same epidemic ev type and described the circulation of ev strains between countries hassel et al 2017 2015 henquell et al 2013 othman et al 2015 the findings suggested that susceptible individuals are exposed to a wide array of ev strains and that the epidemiological patterns of clinical manifestations are driven by constant flows of virus strains from different countries regardless of whether they are neighbouring or distant countries we hypothesized that yearly outbreaks caused by a given ev type result not only from the transmission of one epidemic virus strain within the community but also from the exposure of individuals to multiple viruses of distinct lineages and geographic origins to investigate how environmental surveillance could be implemented to complement clinical surveillance and improve public health monitoring and evaluation we performed a one year pilot study of municipal wastewater effluents of the city of clermont ferrand france to analyse enteric infections bisseux et al 2018 in the present study we analysed wastewater samples by ultra deep sequencing uds to determine the pattern of ev infections of the whole community and compared the data with those derived from clinical surveillance of the same population and the entire french population we discuss the relevance and limitations of the present pilot study and the lessons learnt in terms of epidemiologic surveillance and future applications 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling and virus concentration sampling procedure and virus concentration steps have been previously described bisseux et al 2018 briefly from october 2014 to october 2015 we sampled 20 l of raw wastewater every 2 weeks at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the urban area of clermont ferrand that currently treats the waste of 250 000 people a total of 27 samples were collected from the influent of wwtp they were immediately filtered under gravity through a 50 μm filter and transferred to the laboratory within 1 h after collection after a second gravity filtration stage 20 μm samples were concentrated by tangential flow ultrafiltration using a hallow fibre filter molecular cut off 30 kda inner diameter 200 μm and a transmembrane pressure of 0 07 0 1 bar after the addition of 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate and sonication samples were centrifuged at 8 000 x g for 20 min the ph of supernatants was neutralised to ph 7 virus precipitation was further performed with polyethylene glycol peg peg 8000 and sodium chloride were added to the supernatant at a final concentration of respectively 10 and 0 6 w v and incubated at 4 c for 24 48 h the white phase containing viruses was centrifuged at 8 000 x g at 4 c for 20 min pellets were suspended in buffer 0 1 m nacl 8 mm msso 7h2o 50 mm tris hcl and 0 005 w v glycerol ph 7 after addition of 1 m kcl the mixture was incubated on ice for 40 min to precipitate peg leaving purified virus particles in suspension after centrifugation 12 000 x g 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was stored at 20 c the raw wastewater samples were concentrated to an average of 60 ml concentration factor 333 total nucleic acids were extracted from 1 ml of viral concentrates with the nuclisens easymag platform biomérieux marcy l etoile france and eluates were immediately aliquoted and stored at 80 c until analysis 2 2 target gene amplification and deep sequencing all the 27 samples tested positive for ev arn enterovirus ceeram biomérieux france and quantified as previously reported bisseux et al 2018 with an in house assay volle et al 2012 and were subjected to deep sequencing two manipulators in two distant laboratories performed all reactions in duplicate independently following standard precautions to prevent pcr contamination the partial gene 360 390 nucleotides encoding the major vp1 capsid protein was amplified with pan ev rt nested pcr nix et al 2006 after the first amplification 40 cycles first set of nix primers the second round 40 cycles used the second set of nix primers tagged with a single sequence of eight nucleotides for each replicate of each sample the positive control was a stool collected from a healthy child containing a mixture of echovirus 13 e 13 and coxsackievirus a2 cv a2 identified in a specific illumina sequencing run the negative control was dna and rna free sterile water pcr products and controls were checked on standard 1 agarose gel and purified with the minelute gel extraction kit qiagen paris france all purified dna samples were quantified with agilent d1000 screen tape system and mixed in the same quantity sequencing was performed with the illumina miseq sequencing platform which uses 2 x 300 bp paired end chemistry at the gatc platform germany the sequencing run contained 58 tagged amplicons from 27 wwtp samples the positive and negative controls all in duplicate 2 3 reference databases for ev identification from partial 1dvp1 two different databases were built for the bio informatics analysis the first database named database i was built by aligning sequences from all human and non human ev reference strains downloaded from the ncbi genbank database sequences of sapelovirus were added as an outgroup the second database database ii was built to span intratypic ev diversity the partial vp1 gene sequences targeted by the pcr primers used in this study were recovered from all nucleotide sequences for each human ev type available in genbank as of march 2015 these published sequences were compiled with those determined in our laboratory all the sequence data sets were constructed with the bioedit software version 7 1 9 http www mbio ncsu edu bioedit bioedit html assignment and sequence quality were checked with phylogenetic trees reconstructed by the neighbour joining method implemented in mega software v5 01 tamura et al 2011 the sequences with assignment error or with suspected sequencing error were discarded for each type we selected sequences representing each cluster defined as sequences with less than 1 of nucleic acid differences the final database contained 3 256 2 4 bioinformatic analysis and quality control of sequence data the vsearch open source tool for metagenomics https github com torognes vsearch was used for processing and preparing sequence data after assembly of paired end reads sequences were aligned and those containing ambiguous bases n or mismatches in primers were removed putative chimaeras were identified and removed with the vsearch tool the remaining sequences that shared 98 nucleotide sequence identity were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit otu the taxonomic assignment of the sequence representing each otu was performed by similarity and phylogeny using the two reference databases described above for each otu the closest sequences in database ii were selected by similarity for a first assignment these sequences were then added to the phylogenetic tree reconstructed with fasttree price et al 2010 from sequences of database i for a second phylogenetic assignment the consistency of the results provided by the two methods was verified this process was performed with a modified version of the pipeline panam phylogenetic analysis of next generation amplicons https github com panammeb taib et al 2013 we checked the data for detecting eventual mistagging effect esling et al 2015 schnell et al 2015 by removing sequences representing less 0 5 of the total abundance we eliminated the spurious ones technical appendix a supplementary data duplicates were then pooled for the final analysis we normalised the wwtp samples using the vegan package of r software which consists in a random selection of the same number of sequences in each sample this number was defined as the number of sequences present in the sample containing the lowest sequence number 16 250 sequences in our run 2 5 ev sequences from clinical infections over the same period between october 2014 and october 2015 3191 ev infections were reported to the french national laboratory network of enterovirus surveillance rse coordinated by the agency santé publique france and the national reference centre for enteroviruses and parechoviruses evs were detected by molecular typing in 2124 patients of whom 122 were seen at the teaching hospital of clermont ferrand typing was performed prospectively in all clinical samples cerebrospinal fluid csf blood respiratory stool and throat nucleotide sequences were obtained after complete vp1 gene amplification with species specific primers mirand et al 2016 2006 schuffenecker et al 2016 or with pan ev primers nix et al 2006 targeting a partial region of the vp1 gene the amplicons were sequenced by the sanger technique using the bigdye terminator kit applied biosystems 2 6 phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic analysis based on the partial vp1 gene sequences was performed with the maximum parsimony method implemented in the bionumerics software biomérieux marcy l etoile france the sequences that shared 98 nucleotide identity were clustered in a single sphere 2 7 accession numbers the partial vp1 gene sequences have been deposited in the genbank sequence database under accession numbers mk086267 to mk086510 and mk086163 to mk086266 for wastewater otus and clinical sequences respectively 3 results 3 1 sequencing data of the merged sequences assembly of forward and reverse reads 33 were discarded by the quality control analyses of the remaining sequences assigned to an ev type 0 4 were removed because of incorrect or inaccurate assignment the sequences assigned to rhinovirus types 0 7 were also excluded leaving a set of 2 001 179 sequences for further analyses the cleaning analyses applied to the entire dataset left 1 546 641 sequences in the wastewater samples and 438 750 sequences after the normalisation of data table 1 3 2 diversity of ev types in the wwtp samples otus were assigned to 3 taxonomic species ev a b and c table 1 no sequences were allocated to the ev d species a total of 48 ev types were

level some such as ev a119 and ev a76 were detected sporadically in the wastewater samples and others such as cv a11 and cv a22 were present over time in several consecutive samples a set of 16 sequences clustered in a single otu and shared 99 4 nucleotide identity with the sabin pv 1 vaccine sequence accession number v01150 1 and accordingly were classified as sabin like pv 1 after cleaning and normalisation sequences were clustered into 180 otus which were assigned to 33 ev types table 1 the sequences were distributed among ev b 60 1 ev a 26 and ev c 13 9 species four ev types accounted for more than 70 of all normalised sequences table 1 cv b5 43 9 of sequences cv a16 13 3 cv a5 7 4 and cv a11 6 2 a set of 10 minority ev types accounted for 1 5 of all sequences fifteen ev types represented by a handful of sequences less than 0 5 of the sequences from a respective sample 2 to 703 sequences by type in the whole sequence set were removed during mistagging cleaning and were excluded from the temporal analysis because their allocation to a given sampling date was unreliable however they were included in the analysis of the global diversity of evs within the community

free countries benschop et al 2017 delogu et al 2018 the findings clearly show the need to maintain a high immunization coverage to avoid the occurrence of an outbreak associated with the circulation of vaccine derived polioviruses vdpv as reported in 2015 in ukraine khetsuriani et al 2017 cv a11 and cv a22 were among the five most abundant types in this study these unexpectedly prevalent non polio ev c types could be a gene reservoir for the emergence of recombinant vdpv bessaud et al 2011 we also evidenced the circulation of rare ev a eg a76 a89 ev b eg b78 and ev c eg c105 c116 types previously unreported in the french population and for which few epidemiological and genomic data are available notably our environmental surveillance identified new ev c types associated with severe respiratory diseases and neurological disease conditions whose detection in the faeces was considered to be difficult holm hansen et al 2016 our findings suggest that the circulation of these viruses in the community could be higher than anticipated from the number of reported clinical infections and are consistent with suggestions to enhance the surveillance of ev c species in respiratory specimens barnadas et al 2017 van leer buter et al 2016 our study has two limitations first although the pan ev primers used included a high number of degenerate positions variations in the levels of pcr amplification exist among ev types and could explain why we did not detect ev d68 this virus was previously detected however by type specific amplification confirmed by direct sanger sequencing in 7 27 samples bisseux et al 2018 second we showed that incorrect assignment of reads caused the random spread of signals within multiplexed samples and artificially inflated the diversity detected in each sample this bias referred to as mistagging esling et al 2015 or tag jump schnell et al 2015 has been rarely documented and taken into account in uds analyses despite its critical impact on the quality of data collected for ecological and epidemiological studies minimising incorrect assignments and obtaining reliable results is a real challenge for metabarcoding studies on illumina sequencing platforms strategies including controls must be incorporated into the experimental design to perform sequence data filtering esling et al 2015 galan et al 2016 despite these limits amplicon deep sequencing in wastewater for surveillance and epidemiological studies clearly surpasses earlier techniques used in this field with the implementation of robust quality controls monitoring evs in wastewater can be implemented as a supplementary surveillance system of the community at large to complement clinical surveillance 5 conclusion the combination of temporal wastewater sampling efficient virus concentration from samples analysis with amplicon deep sequencing and robust sequence assignment allow the detection of a large array of ev types while avoiding the bias caused by cell culture sustained environmental surveillance is an advanced approach for a better understanding of the diversity of the ev landscape within an urban community the environmental findings of this study show the circulation of clinically uncommon evs including respiratory ev c species strains and sabin like pv 1 and provide a powerful complement to the clinical data declaration of competing interest

18363,groundwater as the most important drinking water source in arid regions of china has been polluted seriously by accumulated nitrate and heavy metals an economic alternative with capacity of simultaneous mitigation of nitrate and heavy metals is urgently needed this study explored the incorporation of iron scraps and biochar into constructed wetlands cws for enhancing purification performance and investigated interactions of effective nitrate reduction and heavy metals mitigation the results showed that nitrate reduction performance could reach 87 in iron and carbon based fe c cws through fe c micro electrolysis process with lower nitrous oxide n2o emission 4 6 11 75 μg m 2 h 1 due to the complete denitrification process moreover efficient heavy metals mitigation of 75 97 total chromium cr and total lead pb was obtained from fe c systems however the occurrence of heavy metals cr and pb in the influent posed an adverse impact on nitrate removal with the reduction rate of 19 43 biochemical characteristics of wetland plants indicated that the plants also suffered from the stress which induced from heavy metals overall although the addition of iron and biochar in cws enhanced nitrate and heavy metals removal in low carbon groundwater further investigation is still needed to reveal the complex relationships between the removal of nitrate and heavy metals in cws graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands nitrate removal heavy metals groundwater iron carbon micro electrolysis 1 introduction groundwater has been recognized as an important source of drinking water in many arid and semiarid regions of the world e g china however the overuse of chemical fertilizer in agriculture over the past several years have caused a serious crisis of groundwater contamination e g nitrate accumulation which may pose a severe threat to public health from drinking groundwater deng et al 2011 ghafari et al 2009 aslan and cakici 2007 fan et al 2009 in addition heavy metals which mostly come from industries are often detected in groundwater and have been considered as priority pollutants due to their bioaccumulation capacity and persistence nature saha et al 2017 qiu and gui 2019 some metals e g cr pb as hg and cd in the drinking groundwater even at very low concentration may show negative impact on human health saha et al 2017 thus the need of seeking an appropriate technology to remediate the nitrate and heavy metals co contaminated groundwater in many regions of world e g china is highly urgent various technologies have been applied to remove nitrate from groundwater such as chemical reduction fu et al 2014 photocatalytic degradation anderson 2011 electrochemical denitrification li et al 2010 ion exchange samatya et al 2006 reverse osmosis schoeman and steyn 2003 and electrodialysis elmidaoui et al 2001 however these technologies are often restrained by their expensive installation and high optional cost and biological denitrification with high efficiency and cost effectiveness is regarded as an appropriate technology for the nitrate elimination della rocca et al 2007 he et al 2019 in the past several decades constructed wetlands cws as a green and sustainable biological technology have become increasingly used for treating various wastewaters owing to their robustness low energy input and easy operation wu et al 2014 the removal of nitrate in conventional cws is mainly relying on the heterotrophic denitrification which utilizes organic matter as electron donor to reduce nitrate into n2 cecconet et al 2018 however the lack of bio available organic carbon in the groundwater has often been regarded as the most common hindrance for nitrate removal through heterotrophic denitrification process in cws jahangir et al 2012 external dosing of organic compounds e g methanol fructose and synthetic polymers will significantly increase the operational cost of cws and may also create second pollution shen et al 2015 caselles osorio and joan 2006 thus enhancing alternative denitrification process e g autotrophic denitrification in cws on groundwater treatment to improve the nitrate removal has formed the trend of research and application interest autotrophic denitrification is a pathway of biological denitrification where denitrifiers mainly rely on reduced inorganic compounds as electron donors such as hydrogen ferrous iron or sulfur and inorganic carbon to achieve nitrogen removal xiao et al 2017 this process has become increasingly attractive for nitrogen removal from groundwater by virtue of unadded external carbon and lower secondary organic pollution iron carbon fe c micro electrolysis as a widely used technology in wastewater treatment can produce hydroxyl atomic hydrogen and fe ii spontaneously in iron and carbon particles forming plentiful microscopic galvanic cells yang et al 2009 2017 this micro electrolysis process could benefit the biological denitrification significantly because electrons can be stably and rapidly provided for denitrifying bacteria by abundant micro galvanic cell reactions xing et al 2016 in the fe c micro electrolysis fe loses two electrons oxidised to fe2 for the anode and h accepts an electron forming h for the cathode van der zee et al 2003 deng et al 2016a found that efficient simultaneous nitrification and autotrophic denitrification could be enhanced by micro electrolysis based electron donor production during low carbon wastewater treatment deng et al 2016b also proved that autotrophic denitrification could contribute more than 80 to the total nitrogen removal in a fe c combined biological reactor zheng et al 2019 combined a cw system with iron carbon fe c system to enhance the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and found that microbial degradation through iron carbon micro electrolysis was the main nitrogen removal pathway in the cws system moreover there are some other studies confirming that additions of fe c materials are effective for the removal of heavy metals for example wu et al 2013 showed that fe c in water could provide outstanding reducibility for cr ⅵ reaction and the removal rate could reach 99 yuan and liu 2013 also obtained a removal of 97 for pb and zn from aqueous solution by sintering bentonite iron powder and activated carbon which was similar to the fe c micro electrolysis environment however to the best of our knowledge there are few studies of investigating the potential of micro electrolysis process in cws for purifying groundwater containing nitrate and heavy metals moreover for the simultaneous removal of these contaminants little quantitative information is available on exploring the interaction of nitrate and heavy metal removal in black box cws as a green and sustainable technology therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous removal of nitrate and heavy metals e g cr and pb as well as mitigation of n2o emission in iron carbon incorporated cws for purifying nitrate and heavy metals polluted groundwater 2 to elucidate interactions of nitrate reduction and heavy metal mitigation by analyzing nitrogen transformation kinetics in cws in the presence of single or multiple heavy metals and 3 to characterize the response of wetland plants and microbial community in cws for treating nitrate and heavy metals contained groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental cw microcosms three cw microcosms a fe c b fe and c control designed in a vertical flow vf style were established in the laboratory at northwest a f university china each cw microcosm was identically made of a cylindrical pvc tube with an inner diameter of 20 cm and height of 65 cm fig s1 the main microcosm filter layer consisted of a 15 cm sandy substrate and a 50 cm gravel substrate underneath comprised of three layers the bottom layer was filled with coarse gravel 10 cm thickness size 4 6 cm as the supporting layer and the middle layer was 25 cm of fine gravel size 2 3 cm above the fine gravel layer there was a 10 cm layer that varied for different microcosm systems specifically the fe c cw microcosm was filled with iron scraps and biochar size 0 1 cm at a mass ratio of 1 1 after being washed and the fe cw microcosm was the mixture of iron scraps and gravel size 0 1 cm in which the quality of iron was equal to that in fe c cws the control cw microcosm was filled only with gravel size 0 1 cm in all systems aeration devices were installed at the bottom of the system to adjust the dissolved oxygen do concentration a perforated pvc pipe height 66 cm diameter 3 cm was installed in the center of the systems for measuring do concentration inside the wetland system all cw systems were planted with healthy plants iris pseudacorus of similar size approximately 0 3 m in height at a density of six rhizomes per system 2 2 operation of experimental cw microcosms all systems were operated in a sequencing fill and drain batch mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days after establishing all cw systems an acclimation process for plants and microorganisms was performed for approximately one month and the experiment was then started by feeding the synthetic groundwater into the systems the synthetic groundwater with nitrate and heavy metals cr and pb was prepared from tap water by adding kno3 c12h22o11 kh2po4 k2cr2o7 pb no3 2 and trace elements mgcl2 cacl2 based on the reports in the literatures and the monitoring data of groundwater in china the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n 20 mg l 1 lin et al 2008 xiao et al 2019 total chromium cr 2 mg l 1 peng et al 2016 and lead pb 2 mg l 1 bavandpour et al 2018 were used in this study the influent characteristics during the whole experimental period are described in table 1 the nitrate surface loading rate slr was 1 27 g n m 2 d 1 according to different operating conditions the whole cws experiment was divided into five periods namely the start up period i period ii with nitrate period iii with nitrate and single heavy metal period iv with nitrate and multiple heavy metals and period v without heavy metals more detailed operational information for each period is displayed in table s1 the intermittent aeration of 2 h 0 00 01 00 and 12 00 13 00 each day at a rate of 60 ml min 1 was applied since period ii in each cw microcosms zhou et al 2018a 2 3 batch tests to further understand the role of biochar and iron scraps in the reduction of nitrate and heavy metals batch tests were established in erlenmeyer flasks after the cws experiments three batch tests for 15 days were carried out through adding biochar iron scraps biochar and iron scraps together respectively the used biochar was washed with distilled water and iron scraps were washed with hydrochloric acid hcl 2 before the tests different mass of three materials 5 g iron scraps 5 g biochar 5 g iron scraps and 5 g biochar were then added into the 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks after which the flasks were sterilized in a pressure cooker for 30 min after sterilization 150 ml solution were added to the flasks and then placed into an incubator at 25 c with shaking operation three times a day during the whole leaching process meanwhile 2 3 drops of trichloromethane were mixed to guarantee the reactions conducted without microorganisms after filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the filtrates were stored at 4 c until water quality measurement the supernatants were analyzed for nitrogen cr pb and fe concentrations 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 water sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every 3 d and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm for measurements of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn total chromium cr and lead pb the concentration of nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn were determined by an ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer uv 1780 shmadzu japan based on the methods described in the standards apha 2005 total cr and pb concentrations were determined by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp ms icap qc thermo fisher usa the do and water temperature were measured by a do meter hq 30 d 53 led hach usa in situ in addition total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod were also monitored and the results are shown in fig s2 and discussed in text s1 2 4 2 gas sampling and analysis to elucidate the pathways of nitrogen removal gas samples were collected at each fill drain cycle using a stationary chamber method to measure n2o flux the gas collection was carried out for a period of 1 h from 9 00 to 10 00 a m at an interval of 20 min in a 100 ml injection syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography gc agilent technologies 7890 b within 24 h the air temperature in the chamber was monitored during gas collection the detailed information including sampling and calculation methods can be found in our previous studies zhou et al 2018b 2 4 3 plant sampling and analysis to understand the response of plants in the systems to multiple pollution with nitrate and heavy metals several plant biochemical indices including catalase cat and malondialdehyde mda were measured plant samples were collected at the end of each experimental period except for the period i the level of lipid peroxidation in plant leaves was determined by measuring the mda content referring to the method described by heath and packer 1968 cat as an antioxidative plant enzyme was assayed based on the method described by aebi 1974 2 4 4 substrates sampling and microbial community analysis to assess the microbial community in cw systems added with different materials substrates samples 150 g were collected from two layers the second and the third layer of substrates in each cw at the end of stage v after adding distilled water with a solid liquid mass ratio of approximately 1 1 the sample was shaken 20 min in an ultrasonic cleaner to make microorganism fall off into the solution finally the mixture was filtrated using 0 45 μm membrane for the purpose of immobilizing microbes in the filter membrane and stored immediately at 80 c until for dna extraction genomic dna was extracted by using microbial dna extraction kit primers gtactcctacgggaggcagca and gtggactachvgggtwtctaat were used for the pcr amplification of 16 s rrna v3 v4 hypervariable regions the pcr products were then sent to axygen tech beijing china for high throughput sequencing on the platform at illumina miseqpe250 after removing barcodes and primers and further cleaning chimera short sequences through qiime v1 8 0 http qiime org the obtained high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 sequence similarity threshold using uclust 2 5 statistical analysis the anova was conducted for statistical analyses mean value standard deviations via spss 13 0 software spss inc chicago usa in this study the results were considered to be significant when p value was below 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nitrogen removal fig 1 presents the variation of nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn concentrations in influent and effluent during all the experimental periods the influent no3 n concentration in different cws was kept at 20 mg l 1 fig 1a and the effluent no3 n concentration in the fe c cw was always the lowest among three cw microcosms at stage i no3 n was evidently removed but the accumulation of nh4 n no2 n occurred in the first few days of operation in the fe c and fe systems fig 1b and c this phenomenon is consistent with observations from other studies deng et al 2016b pu et al 2014 and the main reason was the chemical reduction of no3 n gradually the effluent no3 n concentration was stabilized at around 2 4 mg l 1 in fe and fe c cw systems and accordingly the effluent nh4 n concentration was accumulated to be 10 mg l 1 fig 2 and fig s3 presents the dynamics of nitrogen transformations in fe c and fe batch tests respectively the results indicated that the decreased no3 n concentration might be highly relating to the chemical reduction of nitrate to ammonium by iron rather than the effect of biochar fig s4 therefore the tn removal was highly limited in this stage among all the three cws fig 1d to improve the tn removal performance intermittent aeration was adopted to intensify microbial nh4 n oxidation since stage ii and the do concentration varied between 0 and 2 mg l 1 in the fe c and fe systems compared with stage i the effluent concentrations of nh4 n was decreased to 1 4 mg l 1 average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies in fe c cw were obtained at 87 and 78 while average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies in fe cw were 81 and 69 table 1 the organic carbon in the influent was only 20 mg l 1 cod which can only fuel 6 9 mg l 1 nitrate removal by conventional heterotrophic denitrification therefore the removed nitrate in this stage of the current study might be attributed to some alternative processes e g autotrophic denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process dnra other than the process of heterotrophic denitrification rahman et al 2019 this phenomenon can also be referred to several former investigations deng et al 2016a 2016b ge et al 2019 in order to explore the interaction of heavy metals and nitrate removal processes cr 2 mg l 1 was singly introduced into the influent in the experimental stage iii as shown in fig 1 effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were still staying at a low level in all cw systems however effluent no3 n concentrations in the fe c cw increased gradually from 2 79 mg l 1 to 6 81 mg l 1 table 2 correspondingly the tn removal efficiency in fe c cw decreased from 78 to 64 indicating the negative impact of cr on nitrate removal the introduction of pb into the influent in the experimental stage iv further decreased the removal of nitrate to 43 with effluent no3 n concentration increased to 12 44 mg l 1 whereas for fe cw average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies both decreased to 37 this difference between fe c and fe cws might be attributed to the biochar addition in the fe c system causing a micro electrolysis environment in which the process of electron transfer to the biofilm surface was slow and stable liu and wang 2019 it should be noted that the effect of heavy metals on nitrogen removal is complex but can be mainly ascribed to electron competition between reduction of nitrate and heavy metals he et al 2015 zhai et al 2017 the declined nitrate reduction rate in the fe c and fe batch tests indirectly illustrated that the chemical reduction of heavy metals might compete for electrons provided by fe c micro electrolysis or fe with the nitrate reduction fig 2 and fig s3 he et al 2015 proved that cr reductase chrr had more competition capability for electrons than nitrate reductase which could infer that the biotransformation of heavy metals could affect nitrate removal performance in cws besides cr reduction may produce some reactive free radicals such as cr v and o2 damaging enzyme synthesis and metabolism of microorganisms further influencing the denitrification process zhai et al 2017 at stage v the nitrogen removal performance was explored when heavy metals were absent in synthetic influent groundwater the effluent no3 n concentrations in the fe c cw were still 13 30 mg l 1 and the overall nitrogen removal performance did not recover when the heavy metals was removed from the influent in the period of 48 days in this experimental stage the possible reason may be that the continuous input of toxic heavy metals with the high concentration might exert a negative influence on the health of plants and the microorganisms related to nitrate reduction which could not recover in a short time further investigations would be necessary for confirming this point 3 1 2 heavy metal removal the predominant mechanisms of metal removal in cws are either biotic plant uptake or abiotic e g adsorption precipitation and reduction but the abiotic routes can play a primary role especially for newly cw systems mainly depending on physio chemical characteristics of wetland substrate bavandpour et al 2018 fig 3 presents the dynamics of cr and pb removal in different cws during the periods of iii and iv the average removal efficiency of total cr reached 97 in stage iii and decreased to 88 in stage iv when pb appeared in the influent table 1 the cr was completely removed in the first 20 days in fe c cws but the effluent concentration gradually increased the control system exhibited little cr removal function and the effluent concentration was almost close to the influent content 2 mg l 1 during the whole experiment meanwhile it is shown that the total cr concentration decreased rapidly in fe and fe c batch tests but remained high in biochar batch test fig s5 indicating the neglectable adsorption of biochar and gravels as shown in fig 3 the effluent total cr concentration in fe c cw was higher than that in fe cw a former study reported that fe c system with excellent reducibility of cr could form micro electrolysis to speed up the cr reaction rate wu et al 2013 however our results showed that cr removal in fe c cw was inferior to that in fe cws this difference may arise from the dissolved organic matters dom released from biochar which was mainly composed of humic acid like and fulvic acid like materials li et al 2017 these compounds could possibly ligate the iron especially fe ii so that make fe ii an overall weaker reductant ponder et al 2000 hakala et al 2009 when the cr and pb coexisted in the influent at stage iv the average cr removal efficiency decreased sharply from 94 to 75 in fe c cw and from 97 to 88 in fe cw table 2 it is shown that fe0 fe2 preferred to react with pb2 compared with cr6 through the batch tests fig s5 which might result in the lower cr removal when pb appeared in the influent however the effluent pb concentrations remained to be less than 0 03 mg l 1 and there were no significant differences for pb removal among different cws being consistent with the performance of cw microcosms pb was removed rapidly in all batch tests depending less on filling materials there are several reports indicating that pb removal by iron involved several processes such as reduction adsorption and precipitation arancibia miranda et al 2014 xi et al 2010 yuan and liu 2013 proved that the pb chemical reaction was the rate controlling step for pb removal when employing bentonite iron powder and activated carbon as raw materials for pb removal from aqueous solution in our cws experiments the control cw system also exhibited better pb removal probably due to the immobilization of media complexation or chelation lim et al 2003 3 1 3 nitrous oxide emissions nitrous oxide n2o can be produced and accumulated as a significant intermediate product during the microbial nitrogen removal process in cws which have been found to be one of the key potential sources of greenhouse gases liu et al 2016 huang et al 2012 thus it is necessary to evaluate the potentiality of n2o emission in three different cws fig 4 illustrates the variation of average n2o emission flux in different cws throughout different experimental periods overall the fe cw system emitted higher n2o 3 21 40 55 μg m 2 h 1 than the fe c cw 4 6 11 75 μg m 2 h 1 and control cw 2 23 6 39 μg m 2 h 1 compared with the average n2o emission flux 120 μg m 2 h 1 reviewed in previous studies the n2o emissions in this study were much lower mander et al 2014 the average values of n2o emission factors n2o n inflow tnin 100 differed significantly in all cws 0 017 0 044 in fe c cw 0 012 0 152 in fe cw and 0 008 0 024 in the control cw among which the n2o emission factor in the fe c was close to the average n2o emission factor in vertical subsurface flow vssf cws 0 023 during stage ii the n2o emission was relatively higher in fe cw compared with that in fe c cw this phenomenon can be related to the relatively higher no2 n concentrations in fe cw fig 1b which are consistent with previous studies that greater no2 n concentrations often accompanied with higher production of n2o in the process of wastewater treatment foley et al 2010 wang et al 2017 the interpretation can be attributed to incomplete denitrification process in which n2o accumulation was caused by that n2o reduction rate was lower than no2 n reduction rate both in fe cws since cr and pb existed in the influent the n2o emissions from fe cws decreased significantly with the decreasing denitrification correspondingly meanwhile fe c cw exhibited smaller n2o fluctuation to the shock of heavy metals and kept to be a low level during all the experimental stages overall the n2o emission in control cw was the lowest in this study because the low nitrate reduction rate might result in low n2o production and accumulation fe c and fe cws also exhibited lower n2o emission as well as higher nitrate removal performance demonstrating that a complete denitrification process could be achieved in this study 3 2 effects of heavy metals on nitrogen transformation to interpret the shock of heavy metals on nitrogen transformation water quality was also measured at different intervals during a typical experimental cycle the variations of nitrogen and heavy metals concentrations and n2o emission flux in an experiment cycle 72 h during period iii are plotted in fig s6 it is noteworthy that the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n had no accumulation throughout the whole typical experiment in all cws this demonstrated that there was little reaction of no3 n to nh4 n and autotrophic denitrification was achieved in fe c and fe cws during stage iii however no3 n contents exhibited quite different trends among three cws during a fill drain cycle the no3 n concentration became stable at 48 h 24 h and 6 h in fe c cw fe cw and control cw fig s6 as shown in fig 5 a the control cw showed the highest nitrate reduction rate 0 47 mg l 1 h 1 and the following was fe cw 0 39 mg l 1 h 1 the lowest was fe c cw 0 27 mg l 1 h 1 meanwhile the n2o emission fluxes in different cws decreased gradually in the starting period of wastewater feeding with a transient rise and finally decreased again in the last period fig s6 similar trends were also obtained in stages iv and v fig s7 and fig s8 during the typical operating stage iv the nitrate reduction in fe cw 0 16 mg l 1 h 1 and control cw 0 12 mg l 1 h 1 decreased while fe c cw 0 28 mg l 1 h 1 remained stable compared with stage iii fig 5b the introduced heavy metals cr and pb might cause electron competition with nitrate and thus affecting the denitrification process zhai et al 2017 when heavy metals were absent in the influent the nitrate removal rates increased gradually but were still lower than that in period iii fig 5c based on the above results besides posing an adverse effect on nitrate removal performance the coexistence of heavy metals cr and pb could also decrease the nitrate reduction rate particularly in fe cw and control cw whereas the nitrate reduction rate in fe c cw manifested a slight fluctuation to the shock of heavy metals hence although the nitrate reduction rate in fe c cws was low the systems could achieve higher nitrate removal efficiency and have higher tolerance to cr and pb than that in control cw and fe cw 3 3 response of wetland plants and microbial community the capacity of plants to resist the shock stress of pollutants in wastewaters is vital to sustainable operation and development of cws fig 6 shows the variation of mda content and cat activity of wetland plants in different cws mda is a major cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation and the content can be used to assess the membrane damage caused by wastewater the mda content increased gradually with cr and pb occurred in the influent which indicated that certain concentrations of cr and pb increase the cell membrane permeability and catalyze lipid peroxidation eventually leading to a broken membrane system xu et al 2010 in addition the mda content also increased significantly in both fe c and fe cws although after ceasing addition of heavy metals at stage v which was similar to the trend of nitrate removal this phenomenon showed that the effect of cr and pb on plants was irreclaimable at least in a short time resulting in severe damage to their development and function wang et al 2016 reported that there may be a threshold for self recovery of wetland plants when investigating the inhibition and adaptability of four wetland plant species to high concentrations of ammonium therefore high cr and pb influent concentrations might be a possible explanation for the continuous increase of mda content cat one of the plant protection systems can collaborate with other systems such as sod and pod to remove the accumulated mda contrary to mda contents the values of cat activity in all cws decreased significantly when heavy metals were introduced into the simulated groundwater fig 6b when plants were exposed to heavy metals the intuitional effects were the slow growth and lower biomass which can be reflected indirectly by the observation during the experimental period considering the internal response of plants metal phytotoxicity would reduce the capacity of the plants to assimilate carbon and this in turn could induce an increase in photosynthetic electron flux to molecular oxygen resulting in the increased production of superoxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical where cat enzymes were responsible for removing these toxic peroxides bhaduri and fulekar 2012 meanwhile we found that the cat activity in control system was always higher than that in fe c and fe cws the possible reasons may be that the plants in control cws could not suffer from the influence of fe leaching from iron scraps bacterial community in cws was characterized by using illumina high throughput sequencing technique fig 7 shows the relative abundance of a total of 10 dominant bacterial communities in different cws significant differences in bacterial community composition at the phylum level were observed between fe fe c cw and control cw fig 7a proteobacteria occupied an obvious quantitative superiority in the two layers of fe c and fe cws accounting for 75 55 and 54 30 respectively it is believed that most of denitrification bacteria belonged to this phyla proteobacteria si et al 2018 in this study the addition of iron and biochar increased the abundance of proteobacteria which played an important role in no3 n removal thereby proving that fe c or fe can promote no3 n removal as found in a previous study zheng et al 2019 proteobacteria mainly included α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria and δ proteobacteria at class level compared with the control cw the relative abundance of α proteobacteria and β proteobacteria were higher particularly in fe c cw fig 7b which may explain the higher nitrate removal performance in fe c cw microbial composition at the family and genus levels are depicted in fig 7c and d the most abundant bacteria in fe c were rhodobacteraceae and subordinative rhodobacter at genus level particularly in the layer containing iron and biochar rhodobacter genera is deemed as a kind of phototrophic bacteria which was related to fe ii oxidation and nitrogen removal chakraborty and picardal 2013 a previous study also found that the high amounts of both nitrate and ammonium removal under photoheterotrophic and anoxic dark growth conditions respectively idi et al 2015 thus the higher abundance of rhodobacter in fe and fe c cws compared with control cw could explain that the addition of iron and biochar improved denitrification processes by changing microbial community structure the relative abundances of the key functional bacteria such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob denitrobacteria dnb and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in different cw treatments are also shown in table s2 it indicated that the relative abundance of dnb in fe c system were much higher than that in control cw such as thauera and denitratisoma which were reported to be related to autotrophic denitrification xing et al 2016 these results could provide useful information to understand biological nitrogen removal process in fe c and fe cw systems 3 4 environmental implications exploring the interactions of nitrate reduction and heavy metal mitigation in cws is of great significance for groundwater remediation the results indicate that the micro electrolysis fe c cw system could potentially be applied as an

18363,groundwater as the most important drinking water source in arid regions of china has been polluted seriously by accumulated nitrate and heavy metals an economic alternative with capacity of simultaneous mitigation of nitrate and heavy metals is urgently needed this study explored the incorporation of iron scraps and biochar into constructed wetlands cws for enhancing purification performance and investigated interactions of effective nitrate reduction and heavy metals mitigation the results showed that nitrate reduction performance could reach 87 in iron and carbon based fe c cws through fe c micro electrolysis process with lower nitrous oxide n2o emission 4 6 11 75 μg m 2 h 1 due to the complete denitrification process moreover efficient heavy metals mitigation of 75 97 total chromium cr and total lead pb was obtained from fe c systems however the occurrence of heavy metals cr and pb in the influent posed an adverse impact on nitrate removal with the reduction rate of 19 43 biochemical characteristics of wetland plants indicated that the plants also suffered from the stress which induced from heavy metals overall although the addition of iron and biochar in cws enhanced nitrate and heavy metals removal in low carbon groundwater further investigation is still needed to reveal the complex relationships between the removal of nitrate and heavy metals in cws graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands nitrate removal heavy metals groundwater iron carbon micro electrolysis 1 introduction groundwater has been recognized as an important source of drinking water in many arid and semiarid regions of the world e g china however the overuse of chemical fertilizer in agriculture over the past several years have caused a serious crisis of groundwater contamination e g nitrate accumulation which may pose a severe threat to public health from drinking groundwater deng et al 2011 ghafari et al 2009 aslan and cakici 2007 fan et al 2009 in addition heavy metals which mostly come from industries are often detected in groundwater and have been considered as priority pollutants due to their bioaccumulation capacity and persistence nature saha et al 2017 qiu and gui 2019 some metals e g cr pb as hg and cd in the drinking groundwater even at very low concentration may show negative impact on human health saha et al 2017 thus the need of seeking an appropriate technology to remediate the nitrate and heavy metals co contaminated groundwater in many regions of world e g china is highly urgent various technologies have been applied to remove nitrate from groundwater such as chemical reduction fu et al 2014 photocatalytic degradation anderson 2011 electrochemical denitrification li et al 2010 ion exchange samatya et al 2006 reverse osmosis schoeman and steyn 2003 and electrodialysis elmidaoui et al 2001 however these technologies are often restrained by their expensive installation and high optional cost and biological denitrification with high efficiency and cost effectiveness is regarded as an appropriate technology for the nitrate elimination della rocca et al 2007 he et al 2019 in the past several decades constructed wetlands cws as a green and sustainable biological technology have become increasingly used for treating various wastewaters owing to their robustness low energy input and easy operation wu et al 2014 the removal of nitrate in conventional cws is mainly relying on the heterotrophic denitrification which utilizes organic matter as electron donor to reduce nitrate into n2 cecconet et al 2018 however the lack of bio available organic carbon in the groundwater has often been regarded as the most common hindrance for nitrate removal through heterotrophic denitrification process in cws jahangir et al 2012 external dosing of organic compounds e g methanol fructose and synthetic polymers will significantly increase the operational cost of cws and may also create second pollution shen et al 2015 caselles osorio and joan 2006 thus enhancing alternative denitrification process e g autotrophic denitrification in cws on groundwater treatment to improve the nitrate removal has formed the trend of research and application interest autotrophic denitrification is a pathway of biological denitrification where denitrifiers mainly rely on reduced inorganic compounds as electron donors such as hydrogen ferrous iron or sulfur and inorganic carbon to achieve nitrogen removal xiao et al 2017 this process has become increasingly attractive for nitrogen removal from groundwater by virtue of unadded external carbon and lower secondary organic pollution iron carbon fe c micro electrolysis as a widely used technology in wastewater treatment can produce hydroxyl atomic hydrogen and fe ii spontaneously in iron and carbon particles forming plentiful microscopic galvanic cells yang et al 2009 2017 this micro electrolysis process could benefit the biological denitrification significantly because electrons can be stably and rapidly provided for denitrifying bacteria by abundant micro galvanic cell reactions xing et al 2016 in the fe c micro electrolysis fe loses two electrons oxidised to fe2 for the anode and h accepts an electron forming h for the cathode van der zee et al 2003 deng et al 2016a found that efficient simultaneous nitrification and autotrophic denitrification could be enhanced by micro electrolysis based electron donor production during low carbon wastewater treatment deng et al 2016b also proved that autotrophic denitrification could contribute more than 80 to the total nitrogen removal in a fe c combined biological reactor zheng et al 2019 combined a cw system with iron carbon fe c system to enhance the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and found that microbial degradation through iron carbon micro electrolysis was the main nitrogen removal pathway in the cws system moreover there are some other studies confirming that additions of fe c materials are effective for the removal of heavy metals for example wu et al 2013 showed that fe c in water could provide outstanding reducibility for cr ⅵ reaction and the removal rate could reach 99 yuan and liu 2013 also obtained a removal of 97 for pb and zn from aqueous solution by sintering bentonite iron powder and activated carbon which was similar to the fe c micro electrolysis environment however to the best of our knowledge there are few studies of investigating the potential of micro electrolysis process in cws for purifying groundwater containing nitrate and heavy metals moreover for the simultaneous removal of these contaminants little quantitative information is available on exploring the interaction of nitrate and heavy metal removal in black box cws as a green and sustainable technology therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous removal of nitrate and heavy metals e g cr and pb as well as mitigation of n2o emission in iron carbon incorporated cws for purifying nitrate and heavy metals polluted groundwater 2 to elucidate interactions of nitrate reduction and heavy metal mitigation by analyzing nitrogen transformation kinetics in cws in the presence of single or multiple heavy metals and 3 to characterize the response of wetland plants and microbial community in cws for treating nitrate and heavy metals contained groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental cw microcosms three cw microcosms a fe c b fe and c control designed in a vertical flow vf style were established in the laboratory at northwest a f university china each cw microcosm was identically made of a cylindrical pvc tube with an inner diameter of 20 cm and height of 65 cm fig s1 the main microcosm filter layer consisted of a 15 cm sandy substrate and a 50 cm gravel substrate underneath comprised of three layers the bottom layer was filled with coarse gravel 10 cm thickness size 4 6 cm as the supporting layer and the middle layer was 25 cm of fine gravel size 2 3 cm above the fine gravel layer there was a 10 cm layer that varied for different microcosm systems specifically the fe c cw microcosm was filled with iron scraps and biochar size 0 1 cm at a mass ratio of 1 1 after being washed and the fe cw microcosm was the mixture of iron scraps and gravel size 0 1 cm in which the quality of iron was equal to that in fe c cws the control cw microcosm was filled only with gravel size 0 1 cm in all systems aeration devices were installed at the bottom of the system to adjust the dissolved oxygen do concentration a perforated pvc pipe height 66 cm diameter 3 cm was installed in the center of the systems for measuring do concentration inside the wetland system all cw systems were planted with healthy plants iris pseudacorus of similar size approximately 0 3 m in height at a density of six rhizomes per system 2 2 operation of experimental cw microcosms all systems were operated in a sequencing fill and drain batch mode with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days after establishing all cw systems an acclimation process for plants and microorganisms was performed for approximately one month and the experiment was then started by feeding the synthetic groundwater into the systems the synthetic groundwater with nitrate and heavy metals cr and pb was prepared from tap water by adding kno3 c12h22o11 kh2po4 k2cr2o7 pb no3 2 and trace elements mgcl2 cacl2 based on the reports in the literatures and the monitoring data of groundwater in china the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen no3 n 20 mg l 1 lin et al 2008 xiao et al 2019 total chromium cr 2 mg l 1 peng et al 2016 and lead pb 2 mg l 1 bavandpour et al 2018 were used in this study the influent characteristics during the whole experimental period are described in table 1 the nitrate surface loading rate slr was 1 27 g n m 2 d 1 according to different operating conditions the whole cws experiment was divided into five periods namely the start up period i period ii with nitrate period iii with nitrate and single heavy metal period iv with nitrate and multiple heavy metals and period v without heavy metals more detailed operational information for each period is displayed in table s1 the intermittent aeration of 2 h 0 00 01 00 and 12 00 13 00 each day at a rate of 60 ml min 1 was applied since period ii in each cw microcosms zhou et al 2018a 2 3 batch tests to further understand the role of biochar and iron scraps in the reduction of nitrate and heavy metals batch tests were established in erlenmeyer flasks after the cws experiments three batch tests for 15 days were carried out through adding biochar iron scraps biochar and iron scraps together respectively the used biochar was washed with distilled water and iron scraps were washed with hydrochloric acid hcl 2 before the tests different mass of three materials 5 g iron scraps 5 g biochar 5 g iron scraps and 5 g biochar were then added into the 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks after which the flasks were sterilized in a pressure cooker for 30 min after sterilization 150 ml solution were added to the flasks and then placed into an incubator at 25 c with shaking operation three times a day during the whole leaching process meanwhile 2 3 drops of trichloromethane were mixed to guarantee the reactions conducted without microorganisms after filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the filtrates were stored at 4 c until water quality measurement the supernatants were analyzed for nitrogen cr pb and fe concentrations 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 water sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every 3 d and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm for measurements of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn total chromium cr and lead pb the concentration of nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tn were determined by an ultraviolet and visible spectrophotometer uv 1780 shmadzu japan based on the methods described in the standards apha 2005 total cr and pb concentrations were determined by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp ms icap qc thermo fisher usa the do and water temperature were measured by a do meter hq 30 d 53 led hach usa in situ in addition total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod were also monitored and the results are shown in fig s2 and discussed in text s1 2 4 2 gas sampling and analysis to elucidate the pathways of nitrogen removal gas samples were collected at each fill drain cycle using a stationary chamber method to measure n2o flux the gas collection was carried out for a period of 1 h from 9 00 to 10 00 a m at an interval of 20 min in a 100 ml injection syringe and analyzed by gas chromatography gc agilent technologies 7890 b within 24 h the air temperature in the chamber was monitored during gas collection the detailed information including sampling and calculation methods can be found in our previous studies zhou et al 2018b 2 4 3 plant sampling and analysis to understand the response of plants in the systems to multiple pollution with nitrate and heavy metals several plant biochemical indices including catalase cat and malondialdehyde mda were measured plant samples were collected at the end of each experimental period except for the period i the level of lipid peroxidation in plant leaves was determined by measuring the mda content referring to the method described by heath and packer 1968 cat as an antioxidative plant enzyme was assayed based on the method described by aebi 1974 2 4 4 substrates sampling and microbial community analysis to assess the microbial community in cw systems added with different materials substrates samples 150 g were collected from two layers the second and the third layer of substrates in each cw at the end of stage v after adding distilled water with a solid liquid mass ratio of approximately 1 1 the sample was shaken 20 min in an ultrasonic cleaner to make microorganism fall off into the solution finally the mixture was filtrated using 0 45 μm membrane for the purpose of immobilizing microbes in the filter membrane and stored immediately at 80 c until for dna extraction genomic dna was extracted by using microbial dna extraction kit primers gtactcctacgggaggcagca and gtggactachvgggtwtctaat were used for the pcr amplification of 16 s rrna v3 v4 hypervariable regions the pcr products were then sent to axygen tech beijing china for high throughput sequencing on the platform at illumina miseqpe250 after removing barcodes and primers and further cleaning chimera short sequences through qiime v1 8 0 http qiime org the obtained high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 sequence similarity threshold using uclust 2 5 statistical analysis the anova was conducted for statistical analyses mean value standard deviations via spss 13 0 software spss inc chicago usa in this study the results were considered to be significant when p value was below 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall treatment performance 3 1 1 nitrogen removal fig 1 presents the variation of nitrogen no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn concentrations in influent and effluent during all the experimental periods the influent no3 n concentration in different cws was kept at 20 mg l 1 fig 1a and the effluent no3 n concentration in the fe c cw was always the lowest among three cw microcosms at stage i no3 n was evidently removed but the accumulation of nh4 n no2 n occurred in the first few days of operation in the fe c and fe systems fig 1b and c this phenomenon is consistent with observations from other studies deng et al 2016b pu et al 2014 and the main reason was the chemical reduction of no3 n gradually the effluent no3 n concentration was stabilized at around 2 4 mg l 1 in fe and fe c cw systems and accordingly the effluent nh4 n concentration was accumulated to be 10 mg l 1 fig 2 and fig s3 presents the dynamics of nitrogen transformations in fe c and fe batch tests respectively the results indicated that the decreased no3 n concentration might be highly relating to the chemical reduction of nitrate to ammonium by iron rather than the effect of biochar fig s4 therefore the tn removal was highly limited in this stage among all the three cws fig 1d to improve the tn removal performance intermittent aeration was adopted to intensify microbial nh4 n oxidation since stage ii and the do concentration varied between 0 and 2 mg l 1 in the fe c and fe systems compared with stage i the effluent concentrations of nh4 n was decreased to 1 4 mg l 1 average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies in fe c cw were obtained at 87 and 78 while average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies in fe cw were 81 and 69 table 1 the organic carbon in the influent was only 20 mg l 1 cod which can only fuel 6 9 mg l 1 nitrate removal by conventional heterotrophic denitrification therefore the removed nitrate in this stage of the current study might be attributed to some alternative processes e g autotrophic denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process dnra other than the process of heterotrophic denitrification rahman et al 2019 this phenomenon can also be referred to several former investigations deng et al 2016a 2016b ge et al 2019 in order to explore the interaction of heavy metals and nitrate removal processes cr 2 mg l 1 was singly introduced into the influent in the experimental stage iii as shown in fig 1 effluent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were still staying at a low level in all cw systems however effluent no3 n concentrations in the fe c cw increased gradually from 2 79 mg l 1 to 6 81 mg l 1 table 2 correspondingly the tn removal efficiency in fe c cw decreased from 78 to 64 indicating the negative impact of cr on nitrate removal the introduction of pb into the influent in the experimental stage iv further decreased the removal of nitrate to 43 with effluent no3 n concentration increased to 12 44 mg l 1 whereas for fe cw average no3 n and tn removal efficiencies both decreased to 37 this difference between fe c and fe cws might be attributed to the biochar addition in the fe c system causing a micro electrolysis environment in which the process of electron transfer to the biofilm surface was slow and stable liu and wang 2019 it should be noted that the effect of heavy metals on nitrogen removal is complex but can be mainly ascribed to electron competition between reduction of nitrate and heavy metals he et al 2015 zhai et al 2017 the declined nitrate reduction rate in the fe c and fe batch tests indirectly illustrated that the chemical reduction of heavy metals might compete for electrons provided by fe c micro electrolysis or fe with the nitrate reduction fig 2 and fig s3 he et al 2015 proved that cr reductase chrr had more competition capability for electrons than nitrate reductase which could infer that the biotransformation of heavy metals could affect nitrate removal performance in cws besides cr reduction may produce some reactive free radicals such as cr v and o2 damaging enzyme synthesis and metabolism of microorganisms further influencing the denitrification process zhai et al 2017 at stage v the nitrogen removal performance was explored when heavy metals were absent in synthetic influent groundwater the effluent no3 n concentrations in the fe c cw were still 13 30 mg l 1 and the overall nitrogen removal performance did not recover when the heavy metals was removed from the influent in the period of 48 days in this experimental stage the possible reason may be that the continuous input of toxic heavy metals with the high concentration might exert a negative influence on the health of plants and the microorganisms related to nitrate reduction which could not recover in a short time further investigations would be necessary for confirming this point 3 1 2 heavy metal removal the predominant mechanisms of metal removal in cws are either biotic plant uptake or abiotic e g adsorption precipitation and reduction but the abiotic routes can play a primary role especially for newly cw systems mainly depending on physio chemical characteristics of wetland substrate bavandpour et al 2018 fig 3 presents the dynamics of cr and pb removal in different cws during the periods of iii and iv the average removal efficiency of total cr reached 97 in stage iii and decreased to 88 in stage iv when pb appeared in the influent table 1 the cr was completely removed in the first 20 days in fe c cws but the effluent concentration gradually increased the control system exhibited little cr removal function and the effluent concentration was almost close to the influent content 2 mg l 1 during the whole experiment meanwhile it is shown that the total cr concentration decreased rapidly in fe and fe c batch tests but remained high in biochar batch test fig s5 indicating the neglectable adsorption of biochar and gravels as shown in fig 3 the effluent total cr concentration in fe c cw was higher than that in fe cw a former study reported that fe c system with excellent reducibility of cr could form micro electrolysis to speed up the cr reaction rate wu et al 2013 however our results showed that cr removal in fe c cw was inferior to that in fe cws this difference may arise from the dissolved organic matters dom released from biochar which was mainly composed of humic acid like and fulvic acid like materials li et al 2017 these compounds could possibly ligate the iron especially fe ii so that make fe ii an overall weaker reductant ponder et al 2000 hakala et al 2009 when the cr and pb coexisted in the influent at stage iv the average cr removal efficiency decreased sharply from 94 to 75 in fe c cw and from 97 to 88 in fe cw table 2 it is shown that fe0 fe2 preferred to react with pb2 compared with cr6 through the batch tests fig s5 which might result in the lower cr removal when pb appeared in the influent however the effluent pb concentrations remained to be less than 0 03 mg l 1 and there were no significant differences for pb removal among different cws being consistent with the performance of cw microcosms pb was removed rapidly in all batch tests depending less on filling materials there are several reports indicating that pb removal by iron involved several processes such as reduction adsorption and precipitation arancibia miranda et al 2014 xi et al 2010 yuan and liu 2013 proved that the pb chemical reaction was the rate controlling step for pb removal when employing bentonite iron powder and activated carbon as raw materials for pb removal from aqueous solution in our cws experiments the control cw system also exhibited better pb removal probably due to the immobilization of media complexation or chelation lim et al 2003 3 1 3 nitrous oxide emissions nitrous oxide n2o can be produced and accumulated as a significant intermediate product during the microbial nitrogen removal process in cws which have been found to be one of the key potential sources of greenhouse gases liu et al 2016 huang et al 2012 thus it is necessary to evaluate the potentiality of n2o emission in three different cws fig 4 illustrates the variation of average n2o emission flux in different cws throughout different experimental periods overall the fe cw system emitted higher n2o 3 21 40 55 μg m 2 h 1 than the fe c cw 4 6 11 75 μg m 2 h 1 and control cw 2 23 6 39 μg m 2 h 1 compared with the average n2o emission flux 120 μg m 2 h 1 reviewed in previous studies the n2o emissions in this study were much lower mander et al 2014 the average values of n2o emission factors n2o n inflow tnin 100 differed significantly in all cws 0 017 0 044 in fe c cw 0 012 0 152 in fe cw and 0 008 0 024 in the control cw among which the n2o emission factor in the fe c was close to the average n2o emission factor in vertical subsurface flow vssf cws 0 023 during stage ii the n2o emission was relatively higher in fe cw compared with that in fe c cw this phenomenon can be related to the relatively higher no2 n concentrations in fe cw fig 1b which are consistent with previous studies that greater no2 n concentrations often accompanied with higher production of n2o in the process of wastewater treatment foley et al 2010 wang et al 2017 the interpretation can be attributed to incomplete denitrification process in which n2o accumulation was caused by that n2o reduction rate was lower than no2 n reduction rate both in fe cws since cr and pb existed in the influent the n2o emissions from fe cws decreased significantly with the decreasing denitrification correspondingly meanwhile fe c cw exhibited smaller n2o fluctuation to the shock of heavy metals and kept to be a low level during all the experimental stages overall the n2o emission in control cw was the lowest in this study because the low nitrate reduction rate might result in low n2o production and accumulation fe c and fe cws also exhibited lower n2o emission as well as higher nitrate removal performance demonstrating that a complete denitrification process could be achieved in this study 3 2 effects of heavy metals on nitrogen transformation to interpret the shock of heavy metals on nitrogen transformation water quality was also measured at different intervals during a typical experimental cycle the variations of nitrogen and heavy metals concentrations and n2o emission flux in an experiment cycle 72 h during period iii are plotted in fig s6 it is noteworthy that the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n had no accumulation throughout the whole typical experiment in all cws this demonstrated that there was little reaction of no3 n to nh4 n and autotrophic denitrification was achieved in fe c and fe cws during stage iii however no3 n contents exhibited quite different trends among three cws during a fill drain cycle the no3 n concentration became stable at 48 h 24 h and 6 h in fe c cw fe cw and control cw fig s6 as shown in fig 5 a the control cw showed the highest nitrate reduction rate 0 47 mg l 1 h 1 and the following was fe cw 0 39 mg l 1 h 1 the lowest was fe c cw 0 27 mg l 1 h 1 meanwhile the n2o emission fluxes in different cws decreased gradually in the starting period of wastewater feeding with a transient rise and finally decreased again in the last period fig s6 similar trends were also obtained in stages iv and v fig s7 and fig s8 during the typical operating stage iv the nitrate reduction in fe cw 0 16 mg l 1 h 1 and control cw 0 12 mg l 1 h 1 decreased while fe c cw 0 28 mg l 1 h 1 remained stable compared with stage iii fig 5b the introduced heavy metals cr and pb might cause electron competition with nitrate and thus affecting the denitrification process zhai et al 2017 when heavy metals were absent in the influent the nitrate removal rates increased gradually but were still lower than that in period iii fig 5c based on the above results besides posing an adverse effect on nitrate removal performance the coexistence of heavy metals cr and pb could also decrease the nitrate reduction rate particularly in fe cw and control cw whereas the nitrate reduction rate in fe c cw manifested a slight fluctuation to the shock of heavy metals hence although the nitrate reduction rate in fe c cws was low the systems could achieve higher nitrate removal efficiency and have higher tolerance to cr and pb than that in control cw and fe cw 3 3 response of wetland plants and microbial community the capacity of plants to resist the shock stress of pollutants in wastewaters is vital to sustainable operation and development of cws fig 6 shows the variation of mda content and cat activity of wetland plants in different cws mda is a major cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation and the content can be used to assess the membrane damage caused by wastewater the mda content increased gradually with cr and pb occurred in the influent which indicated that certain concentrations of cr and pb increase the cell membrane permeability and catalyze lipid peroxidation eventually leading to a broken membrane system xu et al 2010 in addition the mda content also increased significantly in both fe c and fe cws although after ceasing addition of heavy metals at stage v which was similar to the trend of nitrate removal this phenomenon showed that the effect of cr and pb on plants was irreclaimable at least in a short time resulting in severe damage to their development and function wang et al 2016 reported that there may be a threshold for self recovery of wetland plants when investigating the inhibition and adaptability of four wetland plant species to high concentrations of ammonium therefore high cr and pb influent concentrations might be a possible explanation for the continuous increase of mda content cat one of the plant protection systems can collaborate with other systems such as sod and pod to remove the accumulated mda contrary to mda contents the values of cat activity in all cws decreased significantly when heavy metals were introduced into the simulated groundwater fig 6b when plants were exposed to heavy metals the intuitional effects were the slow growth and lower biomass which can be reflected indirectly by the observation during the experimental period considering the internal response of plants metal phytotoxicity would reduce the capacity of the plants to assimilate carbon and this in turn could induce an increase in photosynthetic electron flux to molecular oxygen resulting in the increased production of superoxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical where cat enzymes were responsible for removing these toxic peroxides bhaduri and fulekar 2012 meanwhile we found that the cat activity in control system was always higher than that in fe c and fe cws the possible reasons may be that the plants in control cws could not suffer from the influence of fe leaching from iron scraps bacterial community in cws was characterized by using illumina high throughput sequencing technique fig 7 shows the relative abundance of a total of 10 dominant bacterial communities in different cws significant differences in bacterial community composition at the phylum level were observed between fe fe c cw and control cw fig 7a proteobacteria occupied an obvious quantitative superiority in the two layers of fe c and fe cws accounting for 75 55 and 54 30 respectively it is believed that most of denitrification bacteria belonged to this phyla proteobacteria si et al 2018 in this study the addition of iron and biochar increased the abundance of proteobacteria which played an important role in no3 n removal thereby proving that fe c or fe can promote no3 n removal as found in a previous study zheng et al 2019 proteobacteria mainly included α proteobacteria β proteobacteria γ proteobacteria and δ proteobacteria at class level compared with the control cw the relative abundance of α proteobacteria and β proteobacteria were higher particularly in fe c cw fig 7b which may explain the higher nitrate removal performance in fe c cw microbial composition at the family and genus levels are depicted in fig 7c and d the most abundant bacteria in fe c were rhodobacteraceae and subordinative rhodobacter at genus level particularly in the layer containing iron and biochar rhodobacter genera is deemed as a kind of phototrophic bacteria which was related to fe ii oxidation and nitrogen removal chakraborty and picardal 2013 a previous study also found that the high amounts of both nitrate and ammonium removal under photoheterotrophic and anoxic dark growth conditions respectively idi et al 2015 thus the higher abundance of rhodobacter in fe and fe c cws compared with control cw could explain that the addition of iron and biochar improved denitrification processes by changing microbial community structure the relative abundances of the key functional bacteria such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob denitrobacteria dnb and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in different cw treatments are also shown in table s2 it indicated that the relative abundance of dnb in fe c system were much higher than that in control cw such as thauera and denitratisoma which were reported to be related to autotrophic denitrification xing et al 2016 these results could provide useful information to understand biological nitrogen removal process in fe c and fe cw systems 3 4 environmental implications exploring the interactions of nitrate reduction and heavy metal mitigation in cws is of great significance for groundwater remediation the results indicate that the micro electrolysis fe c cw system could potentially be applied as an effective approach to safeguarding groundwater quality by removing nitrate and heavy metals simultaneously high nitrate removal with low n2o emission can be achieved in cw systems without an external carbon source when treating low carbon groundwater by introducing some recycled materials such as iron scraps and biochar when heavy metal pollution emerges in groundwater fe c cw may function efficiently and reduce the risk however nitrogen removal in cws might be impacted by heavy metals in groundwater in the present study the chemical nitrate reduction and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process dnra might occur at the initial operational stage of fe c cws fig s9 gradually autotrophic denitrification may become an important way to achieve nitrate removal through gaining electrons produced by fe c micro electrolysis the presence of cr and pb in groundwater can be removed by reduction adsorption and precipitation but pose an adverse effect on nitrogen removal and the health of wetland plants the lifespan of this type cw system and the hardening should be considered and discussed carefully although aeration could prevent hardening to some extent but it should be carefully controlled since it might affect the microbial nitrate reduction in cws in the practical application a modeling substrate with fe c materials could be used in cws for purifying groundwater which can be easily replaced without removing other substrate and plants in cw systems 4 conclusion effective purification performance of contaminated groundwater with high nitrate removal could be achieved in cws based on iron carbon fe c micro electrolysis remarkable cr and pb mitigation with a removal rate of 75 97 was obtained simultaneously however the presence of heavy metals in the influent affected the nitrate reduction process in cws and decreased the removal by 19 44 wetland plants also suffered from these metals and could not recover in a short time these findings would

18364,the discovery of the complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria overturns the traditional two organism nitrification paradigm which largely underpins the design and operation of nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment quantifying the abundance diversity and activity of comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems is important for ensuring a clear understanding of the nitrogen biotransformations responsible for ammonia removal to this end we conducted a yearlong survey of 14 full scale nitrogen removal systems including mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification denitrification and side stream partial nitrification anammox systems with varying process configurations metagenomics and genome resolved metagenomics identified comammox bacteria in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification denitrification systems with no evidence for their presence in side stream partial nitrification anammox systems further comammox bacterial diversity was restricted to clade a and these clade a comammox bacteria were detected in systems with long solids retention times 10 days and or in the attached growth phase using a newly designed qpcr assay targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria in combination with quantitation of other canonical nitrifiers we show that long solids retention time is the key process parameter associated with the prevalence and abundance of comammox bacteria the increase in comammox bacterial abundance was not associated with concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers however systems with comammox bacteria showed significantly better and temporally stable ammonia removal compared to systems where they were not detected finally in contrast to recent studies we do not find any significant association of comammox bacterial prevalence and abundance with dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords comammox bacteria nitrification solids retention time qpcr metagenomics 1 introduction nitrification the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite coupled with denitrification where nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen gas are key processes in the removal of nitrogen from wastewater klotz and stein 2008 traditionally nitrification was considered as a two step process driven by two distinct nitrifying guilds i e ammonia oxidation by the aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob kowalchuk and stephen 2001 or archaea aoa stahl et al 2012 followed by nitrite oxidation by the aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 ammonia oxidizers within the betaproteobacteriales genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira siripong and rittmann 2007 wu et al 2019 and nob within the genus nitrospira juretschko et al 1998 wu et al 2019 and more recently nitrotoga saunders et al 2016 are thought to be dominant nitrifiers in wastewater treatment systems however the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing i e comammox bacteria daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 has added new complexity to nitrogen biotransformation in wastewater systems for instance comammox bacteria can completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate and may compete with canonical aob and nob as well as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox bacteria in partial nitritation anammox pna systems also known as deammonification systems in the latter example the effectiveness of deammonification process may be compromised by the complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate by comammox bacteria lawson and lücker 2018 however van kessel et al 2015 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira and anammox can indeed co occur under very low oxygen concentrations and furthermore that comammox i e n inopinata are better suited to oxidize ammonia than nitrite potentially allowing interactions between comammox and anammox bacteria the potential interactions i e cooperation or competition between comammox bacteria and other nitrifiers could thus have implications for process design and operation not only in wastewater treatment but also across other ecosystems comammox bacteria have been detected in geothermal springs daims et al 2015 aquaculture systems van kessel et al 2015 drinking water pinto et al 2015 tatari et al 2017 wang et al 2017 rapid gravity sand filters treating groundwater fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 soils hu and he 2017 orellana et al 2018 as well as a range of wastewater treatment bioreactors annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 chao et al 2016 fan et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2018 the key to evaluating the impact of comammox bacteria on wastewater process operations is to understand the impact of key process variables on whether comammox prevalence and abundance and in turn how this impacts overall activity and function of the engineered system this can then help delineate laboratory pilot or even full scale experiments to probe competitive dynamics between comammox bacteria and other nitrifiers in scenarios that are relevant from a process operations perspective to address this issue the current study presents a systematic year long evaluation of nitrifying populations including comammox bacteria in full scale wastewater treatment plants to provide a baseline of process configurations operations and environmental conditions under which comammox bacteria might be important all detected comammox bacteria belong to genus nitrospira lineage ii and exhibit close phylogenetic relatedness to canonical nitrospira nob recent work suggests that the capacity to oxidize ammonia via the ammonia monoxygenase amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao enzymes may have been acquired by comammox nitrospira via horizontal gene transfer palomo et al 2018 nonetheless the close phylogenetic affiliation of comammox bacteria with canonical nob represents a major challenge with their detection and quantitation specifically the 16s rrna gene and subunits a nxra and b nxrb of the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr gene cannot distinguish between comammox bacteria from canonical nob within the genus nitrospira one alternative to identify and obtain relative abundance of comammox bacteria within a complex nitrifying consortium involves the use of shotgun dna sequencing i e metagenomics this has been employed by several studies annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 chao et al 2016 fan et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 xia et al 2018 to demonstrate that comammox bacterial presence in wastewater systems is primarily dominated by clade a comammox bacteria closely related to ca nitrospira nitrosa while metagenomics provides a snapshot overview it is not ideally suited for high throughput profiling of large number of samples particularly for microbial groups that are typically low to medium abundance e g nitrifiers due to sequencing cost and sequencing depth issues to this end the ammonia monooxygenase amo gene sequences provide a convenient approach for detection and quantitation specifically both the subunit s a amoa and b amob of the ammonia monooxygenase genes form distinct clusters from other known aob and aoa this sequence divergence has been used to develop primer sets targeting the amoa gene of clade a and clade b comammox bacteria separately pjevac et al 2017 and together bartelme et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018 a consistent challenge with these primers is the formation of unspecific products and our experience in this study suggests that they are also unable to capture comammox bacteria detected via metagenomics see results section alternatively beach and noguera 2019 proposed the use of species specific primers that target comammox bacterial amoa gene depending on the process of interest for instance they proposed that since ca nitrospira nitrosa are dominant in low energy wastewater treatment systems utilizing primers that capture ca nitrospira nitrosa would be ideal while this circumvents the challenge of unspecific product formation a species specific approach eliminates the possibility of detecting other closely related comammox bacteria in this study we used a metagenomic approach to recover amoa and amob genes from several full scale nitrogen removal systems and use them in combination with previously published gene sequences to design and validate clade level primers for the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria this is to our knowledge is the primary comammox clade of relevance of wastewater treatment systems the overall objectives of this study were 1 to identify nitrogen removal process configurations for wastewater treatment where comammox bacteria are likely to be relevant 2 develop a qpcr assay for quantitation of comammox bacteria in complex nitrifying communities and 3 perform a temporal survey across a range of process configurations to determine the influence of environmental and variable process operation conditions on the abundance of nitrifying populations inclusive of comammox bacteria this was accomplished through year long quantitative tracking of nitrifying populations in fourteen nitrogen removal systems with varying process configuration using genome resolved metagenomics and qpcr combined with appropriate statistical analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sample processing and data collection samples were collected on a monthly basis from june 2017 to june 2018 at fourteen nitrogen removal systems which included seven full scale suspended growth nitrification denitrification nd systems one full scale integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas nd system two full scale simultaneous nd snd systems one full scale suspended growth side stream pna system and two full scale ifas pna systems table 1 provides an overview of the nitrogen removal systems sampled in this study sample collection and processing were conducted according to the midas field guide mcilroy et al 2015 specifically samples were collected from the nitrifying bioreactors by operational personnel at each of the wastewater utilities and 100 ml of sample was shipped overnight in coolers with icepacks to northeastern university nu immediately upon

dnaeasy powersoil kit qiagen inc cat no 12888 with automated extraction instrument qiacube qiagen inc cat no 9002160 following manufacturer instructions with some modifications in the sample preparation step briefly the lysing buffer from the powerbead tubes provided in the dnaeasy powersoil kit was transferred to the lysing matrix tubes containing the samples and 60 μl of solution c1 from the kit was added to each sample to complete cell lysis bead beating was performed using a fastprep 24 instrument mp bio cat no 116005500 four times for 40 s each mcilroy et al 2015 between each 40 s bead beating interval samples were kept on ice for 2 min to prevent excess heating samples were centrifuged at 10 000g for 30 s and the supernatant was further purified using the qiacube protocol sheet for the dneasy powersoil kit ten samples and two blanks only reagents were extracted for each dna extraction run extracted dna was quantified using qubit instrument with qubit dsdna broad range assay thermofisher scientific cat no q32850 and a subset of samples were randomly selected for analysis using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis to visualize dna shearing extracted dna concentrations ranged from 2 to 254 ng μl dna extracts were stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and data analyses one sample from each system was selected for metagenomic sequencing based on qpcr estimates of aob and nitrospira see qpcr details in section 2 4 specifically samples with high nitrospira aob ratios were selected for metagenomic sequencing under the assumption that these samples were likely to consist comammox nitrospira bacteria for systems that included distinct suspended and attached growth phase e g ifas system from jamm and pna systems from jams and dur one sample each for the attached and suspended phase were included in the sequencing run resulting in a total of 18 metagenomes extracted dna was shipped frozen to the roy j carver biotechnology center at university of illinois urbana champaign sequencing core for sequencing the dna extracts were subject to pcr free library preparation using hyper prep library construction kit from kapa biosystems and subsequently sequenced on 300 cycle run 2 150nt reads on two lanes of illumina hiseq 4000 this resulted in a total of 1 35 billion paired end reads raw data for these 18 metagenomes was deposited in ncbi with bioproject number prjna552823 the reads were subject to adaptor removal and quality trimming using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 which included adaptor removal clipping of the first and last three bases trimming of sequences where four bp sliding window quality threshold was below q20 and discarding of all trimmed sequences less than 75 bp in length this resulted in a total of 1 03 billion paired end reads which were analyzed using a few different approaches see below 2 3 1 reference genomes based annotation a total of 53 publicly available genomes genome assemblies for nitrifying organisms were downloaded from ncbi refseq version 86 table s1 this included genome assemblies for 12 aoa five anammox bacteria 17 aob 10 comammox bacteria and nine nob reads from all samples were competitively mapped to the reference genomes using bwa li and durbin 2010 followed by extraction of properly paired mapped reads samtools view f2 using samtools li et al 2009 the extracted reads were then again competitively aligned against reference genomes using blast altschul et al 1990 with a criterion of 90 sequence identity and 90 read coverage the reads per kilobase million rpkm metric was used as a measure of the reference genome relative abundance in each sample and was estimated by dividing the number of reads aligning to reference genome at aforementioned criteria with the number of kilobases in each reference genome and the millions of reads per sample 2 3 2 ssu rrna based community characterization the paired end metagenomic reads were assembled using matam pericard et al 2018 with the silva ssu rrna release 132 database quast et al 2013 as the reference for assembly of the 16s rrna genes with a minimum 16s rrna gene length threshold of 500 bp the assembled 16s rrna genes were classified against the rdp database cole et al 2014 using naïve bayesian classifier approach wang et al 2007 the relative abundance of each 16s rrna gene was estimated by dividing the number of reads mapping to each matam assembled 16s rrna gene with the total number of reads mapping to all assembled 16s rrna genes per sample 2 3 3 gene centric de novo assembly the paired end reads from each sample assembled into contigs using metaspades nurk et al 2017 where two sets of reads were available from attached and suspended phase from same bioreactor i e jamm jams dur or from two parallel operated bioreactors gre these were co assembled metaspades assembly co assembly was carried out with kmers 21 33 55 77 99 and 127 the assembled contigs were filtered to remove all contigs smaller than 500 bp and subject to gene calling using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and annotation against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 genes identified as encoding for amoa ko k10944 amob ko k10945 and nxra ko k00370 were extracted for further analyses an analysis of genes assembled using de novo assembly approach for the complete metagenome revealed that several of the identified genes were highly fragmented to circumvent this limitation gene centric de novo assembly was used specifically paired end reads were mapped to a curated amino acid database of amoa amob and nxra genes using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the mapped reads were then assembled into contigs metaspades nurk et al 2017 followed by gene calling using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and annotation against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 the amoa amob and nxra genes identified using the complete and gene targeted de novo assembly approach were combined de duplicated and further curated by evaluating phylogenetic placement of assembled genes specifically reference alignments for amoa amob and nxra genes were created by extracting corresponding genes from the reference assemblies and aligning with muscle edgar 2004 followed by construction of a reference tree for each gene using raxml stamatakis 2014 the amoa amob and nxra genes were placed on the gene specific reference tree using pplacer matsen et al 2010 annotated genes that did not conform to known phylogeny of amoa and amob for aob aoa and comammox bacteria and nxra genes for nob and comammox bacteria were discarded finally the relative abundance of the curated genes in each sample was estimated using the rpkm metric specifically the sum of reads mapping to contig containing gene of interest per sample were divided by number of kilobases for each contig and the millions of reads per sample 2 3 4 recovery phylogenomic placement and annotation of nitrospira metagenome assembled genomes assembled contigs from nine metagenomes corresponding to seven nitrogen removal systems where comammox bacteria were detected i e dcwm gre1 gre2 jamm jammsm kin

2 12 1 kang et al 2015 the completion and redundancy of the resulting bins were estimated with checkm lineage wf version 1 0 12 parks et al 2015 reads mapping to bins 50 complete were extracted and used to re assemble the bin with unicycler default parameters version 0 4 7 bankevich et al 2012 li et al 2009 wick et al 2017 the quality and taxonomy of re assembled bins were evaluated with checkm parks et al 2015 and the genome taxonomy database toolkit gtdb tk 0 2 2 database release r86 v3 parks et al 2018 respectively bins greater than 70 complete and classified as nitrospira by gtdb tk were retained for manual refinement with anvi o eren et al 2015 following refinement the quality and taxonomy of the bins were re assessed with checkm parks et al 2015 and the genome taxonomy database toolkit parks et al 2018 selecting metagenome assembled genomes mags with completeness and redundancy estimates of 70 and 10 respectively open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 v2 6 3 for all nitrospira mags recovered from this study n 10 kegg orthologies ko were assigned to predicted orf s in these 10 genomes against 10 108 hmm models of prokaryota in kegg kanehisa et al 2016 database v90 1 using kofamscan aramaki et al 2019 to investigate the phylogeny of these 10 nitrospira mags recovered from this study 32 previously publicly available nitrospira genomes were downloaded from genbank table s2 poghosyan et al 2019 and used as reference genomes for phylogenetic tree reconstruction phylogenomic tree reconstruction was conducted by anvi o eren et al 2015 v5 5 orfs were predicted for aforementioned 32 reference genomes and 10 mags from this study using prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and then searched against a collection of hmm models summarized by campbell et al 2011 using hmmscan version 3 2 1 eddy 2011 including 48 ribosomal proteins only genomes containing more than genes encoding for 40 of the 48 ribosomal proteins table s3 were included in downstream phylogenomic analyses alignments for each gene were conducted using muscle edgar 2004 alignments were concatenated and finally phylogenomic tree was constructed using fasttree version 2 1 7 price et al 2010 2 4 quantitative pcr for total bacteria and nitrifying populations and design of primers targeting amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria pcr thermocycling and reaction mix conditions of previously published primer sets for qpcr based quantification of 16s rrna gene of total bacteria caporaso et al 2011 aob hermansson and lindgren 2001 and nitrospira graham et al 2007 and ammonia monoxygenase subunit a amoa gene for aob rotthauwe et al 1997 are shown in table s4 further qpcr assays targeting the amoa gene of comammox bacteria were conducted using previously published primer sets fowler et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 table s4 however these assays either resulted in unspecific product formation and non detection of comammox bacteria in samples where metagenomic analyses indicated presence of comammox bacteria as a result new primer sets targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria only clade a comammox bacteria were detected via metagenomic analyses in this study were designed to do this the amob genes assembled from the metagenomic data were combined with amob gene sequences from previous studies daims et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the primer set was designed to ensure no degeneracies within the first and third nucleotides of the primer and amplifying less than 400 bp pcr product this resulted in development of primer set follows cmx amob 148f 5 3 tggtaygayacngaatggg and cmx amob 485r 5 3 cccgtgatrtccatcca which amplifies a 337 bp pcr product this new primer set was tested with samples from this study that were positive and negative for comammox bacteria along with dna extracts from ca nitrospira inopinata as positive control involving variation in annealing temperature primer concentration and template concentration we performed in silico analysis to determine the specificity of the primer set against recently published comammox bacteria amob gene sequences to do this we downloaded genomes from previously published manuscripts van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 2018 camejo et al 2017 wang et al 2017 parks et al 2017 orellana et al 2018 woodcroft et al 2018 and a pre print palomo et al 2019 this resulted in a total of 60 metagenomes assembled genomes mag and one complete genome i e ca nitrospira inopinata subsequently we used prodigal hyatt et al 2010 to identify open reading frames orf and then annotated them against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for orf s annotated against the amob gene ko k10945 were extracted this resulted in the identification of 47 amob gene sequences these 47 amob amino acid sequences were used to create protein database using diamond buchfink et al 2015 subsequently publicly available metagenomic assemblies with confirmed presence of comammox bacteria were downloaded from ncbi including from the above referenced studies and this study the contigs from these assemblies were subject to orf prediction using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and predicted orfs were searched against the custom amob database using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the best hit for each orf was extracted from the diamond output by excluding genes that exhibited 100 identity to amob gene sequences from the 60 comammox nitrospira mags this resulted in a total of 48 additional putative amob gene sequences subsequently the amino acid sequences of amob gene from the mags n 47 were aligned using muscle edgar 2004 and the alignment was trimmed using trimal capella gutiérrez et al 2009 the trimmed alignment was then used to construct a maximum likelihood reference tree using raxml stamatakis et al 2014 with flags m protgammawagf p 12345 the putative amob gene sequences extracted from the metagenomes were then places on the reference phylogenetic tree using pplacer matsen et al 2010 only the amob gene sequences that were unambiguously clustered with reference sequences from the mags were retained for further analyses this resulted in a total of 85 amob gene sequences spanning clade a n 60 and clade b n 25 including from the reference mags and from this study of the 60 clade a sequences 48 sequences contained the binding site for both cmx amob 148f and cmx amob 485r and primer specificity was checked against these further the primers were also checked for their ability to capture non target sequences i e amob gene of clade b comammox bacteria as well as amob gene of betaproteobacteriales aob extracted from genomes n 96 downloaded from ncbi table s5 the qpcr assays were performed on a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system thermofisher scientific cat no a28567 in 20 μl reaction volume

melting curve analyses was performed at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min and 95 c for 15 s a negative control ntc and a standard curve ranging from 103 109 copies of 16s rrna gene of nitrosomonas europaea for total bacteria assay and 102 108 copies of 16s rrna genes for nitrosomonas europaea and ca nitrospira inopinata for the aob and nitrospira assays respectively and 102 108 copies for amoa of nitrosomonas europaea and ca nitrospira inopinata for the aob and comammox assays respectively and amob gene of ca nitrospira inopinata for the comammox assays were included in the qpcr analysis 2 5 statistical analyses statistically significant differences in the abundance of nitrifying organisms between nitrogen removal systems was evaluated using the non parametric kruskal wallis or wilcoxon rank sum test in r as appropriate rcoreteam 2014 correlations between any two variables were determined using spearman rank correlations and bioenv analysis within the r package vegan to identify process and environmental variables that demonstrate significant correlation with changes in nitrifier population abundances all statistical tests and figure generation wickham 2009 were performed in r rcoreteam 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of nitrogen removal systems included in this study as part of this study we sampled fourteen full scale nitrogen removal systems of varying process configurations specifically we sampled nine nitrification denitrification nd two simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd mainstream systems and three partial nitrification anammox pna sidestream systems with diverse process subtypes table 1 the process sub types ranged from multi stage suspended growth systems with secondary clarification to sequencing batch reactors sbrs ones to membrane bioreactors kin to systems with significant attached growth components e g dur jamm jams the typical process parameters for each of these systems is shown in fig 1 all nitrogen removal systems included in this study performed normally during this study with no significant and sustained process upset 3 2 identification of nitrifying populations using reference genome mapping and 16s rrna gene assembly mapping of reads to reference genomes indicated that nitrospira like bacteria were dominant members of the nitrifying communities in all nd and snd systems followed by nitrosomonas like bacteria with no or very low detection of aoa fig 2 a nearly all detected aob belonged to the genus nitrosomonas with low levels of detection of aob within the genera nitrosococcus and nitrosospira in two systems i e arm and boa at very low abundances likely a result of unspecific mapping metagenomic reads mapped to comammox references genomes within the genus nitrospira for samples from six nd and one snd system with abundances higher than canonical nitrospira nob for three nd systems i e gre kin and neu and one snd system i e yan genera containing other canonical nob i e nitrotoga and nitrobacter were detected in two nd and one snd system with nitrotoga being the primary nob in boa mapping of metagenomic reads from pna systems to reference genomes primarily resulted in the detection of anammox bacteria genus brocadia and aob genus nitrosomonas with no detectable presence of nitrospira it is important to note that while metagenomic reference genome based approach may be useful for detection of organisms its quantitative value is limited this limitation likely emerges from the reliance of a reference database of genomes and the stringent criteria used for read mapping i e 90 sequence identity between metagenomic read over 90 of the read length thus it is possible that the significant over representation of nitrospira in the metagenomic reference genome based approach emerges from a high level of genomic similarity between nitrospira in the samples and in the reference database and under representation of aob emerges from a low level of genomic similarity between aob in the samples and in the reference database this is the most likely scenario because genomic similarity between organisms within the same genus can be as low as 75 jain et al 2018 in contrast a subset of genes particularly ribosomal genes may be far more reliable for relative quantitation of microbial abundance within the larger community thus we used matam to identify reads originating from the 16s rrna gene within each metagenomic sample and subsequently assemble them and finally determine the relative abundance of each gene in the sample microbial community the reference genome mapping results were largely consistent with classification of matam assembled 16s rrna genes fig 2b with nitrospira and nitrosomonas like bacteria dominant in nd and snd systems and brocadia and nitrosomonas like bacteria being dominant in pna systems three of the 14 systems included in this study consisted of distinct suspended and attached growth phase i e nd ifas system i e jamm and two side stream pna systems dur and jams relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrosomonas like bacteria were similar between the suspended and attached growth phase for jamm while brocadia like bacteria were enriched in the attached growth phase for dur and jams the key differences between reference genome and 16s rrna gene analyses were for the pna systems and one nd system i e boa specifically nitrospira like bacteria were also detected in all pna system included in this study using 16s rrna gene analyses compared to reference mapping of metagenomics reads the discrepancies between reference genome based analyses and 16s rrna gene assembly based analyses may result from the limitation of the prior as stated above inefficient assembly of 16s rrna genes due to highly conserved regions miller et al 2011 pericard et al 2018 or a combination of both 3 3 functional gene based metagenomic identification of ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria mapping of reads to curated amoa amob and nxra genes followed by gene centric de novo assembly was used to detect and estimate the relative abundance of aob comammox bacteria and nob in the metagenomic datasets from the 14 systems subsequently all assembled and annotated genes were placed on gene specific phylogenetic trees to eliminate potentially misannotated amoa amob and nxra genes this analysis revealed that nearly all annotated aob belonged to betaproteobacteriales fig 3 a and contained representative sequences from nd snd and pna systems while amoa and amob sequences from comammox bacteria were detected in dcwm gre jamm jammsm kin neu wil and yan fig 3b these results are qualitatively consistent i e presence absence of comammox bacteria with those obtained by reference genome based analyses of comammox bacteria the relative abundance of comammox bacteria was higher than aob in jamm jammsm while both were equally abundant two nd systems i e gre and neu and one snd system i e yan in contrast comammox bacteria were less abundant than aob in dcwm and wil both of these are nd systems interestingly no aob were detected in kin an mbr mle system with comammox being the only ammonia oxidizer the results for kin were consistent with that of reference genome based and 16s rrna gene based analyses where no aob were detected further the similarity in relative abundance of amoa amob and nxra genes indicates that all detected nitrospira bacteria in this system are likely to be comammox bacteria the non detection of other low abundance aob and nob e g nitrotoga that were detected by reference genome based or 16s rrna gene assembly based analyses could be due to challenges with de novo assembly genes from low abundance microorganisms i e insufficient sequencing depth and thus low coverage a consistent aspect of systems with prevalent comammox populations was their high total solids retention time srt for instance kin is an mbr system with an estimated srt of 30 days dcwm is a nd system with a total srt of 30 days and gre is an sbr system with an srt 30 day fig 1 while jamm jammsm i e james river has an srt of 2 5 days for the suspended phase this is an ifas system with a significant attached growth component this suggests that irrespective of the process configuration type nd snd and or mode of operation continuous sbr attached growth the key similarity among comammox prevalent systems is their high srt or presence of attached growth component i e implicitly high srt this is consistent with thermodynamic and metabolic pathway modeling that suggests that comammox bacteria have a very low specific growth rates compared to aob and nob costa et al 2006 for instance recent literature suggests that comammox maximum specific growth rates are 3 10 5 11 and 2 times lower than that of nitrospira nob aob and aoa kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 while this explains the prevalence of comammox in long srt system it does not explain the absence of aoa in these systems yet while aoa are highly prevalent in other ecosystems i e soils drinking water marine environments prosser and nicol 2008 they are rarely detected in wastewater systems muβmann et al 2011 chao et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 including the systems included in this project all comammox based amoa and amob gene sequences detected using metagenomic sequencing closely clustered with ca nitrospira nitrosa and distinct from other clade a bacteria e g ca nitrospira nitrificans ca nitrospira inopinata fig 3b further all nitrospira mag s recovered from the genome binning process were associated with either lineage 1 or 2 nitrospira and included six canonical nob and four clade a comammox genome statistics for the recovered mags are shown in table 2 consistent with previously described clade a comammox bacteria all comammox mags contained some or all genes associated with both ammonia and nitrite oxidation except for nitrospira mag 248 which is likely due to lower completeness i e 70 similarly these comammox mag s contained genes involved in urea uptake and hydrolysis a feature shared with the other recovered canonical nitrospira nob mags further similar to other clade a comammox bacteria the recovered comammox mag s lacked ammonium transporter amt or any of formate dehydrogenase genes which are reported present in clade b comammox as well as canonical nob within lineage ii nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 in fact it has been demonstrated that nitrospira nob can thrive on formate and hydrogen daims et al 2016 finally similar to previously reported clade a comammox bacteria the comammox mag s recovered in this study also indicated presence of genes associated with group 3b nife hydrogenase 3 4 development of qpcr assay for quantitative detection of comammox bacteria we initially performed in silico analysis to determine if previously published primers would capture the comammox amoa gene sequences assembled from the systems included in this study pjevac et al 2017 bartelme et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the primer set developed by bartelme et al 2017 xia et al 2018 and wang et al 2018 were not experimentally tested because they were found to be unsuitable for a range of amoa sequences retrieved from this study specifically the forward and reverse primers presented by bartelme et al 2017 missed 50 and 100 respectively of the comammox amoa sequences assembled from metagenomic data in our study the primer set presented by wang et al 2017 did not capture any of the comammox amoa gene sequences detected in our systems and finally while the forward primer presented by xia et al 2018 captured all comammox amoa gene sequences detected in our systems the corresponding reverse primer did not capture any thus we focused our experimental testing on primers developed by pjevac et al 2017 and fowler et al 2018 because in silico analyses indicated that they would theoretically capture all and majority of the comammox amoa gene genes in the systems included in this study respectively table s4 pjevac et al 2017 provided two different primer sets targeting the amoa gene both clade a and clade b comammox bacteria one primer set was the degenerate primer set while the other contained an equimolar proportion of six forward and six reverse primers in contrast fowler et al 2018 developed a single primer set targeting the amoa gene of both clade a and clade b comammox bacteria while both primer sets showed excellent pcr efficiency with dna extracts from pure culture of ca nitrospira inopinata efforts to pcr amplify the amoa gene from samples included in this study demonstrated either non detection of comammox bacteria in the six systems with metagenomic evidence of their presence or unspecific product formation fig 4 a and b this was also consistent for amoa specific primers designed in this study data not shown the same issue was also highlighted by beach and noguera 2019 who suggested the use of species primers for comammox detection based on the system of interest i e wastewater drinking water etc the comammox amoa primers were also tested against the comammox amoa genes recovered from the metagenomic sequencing data this in silico analysis indicated that primer sets comaa d 244f 659r comaa 244f 659r and coma f r matched recovered amoa genes yet the issue with unspecific product amplification and non detects in some samples were persistent despite additional efforts to optimize annealing temperatures template concentration and pcr additives i e dmso bsa magnesium etc therefore we developed a new primer set targeting the amob gene of comammox bacteria specifically clade a comammox bacteria the primary comammox clade detected in our study and in wastewater treatment systems analyzed by recent studies chao et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 the amob gene exhibits phylogenetic clustering consistent with that of amoa gene and places comammox bacteria in a distinct cluster from all other ammonia oxidizers thus we developed a primer set targeting the amob gene of comammox bacteria with an expected product size 337 bp this primer set resulted in high specificity i e no unspecific amplification fig 4c high pcr efficiency 94 fig 4d and a clean melting curve fig 4e further the qpcr based estimates of the ratio of comammox bacteria determined using amob specific primers to total ammonia oxidizers was highly correlated with the ratio of comammox bacteria to total ammonia oxidizers determined using metagenomic data involving gene centric de novo assembly fig 4f and mapping of metagenomic reads to reference genomes fig 4g suggesting that the primer set developed was accurately and specifically able to capture the amob gene of comammox bacteria in the systems included in this study the deviations of the data points from the mean regression line comparing the qpcr and metagenomic assays fig 4f and g could be due to a combination of database dependence for the reference genome mapping exercise and possibly due to inability to assemble low abundance gene sequences from metagenomic data fig 4f which may distort the ratios we further tested the ability of this primer set to capture comammox bacteria from other ecosystems by comparing against amob gene sequences from published mags as well as metagenomic assemblies with confirmed presence of comammox bacteria fig s1 of the 60 clade a sequences 48 sequences contained the binding site for both cmx amob 148f and cmx amob 485r the forward primer cmx amob 148f demonstrated perfect matches 0 mismatches to 83 of sequences with one and two mismatches to 12 5 and 4 5 of sequences the mismatches to 17 of sequences were primarily associated with comammox bacteria from drinking water and sediments with the primer matching 100 of all sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants retrieved thus far including in this study table s6 the single nucleotide mismatch to 12 5 of the sequences can be remedied by switching base a in position 15 of the primer a degeneracy r i e a g thus we recommend that future studies test a modified version of the cmx amob 148f primer 5 3 tggtaygayacnga r tggg the reverse primer cmx amob 485r demonstrated perfect matches 0 mismatches to 77 of sequences with one and two mismatches to 21 and 2 of sequences the mismatches to 21 of sequences were primarily associated with comammox bacteria from drinking water and sediments with the primer matching 100 of all sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants retrieved thus far including in this study table s7 the single nucleotide mismatch to 21 of the sequences could be remedied by switching base c in position 3 of the primer to an ambiguous base n however we recommend utilizing equimolar proportion of four reverse primers where the third base is variable while the mismatches of cmx amob 148f cmx amob 485r may indicate that these primers may not work optimally work for all ecosystems they appear to capture 95 forward primer 95 5 reverse primer 98 with 0 or 1 mismatch and capture perfectly 0 mismatches all comammox bacterial sequences recovered from wastewater treatment plants further while the reverse primer matched 24 of the comammox clade b amob gene sequences it exhibited 2 mismatches to the remaining amob gene sequences further the forward primer consistently exhibited 2 mismatches with the primer binding site of all comammox clade b amob gene sequences including at the last base at the 3 end this suggests that this primer set would exclude the detection of clade b comammox bacteria finally the primers also did not capture any betaproteobacterial amob genes and consistently exhibited 2 mismatches to either the forward or reverse primers developed in this study 3 5 quantitative detection of nitrifying populations including comammox bacteria initial assessment of qpcr results from the amoa assay for aob underestimated aob abundance when compared to the qpcr data targeting the 16s rrna gene for aob supplemental fig s1 in contrast 16s rrna gene based qpcr estimates for aob were consistent with those obtained using metagenomics supplemental fig s2 this issue was also reported by dechesne et al 2016 who indicated that amoa primer sets do not provide sufficient coverage for aob while the 16s rrna primer sets likely capture some non aob sequences as well our analyses suggest that while amoa primer sets did not provide sufficient coverage for aob in our study comparisons with metagenomic data indicated no evidence on unspecific non aob detection with 16s rrna gene primers as a result all subsequent measurements of aob were conducted using 16s rrna gene based assays canonical aob and nitrospira including comammox and nob were detected in all systems irrespective of the nitrogen removal process configuration the relative abundance of both groups ranges from 0 25 to 9 of total bacteria with an average of 1 71 and 1 65 respectively except for nitrospira in the attached growth of jamm jammsm which reached a maximum relative abundance of 20 with an average of 8 56 fig 5 a and b for several systems the abundance of nitrospira in proportion to aob was significantly and consistently above what would be expected if nitrification was being driven by aob and nob alone these included the following nd systems dcwm attached growth phase of jamm i e jammsm kin snd system yan and pna systems attached growth phase of jams i e jams while comammox bacteria were detected in most systems with higher proportional abundance of nitrospira over aob except for the pna system jams the presence of comammox bacteria was not exclusive to them fig 5b for instance comammox bacteria were also detected in gre and neu where the abundance of nitrospira and aob were largely in line with expected proportions if nitrification was primarily driven by aob and nob costa et al 2006 comammox bacteria were not detected in four nd systems arm boa nan yorm one snd system nan and the three pna systems dur dursm jams jamssm yors which was consistent with metagenomic observations in all comammox bacteria were detected in six nd systems i e dcwm gre neu wil kin jam jamsm and one snd system i e yan the abundance of comammox bacteria in these systems ranged from 0 5 to 3 of total bacteria in the suspended growth phase while it was as high as 17 in the attached phase of the ifas systems i e jammsm in systems that included only suspended growth phase comammox bacteria constituted between 20 and 70 of all ammonia oxidizers i e aob comammox for the duration of the study with abundances equal to that of aob in two nd systems i e gre and neu the proportion of comammox bacteria to that of total ammonia oxidizers varied significantly for two systems with low dissolved oxygen i e kin nd and yan snd from 1 to 70 and at times significantly surpassed that of aob 3 6 comammox bacterial abundance was strongly associated with solids retention time comammox bacteria were prevalent and temporally persistent in systems with long srts despite fluctuations in srt levels within each system the abundance of comammox bacteria as a proportion of all ammonia oxidizers i e comammox aob increased with increasing median srt of the system fig 6 a and b with high abundances on the attached growth phase of the ifas systems at jamm further the mean ammonia removal was typically higher in systems with comammox bacterial present compared to those without comammox bacteria wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 fig 6c and finally while comammox bacterial abundance increased with srt fig 6f spearman s r 0 52 p 0 0001 the abundance of nitrospira nob and aob did not exhibit significant association with srt fig 6d and e this suggests that increases in comammox abundance may not be associated with a concomitant decrease in aob or nob concentrations these data provide two potential insights into comammox bacterial relevance in nitrogen removal systems and their potential competitive dynamics or lack thereof with canonical nitrifiers first as stated earlier section 3 3 comammox bacteria are preferentially enriched in systems with long srt s and systems with an attached phase component while the prevalence in long srt systems may be explained by their slower net growth rates compared to canonical aob and nob kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 this does not provide basis for explaining their preferential enrichment over aob and nob with increasing srt it is also important to note that the aob and nob abundances were not associated with a concomitant increase in comammox bacterial abundance suggests that these bacteria may occupy exclusive niches within the nitrifying consortium for instance aob and comammox may occupy independent niches at different ammonia concentrations due to different affinity levels for ammonia kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 which may allow for their co existence in fact in three nd systems i e dcwm neu and yan and the ifas nd system i e jammsm the concentrations of aob and comammox were positively correlated r 0 53 dcwm 0 41 neu 0 91 yan 0 60 jammsm p 0 01 suggesting the potential for some level of cooperation between the two further like other lineage ii nitrospira comammox bacteria demonstrate potential to exhibit diverse metabolic capacities daims et al 2016 lawson and lücker 2018 including genes involved in urea uptake and urease for conversion of urea to ammonia daims et al 2016 koch et al 2015 lawson and lücker 2018 thus it is plausible that the combination of greater metabolic diversity e g ability to utilize urea and higher affinities for ammonia of comammox bacteria compared to that of aob may ensure that comammox bacteria may have preferential access to ammonia or other electron donors made available via increased biomass decay products at longer srts this could likely explain the increase in the abundance of comammox bacteria and not aob or nob with increasing srt the second insight is that systems with comammox bacteria may have higher ammonia removal efficiencies compared to nitrogen removal systems where they are absent it is important to note that this statistically significant observation is confounded by the fact that systems with comammox bacteria also exhibited higher srt thus it is difficult to disentangle the role of comammox bacteria from that of srt alone in explaining the differences in ammonia removal efficiency nonetheless the presence and indeed the dominance of comammox bacteria in nitrifying systems may present other key benefits for instance kits et al 2019 demonstrated that ca nitrospira inopinata cannot denitrify to nitrous oxide n2o and produces n2o at significantly lower levels as compared to canonical aob further a recent study has shown that ca nitrospira inopinata can degrade micropollutants e g carbendazim benzimidazole that cannot be degraded by aoa or aob han et al 2019 thus even if the presence of comammox bacteria is not associated with stable and higher nitrogen removal these benefits suggest that operating at higher srt s to ensure stable comammox bacterial populations may carry additional benefits further we did not find any other significant correlations between comammox bacterial concentrations and proportions of total bacteria and ammonia oxidizers with any of the other measured process parameters including loading rates ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentrations the lack of association with do concentrations is in contrast with previous studies beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 in fact comammox bacteria were present and their abundances stable in systems with do less than 1 mg l i e yan neu as well as those with do levels significantly in excess of 2 mg l i e gre jamm wil kin it is important to note that correlations of comammox bacterial abundance and proportions with process parameters were estimated on a system by system basis with a maximum of 12 data points per system thus it is feasible that our correlation efforts were limited by the richness of our dataset on an individual system basis where multiple factors may together play a role in influencing microbial community composition thus while this does not eliminate the possibility that low do levels or other process parameters impact comammox bacteria it suggests that srt plays a more prominent role compared to other process parameters in the selection of comammox bacteria in full scale mainstream nitrogen removal systems finally it is important to note that qpcr or metagenomic assays such as those performed in the current study are subject to biases from a range of factors such as differential lysing efficiencies dionisi et al 2003 smith and osborn 2009 and extracellular dna carini et al 2016 thus while our results clearly identify the presence of comammox bacteria and their importance in nitrogen systems with long solids retention time their quantitative higher abundance over canonical aob should be confirmed with assays that are not impacted by biases associated with dna extraction and isolation e g fluorescent in situ hybridization fish wagner et al 2003 to our knowledge there are currently no fish probes available that can distinguish canonical nob within the genus nitrospira from comammox nitrospira bacteria considering the fact that the ssu rrna gene which is often the target of fish assays of nitrospira nob and comammox nitrospira are largely indistinguishable fluorescence microscopy based differentiation between these two phylogenetically similar but functionally distinct bacterial groups remains an open challenge 4 conclusions comammox bacteria were not prevalent in side stream pna systems including single stage systems that contain attached growth and suspended phase components this is likely to be associated with the high ambient ammonia concentrations in pna systems all comammox bacteria detected in full scale systems belonged to clade a comammox bacteria and are closely associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa this study provides a novel primer set and qpcr assay targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria relevant to wastewater treatment systems comammox bacteria were prevalent in full scale mainstream nitrogen removal systems with long srt s and or systems with attached growth components this finding is consistent with estimates of slower growth rates for comammox bacteria compared to canonical aob and nob increases in comammox bacterial abundance in systems with sufficient srt and or attached growth phase were not associated with a concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical aob or nob indicating that they may occupy niche independent from that of canonical nitrifiers within complex nitrifying communities we found no significant associations between do concentrations and comammox presence absence or concentration in this study while this does not eliminate the possibility that low do levels favor comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems it suggests that srt is the key

18364,the discovery of the complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria overturns the traditional two organism nitrification paradigm which largely underpins the design and operation of nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment quantifying the abundance diversity and activity of comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems is important for ensuring a clear understanding of the nitrogen biotransformations responsible for ammonia removal to this end we conducted a yearlong survey of 14 full scale nitrogen removal systems including mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification denitrification and side stream partial nitrification anammox systems with varying process configurations metagenomics and genome resolved metagenomics identified comammox bacteria in mainstream conventional and simultaneous nitrification denitrification systems with no evidence for their presence in side stream partial nitrification anammox systems further comammox bacterial diversity was restricted to clade a and these clade a comammox bacteria were detected in systems with long solids retention times 10 days and or in the attached growth phase using a newly designed qpcr assay targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria in combination with quantitation of other canonical nitrifiers we show that long solids retention time is the key process parameter associated with the prevalence and abundance of comammox bacteria the increase in comammox bacterial abundance was not associated with concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical nitrifiers however systems with comammox bacteria showed significantly better and temporally stable ammonia removal compared to systems where they were not detected finally in contrast to recent studies we do not find any significant association of comammox bacterial prevalence and abundance with dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords comammox bacteria nitrification solids retention time qpcr metagenomics 1 introduction nitrification the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite coupled with denitrification where nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen gas are key processes in the removal of nitrogen from wastewater klotz and stein 2008 traditionally nitrification was considered as a two step process driven by two distinct nitrifying guilds i e ammonia oxidation by the aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob kowalchuk and stephen 2001 or archaea aoa stahl et al 2012 followed by nitrite oxidation by the aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 ammonia oxidizers within the betaproteobacteriales genera nitrosomonas and nitrosospira siripong and rittmann 2007 wu et al 2019 and nob within the genus nitrospira juretschko et al 1998 wu et al 2019 and more recently nitrotoga saunders et al 2016 are thought to be dominant nitrifiers in wastewater treatment systems however the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing i e comammox bacteria daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 has added new complexity to nitrogen biotransformation in wastewater systems for instance comammox bacteria can completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate and may compete with canonical aob and nob as well as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox bacteria in partial nitritation anammox pna systems also known as deammonification systems in the latter example the effectiveness of deammonification process may be compromised by the complete conversion of ammonia to nitrate by comammox bacteria lawson and lücker 2018 however van kessel et al 2015 demonstrated that comammox nitrospira and anammox can indeed co occur under very low oxygen concentrations and furthermore that comammox i e n inopinata are better suited to oxidize ammonia than nitrite potentially allowing interactions between comammox and anammox bacteria the potential interactions i e cooperation or competition between comammox bacteria and other nitrifiers could thus have implications for process design and operation not only in wastewater treatment but also across other ecosystems comammox bacteria have been detected in geothermal springs daims et al 2015 aquaculture systems van kessel et al 2015 drinking water pinto et al 2015 tatari et al 2017 wang et al 2017 rapid gravity sand filters treating groundwater fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 soils hu and he 2017 orellana et al 2018 as well as a range of wastewater treatment bioreactors annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 chao et al 2016 fan et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2018 the key to evaluating the impact of comammox bacteria on wastewater process operations is to understand the impact of key process variables on whether comammox prevalence and abundance and in turn how this impacts overall activity and function of the engineered system this can then help delineate laboratory pilot or even full scale experiments to probe competitive dynamics between comammox bacteria and other nitrifiers in scenarios that are relevant from a process operations perspective to address this issue the current study presents a systematic year long evaluation of nitrifying populations including comammox bacteria in full scale wastewater treatment plants to provide a baseline of process configurations operations and environmental conditions under which comammox bacteria might be important all detected comammox bacteria belong to genus nitrospira lineage ii and exhibit close phylogenetic relatedness to canonical nitrospira nob recent work suggests that the capacity to oxidize ammonia via the ammonia monoxygenase amo and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao enzymes may have been acquired by comammox nitrospira via horizontal gene transfer palomo et al 2018 nonetheless the close phylogenetic affiliation of comammox bacteria with canonical nob represents a major challenge with their detection and quantitation specifically the 16s rrna gene and subunits a nxra and b nxrb of the nitrite oxidoreductase nxr gene cannot distinguish between comammox bacteria from canonical nob within the genus nitrospira one alternative to identify and obtain relative abundance of comammox bacteria within a complex nitrifying consortium involves the use of shotgun dna sequencing i e metagenomics this has been employed by several studies annavajhala et al 2018 camejo et al 2017 chao et al 2016 fan et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 xia et al 2018 to demonstrate that comammox bacterial presence in wastewater systems is primarily dominated by clade a comammox bacteria closely related to ca nitrospira nitrosa while metagenomics provides a snapshot overview it is not ideally suited for high throughput profiling of large number of samples particularly for microbial groups that are typically low to medium abundance e g nitrifiers due to sequencing cost and sequencing depth issues to this end the ammonia monooxygenase amo gene sequences provide a convenient approach for detection and quantitation specifically both the subunit s a amoa and b amob of the ammonia monooxygenase genes form distinct clusters from other known aob and aoa this sequence divergence has been used to develop primer sets targeting the amoa gene of clade a and clade b comammox bacteria separately pjevac et al 2017 and together bartelme et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018 a consistent challenge with these primers is the formation of unspecific products and our experience in this study suggests that they are also unable to capture comammox bacteria detected via metagenomics see results section alternatively beach and noguera 2019 proposed the use of species specific primers that target comammox bacterial amoa gene depending on the process of interest for instance they proposed that since ca nitrospira nitrosa are dominant in low energy wastewater treatment systems utilizing primers that capture ca nitrospira nitrosa would be ideal while this circumvents the challenge of unspecific product formation a species specific approach eliminates the possibility of detecting other closely related comammox bacteria in this study we used a metagenomic approach to recover amoa and amob genes from several full scale nitrogen removal systems and use them in combination with previously published gene sequences to design and validate clade level primers for the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria this is to our knowledge is the primary comammox clade of relevance of wastewater treatment systems the overall objectives of this study were 1 to identify nitrogen removal process configurations for wastewater treatment where comammox bacteria are likely to be relevant 2 develop a qpcr assay for quantitation of comammox bacteria in complex nitrifying communities and 3 perform a temporal survey across a range of process configurations to determine the influence of environmental and variable process operation conditions on the abundance of nitrifying populations inclusive of comammox bacteria this was accomplished through year long quantitative tracking of nitrifying populations in fourteen nitrogen removal systems with varying process configuration using genome resolved metagenomics and qpcr combined with appropriate statistical analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites sample processing and data collection samples were collected on a monthly basis from june 2017 to june 2018 at fourteen nitrogen removal systems which included seven full scale suspended growth nitrification denitrification nd systems one full scale integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas nd system two full scale simultaneous nd snd systems one full scale suspended growth side stream pna system and two full scale ifas pna systems table 1 provides an overview of the nitrogen removal systems sampled in this study sample collection and processing were conducted according to the midas field guide mcilroy et al 2015 specifically samples were collected from the nitrifying bioreactors by operational personnel at each of the wastewater utilities and 100 ml of sample was shipped overnight in coolers with icepacks to northeastern university nu immediately upon

based on qpcr estimates of aob and nitrospira see qpcr details in section 2 4 specifically samples with high nitrospira aob ratios were selected for metagenomic sequencing under the assumption that these samples were likely to consist comammox nitrospira bacteria for systems that included distinct suspended and attached growth phase e g ifas system from jamm and pna systems from jams and dur one sample each for the attached and suspended phase were included in the sequencing run resulting in a total of 18 metagenomes extracted dna was shipped frozen to the roy j carver biotechnology center at university of illinois urbana champaign sequencing core for sequencing the dna extracts were subject to pcr free library preparation using hyper prep library construction kit from kapa biosystems and subsequently sequenced on 300 cycle run 2 150nt reads on two lanes of illumina hiseq 4000 this resulted in a total of 1 35 billion paired end reads raw data for these 18 metagenomes was deposited in ncbi with bioproject number prjna552823 the reads were subject to adaptor removal and quality trimming using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 which included adaptor removal clipping of the first and last three bases trimming of sequences where four bp sliding window quality threshold was below q20 and discarding of all trimmed sequences less than 75 bp in length this resulted in a total of 1 03

nitrifying organisms were downloaded from ncbi refseq version 86 table s1 this included genome assemblies for 12 aoa five anammox bacteria 17 aob 10 comammox bacteria and nine nob reads from all samples were competitively mapped to the reference genomes using bwa li and durbin 2010 followed by extraction of properly paired mapped reads samtools view f2 using samtools li et al 2009 the extracted reads were then again competitively aligned against reference genomes using blast altschul et al 1990 with a criterion of 90 sequence identity and 90 read coverage the reads per kilobase million rpkm metric was used as a measure of the reference genome relative abundance in each sample and was estimated by dividing the number of reads aligning to reference genome at aforementioned criteria with the number of kilobases in each reference genome and the millions of reads per sample 2 3 2 ssu rrna based community characterization the paired end metagenomic reads were assembled using matam pericard et al 2018 with the silva ssu rrna release 132 database quast et al 2013 as the reference for assembly of the 16s rrna genes with a minimum 16s rrna gene length threshold of 500 bp the assembled 16s rrna genes were classified against the rdp database cole et al 2014 using naïve bayesian classifier approach wang et al 2007 the relative abundance of each 16s rrna gene was estimated by dividing the number of reads mapping to each matam assembled 16s rrna gene with the total number of reads mapping to all assembled 16s rrna genes per sample 2 3 3 gene centric de novo assembly the paired end reads from each sample assembled into contigs using metaspades nurk et al 2017 where two sets of reads were available from attached and suspended phase from same bioreactor i e jamm jams dur or from two parallel operated bioreactors gre these were co assembled metaspades assembly co assembly was carried out with kmers 21 33 55 77 99 and 127 the assembled contigs were filtered to remove all contigs smaller than 500 bp and subject to gene calling using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and annotation against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 genes identified as encoding for amoa ko k10944 amob ko k10945 and nxra ko k00370 were extracted for further analyses an analysis of genes assembled using de novo assembly approach for the complete metagenome revealed that several of the identified genes were highly fragmented to circumvent this limitation gene centric de novo assembly was used specifically paired end reads were mapped to a curated amino acid database of amoa amob and nxra genes using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the mapped reads were then assembled into contigs metaspades nurk et al 2017 followed by gene calling using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and annotation against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 the amoa amob and nxra genes identified using the complete and gene targeted de novo assembly approach were combined de duplicated and further curated by evaluating phylogenetic placement of assembled genes specifically reference alignments for amoa amob and nxra genes were created by extracting corresponding genes from the reference assemblies and aligning with muscle edgar 2004 followed by construction of a reference tree for each gene using raxml stamatakis 2014 the amoa amob and nxra genes were placed on the gene specific reference tree using pplacer matsen et al 2010 annotated genes that did not conform to known phylogeny of amoa and amob for aob aoa and comammox bacteria and nxra genes for nob and comammox bacteria were discarded finally the relative abundance of the curated genes in each sample was estimated using the rpkm metric specifically the sum of reads mapping to contig containing gene of interest per sample were divided by number of kilobases for each contig and the millions of reads per sample 2 3 4 recovery phylogenomic placement and annotation of nitrospira metagenome assembled genomes assembled contigs from nine metagenomes corresponding to seven nitrogen removal systems where comammox bacteria were detected i e dcwm gre1 gre2 jamm jammsm kin neu wil and yan were pooled reads from each metagenome were mapped to all contigs with bowtie2 default parameters version 2 1 0 langmead and salzberg 2012 prior to binning with metabat2 m 2000 version 2 12 1 kang et al 2015 the completion and redundancy of the resulting bins were estimated with checkm lineage wf version 1 0 12 parks et al 2015 reads mapping to bins 50 complete were extracted and used to re assemble the bin with unicycler default parameters version 0 4 7 bankevich et al 2012 li et al 2009 wick et al 2017 the quality and taxonomy of re assembled bins were evaluated with checkm parks et al 2015 and the genome taxonomy database toolkit gtdb tk 0 2 2 database release r86 v3 parks et al 2018 respectively bins greater than 70 complete and classified as nitrospira by gtdb tk were retained for manual refinement with anvi o eren et al 2015 following refinement the quality and taxonomy of the bins were re assessed with checkm parks et al 2015 and the genome taxonomy database toolkit parks et al 2018 selecting metagenome assembled genomes mags with completeness and redundancy estimates of 70 and 10 respectively open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 v2 6 3 for all nitrospira mags recovered from this study n 10 kegg orthologies ko were assigned to predicted orf s in these 10 genomes against 10 108 hmm models of prokaryota in kegg kanehisa et al 2016 database v90 1 using kofamscan aramaki et al 2019 to investigate the phylogeny of these 10 nitrospira mags recovered from this study 32 previously publicly available nitrospira genomes were downloaded from genbank table s2 poghosyan et al 2019 and used as reference genomes for phylogenetic tree reconstruction phylogenomic tree reconstruction was conducted by anvi o eren et al 2015 v5 5 orfs were predicted for aforementioned 32 reference genomes and 10 mags from this study using prodigal version 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 and then searched against a collection of hmm models summarized by campbell et al 2011 using hmmscan version 3 2 1 eddy 2011 including 48 ribosomal proteins only genomes containing more than genes encoding for 40 of the 48 ribosomal proteins table s3 were included in downstream phylogenomic analyses alignments for each gene were conducted using muscle edgar 2004 alignments were concatenated and finally phylogenomic tree was constructed using fasttree version 2 1 7 price et al 2010 2 4 quantitative pcr for total bacteria and nitrifying populations and design of primers targeting amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria pcr thermocycling and reaction mix conditions of previously published primer sets for qpcr based quantification of 16s rrna gene of total bacteria caporaso et al 2011 aob hermansson and lindgren 2001 and nitrospira graham et al 2007 and ammonia monoxygenase subunit a amoa gene for aob rotthauwe et al 1997 are shown in table s4 further qpcr assays targeting the amoa gene of comammox bacteria were conducted using previously published primer sets fowler et al 2018 pjevac et al 2017 table s4 however these assays either resulted in unspecific product formation and non detection of comammox bacteria in samples where metagenomic analyses indicated presence of comammox bacteria as a result new primer sets targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria only clade a comammox bacteria were detected via metagenomic analyses in this study were designed to do this the amob genes assembled from the metagenomic data were combined with amob gene sequences from previous studies daims et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 the primer set was designed to ensure no degeneracies within the first and third nucleotides of the primer and amplifying less than 400 bp pcr product this resulted in development of primer set follows cmx amob 148f 5 3 tggtaygayacngaatggg and cmx amob 485r 5 3 cccgtgatrtccatcca which amplifies a 337 bp pcr product this new primer set was tested with samples from this study that were positive and negative for comammox bacteria along with dna extracts from ca nitrospira inopinata as positive control involving variation in annealing temperature primer concentration and template concentration we performed in silico analysis to determine the specificity of the primer set against recently published comammox bacteria amob gene sequences to do this we downloaded genomes from previously published manuscripts van kessel et al 2015 daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 2018 camejo et al 2017 wang et al 2017 parks et al 2017 orellana et al 2018 woodcroft et al 2018 and a pre print palomo et al 2019 this resulted in a total of 60 metagenomes assembled genomes mag and one complete genome i e ca nitrospira inopinata subsequently we used prodigal hyatt et al 2010 to identify open reading frames orf and then annotated them against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the nucleotide and amino acid sequences for orf s annotated against the amob gene ko k10945 were extracted this resulted in the identification of 47 amob gene sequences these 47 amob amino acid sequences were used to create protein database using diamond buchfink et al 2015 subsequently publicly available metagenomic assemblies with confirmed presence of comammox bacteria were downloaded from ncbi including from the above referenced studies and this study the contigs from these assemblies were subject to orf prediction using prodigal hyatt et al 2010 and predicted orfs were searched against the custom amob database using diamond buchfink et al 2015 the best hit for each orf was extracted from the diamond output by excluding genes that exhibited 100 identity to amob gene sequences from the 60 comammox nitrospira mags this resulted in a total of 48 additional putative amob gene sequences subsequently the amino acid sequences of amob gene from the mags n 47 were aligned using muscle edgar 2004 and the alignment was trimmed using trimal capella gutiérrez et al 2009 the trimmed alignment was then used to construct a maximum likelihood reference tree using raxml stamatakis et al 2014 with flags m protgammawagf p 12345 the putative amob gene sequences extracted from the metagenomes were then places on the reference phylogenetic tree using pplacer matsen et al 2010 only the amob gene sequences that were unambiguously clustered with reference sequences from the mags were retained for further analyses this resulted in a total of 85 amob gene sequences spanning clade a n 60 and clade b n 25 including from the reference mags and from this study of the 60 clade a sequences 48 sequences contained the binding site for both cmx amob 148f and cmx amob 485r and primer specificity was checked against these further the primers were also checked for their ability to capture non target sequences i e amob gene of clade b comammox bacteria as well as amob gene of betaproteobacteriales aob extracted from genomes n 96 downloaded from ncbi table s5 the qpcr assays were performed on a quantstudio 3 real time pcr system thermofisher scientific cat no a28567 in 20 μl reaction volume

melting curve analyses was performed at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min and 95 c for 15 s a negative control ntc and a standard curve ranging from 103 109 copies of 16s rrna gene of nitrosomonas europaea for total bacteria assay and 102 108 copies of 16s rrna genes for nitrosomonas europaea and ca nitrospira inopinata for the aob and nitrospira assays respectively and 102 108 copies for amoa of nitrosomonas europaea and ca nitrospira inopinata for the aob and comammox assays respectively and amob gene of ca nitrospira inopinata for the comammox assays were included in the qpcr analysis 2 5 statistical analyses statistically significant differences in the abundance of nitrifying organisms between nitrogen removal systems was evaluated using the non parametric kruskal wallis or wilcoxon rank sum test in r as appropriate rcoreteam 2014 correlations between any two variables were determined using spearman rank correlations and bioenv analysis within the r package vegan to identify process and environmental variables that demonstrate significant correlation with changes in nitrifier population abundances all statistical tests and figure generation wickham 2009 were performed in r rcoreteam 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 overview of nitrogen removal systems included in this study as part of this study we sampled fourteen full scale nitrogen removal systems of varying process configurations specifically we sampled nine nitrification denitrification nd two simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd mainstream systems and three partial nitrification anammox pna sidestream systems with diverse process subtypes table 1 the process sub types ranged from multi stage suspended growth systems with secondary clarification to sequencing batch reactors sbrs ones to membrane bioreactors kin to systems with significant attached growth components e g dur jamm jams the typical process parameters for each of these systems is shown in fig 1 all nitrogen removal systems included in this study performed normally during this study with no significant and sustained process upset 3 2 identification of nitrifying populations using reference genome mapping and 16s rrna gene assembly mapping of reads to reference genomes indicated that nitrospira like bacteria were dominant members of the nitrifying communities in all nd and snd systems followed by nitrosomonas like bacteria with no or very low detection of aoa fig 2 a nearly all detected aob belonged to the genus nitrosomonas with low levels of detection of aob within the genera nitrosococcus and nitrosospira in two systems i e arm and boa at very low abundances likely a result of unspecific mapping metagenomic reads mapped to comammox references genomes within the genus nitrospira for samples from six nd and one snd system with abundances higher than canonical nitrospira nob for three nd systems i e gre kin and neu and one snd system i e yan genera containing other canonical nob i e nitrotoga and nitrobacter were detected in two nd and one snd system with nitrotoga being the primary nob in boa mapping of metagenomic reads from pna systems to reference genomes primarily resulted in the detection of anammox bacteria genus brocadia and aob genus nitrosomonas with no detectable presence of nitrospira it is important to note that while metagenomic reference genome based approach may be useful for detection of organisms its quantitative value is limited this limitation likely emerges from the reliance of a reference database of genomes and the stringent criteria used for read mapping i e 90 sequence identity between metagenomic read over 90 of the read length thus it is possible that the significant over representation of nitrospira in the metagenomic reference genome based approach emerges from a high level of genomic similarity between nitrospira in the samples and in the reference database and under representation of aob emerges from a low level of genomic similarity between aob in the samples and in the reference database this is the most likely scenario because genomic similarity between organisms within the same genus can be as low as 75 jain et al 2018 in contrast a subset of genes particularly ribosomal genes may be far more reliable for relative quantitation of microbial abundance within the larger community thus we used matam to identify reads originating from the 16s rrna gene within each metagenomic sample and subsequently assemble them and finally determine the relative abundance of each gene in the sample microbial community the reference genome mapping results were largely consistent with classification of matam assembled 16s rrna genes fig 2b with nitrospira and nitrosomonas like bacteria dominant in nd and snd systems and brocadia and nitrosomonas like bacteria being dominant in pna systems three of the 14 systems included in this study consisted of distinct suspended and attached growth phase i e nd ifas system i e jamm and two side stream pna systems dur and jams relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrosomonas like bacteria were similar between the suspended and attached growth phase for jamm while brocadia like bacteria were enriched in the attached growth phase for dur and jams the key differences between reference genome and 16s rrna gene analyses were for the pna systems and one nd system i e boa specifically nitrospira like bacteria were also detected in all pna system included in this study using 16s rrna gene analyses compared to reference mapping of metagenomics reads the discrepancies between reference genome based analyses and 16s rrna gene assembly based analyses may result from the limitation of the prior as stated above inefficient assembly of 16s rrna genes due to highly conserved regions miller et al 2011 pericard et al 2018 or a combination of both 3 3 functional gene based metagenomic identification of ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria mapping of reads to curated amoa amob and nxra genes followed by gene centric de novo assembly was used to detect and estimate the relative abundance of aob comammox bacteria and nob in the metagenomic datasets from the 14 systems subsequently all assembled and annotated genes were placed on gene specific phylogenetic trees to eliminate potentially misannotated amoa amob and nxra genes this analysis revealed that nearly all annotated aob belonged to betaproteobacteriales fig 3 a and contained representative sequences from nd snd and pna systems while amoa and amob sequences from comammox bacteria were detected in dcwm gre jamm jammsm kin neu wil and yan fig 3b these results are qualitatively consistent i e presence absence of comammox bacteria with those obtained by reference genome based analyses of comammox bacteria the relative abundance of comammox bacteria was higher than aob in jamm jammsm while both were equally abundant two nd systems i e gre and neu and one snd system i e yan in contrast comammox bacteria were less abundant than aob in dcwm and wil both of these are nd systems interestingly no aob were detected in kin an mbr mle system with comammox being the only ammonia oxidizer the results for kin were consistent with that of reference genome based and 16s rrna gene based analyses where no aob were detected further the similarity in relative abundance of amoa amob and nxra genes indicates that all detected nitrospira bacteria in this system are likely to be comammox bacteria the non detection of other low abundance aob and nob e g nitrotoga that were detected by reference genome based or 16s rrna gene assembly based analyses could be due to challenges with de novo assembly genes from low abundance microorganisms i e insufficient sequencing depth and thus low coverage a consistent aspect of systems with prevalent comammox populations was their high total solids retention time srt for instance kin is an mbr system with an estimated srt of 30 days dcwm is a nd system with a total srt of 30 days and gre is an sbr system with an srt 30 day fig 1 while jamm jammsm i e james river has an srt of 2 5 days for the suspended phase this is an ifas system with a significant attached growth component this suggests that irrespective of the process configuration type nd snd and or mode of operation continuous sbr attached growth the key similarity among comammox prevalent systems is their high srt or presence of attached growth component i e implicitly high srt this is consistent with thermodynamic and metabolic pathway modeling that suggests that comammox bacteria have a very low specific growth rates compared to aob and nob costa et al 2006 for instance recent literature suggests that comammox maximum specific growth rates are 3 10 5 11 and 2 times lower than that of nitrospira nob aob and aoa kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 while this explains the prevalence of comammox in long srt system it does not explain the absence of aoa in these systems yet while aoa are highly prevalent in other ecosystems i e soils drinking water marine environments prosser and nicol 2008 they are rarely detected in wastewater systems muβmann et al 2011 chao et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 including the systems included in this project all comammox based amoa and amob gene sequences detected using metagenomic sequencing closely clustered with ca nitrospira nitrosa and distinct from other clade a bacteria e g ca nitrospira nitrificans ca nitrospira inopinata fig 3b further all nitrospira mag s recovered from the genome binning process were associated with either lineage 1 or 2 nitrospira and included six canonical nob and four clade a comammox genome statistics for the recovered mags are shown in table 2 consistent with previously described clade a comammox bacteria all comammox mags contained some or all genes associated with both ammonia and nitrite oxidation except for nitrospira mag 248 which is likely due to lower completeness i e 70 similarly these comammox mag s contained genes involved in urea uptake and hydrolysis a feature shared with the other recovered canonical nitrospira nob mags further similar to other clade a comammox bacteria the recovered comammox mag s lacked ammonium transporter amt or any of formate dehydrogenase genes which are reported present in clade b comammox as well as canonical nob within lineage ii nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 in fact it has been demonstrated that nitrospira nob can thrive on formate and hydrogen daims et al 2016 finally similar to previously reported clade a comammox bacteria the comammox mag s recovered in this study also indicated presence of genes associated with group 3b nife hydrogenase 3 4 development of qpcr assay for quantitative detection of comammox bacteria we initially performed in silico analysis to determine if previously published primers would capture the comammox amoa gene sequences assembled from the systems included in this study pjevac et al 2017 bartelme et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the primer set developed by bartelme et al 2017 xia et al 2018 and wang et al 2018 were not experimentally tested because they were found to be unsuitable for a range of amoa sequences retrieved from this study specifically the forward and reverse primers presented by bartelme et al 2017 missed 50 and 100 respectively of the comammox amoa sequences assembled from metagenomic data in our study the primer set presented by wang et al 2017 did not capture any of the comammox amoa gene sequences detected in our systems and finally while the forward primer presented by xia et al 2018 captured all comammox amoa gene sequences detected in our systems the corresponding reverse primer did not capture any thus we focused our experimental testing on primers developed by pjevac et al 2017 and fowler et al 2018 because in silico analyses indicated that they would theoretically capture all and majority of the comammox amoa gene genes in the systems included in this study respectively table s4 pjevac et al 2017 provided two different primer sets targeting the amoa gene both clade a and clade b comammox bacteria one primer set was the degenerate primer set while the other contained an equimolar proportion of six forward and six reverse primers in contrast fowler et al 2018 developed a single primer set targeting the amoa gene of both clade a and clade b comammox bacteria while both primer sets showed excellent pcr efficiency with dna extracts from pure culture of ca nitrospira inopinata efforts to pcr amplify the amoa gene from samples included in this study demonstrated either non detection of comammox bacteria in the six systems with metagenomic evidence of their presence or unspecific product formation fig 4 a and b this was also consistent for amoa specific primers designed in this study data not shown the same issue was also highlighted by beach and noguera 2019 who suggested the use of species primers for comammox detection based on the system of interest i e wastewater drinking water etc the comammox amoa primers were also tested against the comammox amoa genes recovered from the metagenomic sequencing data this in silico analysis indicated that primer sets comaa d 244f 659r comaa 244f 659r and coma f r matched recovered amoa genes yet the issue with unspecific product amplification and non detects in some samples were persistent despite additional efforts to optimize annealing temperatures template concentration and pcr additives i e dmso bsa magnesium etc therefore we developed a new primer set targeting the amob gene of comammox bacteria specifically clade a comammox bacteria the primary comammox clade detected in our study and in wastewater treatment systems analyzed by recent studies chao et al 2016 pjevac et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2019 the amob gene exhibits phylogenetic clustering consistent with that of amoa gene and places comammox bacteria in a distinct cluster from all other ammonia oxidizers thus we developed a primer set targeting the amob gene of comammox bacteria with an expected product size 337 bp this primer set resulted in high specificity i e no unspecific amplification fig 4c high pcr efficiency 94 fig 4d and a clean melting curve fig 4e further the qpcr based estimates of the ratio of comammox bacteria determined using amob specific primers to total ammonia oxidizers was highly correlated with the ratio of comammox bacteria to total ammonia oxidizers determined using metagenomic data involving gene centric de novo assembly fig 4f and mapping of metagenomic reads to reference genomes fig 4g suggesting that the primer set developed was accurately and specifically able to capture the amob gene of comammox bacteria in the systems included in this study the deviations of the data points from the mean regression line comparing the qpcr and metagenomic assays fig 4f and g could be due to a combination of database dependence for the reference genome mapping exercise and possibly due to inability to assemble low abundance gene sequences from metagenomic data fig 4f which may distort the ratios we further tested the ability of this primer set to capture comammox bacteria from other ecosystems by comparing against amob gene sequences from published mags as well as metagenomic assemblies with confirmed presence of comammox bacteria fig s1 of the 60 clade a sequences 48 sequences contained the binding site for both cmx amob 148f and cmx amob 485r the forward primer cmx amob 148f demonstrated perfect matches 0 mismatches to 83 of sequences with one and two mismatches to 12 5 and 4 5 of sequences the mismatches to 17 of sequences were primarily associated with comammox bacteria from drinking water and sediments with the primer matching 100 of all sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants retrieved thus far including in this study table s6 the single nucleotide mismatch to 12 5 of the sequences can be remedied by switching base a in position 15 of the primer a degeneracy r i e a g thus we recommend that future studies test a modified version of the cmx amob 148f primer 5 3 tggtaygayacnga r tggg the reverse primer cmx amob 485r demonstrated perfect matches 0 mismatches to 77 of sequences with one and two mismatches to 21 and 2 of sequences the mismatches to 21 of sequences were primarily associated with comammox bacteria from drinking water and sediments with the primer matching 100 of all sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants retrieved thus far including in this study table s7 the single nucleotide mismatch to 21 of the sequences could be remedied by switching base c in position 3 of the primer to an ambiguous base n however we recommend utilizing equimolar proportion of four reverse primers where the third base is variable while the mismatches of cmx amob 148f cmx amob 485r may indicate that these primers may not work optimally work for all ecosystems they appear to capture 95 forward primer 95 5 reverse primer 98 with 0 or 1 mismatch and capture perfectly 0 mismatches all comammox bacterial sequences recovered from wastewater treatment plants further while the reverse primer matched 24 of the comammox clade b amob gene sequences it exhibited 2 mismatches to the remaining amob gene sequences further the forward primer consistently exhibited 2 mismatches with the primer binding site of all comammox clade b amob gene sequences including at the last base at the 3 end this suggests that this primer set would exclude the detection of clade b comammox bacteria finally the primers also did not capture any betaproteobacterial amob genes and consistently exhibited 2 mismatches to either the forward or reverse primers developed in this study 3 5 quantitative detection of nitrifying populations including comammox bacteria initial assessment of qpcr results from the amoa assay for aob underestimated aob abundance when compared to the qpcr data targeting the 16s rrna gene for aob supplemental fig s1 in contrast 16s rrna gene based qpcr estimates for aob were consistent with those obtained using metagenomics supplemental fig s2 this issue was also reported by dechesne et al 2016 who indicated that amoa primer sets do not provide sufficient coverage for aob while the 16s rrna primer sets likely capture some non aob sequences as well our analyses suggest that while amoa primer sets did not provide sufficient coverage for aob in our study comparisons with metagenomic data indicated no evidence on unspecific non aob detection with 16s rrna gene primers as a result all subsequent measurements of aob were conducted using 16s rrna gene based assays canonical aob and nitrospira including comammox and nob were detected in all systems irrespective of the nitrogen removal process configuration the relative abundance of both groups ranges from 0 25 to 9 of total bacteria with an average of 1 71 and 1 65 respectively except for nitrospira in the attached growth of jamm jammsm which reached a maximum relative abundance of 20 with an average of 8 56 fig 5 a and b for several systems the abundance of nitrospira in proportion to aob was significantly and consistently above what would be expected if nitrification was being driven by aob and nob alone these included the following nd systems dcwm attached growth phase of jamm i e jammsm kin snd system yan and pna systems attached growth phase of jams i e jams while comammox bacteria were detected in most systems with higher proportional abundance of nitrospira over aob except for the pna system jams the presence of comammox bacteria was not exclusive to them fig 5b for instance comammox bacteria were also detected in gre and neu where the abundance of nitrospira and aob were largely in line with expected proportions if nitrification was primarily driven by aob and nob costa et al 2006 comammox bacteria were not detected in four nd systems arm boa nan yorm one snd system nan and the three pna systems dur dursm jams jamssm yors which was consistent with metagenomic observations in all comammox bacteria were detected in six nd systems i e dcwm gre neu wil kin jam jamsm and one snd system i e yan the abundance of comammox bacteria in these systems ranged from 0 5 to 3 of total bacteria in the suspended growth phase while it was as high as 17 in the attached phase of the ifas systems i e jammsm in systems that included only suspended growth phase comammox bacteria constituted between 20 and 70 of all ammonia oxidizers i e aob comammox for the duration of the study with abundances equal to that of aob in two nd systems i e gre and neu the proportion of comammox bacteria to that of total ammonia oxidizers varied significantly for two systems with low dissolved oxygen i e kin nd and yan snd from 1 to 70 and at times significantly surpassed that of aob 3 6 comammox bacterial abundance was strongly associated with solids retention time comammox bacteria were prevalent and temporally persistent in systems with long srts despite fluctuations in srt levels within each system the abundance of comammox bacteria as a proportion of all ammonia oxidizers i e comammox aob increased with increasing median srt of the system fig 6 a and b with high abundances on the attached growth phase of the ifas systems at jamm further the mean ammonia removal was typically higher in systems with comammox bacterial present compared to those without comammox bacteria wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 fig 6c and finally while comammox bacterial abundance increased with srt fig 6f spearman s r 0 52 p 0 0001 the abundance of nitrospira nob and aob did not exhibit significant association with srt fig 6d and e this suggests that increases in comammox abundance may not be associated with a concomitant decrease in aob or nob concentrations these data provide two potential insights into comammox bacterial relevance in nitrogen removal systems and their potential competitive dynamics or lack thereof with canonical nitrifiers first as stated earlier section 3 3 comammox bacteria are preferentially enriched in systems with long srt s and systems with an attached phase component while the prevalence in long srt systems may be explained by their slower net growth rates compared to canonical aob and nob kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 this does not provide basis for explaining their preferential enrichment over aob and nob with increasing srt it is also important to note that the aob and nob abundances were not associated with a concomitant increase in comammox bacterial abundance suggests that these bacteria may occupy exclusive niches within the nitrifying consortium for instance aob and comammox may occupy independent niches at different ammonia concentrations due to different affinity levels for ammonia kits et al 2017 lawson and lücker 2018 which may allow for their co existence in fact in three nd systems i e dcwm neu and yan and the ifas nd system i e jammsm the concentrations of aob and comammox were positively correlated r 0 53 dcwm 0 41 neu 0 91 yan 0 60 jammsm p 0 01 suggesting the potential for some level of cooperation between the two further like other lineage ii nitrospira comammox bacteria demonstrate potential to exhibit diverse metabolic capacities daims et al 2016 lawson and lücker 2018 including genes involved in urea uptake and urease for conversion of urea to ammonia daims et al 2016 koch et al 2015 lawson and lücker 2018 thus it is plausible that the combination of greater metabolic diversity e g ability to utilize urea and higher affinities for ammonia of comammox bacteria compared to that of aob may ensure that comammox bacteria may have preferential access to ammonia or other electron donors made available via increased biomass decay products at longer srts this could likely explain the increase in the abundance of comammox bacteria and not aob or nob with increasing srt the second insight is that systems with comammox bacteria may have higher ammonia removal efficiencies compared to nitrogen removal systems where they are absent it is important to note that this statistically significant observation is confounded by the fact that systems with comammox bacteria also exhibited higher srt thus it is difficult to disentangle the role of comammox bacteria from that of srt alone in explaining the differences in ammonia removal efficiency nonetheless the presence and indeed the dominance of comammox bacteria in nitrifying systems may present other key benefits for instance kits et al 2019 demonstrated that ca nitrospira inopinata cannot denitrify to nitrous oxide n2o and produces n2o at significantly lower levels as compared to canonical aob further a recent study has shown that ca nitrospira inopinata can degrade micropollutants e g carbendazim benzimidazole that cannot be degraded by aoa or aob han et al 2019 thus even if the presence of comammox bacteria is not associated with stable and higher nitrogen removal these benefits suggest that operating at higher srt s to ensure stable comammox bacterial populations may carry additional benefits further we did not find any other significant correlations between comammox bacterial concentrations and proportions of total bacteria and ammonia oxidizers with any of the other measured process parameters including loading rates ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentrations the lack of association with do concentrations is in contrast with previous studies beach and noguera 2019 roots et al 2019 in fact comammox bacteria were present and their abundances stable in systems with do less than 1 mg l i e yan neu as well as those with do levels significantly in excess of 2 mg l i e gre jamm wil kin it is important to note that correlations of comammox bacterial abundance and proportions with process parameters were estimated on a system by system basis with a maximum of 12 data points per system thus it is feasible that our correlation efforts were limited by the richness of our dataset on an individual system basis where multiple factors may together play a role in influencing microbial community composition thus while this does not eliminate the possibility that low do levels or other process parameters impact comammox bacteria it suggests that srt plays a more prominent role compared to other process parameters in the selection of comammox bacteria in full scale mainstream nitrogen removal systems finally it is important to note that qpcr or metagenomic assays such as those performed in the current study are subject to biases from a range of factors such as differential lysing efficiencies dionisi et al 2003 smith and osborn 2009 and extracellular dna carini et al 2016 thus while our results clearly identify the presence of comammox bacteria and their importance in nitrogen systems with long solids retention time their quantitative higher abundance over canonical aob should be confirmed with assays that are not impacted by biases associated with dna extraction and isolation e g fluorescent in situ hybridization fish wagner et al 2003 to our knowledge there are currently no fish probes available that can distinguish canonical nob within the genus nitrospira from comammox nitrospira bacteria considering the fact that the ssu rrna gene which is often the target of fish assays of nitrospira nob and comammox nitrospira are largely indistinguishable fluorescence microscopy based differentiation between these two phylogenetically similar but functionally distinct bacterial groups remains an open challenge 4 conclusions comammox bacteria were not prevalent in side stream pna systems including single stage systems that contain attached growth and suspended phase components this is likely to be associated with the high ambient ammonia concentrations in pna systems all comammox bacteria detected in full scale systems belonged to clade a comammox bacteria and are closely associated with ca nitrospira nitrosa this study provides a novel primer set and qpcr assay targeting the amob gene of clade a comammox bacteria relevant to wastewater treatment systems comammox bacteria were prevalent in full scale mainstream nitrogen removal systems with long srt s and or systems with attached growth components this finding is consistent with estimates of slower growth rates for comammox bacteria compared to canonical aob and nob increases in comammox bacterial abundance in systems with sufficient srt and or attached growth phase were not associated with a concomitant decrease in the abundance of canonical aob or nob indicating that they may occupy niche independent from that of canonical nitrifiers within complex nitrifying communities we found no significant associations between do concentrations and comammox presence absence or concentration in this study while this does not eliminate the possibility that low do levels favor comammox bacteria in wastewater treatment systems it suggests that srt is the key
