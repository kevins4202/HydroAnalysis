17115,covid 19 patients can excrete viable sars cov 2 virus via urine and faeces which has raised concerns over the possibility of covid 19 transmission via aerosolized contaminated water or via the faecal oral route these concerns are especially exacerbated in many low and middle income countries where untreated sewage is frequently discharged to surface waters sars cov 2 rna has been detected in river water rw and raw wastewater ww samples however little is known about sars cov 2 viability in these environmental matrices determining the persistence of sars cov 2 in water under different environmental conditions is of great importance for basic assumptions in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra in this study the persistence of sars cov 2 was assessed using plaque assays following spiking of rw and ww samples with infectious sars cov 2 that was previously isolated from a covid 19 patient these assays were carried out on autoclaved rw and ww samples filtered 0 22 µm and unfiltered at 4 c and 24 c linear and nonlinear regression models were adjusted to the data the weibull regression model achieved the lowest root mean square error rmse and was hence chosen to estimate t90 and t99 time required for 1 log and 2 log reductions respectively sars cov 2 remained viable longer in filtered compared with unfiltered samples rw and ww showed t90 values of 1 9 and 1 2 day and t99 values of 6 4 and 4 0 days respectively when samples were filtered through 0 22 µm pore size membranes t90 values increased to 3 3 and 1 5 days and t99 increased to 8 5 and 4 5 days for rw and ww samples respectively remarkable increases in sars cov 2 persistence were observed in assays at 4 c which showed t90 values of 7 7 and 5 5 days and t99 values of 18 7 and 17 5 days for rw and ww

significant influence on virus persistence in environmental matrices depending on whether its external layer remains intact mitchell and akram 2019 for this reason enveloped virus such as coronaviruses with their fragile lipid external layer are usually much less persistent than non enveloped viruses in water remaining viable for a few days as opposed to months as is the case for the latter kutz and gerba 1988 due to the high risks of infection biosafety level 3 laboratories are required for propagation methods involving viable sars cov 2 for this reason different studies have used alternative viruses as surrogates to predict the behavior of coronavirus in environmental matrices aquino de carvalho et al 2017 casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 however the effects of different matrices and environmental parameters on the inactivation of viruses are complex and yield highly variable results depending on the viral strain used as surrogate carraturo et al 2020 although studies based on surrogate viruses are highly relevant surrogate viruses can respond differently to environmental stresses when compared with target pathogen viruses emphasizing the need for

until further use in spiking tests sars cov 2 titers were determined with plaque assay in 24 wells plates seeded with vero ccl 81 cells at a concentration of 1 105 cells well after reaching a confluence of 80 90 ten fold dilutions of virus suspensions in dmem 2 fbs were transferred 100 μl well to the seeded plates after 1 h adsorption the wells were covered with an overlay of dmem 2 fbs containing 1 w v carboxymethyl cellulose cmc plates were incubated at 37 c in 5 co2 for 72 hours fixed in 10 formalin solution and stained with a 0 5 crystal violet solution plaque forming units pfu

determined through plaque assay briefly a 4 8 ml aliquot of each different water sample was transferred to a sterile 15 ml polypropylene conical tube then 1 105 pfu of stock sars cov 2 in 200 µl was added to each tube vf 5ml sars cov 2 designed initial titer 2 104 pfu ml inoculated water matrices were either kept at 24 c or stored at 4 c according to the experimental design after exposure infectious sars cov 2 in suspension were tested for infectivity in vero ccl 81 cells at time points 0 6 24 48 72 96 120 240 and 360 hours post inoculation at each time point including immediately following inoculation 50 μl of each sample was collected and added to 450 μl of dmem 2 fbs in a 1 5 ml microcentrifuge tube negative controls consisting of 50 μl of uninoculated wastewater added to 450 μl of dmem 2 fbs were also prepared at each time point 2 6 statistical analyses in addition to the log linear model equation 1 nonlinear models were applied to describe the decay patterns and obtained by nonlinear least square nls method including exponential nls equation 2 exponential biphasic exp biphasic equation 3 weibull equation 4 and gompertz equation 5 models 1 l o g c t c 0 k t 2

c t is the concentration of the virus at time t and c 0 is the starting virus concentration at t 0 the exponential biphasic decay consisted of initial and final fast and slow decay periods in which b1 and b2 correspond to the fast and slow decay constants whereas a1 and a2 represent the decay of the virus at the start of the fast and slow decay periods respectively bivins et al 2020 the weibull model is described by asym1 which represents the horizontal asymptote on the right side drop is a numeric parameter representing the change from asym to the y intercept lrc1 is a numeric parameter representing the natural logarithm of the rate constant pwr is a numeric parameter representing the power to which t is raised in the gompertz model asym2 represents the asymptote b3 is related to the value of the function at t 0 and b4 is a numeric parameter related to the scale of the x axis all regressions and statistical analyses were performed using the pharmacokinetic pk nlstools packages in cran and rstudio team 2020 linear regressions were assessed by r2 values and by checking the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions in the q q and residuals vs fitted values plots a shapiro wilk test was performed to complementarily assess the assumption of normality whereas a skew ratio the ratio between skewness value and standard error of skewness greater than 2 was used as a reference to regard the data as having unignorable skewness yan et al 2016 the skew ratio was determined using the skwelmm package the occurrence of significant differences between first decay

estimated using the self start models the fit of the models to the observed data was assessed using an extra sum of squares f the bayesian information criterion bic test and the root mean square

as the best fit kauppinen and miettinen 2017 for the decay rate comparison t90 and t99 the time to achieve 90 and 99 reductions from the initial titer were determined using the best fitting model spearman correlations between t90 and t99 values and physicochemical parameters were also assessed using rstudio stats package 3 results and discussion 3 1 first order decay rate constants first order log linear models were fit to experimental data for preliminary assessment of sars cov 2 decay table 2 on fig 1 each inset shows the linear regressions performed for the original experimental data from triplicate assays black dots first order decay rates for unfiltered samples were 0 37 d 1 and 0 83 d 1 for rw 24 c and ww 24 c respectively samples filtered through 0 22 µm pore size membranes presented slightly lower decay rates of 0 32 d 1 and 0 80 d 1 for rwf 24 c and wwf 24 c whereas the first order decay rates in samples at 4 c presented even lower values of 0 16 d 1 rw 4 c and 0 19 d 1 ww 4 c anova and pairwise comparisons of the decay rates showed that rw 4 c and ww 4 c exhibited significantly lower p 0 05 values than the other decay rates indicating a significant increase in viral persistence at low temperature arrhenius equation parameters were established in order to determine reaction coefficients for different temperatures 4 c and 24 c supplementary material equation s1 and figure s 7 the first order decay constants followed arrhenius relationship with activation energies of 22 8 and 50 4 kj mol 1 for rw and ww respectively indicating that sars cov 2 decay in ww was more sensitive to temperature than in rw similar energies of 39 kj mol 1 have been reported for the inactivation of poliovirus type 1 during thermophilic 51 to 56 c anaerobic digestion of sludge popat et al 2010 and 59 8 kj mol 1 for poliovirus 2 inactivation by chloramine t in water 5 to 35 c gowda et al 1981 furthermore mhv murine coronavirus inactivation in stainless steel showed values between 30 and 100 kj mol 1 casanova et al 2010 roos 2020 3 2 nonlinear regressions log linear regressions were a poor fit to the experimental data as indicated by rmse values table 2 four nonlinear models were tested exponential nls exponential biphasic weibull and gompertz the regression parameters calculated for each model are presented in table s1 supplementary materials all nonlinear models showed better fits compared to linear models as evidenced by the lower rsme values compared to those found for linear regressions overall the weibull model was a better fit for the complete dataset although linear first order kinetics is a classical model of virus decay in water and wastewater including enveloped and non enveloped viruses in some cases its fitting is not carefully assessed hampering the ability to identify factors that can affect inactivation kinetics or determine the actual patterns of decay dean et al 2020 in this study the lack of accuracy of the log linear model was the consequence of possible outliers and the violation of the assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity the violation of the assumption of normality shapiro wilk test and q q plots figure s1 to s6 supplementary material occurred for all of log normal regressions the assessment of the skew ratio showed high skewness in all cases except for ww 24 c and ww 4 c also several matrices showed violations of the assumption of variance homogeneity i e rw 4 c wwf 24 c and ww 4 c increasing uncertainty in linear regressions figure s1 to s6 supplementary material exponential models representing a flat tail have been reported as providers of better representation of the decay of pathogens including viruses for instance biphasic dynamics can arise as a consequence of pathogens population heterogeneity or hardening off brouwer et al 2017 similarly biphasic inactivation kinetics has also been observed for non enveloped viruses which was attributed to subpopulations of viruses with varied susceptibilities to solution chemistry or temperature ye et al 2016 kauppinen and miettinen 2017 found that weibull and double weibull models presented the best fittings for norovirus gii genome inactivation in wastewater 3 c and drinking water 21 c respectively which showed a high tailing effect describing the long persistence of the virus the tailing effect represented by the weibull model has been reported as providing a better description of inactivation of foot and mouth disease virus clones subjected to 50 plaque to plaque transfers since small differences in the virus replication which are amplified during the course of replication resulted in larger fluctuations and the flat tail in the probability distribution which eventually develops a stretched exponential weibull shape lázaro et al 2003 the experimental data shown in the current study indicated higher fluctuations in sars cov 2 survival at low viral titer and mainly at low temperature 3 3 sars cov 2 t90 and t99 in water and wastewater t90 and t99 values were calculated for sars cov 2 survival in all samples using the weibull model table 3 rw 24 c and ww 24 c showed t90 values of 1 9 and 1 2 day and t99 values of 6 4 and 4 0 days respectively these t90 values were within the same range of those reported by bivins et al 2020 which were 2 0 and 1 6 days for tap water and wastewater samples respectively however these t99 values at 24 c are slightly higher than those reported by bivins et al 2020 at 3 9 days and 3 2 days for tap water and wastewater respectively the differences at longer survival times could potentially be due to the differences in the regression models used weibull in the current study versus log linear when samples were filtered through 0 22 µm pore size membranes t90 values increased to 3 3 and 1 5 days and t99 increased to 8 5 and 4 5 days for rw 24 c and ww 24 c samples respectively remarkable increases in sars cov 2 survival times were observed in essays at 4 c which showed t90 values of 7 7 and 5 5 days and t99 values of 18 7 and 17 5 days for river water and wastewater samples respectively temperature is recognized as having a strong effect on virus persistence high persistence at low temperatures has been previously reported for other coronaviruses casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 bertrand et al 2012 sars cov 2 viability has not yet been confirmed in real wastewater or natural river water however assessing the effect of temperature on sars cov 2 persistence in water matrices could be highly relevant for quantifying risks related to exposure to sars cov 2 contaminated water since several countries are currently experiencing peaks of covid 19 transmissions which coincide with the boreal winter low seasonal temperatures may increase the water related risk of sars cov 2 transmission raising concerns over the risk of covid 19 transmission by aerosolized contaminated water and wastewater or via the fecal oral transmission solids content and composition were likely a secondary factor affecting sars cov 2 persistence in the water and wastewater samples tested longer sars cov 2 survival times were observed in river water compared to wastewater and in filtered samples compared to unfiltered samples although no significant correlations were observed for t90 or t99 values and physicochemical parameters table s 2 supplementary material solids composition and ph can affect sars cov 2 persistence in rw 24 c the lower ph may have stimulated higher electrostatic interactions and viral adsorption to the solids which presented a more mineral composition volatile solids total solids ratio of 0 3 compared to the solids present in wastewater samples volatile solids total solids ratio of 0 5 these results agree with the effect of matrix composition previously described in the literature with a faster virus inactivation in complex rather than in simpler matrices bertrand et al 2012 on the same note viral persistence in non sterile water and wastewater should be lower compared to viral persistence in autoclaved samples determined in the current study as also verified for sars cov 2 rna by ahmed et al 2020b ph and organic and inorganic solids can play important roles in the formation of ph dependent electrically charged surfaces michen and graule 2009 scheller et al 2020 by producing significant alterations in the virus structure proteins due to changes in its isoelectric point iep a hypothetical explanation for faster inactivation in unfiltered compared to filtered river water samples is the presence of inorganic clays due to their highly adsorptive properties which could potentially act as sars cov 2 inhibitors sahel n abduljauwad et al 2020 table 4 shows a comparison of the sars cov 2 t90 values determined in the current study with t90 values previously reported for other coronaviruses surrogate coronaviruses and other viruses 4 conclusion knowing how long sars cov 2 can remain viable in water and wastewater is essential for assessing the risks to public health associated with contaminated water our data showed that temperature had a strong effect on sars cov 2 persistence with t90 values at 4 c of 7 7 and 5 5 days for rw and ww respectively which are 4 to 4 5 times t90 values determined at 24 c for the same samples it is important to note that faecal oral transmission of covid 19 has not yet been confirmed nevertheless these results could be highly relevant for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra related to exposure to sars cov 2 contaminated water since several countries are currently experiencing the highest peaks to date in new covid 19 cases in places where adequate sanitation infrastructure is not in place high sars cov 2 loads could be reaching water bodies and remain active for relatively long periods low seasonal temperatures may increase the risk of water related sars cov 2 transmission raising concerns over covid 19 transmission via aerosolized contaminated water and wastewater one important limitation of this study is the fact that persistence assays were carried out on sterile samples spiked with infective sars cov 2 therefore

determined through plaque assay briefly a 4 8 ml aliquot of each different water sample was transferred to a sterile 15 ml polypropylene conical tube then 1 105 pfu of stock sars cov 2 in 200 µl was added to each tube vf 5ml sars cov 2 designed initial titer 2 104 pfu ml inoculated water matrices were either kept at 24 c or stored at 4 c according to the experimental design after exposure

cran and rstudio team 2020 linear regressions were assessed by r2 values and by checking the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions in the q q and residuals vs fitted values plots a shapiro wilk test was performed to complementarily assess the assumption of normality whereas a skew ratio the ratio between skewness value and standard error of skewness greater than 2 was used as a

log linear models were fit to experimental data for preliminary assessment of sars cov 2 decay table 2 on fig 1 each inset shows the linear regressions performed for the original experimental data from triplicate assays black dots first order decay rates for unfiltered samples were 0 37 d 1 and 0 83 d 1 for rw 24 c and ww 24 c respectively samples filtered through 0 22 µm pore size membranes presented slightly lower decay rates of 0 32 d 1 and 0 80 d 1 for rwf 24 c and wwf 24 c whereas the first order decay rates in samples at 4 c presented even lower values of 0 16 d 1 rw 4 c and 0 19 d 1 ww 4 c anova and pairwise comparisons of the decay rates showed that rw 4 c and ww 4 c exhibited significantly lower p 0 05 values than the other decay rates indicating a significant increase in viral persistence at low temperature arrhenius equation parameters were established in order to determine reaction coefficients for different temperatures 4 c and 24 c supplementary material equation s1 and figure s 7 the first order decay constants followed arrhenius relationship with activation energies of 22 8 and 50 4 kj mol 1 for rw and ww respectively indicating that sars cov 2 decay in ww was more sensitive to temperature than in rw similar energies of 39 kj mol 1 have been reported for the inactivation of poliovirus type 1 during thermophilic 51 to 56 c anaerobic digestion of sludge popat et al 2010 and 59 8 kj mol 1 for poliovirus 2 inactivation by chloramine t in water 5 to 35 c gowda et al 1981 furthermore mhv murine coronavirus inactivation in stainless steel showed values between 30 and 100 kj mol 1 casanova et al 2010 roos 2020 3 2 nonlinear regressions log linear regressions were a poor fit to the experimental data as indicated by rmse values table 2 four nonlinear models were tested exponential nls exponential biphasic weibull and gompertz the regression parameters calculated for each model are presented in table s1 supplementary materials all nonlinear models showed better fits compared to linear models as evidenced by the lower rsme values compared to those found for linear regressions overall the weibull model was a better fit for the complete dataset although linear first order kinetics is a classical model of virus decay in water and wastewater including enveloped and non enveloped viruses in some cases its fitting is not carefully assessed hampering the ability to identify factors that can affect inactivation kinetics or determine the actual patterns of decay dean et al 2020 in this study the lack of accuracy of the log linear model was the consequence of possible outliers and the violation of the assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity the violation of the assumption of normality shapiro wilk test and q q plots figure s1 to s6 supplementary material occurred for all of log normal regressions the assessment of the skew ratio showed high skewness in all cases except for ww 24 c and ww 4 c also several matrices showed violations of the assumption of variance homogeneity i e rw 4 c wwf 24 c and ww 4 c increasing uncertainty in linear regressions figure s1 to s6 supplementary material exponential models representing a flat tail have been reported as providers of better representation of the decay of pathogens including viruses for instance biphasic dynamics can arise as a consequence of pathogens population heterogeneity or hardening off brouwer et al 2017 similarly biphasic inactivation kinetics has also been observed for non enveloped viruses which was attributed to subpopulations of viruses with varied susceptibilities to solution chemistry or temperature ye et al 2016 kauppinen and miettinen 2017 found that weibull and double weibull models presented the best fittings for norovirus gii genome inactivation in wastewater 3 c and drinking water 21 c respectively which showed a high tailing effect describing the long persistence of the virus the tailing effect represented by the weibull model has been reported as providing a better description of inactivation of foot and mouth disease virus clones subjected to 50 plaque to plaque transfers since small differences in the virus replication which are amplified during the course of replication resulted in larger fluctuations and the flat tail in the probability distribution which eventually develops a stretched exponential weibull shape lázaro et al 2003 the experimental data shown in the current study indicated higher fluctuations in sars cov 2 survival at low viral titer and mainly at low temperature 3 3 sars cov 2 t90 and t99 in water and wastewater t90 and t99 values were calculated for sars cov 2 survival in all samples using the weibull model table 3 rw 24 c and ww 24 c showed t90 values of 1 9 and 1 2 day and t99 values of 6 4 and 4 0 days respectively these t90 values were within the same range of those reported by bivins et al 2020 which were 2 0 and 1 6 days for tap water and wastewater samples respectively however these t99 values at 24 c are slightly higher than those reported by bivins et al 2020 at 3 9 days and 3 2 days for tap water and wastewater respectively the differences at longer survival times could potentially be due to the differences in the regression models used weibull in the current study versus log linear when samples were filtered through 0 22 µm pore size membranes t90 values increased to 3 3 and 1 5 days and t99 increased to 8 5 and 4 5 days for rw 24 c and ww 24 c samples respectively remarkable increases in sars cov 2 survival times were observed in essays at 4 c which showed t90 values of 7 7 and 5 5 days and t99 values of 18 7 and 17 5 days for river water and wastewater samples respectively temperature is recognized as having a strong effect on virus persistence high persistence at low temperatures has been previously reported for other coronaviruses casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 bertrand et al 2012 sars cov 2 viability has not yet been confirmed in real wastewater or natural river water however assessing the effect of temperature on sars cov 2 persistence in water matrices could be highly relevant for quantifying risks related to exposure to sars cov 2 contaminated water since several countries are currently experiencing peaks of covid 19 transmissions which coincide with the boreal winter low seasonal temperatures may increase the water related risk of sars cov 2 transmission raising concerns over the risk of covid 19 transmission by aerosolized contaminated water and wastewater or via the fecal oral transmission solids content and composition were likely a secondary factor affecting sars cov 2 persistence in the water and wastewater samples tested longer sars cov 2 survival times were observed in river water compared to wastewater and in filtered samples compared to unfiltered samples although no significant correlations were observed for t90 or t99 values and physicochemical parameters table s 2 supplementary material solids composition and ph can affect sars cov 2 persistence in rw 24 c the lower ph may have stimulated higher electrostatic interactions and viral adsorption to the solids which presented a more mineral composition volatile solids total solids ratio of 0 3 compared to the solids present in wastewater samples volatile solids total solids ratio of 0 5 these results agree with the effect of matrix composition previously described in the literature with a faster virus inactivation in complex rather than in simpler matrices bertrand et al 2012 on the same note viral persistence in non sterile water and wastewater should be lower compared to viral persistence in autoclaved samples determined in the current study as also verified for sars cov 2 rna by ahmed et al 2020b ph and organic and inorganic solids can play important roles in the formation of ph dependent electrically charged surfaces michen and graule 2009 scheller et al 2020 by producing significant alterations in the virus structure proteins due to changes in its isoelectric point iep a hypothetical explanation for faster inactivation in unfiltered compared to filtered river water samples is the presence of inorganic clays due to their highly adsorptive properties which could potentially act as sars cov 2 inhibitors sahel n abduljauwad et al 2020 table 4 shows a comparison of the sars cov 2 t90 values determined in the current study with t90 values previously reported for other coronaviruses surrogate coronaviruses and other viruses 4 conclusion knowing how long sars cov 2 can remain viable in water and wastewater is essential for assessing the risks to public health associated with contaminated water our data showed that temperature had a strong effect on sars cov 2 persistence with t90 values at 4 c of 7 7 and 5 5 days for rw and ww respectively which are 4 to 4 5 times t90 values determined at 24 c for the same samples it is important to note that faecal oral transmission of covid 19 has not yet been confirmed nevertheless these results could be highly relevant for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra related to exposure to sars cov 2 contaminated water since several countries are currently experiencing the highest peaks to date in new covid 19 cases in places where adequate sanitation infrastructure is not in place high sars cov 2 loads could be reaching water bodies and remain active for relatively long periods low seasonal temperatures may increase the risk of water related sars cov 2 transmission raising concerns over covid 19 transmission via aerosolized contaminated water and wastewater one important limitation of this study is the fact that persistence assays were carried out on sterile samples spiked with infective sars cov 2 therefore actual survival times in non sterile naturally complex environmental samples could likely be shorter declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17116,recent years the hydrological connectivity has gained popularity in various research fields however its definition and threshold effects at a system scale have not received adequate attention the current research proposes a promising framework to refine the concept of surface hydrological connectivity by combining hydrodynamic modeling experiments threshold effects and geostatistical connectivity analysis exemplified by the flood pulse influenced poyang lake floodplain system china to enhance the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco environments total connectivity tc general connectivity gc and effective connectivity ec were proposed to refine the metrics of hydrological connectivity the results show that substantial differences between the three connectivity metrics are observed for all target directions demonstrating that the joint role of water depth and flow velocity may produce more dynamic and complex influences on ec than the other two metrics of tc and gc topographically the connectivity objects areas within the flood pulse system reveal that the floodplain is a more sensitive area than the lake s main flow channels under different connectivity conditions the modelling experimental studies show that variations in water depth thresholds are more likely to have a strong effect on connectivity for the dry rising and falling limbs rather than the flooding period while the flow velocity may exert an opposite threshold effect the lake floodplain system is characterized by a dynamic threshold behavior with seasonally varying water depth and velocity thresholds this study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for facilitating scientific communication by combining hydrodynamic thresholds and offering recommendations for future connectivity assessments using our proposed metrics of tc gc and ec graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological connectivity threshold effect hydrodynamic model floodplain lake connectivity assessment ecological and environmental goals introduction in recent years floodplain systems have gained considerable attention in fields like hydrology ecology and environment funk et al 2019 karpack et al 2020 they are regarded as the most important natural regions and frequently function as significantly valuable and productive hotspots on earth bonnet et al 2008 de resende et al 2019 floodplain connectivity has been a renewed interest for interpreting transport mechanisms of the constituent materials li et al 2019a park 2020 building upon ecological theory hydrological connectivity refers to the water and water mediated exchanges e g sediment energy and organisms between rivers or lakes and their floodplains as well as between heterogeneous regions within floodplains bracken et al 2013 saco et al 2020 therefore the hydrologically dynamic and complex floodplains and hence their processes and functions can be understood and evaluated using hydrological connectivity yang and chu 2013 singh and sinha 2019 tan et al 2019 while the concept of hydrological connectivity has been developed and widely used in many investigations there is little agreement on its definition and metric method antoine et al 2009 rinderer et al 2018 during the past few years two relevant and complementary concepts structural and functional connectivity have been adopted to represent the degree and dynamics of hydrological connectivity in spatiotemporal scales saco et al 2020 the combined role of physical topography e g channel bed and bank elevation and hydrological pulses determines water exchanges and spatial pathways within the floodplain trigg et al 2013 liu et al 2020 additionally the flood pulse concept shows that the floodplain heterogeneity is mainly attributable to the shifting water sources and dynamic flow pathways junk et al 1989 trigg et al 2013 given the above background hydrological connectivity in recent work has been assessed using graph theory percolation theory pattern analysis and spatial statistics e g yang and chu 2013 deng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 based on the results of field measurements or numerical models kupfer et al 2015 yeo et al 2019 waterbody extent from remote sensing products tan et al 2019 liu et al 2020 park 2020 and physical or chemical transport casanova et al 2009 fazi et al 2018 granados et al 2020 although many approaches such as field measurements and remote sensing techniques provide directly information e g water level water coverage for identifying connectivity conditions between different waterbodies they have difficulty providing sufficient data about the spatiotemporal distributions of water depth and flow velocity water depth and flow velocity are generally viewed as the two most important factors in floodplain connectivity particularly for various kinds of ecological indicators usepa 2015 generally the irregularity and remoteness of the majority of floodplains lead to independent localized hydrological units such as surface depressions river channels and topographic barriers khaki and awange 2019 liu et al 2020 creating heterogeneous water depth and flow velocity distributions that directly affect hydrological connectivity in general dynamics in water depth may exert a significant role in influencing fishes mollusc communities and waterbirds reckendorfer et al 2006 bennion and manny 2014 liu et al 2020 flow velocity is prone to affect sediment transport organic matter and water quality trends jager et al 2012 giblin et al 2014 while the joint role of the two is expected to control the most ecological goals although previous studies have highlighted the importance and implications of connectivity for the analysis of floodplain settings and as a potential tool for planning and management strategies they do not provide sufficient knowledge regarding the individual or joint influence of water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity from a systemic perspective a conceptual schematic diagram of the hydrological connectivity and the associated relationships between the water depth flow velocity and ecological indicators is provided in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge hydrological connectivity has a more significant implication for ecology and environment fields by considering the water depth and flow velocity referred to as the later stage than the pure hydrology that focuses on the water extent information referred to as the initial stage consequently the concept of hydrological connectivity should be refined or redefined to improve its usefulness for ecological and environmental studies hydrological connectivity is an emerging property of systems that is changing in both its prevalent structural features and its short response functional elements saco et al 2020 the response of systems and the detection of threshold behavior are paramount in floodplains and wetlands where the transitions to degraded conditions are tightly related to changes in hydrological connectivity turnbull et al 2008 moreno delas heras et al 2012 more importantly early detection of threshold signals may prevent a transition to more rapid degradation saco et al 2018 however threshold behaviors of floodplain systems have not been frequently identified as an important factor in analyzing the nature of hydrological connectivity phillips et al 2011 liu et al 2020 additionally there is no widely accepted definition of surface hydrological connectivity regarding the connection and disconnection thresholds restrepo a et al 2020 consequently investigating the system thresholds and the corresponding threshold dynamics has practical implications for healthy floodplain functions due to considerable concern for various water resource ecological and environmental goals in floodplains karpack et al 2020 it is vital to improve the understanding regarding threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity in flood pulse systems as this area has not received the same degree of attention as hydrodynamic processes different from previous work this study also intends to refine the concept of hydrological connectivity and seeks to bridge the gaps between connectivity and the related ecological and environmental processes the specific objectives of this paper are to 1 improve the understanding of spatiotemporal variations in floodplain hydrodynamics and hydrological connectivity by combining a 2d hydrodynamic model and geostatistical analysis 2 combine water depth and flow velocity thresholds to propose new metrics of hydrological connectivity by considering ecological and environmental goals and 3 assess the influences of threshold changes on floodplain hydrological connectivity and the associated eco environmental indicators using a series of modeling experiments 2 study area poyang lake floodplain system is located at the southern bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river in northern jiangxi province poyang lake has a typical subtropical monsoon climate hu et al 2007 in the yangtze river catchment poyang lake is considered a distinctive flood pulse influenced system that sustains free connection with its inflow rivers zhang et al 2014 li et al 2020a the lake receives five major river inflows from a catchment area of 1 62 105 km2 and subsequently discharges to the downstream yangtze river fig 2 lake water balance shows that about 91 2 of yearly inflows are from river discharges from the catchment lake discharges to the yangtze river occupies around 86 9 of the total outflow li et al 2020a the floodplain areas of 2000 km2 are almost fully connected to the main lake during the flooding season but become isolated or partly connection during the dry season li et al 2019b tan et al 2019 due to the flood pulses from both the catchment rivers and the lake inundation wei et al 2020 generally the water depth exhibits an increasing trend from the floodplains to the flow channels varied from 6 m to 30 m and the water velocities vary from 0 1 to 1 0 m s li et al 2017 the flushing ability of the lake floodplain system is characterized by spatial varying residence times in the range of 20 300 days li et al 2016 3 materials and methods this work used a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model to represent the hydrodynamic behaviors of the flood pulse influenced poyang lake see section 3 2 the validated model and its simulation results in combination with the threshold definition were used to identify the water spatiotemporal pattern the geostatistical analysis was subsequently applied to the binary raster data to investigate the responses of surface hydrological connectivity see section 3 3 and allowed to further explore the threshold effects on connectivity conditions see section 3 4 the major methodology in this study regarding the hydrodynamic modeling threshold definition and connectivity calculation is presented in fig 3 3 1 data collection and purpose 3 1 1 hydrological and meteorological data the daily hydrological and meteorological data were collected for the purpose of driving and validating the floodplain hydrodynamic model of poyang lake during 2018 daily discharges at the four main river gauging stations and two tributary stations were adopted to reflect the five major rivers from the lake s catchment fig 2a lake water levels and outflow hydrographs at the five gauging stations were used to represent the spatial responses of the lake during 2018 fig 2b the bathymetry map surveyed in 2010 1 10 000 was used to depict the physical topography of the lake floodplain system fig 2b spatial flow velocities were used to reproduce the flow field of poyang lake based on acoustic doppler current profile adcp measurements in august 2018 see section 4 1 meteorological parameters time series precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction obtained from the lake gauging stations were selected to represent the atmospheric conditions of the floodplain system 3 1 2 water quality data waterbird population and fish distributions in order to explore the importance and implications of the proposed connectivity metrics this study used water quality parameters waterbird and fish as proxy indicators of the eco environments in the poyang lake floodplain system a total of 144 vertically integrated water samples were collected within consecutive days during 10 15 july 2019 the locations of sampling sites differ in space to cover different lake regions see section 4 5 for a comprehensive analysis the popular trophic state index tsi carlson 1977 was calculated and used to present the condition of the lake ecosystem based on the total dissolved nitrogen tn total dissolved phosphorous tp chlorophyll a chl a chemical oxygen demand codmn concentrations and secchi disk depth the analysis method of these parameters is same to li et al 2019a waterbird population distributions were obtained from huang et al 2018 and fish distribution map was derived from the atlas of poyang lake 1993 in order to analyze and explain the implications of different connectivity metrics proposed by this study these data obtained in 2019 were presumed to represent the conditions in 2018 3 2 floodplain hydrodynamic model the present study used a two dimensional 2d mike 21 model to investigate the floodplain hydrological and hydrodynamic behaviors of poyang lake the modelling work of poyang lake involved several major aspects the model domain is about 3 124 km2 and the element sizes varied from 70 m to 1 500 m to capture the lake floodplain inundation dynamics fig 2 therefore a total of 20 450 triangular elements were generated to perform the floodplain hydrodynamic simulation fig 3 the time varying catchment inflows five large rivers were used as the lake upstream boundary conditions q t fig 2 the hukou water level observations lake outlet were used as the lower boundary condition h t fig 3 the model also used precipitation evaporation and wind fields to reflect the influences of meteorological conditions on the lake hydrodynamics fig 3 the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity cs 0 28 and manning numbers m 10 59 m1 3 s were used to represent heterogeneous bed roughness for the lake flow channels and the floodplains e g vegetation area mudflat and permanent waterbody of the flood pulse system li et al 2020b the model adopted the depth rule h drying 0 005 m h flooding 0 05 m h wetting 0 1 m to capture the wetting and drying cycle in the floodplain system dhi 2014 li et al 2014 to maintain the target courant friedrich levy number of 1 0 the minimum and the maximum time step were set to 0 1 s and 3600 s respectively extensive validation and applications in many previous studies have been conducted for the hydrodynamic model of the poyang lake floodplain system e g li et al 2014 li et al 2017 2019a b 2020a b therefore a brief description regarding the theoretical basis and other model aspects of the mike 21 is given in this section in this study the floodplain hydrodynamic model of the lake was further validated using water level and flow velocity observations during 2018 the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens were used to quantify the goodness of fit and to assess the model s performance 3 3 geostatistical connectivity analysis we used geostatistical connectivity metrics to quantify and characterize the surface hydrological connectivity of the poyang lake floodplains the geostatistical method is effective for investigating the transport pathway connection or isolation between different surface water elements trigg et al 2013 generally connectivity analysis adopts binary data to analyze the surface water connectivity and the associated spatial patterns of connected components fig 3 this method has the capacity to describe spatiotemporal patterns and quantify thresholds and transitions in large systems by identifying the subtle differences in the data fields michaelides and chappell 2009 the geostatistical approach is multi point connectivity statistics that quantify the probability of any connected cells and corresponding connected magnitude for binary state patterns of hydrological systems pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 the basic mathematical expression of connectivity function cf in different directions including north south n s west east w e nw se and ne sw is expressed by journel et al 2000 1 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 2 if z u j z c i u j z c 1 0 3 if z u j z c i u j z c 0 where n represents the total number of points π represents the product operator uj represents the location zc is the threshold value i uj zc represents a connectivity indicator pr is the calculated probability here the connectivity statistic is a probability distance function cf that was produced to express the probability pr 3 4 connectivity definition and threshold scenario the individual or combined threshold effects of spatiotemporal water inundation water depth and flow velocity distributions obtained from the hydrodynamic model were used to define different connectivity types corresponding gridded patterns wet dry were used as input for geostatistical connectivity analysis fig 3 three connectivity definitions namely total connectivity general connectivity and effective connectivity are discussed in table 1 since this study aimed to provide insights into the effects of proposed connectivity metrics the general idea was to show the differences between the connectivity conditions under the three definitions based on a representative year of the floodplain system to represent the significant importance of threshold effect the recommended values of water depth threshold thresholdh 20 cm and flow velocity threshold thresholdv 0 1 m s were based on literature values from poyang lake and other similar areas jager et al 2012 bennion and manny 2014 giblin et al 2014 liu et al 2020 that is 20 cm depth or 0 1 m s velocity environments are more likely to create a better connectivity condition that has significant implications for most ecological and environmental goals e g sediment organic matter fish phytoplankton see table 1 in order to investigate the influence of variations in different thresholds water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity this study uses a series of experimental scenarios by setting specified threshold values for water depth and flow velocity h 10 cm v 0 05 m s consequently the resulting wet dry binary data were used to calculate the surface hydrological connectivity in n s w e nw se and ne sw directions since the general idea was to identify the differences between the connectivity conditions under different h and v threshold values the authors limit the modeling experiments within the threshold range of water depth 0 90 cm and velocity 0 0 3 m s given the difficulties in conducting detailed analyses of threshold effect for every small offset value 4 results 4 1 validation of hydrodynamic model observed water levels and flow velocities distributed in the floodplain system were used to reproduce the dynamic changes in the hydrological behaviors fig 4 the observed and modelled water levels at the xingzi duchang and kangshan gauging stations matched well during the validation procedure fig 4b the statistics showed that the ens varied from 0 95 to 0 99 and r 2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 the values of rmse were lower than 0 45 m although the impact of the complex topography e g the flow channel shallow floodplains and model conceptualization e g mesh size boundary condition on generated patterns of hydrodynamics can almost be neglected during the flooding water phase slight discrepancies between the simulation and the observation are found during low lake level seasons fig 4b for the spatial flow velocity simulations fig 4a the statistics also revealed a close agreement between the modelled and observed points r 2 0 71 fig 4c the validation presented in fig 4 demonstrates the floodplain hydrodynamic model has an overall capability in capturing the rising high falling and low water phases in the flood pulse influenced poyang lake building confidence in the applicability of the modeling experimental studies and scenarios analysis 4 2 spatiotemporal changes in hydrodynamics and connectivity conditions spatial and temporal dynamics in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the poyang lake floodplains are inextricably linked to surface water connectivity for both water depth and flow velocity the temporal trends show that in general the two hydrodynamic forcings exhibit a distinct negative relationship throughout the year fig 5 a mainly due to the influence of dynamic hydraulic gradient on velocity on average low hydrological connectivity can be observed during the dry water phase e g february mean cf 0 3 intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and falling limbs e g may and october mean cf 0 4 0 5 while high connectivity is found during flood phase e g august mean cf 0 7 spatial variations of the poyang lake hydrodynamic and connectivity conditions in the dry rising flooding and receding hydrological phases are illustrated in figs 5b c the water depth and flow velocity show high spatial heterogeneity and varies quite distinctly within the lake however the hydrodynamic behaviors in the lake floodplains exhibit similar characteristics in terms of their spatial pattern that is the lake s main flow channels and the associated extensive floodplains can be recognized across the flood pulse system geographically the water depth in the main lake flow channels can exceed around 10 m but the depth within the shallow floodplain areas is generally less than 2 m fig 5b spatially the flow velocities vary from 0 1 m s in the lake s floodplains to 0 9 m s in the main flow channels fig 5c the result presented in fig 5d reveals the changes in connectivity objects areas between the main flow channels and the lake s floodplains as well as between heterogeneous areas within the floodplain indicating relatively complex connections in different colors throughout the lake floodplain system this is the expected outcome given that the spatially varying topographic features may exert substantial influences on the connectivity condition particularly for the dry rising and receding phases of the flood pulse system fig 5d that is water depth in the lake flow channels is much deeper than that of the surrounding floodplains during different hydrological water phases and filling spilling process generally extends from lower lying channels to upper lying floodplains 4 3 comparison of different connectivity metrics connectivity analysis of the poyang lake floodplains generated a series of monthly n s w e nw se and ne sw cf changes under tc gc and ec conditions fig 6 for all three connectivity scenarios the temporal trends show that the cf plots exhibit highly dynamic changes along the distance scale x axis for the four directions however the results reveal that in general low connectivity is observed during the dry seasons intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and receding periods while high connectivity is found during the flood period figs 6a d under different connectivity types the cf results indicate that the connectivity conditions of tc are distinctly higher than those of gc and ec during most times of the year as expected the effects of water depth and flow velocity thresholds on hydrological connectivity gc and ec may produce large differences relative to the baseline scenario tc the results presented in fig 6 indicate that the combined effect of water depth and velocity may generate a more complex role on connectivity ec than that of the water depth alone gc on average it seems that the cf curve is more likely to generate abrupt changes under the ec scenario than the other two connectivity scenarios fig 7 additionally it should be noted that the cf curves decreased to zero in a more rapid manner along the distance scale especially for the ec scenario figs 6 7 in order to explore the influence of tc gc and ec scenarios on hydrological connectivity four typical water phases of the poyang lake floodplains were selected to reflect the connected areas and corresponding connected objects areas fig 8 a it is expected that the connected areas under gc and ec scenarios are lower than in the tc scenario mainly due to the limitation of water depth and flow velocity correspondingly the spatial variations of connected objects areas show a similar trend to that of the connected areas for the three connectivity scenarios as illustrated in fig 8b it can be found that the most notable changes mainly occur in the floodplain areas and in some high elevation areas in addition the effective connectivity objects areas ec are mainly distributed in the lake s flow channels across the lake s length from south to north in a word the results presented in fig 8b demonstrate that the individual or joint effects of water depth and flow velocity are mostly likely to play a dominant role in controlling flow pathways and associated spatial patterns of connectivity objects areas 4 4 threshold effect of hydrological connectivity when the cf curves exhibit subtle changes over time implies that the system can be characterized by a steady state condition or that a threshold behavior may affect the hydrological system in order to further investigate the threshold effects on surface hydrological connectivity a series of daily mean cf plots are obtained from the designed modeling experiments as shown in fig 9 the results demonstrate that the variations in water depth thresholds appear to have a large effect on cf during the dry rising and falling limbs opposed to the flooding limb see the dotted line in fig 9a whereas the flow velocity tends to have an opposite threshold effect see the dotted line in fig 9b the reason can be attributed to the negative relationship between the water depth and flow velocity see fig 5a these previous results imply that the combined effect of water depth and flow velocity thresholds on connectivity may be dynamic and complex e g ec see figs 6 7 although there is difficulty in quantifying the threshold values of water depth and flow velocity the results tend to show that the threshold effects are more likely to exhibit a temporal evolution in terms of the line shape of threshold fig 9 that is the influence of depth and velocity thresholds on connectivity will change along the dry thresholdh 10 20 cm thresholdv 20 25 cm s rising thresholdh 50 60 cm thresholdv 25 cm s flooding thresholdh 80 cm thresholdv 5 10 cm s and receding thresholdh 50 60 cm thresholdv 20 cm s water phases see the dotted lines in fig 9 additionally the calculated cfs presented in fig 10 demonstrate that on average the lake floodplain system seems to exhibit an abrupt change the water depth and velocity thresholds are around 20 cm and 5 cm s respectively see the yellow shadow areas additionally different connectivity conditions are observed for n s w e nw se and ne sw directions which can be explained by the joint influence of spatial varying topographic features e g flow channels and depressions and different hydrological pulses e g river inflows and lake inundation 4 5 implications of the refined connectivity concept and assessment applications this study attempts to use water coverage water depth and flow velocity to describe the hydrological connectivity and its implications for eco environmental research the distributions of water quality parameters waterbirds and fishes in poyang lake were selected and used to validate the connectivity metrics of tc gc and ec as illustrated in fig 11 a although these indicators exhibit distinctly heterogeneous distribution the spatial pattern is highly consistent with the connectivity condition of gc and ec demonstrating that the threshold range of water depth and flow velocity is critical for connectivity assessment in the system for example the connectivity objects areas of ec is most likely to control the tsi of the lake especially for the main flow channels see ② in fig 11a the spatial coincidence of connectivity objects areas with waterbird and fish distributions are well reproduced by the changed water depth threshold of gc statistical analysis reveals that the refined hydrological connectivity of gc and ec has a close relationship with the eco environmental indicators as reflected in r 2 values of 0 92 and 0 69 for the tsi and the waterbird population respectively p 0 05 fig 11a the results present here highlight the effectiveness and implications of the refined connectivity metrics from the perspective of hydrodynamics the spatial distributions of tn tp chl a concentrations and the tsi can be directly explained by the complex depth velocity relationships see ①②③ in fig 11b for most rivers lakes and wetlands water depth and flow velocity generally exhibit positive relationships that play a cumulative or equivalent role on connectivity condition gc can be selected to evaluate the connectivity effects on ecosystems while ec is an appropriate metric to investigate regions with negative relationships between water depth and flow velocity compensatory role fig 11b the researchers should take caution that the threshold value of ec may produce significant influences on the connectivity and the associated assessment applications particularly for shallow water flow areas e g floodplains 5 discussion for this study we provided new insight into the threshold effects of key hydrodynamic variables on surface water connectivity for the poyang lake floodplains and other similar floodplains around the world although the current work improves our understanding of hydrological connectivity and its causal factors in large flood pulse influenced systems connectivity dynamics are also affected by complex hydro geomorphologic properties including channelized water flowpaths overbank processes and local recharge stevaux et al 2013 restrepo a et al 2020 in large floodplains the surface topography and hydrological pulses are dominant in different parts of the system the threshold behaviors from this work may have somewhat different outcomes if other floodplain areas are investigated therefore specific studies should be conducted to identify individual thresholds for different geomorphic units knowledge regarding the temporal evolution and the spatial continuity as well as the complexity of heterogenous topographic features is a necessity for any restoration effort singh and sinha 2019 the current hydrodynamic model and spatial analysis provide a combination approach to consider past and present connectivity conditions with intensifying persistent and diminishing connectivity potentials the examination of low and high potential connectivity and spatial connected objects areas in the current work offers an opportunity to perform effective management and restoration activities therefore this study may contribute to the method and the need for a spatiotemporal framework for connectivity and restoration projects across different landscape elements for the flood pulse influenced poyang lake this study demonstrates that the floodplain and its embedded wetland are sensitive areas that are strongly affected by threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity see fig 8 therefore the current assessment of hydrological connectivity should be combined with ecological and environmental processes indeed several previous attempts have been carried out to analyze the relationship between hydrological connectivity and wetland function for example field observations have been carried out to explore the effects of hydrological connectivity on wetland waterbirds of poyang lake xia et al 2016 a geostatistical calculation was applied in hydrodynamic results and used to examine the influence of connectivity on water quality status of the lake wetland li et al 2019a more recently the same geostatistical method as li et al 2019a was adopted to analyze the connectivity dynamics and the associated causal factors for the lake s floodplains based on a series of remote sensing images tan et al 2019 liu et al 2020 although these previous studies highlighted the important role of surface hydrological connectivity on vegetation types fishes migratory waterbirds and water quality status of the poyang lake floodplain system water depth and flow velocity were not quantitatively combined to explain the effect of hydrological connectivity the outcomes from the current work increase our knowledge of previous studies by refining the concept of hydrological connectivity and evaluating the influence of water depth and flow velocity on connectivity in the threshold affected floodplain in addition this study also offers recommendations for future work in which researchers should use more comprehensive connectivity data e g habitat suitability data assessments and measures to facilitate scientific communication and its implication according to previous ecological assessments most lakes surrounding the yangtze river have lost their natural connections and as such some lakes have disappeared entirely during recent decades zhang et al 2020 numerous previous studies have been conducted to investigate the external connectivity between the yangtze river and their floodplain lakes river lake connectivity such as dongting lake and poyang lake e g zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2015 li et al 2017 for example the lowering level in the yangtze river plays a weakening role in enhancing lake outflows into the river resulting in a reduced lake water level over the receding water phase zhang et al 2014 additionally according to previous hydrological and environmental assessments the poyang lake hydraulic dam linking the lake and the yangtze river proposed by the jiangxi province government is more likely to increase the low lake water levels and alter the flow fields wang et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the variations in the lake hydrodynamics may exceed the water depth and velocity threshold values potentially leading to abrupt changes in internal connectivity lake floodplain connectivity however previous efforts regarding hydrological and ecological conditions and management and policy decisions are often made in the absence of adequate assessments on surface hydrological connectivity the outcomes from this study play a critical role in guiding future strategies for both poyang lake and the yangtze river and proposing floodplain behavior management connectivity dynamics and associated ecological responses in this study we focus on the surface water connectivity and its threshold effects on the floodplain system hydrological connectivity is based on a system specific concept usepa 2015 indeed the concept of connectivity develops from its origin in ecology goodwin 2003 during the recent decade both ecologists and hydrologists have adopted a variety of connectivity definitions rinderer et al 2018 generally hydrological connectivity includes longitudinal e g streamflow and downstream transport lateral e g overbank flow and transport from channels to floodplains vertical e g surface subsurface exchange and temporal dimensions e g seasonal cycles see fig 12 since the surface hydrological connectivity analyzed in this study is based on the floodplain hydrodynamic model mike 21 we could not provide information regarding subsurface connectivity e g recharge rate soil water and groundwater previous work in the poyang lake floodplains concluded that lake floodplain groundwater exhibits a significant seasonal exchange and has a strong impact on soil gleyization li et al 2019c yang et al 2019 additionally it is important to keep in mind that natural waterbodies e g rivers and lakes usually have rather complex and sensitive flow dynamics it is beyond the scope of this study to use velocity directions to identify the variable connectivity conditions therefore the current connectivity method represents an average connectivity condition along the n s w e ne sw and nw se directions respectively see equation 1 3 refining hydrological connectivity through a threshold approach as done in this study indubitably affects multiple dimensions of connectivity for example the refined hydrological connectivity may lead to the partial or fragmental connectivity condition for most natural rivers due to the consideration of water depth or velocity threshold given the above background further work to evaluate the connectivity in complex environments will focus on the following 1 incorporate a 2d hydrodynamic model and groundwater flow model to provide a complete description of the surface flowpaths soil water movement and groundwater flow dynamics 2 modify the current connectivity algorithm or apply novel methods to represent the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions rather than n s w e nw se and ne sw based on river networks and associated flow directions and 3 develop a simplified scheme to provide new insights into the linkage of multiple dimensions scales of hydrological connectivity and its response to climate change e g abnormal flooding and drying years and human activities e g dam construction sedimentation 6 conclusions the current work aimed to improve the understanding of hydrological connectivity and the threshold effects of hydrodynamics on eco environmental indicators in a large flood pulse influenced floodplain system poyang lake china the results reveal that low connectivity is observed during the dry water phase intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and receding phases and high connectivity is found during the flood phase of poyang lake spatial changes in connectivity objects areas indicate that the heterogeneous floodplain is a sensitive area of the flood pulse system in order to highlight the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco environments the concepts of total connectivity tc general connectivity gc and effective connectivity ec were proposed and defined based on water inundation water depth and flow velocity distributions the substantial differences between the three connectivity types demonstrate that the joint influences of water depth and velocity ec may produce more dynamic and complex roles on connectivity than the other two scenarios tc and gc the modelling experiments provide new insight into the threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity on floodplain hydrological connectivity the results reveal that in general the variations in water depth thresholds may have a large effect on connectivity during the dry rising and receding limbs rather than the flooding limb while velocity seems to exert an opposite threshold role in affecting the wetting and drying cycle the influence of depth and velocity thresholds on connectivity will change along different water phases of the hydrological pulses indicating a temporal dynamic threshold behavior in flood pulse influenced systems our study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for both management applications and providing

17116,recent years the hydrological connectivity has gained popularity in various research fields however its definition and threshold effects at a system scale have not received adequate attention the current research proposes a promising framework to refine the concept of surface hydrological connectivity by combining hydrodynamic modeling experiments threshold effects and geostatistical connectivity analysis exemplified by the flood pulse influenced poyang lake floodplain system china to enhance the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco environments total connectivity tc general connectivity gc and effective connectivity ec were proposed to refine the metrics of hydrological connectivity the results show that substantial differences between the three connectivity metrics are observed for all target directions demonstrating that the joint role of water depth and flow velocity may produce more dynamic and complex influences on ec than the other two metrics of tc and gc topographically the connectivity objects areas within the flood pulse system reveal that the floodplain is a more sensitive area than the lake s main flow channels under different connectivity conditions the modelling experimental studies show that variations in water depth thresholds are more likely to have a strong effect on connectivity for the dry rising and falling limbs rather than the flooding period while the flow velocity may exert an opposite threshold effect the lake floodplain system is characterized by a dynamic threshold behavior with seasonally varying water depth and velocity thresholds this study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for facilitating scientific communication by combining hydrodynamic thresholds and offering recommendations for future connectivity assessments using our proposed metrics of tc gc and ec graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological connectivity threshold effect hydrodynamic model floodplain lake connectivity assessment ecological and environmental goals introduction in recent years floodplain systems have gained considerable attention in fields like hydrology ecology and environment funk et al 2019 karpack et al 2020 they are regarded as the most important natural regions and frequently function as significantly valuable and productive hotspots on earth bonnet et al 2008 de resende et al 2019 floodplain connectivity has been a renewed interest for interpreting transport mechanisms of the constituent materials li et al 2019a park 2020 building upon ecological theory hydrological connectivity refers to the water and water mediated exchanges e g sediment energy and organisms between rivers or lakes and their floodplains as well as between heterogeneous regions within floodplains bracken et al 2013 saco et al 2020 therefore the hydrologically dynamic and complex floodplains and hence their processes and functions can be understood and evaluated using hydrological connectivity yang and chu 2013 singh and sinha 2019 tan et al 2019 while the concept of hydrological connectivity has been developed and widely used in many investigations there is little agreement on its definition and metric method antoine et al 2009 rinderer et al 2018 during the past few years two relevant and complementary concepts structural and functional connectivity have been adopted to represent the degree and dynamics of hydrological connectivity in spatiotemporal scales saco et al 2020 the combined role of physical topography e g channel bed and bank elevation and hydrological pulses determines water exchanges and spatial pathways within the floodplain trigg et al 2013 liu et al 2020 additionally the flood pulse concept shows that the floodplain heterogeneity is mainly attributable to the shifting water sources and dynamic flow pathways junk et al 1989 trigg et al 2013 given the above background hydrological connectivity in recent work has been assessed using graph theory percolation theory pattern analysis and spatial statistics e g yang and chu 2013 deng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 based on the results of field

identifying connectivity conditions between different waterbodies they have difficulty providing sufficient data about the spatiotemporal distributions of water depth and flow velocity water depth and flow velocity are generally viewed as the two most important factors in floodplain connectivity particularly for various kinds of ecological indicators usepa 2015 generally the irregularity and remoteness of the majority of floodplains lead to independent localized hydrological units such as surface depressions river channels and topographic barriers khaki and awange 2019 liu et al 2020 creating heterogeneous water depth and flow velocity distributions that directly affect hydrological connectivity in general dynamics in water depth may exert a significant role in influencing fishes mollusc communities and waterbirds reckendorfer et al 2006 bennion and manny 2014 liu et al 2020 flow velocity is prone to affect sediment transport organic matter and water quality trends jager et al 2012 giblin et al 2014 while the joint role of the two is expected to control the most ecological goals although previous studies have highlighted the importance and implications of connectivity for the analysis of floodplain settings and as a potential tool for planning and management strategies they do not provide sufficient knowledge regarding the individual or joint influence of water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity from a systemic perspective a conceptual schematic diagram of the hydrological connectivity and the associated relationships between the water depth flow velocity and ecological indicators is provided in fig 1 to the best of our knowledge hydrological connectivity has a more significant implication for ecology and environment fields by considering the water depth and flow velocity referred to as the later stage than the pure hydrology that focuses on the water extent information referred to as the initial stage consequently the concept of hydrological connectivity should be refined or redefined to improve its usefulness for ecological and environmental studies hydrological connectivity is an emerging property of systems that is changing in both its prevalent structural features and its short response functional elements saco et al 2020 the response of systems and the detection of threshold behavior are paramount in floodplains and wetlands where the transitions to degraded conditions are tightly related to changes in hydrological connectivity turnbull et al 2008 moreno delas heras et al 2012 more importantly early detection of threshold signals may prevent a transition to more rapid degradation saco et al 2018 however threshold behaviors of floodplain systems have not been frequently identified as an important factor in analyzing the nature of hydrological connectivity phillips et al 2011 liu et al 2020 additionally there is no widely accepted definition of surface hydrological connectivity regarding the connection and disconnection thresholds restrepo a et al 2020 consequently investigating the system thresholds and the corresponding threshold dynamics has practical implications for healthy floodplain functions due to considerable concern for various water resource ecological and environmental goals in floodplains karpack et al 2020 it is vital to improve the understanding regarding threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity in flood pulse systems as this area has not received the same degree of attention as hydrodynamic processes different from previous work this study also intends to refine the concept of hydrological connectivity and seeks to bridge the gaps between connectivity and the related ecological and environmental processes the specific objectives of this paper are to 1 improve the understanding of spatiotemporal variations in floodplain hydrodynamics and hydrological connectivity by combining a 2d hydrodynamic model and geostatistical analysis 2 combine water depth and flow velocity thresholds to propose new metrics of hydrological connectivity by considering ecological and environmental goals and 3 assess the influences of threshold changes on floodplain hydrological connectivity and the associated eco environmental indicators using a series of modeling experiments 2 study area poyang lake floodplain system is located at the southern bank of the middle reaches of the yangtze river in northern jiangxi province poyang lake has a typical subtropical monsoon climate hu et al 2007 in the yangtze river catchment poyang lake is considered a distinctive flood pulse influenced system that sustains free connection with its inflow rivers zhang et al 2014 li et al 2020a the lake receives five major river inflows from a catchment area of 1 62 105 km2 and subsequently discharges to the downstream yangtze river fig 2 lake water balance shows that about 91 2 of yearly inflows are from river discharges from the catchment lake discharges to the yangtze river occupies around 86 9 of the total outflow li et al 2020a the floodplain areas of 2000 km2 are almost fully connected to the main lake during the flooding season but become isolated or partly connection during the dry season li et al 2019b tan et al 2019 due to the flood pulses from both the catchment rivers and the lake inundation wei et al 2020 generally the water depth exhibits an increasing trend from the floodplains to the flow channels varied from 6 m to 30 m and the water velocities vary from 0 1 to 1 0 m s li et al 2017 the flushing ability of the lake floodplain system is characterized by spatial varying residence times in the range of 20 300 days li et al 2016 3 materials and methods this work used a two dimensional 2d hydrodynamic model to represent the hydrodynamic behaviors of the flood pulse influenced poyang lake see section 3 2 the validated model and its simulation results in combination with the threshold definition were used to identify the water spatiotemporal pattern the geostatistical analysis was subsequently applied to the binary raster data to investigate the responses of surface hydrological connectivity see section 3 3 and allowed to further explore the threshold effects on connectivity conditions see section 3 4 the major methodology in this study regarding the hydrodynamic modeling threshold definition and connectivity calculation is presented in fig 3 3 1 data collection and purpose 3 1 1 hydrological and meteorological data the daily hydrological and meteorological data were collected for the purpose of driving and validating the floodplain hydrodynamic model of poyang lake during 2018 daily discharges at the four main river gauging stations and two tributary stations were adopted to reflect the five major rivers from the lake s catchment fig 2a lake water levels and outflow hydrographs at the five gauging stations were used to represent the spatial responses of the lake during 2018 fig 2b the bathymetry map surveyed in 2010 1 10 000 was used to depict the physical topography of the lake floodplain system fig 2b spatial flow velocities were used to reproduce the flow field of poyang lake based on acoustic doppler current profile adcp measurements in august 2018 see section 4 1 meteorological parameters time series precipitation evaporation wind speed and wind direction obtained from the lake gauging stations were selected to represent the atmospheric conditions of the floodplain system 3 1 2 water quality data waterbird population and fish distributions in order to explore the importance and implications of the proposed connectivity metrics this study used water quality parameters waterbird and fish as proxy indicators of the eco environments in the poyang lake floodplain system a total of 144 vertically integrated water samples were collected within consecutive days during 10 15 july 2019 the locations of sampling sites differ in space to cover different lake regions see section 4 5 for a comprehensive analysis the popular trophic state index tsi carlson 1977 was calculated and used to present the condition of the lake ecosystem based on the total dissolved nitrogen tn total dissolved phosphorous tp chlorophyll a chl a chemical oxygen demand codmn concentrations and secchi disk depth the analysis method of these parameters is same to li et al 2019a waterbird population distributions were obtained from huang et al 2018 and fish distribution map was derived from the atlas of poyang lake 1993 in order to analyze and explain the implications of different connectivity metrics proposed by this study these data obtained in 2019 were presumed to represent the conditions in 2018 3 2 floodplain hydrodynamic model the present study used a two dimensional 2d mike 21 model to investigate the floodplain hydrological and hydrodynamic behaviors of poyang lake the modelling work of poyang lake involved several major aspects the model domain is about 3 124 km2 and the element sizes varied from 70 m to 1 500 m to capture the lake floodplain inundation dynamics fig 2 therefore a total of 20 450 triangular elements were generated to perform the floodplain hydrodynamic simulation fig 3 the time varying catchment inflows five large rivers were used as the lake upstream boundary conditions q t fig 2 the hukou water level observations lake outlet were used as the lower boundary condition h t fig 3 the model also used precipitation evaporation and wind fields to reflect the influences of meteorological conditions on the lake hydrodynamics fig 3 the smagorinsky factor of eddy viscosity cs 0 28 and manning numbers m 10 59 m1 3 s were used to represent heterogeneous bed roughness for the lake flow channels and the floodplains e g vegetation area mudflat and permanent waterbody of the flood pulse system li et al 2020b the model adopted the depth rule h drying 0 005 m h flooding 0 05 m h wetting 0 1 m to capture the wetting and drying cycle in the floodplain system dhi 2014 li et al 2014 to maintain the target courant friedrich levy number of 1 0 the minimum and the maximum time step were set to 0 1 s and 3600 s respectively extensive validation and applications in many previous studies have been conducted for the hydrodynamic model of the poyang lake floodplain system e g li et al 2014 li et al 2017 2019a b 2020a b therefore a brief description regarding the theoretical basis and other model aspects of the mike 21 is given in this section in this study the floodplain hydrodynamic model of the lake was further validated using water level and flow velocity observations during 2018 the determination coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient ens were used to quantify the goodness of fit and to assess the model s performance 3 3 geostatistical connectivity analysis we used geostatistical connectivity metrics to quantify and characterize the surface hydrological connectivity of the poyang lake floodplains the geostatistical method is effective for investigating the transport pathway connection or isolation between different surface water elements trigg et al 2013 generally connectivity analysis adopts binary data to analyze the surface water connectivity and the associated spatial patterns of connected components fig 3 this method has the capacity to describe spatiotemporal patterns and quantify thresholds and transitions in large systems by identifying the subtle differences in the data fields michaelides and chappell 2009 the geostatistical approach is multi point connectivity statistics that quantify the probability of any connected cells and corresponding connected magnitude for binary state patterns of hydrological systems pardo iguzquiza and dowd 2003 the basic mathematical expression of connectivity function cf in different directions including north south n s west east w e nw se and ne sw is expressed by journel et al 2000 1 cf n z c pr j 1 n i u j z c 1 2 if z u j z c i u j z c 1 0 3 if z u j z c i u j z c 0 where n represents the total number of points π represents the product operator uj represents the location zc is the threshold value i uj zc represents a connectivity indicator pr is the calculated probability here the connectivity statistic is a probability distance function cf that was produced to express the probability pr 3 4 connectivity definition and threshold scenario the individual or combined threshold effects of spatiotemporal water inundation water depth and flow velocity distributions obtained from the hydrodynamic model were used to define different connectivity types corresponding gridded patterns wet dry were used as input for geostatistical connectivity analysis fig 3 three connectivity definitions namely total connectivity general connectivity and effective connectivity are discussed in table 1 since this study aimed to provide insights into the effects of proposed connectivity metrics the general idea was to show the differences between the connectivity conditions under the three definitions based on a representative year of the floodplain system to represent the significant importance of threshold effect the recommended values of water depth threshold thresholdh 20 cm and flow velocity threshold thresholdv 0 1 m s were based on literature values from poyang lake and other similar areas jager et al 2012 bennion and manny 2014 giblin et al 2014 liu et al 2020 that is 20 cm depth or 0 1 m s velocity environments are more likely to create a better connectivity condition that has significant implications for most ecological and environmental goals e g sediment organic matter fish phytoplankton see table 1 in order to investigate the influence of variations in different thresholds water depth and flow velocity on hydrological connectivity this study uses a series of experimental scenarios by setting specified threshold values for water depth and flow velocity h 10 cm v 0 05 m s consequently the resulting wet dry binary data were used to calculate the surface hydrological connectivity in n s w e nw se and ne sw directions since the general idea was to identify the differences between the connectivity conditions under different h and v threshold values the authors limit the modeling experiments within the threshold range of water depth 0 90 cm and velocity 0 0 3 m s given the difficulties in conducting detailed analyses of threshold effect for every small offset value 4 results 4 1 validation of hydrodynamic model observed water levels and flow velocities distributed in the floodplain system were used to reproduce the dynamic changes in the hydrological behaviors fig 4 the observed and modelled water levels at the xingzi duchang and kangshan gauging stations matched well during the validation procedure fig 4b the statistics showed that the ens varied from 0 95 to 0 99 and r 2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 the values of rmse were lower than 0 45 m although the impact of the complex topography e g the flow channel shallow floodplains and model conceptualization e g mesh size boundary condition on generated patterns of hydrodynamics can almost be neglected during the flooding water phase slight discrepancies between the simulation and the observation are found during low lake level seasons fig 4b for the spatial flow velocity simulations fig 4a the statistics also revealed a close agreement between the modelled and observed points r 2 0 71 fig 4c the validation presented in fig 4 demonstrates the floodplain hydrodynamic model has an overall capability in capturing the rising high falling and low water phases in the flood pulse influenced poyang lake building confidence in the applicability of the modeling experimental studies and scenarios analysis 4 2 spatiotemporal changes in hydrodynamics and connectivity conditions spatial and temporal dynamics in the hydrodynamic characteristics of the poyang lake floodplains are inextricably linked to surface water connectivity for both water depth and flow velocity the temporal trends show that in general the two hydrodynamic forcings exhibit a distinct negative relationship throughout the year fig 5 a mainly due to the influence of dynamic hydraulic gradient on velocity on average low hydrological connectivity can be observed during the dry water phase e g february mean cf 0 3 intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and falling limbs e g may and october mean cf 0 4 0 5 while high connectivity is found during flood phase e g august mean cf 0 7 spatial variations of the poyang lake hydrodynamic and connectivity conditions in the dry rising flooding and receding hydrological phases are illustrated in figs 5b c the water depth and flow velocity show high spatial heterogeneity and varies quite distinctly within the lake however the hydrodynamic behaviors in the lake floodplains exhibit similar characteristics in terms of their spatial pattern that is the lake s main flow channels and the associated extensive floodplains can be recognized across the flood pulse system geographically the water depth in the main lake flow channels can exceed around 10 m but the depth within the shallow floodplain areas is generally less than 2 m fig 5b spatially the flow velocities vary from 0 1 m s in the lake s floodplains to 0 9 m s in the main flow channels fig 5c the result presented in fig 5d reveals the changes in connectivity objects areas between the main flow channels and the lake s floodplains as well as between heterogeneous areas within the floodplain indicating relatively complex connections in different colors throughout the lake floodplain system this is the expected outcome given that the spatially varying topographic features may exert substantial influences on the connectivity condition particularly for the dry rising and receding phases of the flood pulse system fig 5d that is water depth in the lake flow channels is much deeper than that of the surrounding floodplains during different hydrological water phases and filling spilling process generally extends from lower lying channels to upper lying floodplains 4 3 comparison of different connectivity metrics connectivity analysis of the poyang lake floodplains generated a series of monthly n s w e nw se and ne sw cf changes under tc gc and ec conditions fig 6 for all three connectivity scenarios the temporal trends show that the cf plots exhibit highly dynamic changes along the distance scale x axis for the four directions however the results reveal that in general low connectivity is observed during the dry seasons intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and receding periods while high connectivity is found during the flood period figs 6a d under different connectivity types the cf results indicate that the connectivity conditions of tc are distinctly higher than those of gc and ec during most times of the year as expected the effects of water depth and flow velocity thresholds on hydrological connectivity gc and ec may produce large differences relative to the baseline scenario tc the results presented in fig 6 indicate that the combined effect of water depth and velocity may generate a more complex role on connectivity ec than that of the water depth alone gc on average it seems that the cf curve is more likely to generate abrupt changes under the ec scenario than the other two connectivity scenarios fig 7 additionally it should be noted that the cf curves decreased to zero in a more rapid manner along the distance scale especially for the ec scenario figs 6 7 in order to explore the influence of tc gc and ec scenarios on hydrological connectivity four typical water phases of the poyang lake floodplains were selected to reflect the connected areas and corresponding connected objects areas fig 8 a it is expected that the connected areas under gc and ec scenarios are lower than in the tc scenario mainly due to the limitation of water depth and flow velocity correspondingly the spatial variations of connected objects areas show a similar trend to that of the connected areas for the three connectivity scenarios as illustrated in fig 8b it can be found that the most notable changes mainly occur in the floodplain areas and in some high elevation areas in addition the effective connectivity objects areas ec are mainly distributed in the lake s flow channels across the lake s length from south to north in a word the results presented in fig 8b demonstrate that the individual or joint effects of water depth and flow velocity are mostly likely to play a dominant role in controlling flow pathways and associated spatial patterns of connectivity objects areas 4 4 threshold effect of hydrological connectivity when the cf curves exhibit subtle changes over time implies that the system can be characterized by a steady state condition or that a threshold behavior may affect the hydrological system in order to further investigate the threshold effects on surface hydrological connectivity a series of daily mean cf plots are obtained from the designed modeling experiments as shown in fig 9 the results demonstrate that the variations in water depth thresholds appear to have a large effect on cf during the dry rising and falling limbs opposed to the flooding limb see the dotted line in fig 9a whereas the flow velocity tends to have an opposite threshold effect see the dotted line in fig 9b the reason can be attributed to the negative relationship between the water depth and flow velocity see fig 5a these previous results imply that the combined effect of water depth and flow velocity thresholds on connectivity may be dynamic and complex e g ec see figs 6 7 although there is difficulty in quantifying the threshold values of water depth and flow velocity the results tend to show that the threshold effects are more likely to exhibit a temporal evolution in terms of the line shape of threshold fig 9 that is the influence of depth and velocity thresholds on connectivity will change along the dry thresholdh 10 20 cm thresholdv 20 25 cm s rising thresholdh 50 60 cm thresholdv 25 cm s flooding thresholdh 80 cm thresholdv 5 10 cm s and receding thresholdh 50 60 cm thresholdv 20 cm s water phases see the dotted lines in fig 9 additionally the calculated cfs presented in fig 10 demonstrate that on average the lake floodplain system seems to exhibit an abrupt change the water depth and velocity thresholds are around 20 cm and 5 cm s respectively see the yellow shadow areas additionally different connectivity conditions are observed for n s w e nw se and ne sw directions which can be explained by the joint influence of spatial varying topographic features e g flow channels and depressions and different hydrological pulses e g river inflows and lake inundation 4 5 implications of the refined connectivity concept and assessment applications this study attempts to use water coverage water depth and flow velocity to describe the hydrological connectivity and its implications for eco environmental research the distributions of water quality parameters waterbirds and fishes in poyang lake were selected and used to validate the connectivity metrics of tc gc and ec as illustrated in fig 11 a although these indicators exhibit distinctly heterogeneous distribution the spatial pattern is highly consistent with the connectivity condition of gc and ec demonstrating that the threshold range of water depth and flow velocity is critical for connectivity assessment in the system for example the connectivity objects areas of ec is most likely to control the tsi of the lake especially for the main flow channels see ② in fig 11a the spatial coincidence of connectivity objects areas with waterbird and fish distributions are well reproduced by the changed water depth threshold of gc statistical analysis reveals that the refined hydrological connectivity of gc and ec has a close relationship with the eco environmental indicators as reflected in r 2 values of 0 92 and 0 69 for the tsi and the waterbird population respectively p 0 05 fig 11a the results present here highlight the effectiveness and implications of the refined connectivity metrics from the perspective of hydrodynamics the spatial distributions of tn tp chl a concentrations and the tsi can be directly explained by the complex depth velocity relationships see ①②③ in fig 11b for most rivers lakes and wetlands water depth and flow velocity generally exhibit positive relationships that play a cumulative or equivalent role on connectivity condition gc can be selected to evaluate the connectivity effects on ecosystems while ec is an appropriate metric to investigate regions with negative relationships between water depth and flow velocity compensatory role fig 11b the researchers should take caution that the threshold value of ec may produce significant influences on the connectivity and the associated assessment applications particularly for shallow water flow areas e g floodplains 5 discussion for this study we provided new insight into the threshold effects of key hydrodynamic variables on surface water connectivity for the poyang lake floodplains and other similar floodplains around the world although the current work improves our understanding of hydrological connectivity and its causal factors in large flood pulse influenced systems connectivity dynamics are also affected by complex hydro geomorphologic properties including channelized water flowpaths overbank processes and local recharge stevaux et al 2013 restrepo a et al 2020 in large floodplains the surface topography and hydrological pulses are dominant in different parts of the system the threshold behaviors from this work may have somewhat different outcomes if other floodplain areas are investigated therefore specific studies should be conducted to identify individual thresholds for different geomorphic units knowledge regarding the temporal evolution and the spatial continuity as well as the complexity of heterogenous topographic features is a necessity for any restoration effort singh and sinha 2019 the current hydrodynamic model and spatial analysis provide a combination approach to consider past and present connectivity conditions with intensifying persistent and diminishing connectivity potentials the examination of low and high potential connectivity and spatial connected objects areas in the current work offers an opportunity to perform effective management and restoration activities therefore this study may contribute to the method and the need for a spatiotemporal framework for connectivity and restoration projects across different landscape elements for the flood pulse influenced poyang lake this study demonstrates that the floodplain and its embedded wetland are sensitive areas that are strongly affected by threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity see fig 8 therefore the current assessment of hydrological connectivity should be combined with ecological and environmental processes indeed several previous attempts have been carried out to analyze the relationship between hydrological connectivity and wetland function for example field observations have been carried out to explore the effects of hydrological connectivity on wetland waterbirds of poyang lake xia et al 2016 a geostatistical calculation was applied in hydrodynamic results and used to examine the influence of connectivity on water quality status of the lake wetland li et al 2019a more recently the same geostatistical method as li et al 2019a was adopted to analyze the connectivity dynamics and the associated causal factors for the lake s floodplains based on a series of remote sensing images tan et al 2019 liu et al 2020 although these previous studies highlighted the important role of surface hydrological connectivity on vegetation types fishes migratory waterbirds and water quality status of the poyang lake floodplain system water depth and flow velocity were not quantitatively combined to explain the effect of hydrological connectivity the outcomes from the current work increase our knowledge of previous studies by refining the concept of hydrological connectivity and evaluating the influence of water depth and flow velocity on connectivity in the threshold affected floodplain in addition this study also offers recommendations for future work in which researchers should use more comprehensive connectivity data e g habitat suitability data assessments and measures to facilitate scientific communication and its implication according to previous ecological assessments most lakes surrounding the yangtze river have lost their natural connections and as such some lakes have disappeared entirely during recent decades zhang et al 2020 numerous previous studies have been conducted to investigate the external connectivity between the yangtze river and their floodplain lakes river lake connectivity such as dongting lake and poyang lake e g zhang et al 2014 hu et al 2015 li et al 2017 for example the lowering level in the yangtze river plays a weakening role in enhancing lake outflows into the river resulting in a reduced lake water level over the receding water phase zhang et al 2014 additionally according to previous hydrological and environmental assessments the poyang lake hydraulic dam linking the lake and the yangtze river proposed by the jiangxi province government is more likely to increase the low lake water levels and alter the flow fields wang et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the variations in the lake hydrodynamics may exceed the water depth and velocity threshold values potentially leading to abrupt changes in internal connectivity lake floodplain connectivity however previous efforts regarding hydrological and ecological conditions and management and policy decisions are often made in the absence of adequate assessments on surface hydrological connectivity the outcomes from this study play a critical role in guiding future strategies for both poyang lake and the yangtze river and proposing floodplain behavior management connectivity dynamics and associated ecological responses in this study we focus on the surface water connectivity and its threshold effects on the floodplain system hydrological connectivity is based on a system specific concept usepa 2015 indeed the concept of connectivity develops from its origin in ecology goodwin 2003 during the recent decade both ecologists and hydrologists have adopted a variety of connectivity definitions rinderer et al 2018 generally hydrological connectivity includes longitudinal e g streamflow and downstream transport lateral e g overbank flow and transport from channels to floodplains vertical e g surface subsurface exchange and temporal dimensions e g seasonal cycles see fig 12 since the surface hydrological connectivity analyzed in this study is based on the floodplain hydrodynamic model mike 21 we could not provide information regarding subsurface connectivity e g recharge rate soil water and groundwater previous work in the poyang lake floodplains concluded that lake floodplain groundwater exhibits a significant seasonal exchange and has a strong impact on soil gleyization li et al 2019c yang et al 2019 additionally it is important to keep in mind that natural waterbodies e g rivers and lakes usually have rather complex and sensitive flow dynamics it is beyond the scope of this study to use velocity directions to identify the variable connectivity conditions therefore the current connectivity method represents an average connectivity condition along the n s w e ne sw and nw se directions respectively see equation 1 3 refining hydrological connectivity through a threshold approach as done in this study indubitably affects multiple dimensions of connectivity for example the refined hydrological connectivity may lead to the partial or fragmental connectivity condition for most natural rivers due to the consideration of water depth or velocity threshold given the above background further work to evaluate the connectivity in complex environments will focus on the following 1 incorporate a 2d hydrodynamic model and groundwater flow model to provide a complete description of the surface flowpaths soil water movement and groundwater flow dynamics 2 modify the current connectivity algorithm or apply novel methods to represent the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions rather than n s w e nw se and ne sw based on river networks and associated flow directions and 3 develop a simplified scheme to provide new insights into the linkage of multiple dimensions scales of hydrological connectivity and its response to climate change e g abnormal flooding and drying years and human activities e g dam construction sedimentation 6 conclusions the current work aimed to improve the understanding of hydrological connectivity and the threshold effects of hydrodynamics on eco environmental indicators in a large flood pulse influenced floodplain system poyang lake china the results reveal that low connectivity is observed during the dry water phase intermediate connectivity tends to occur during the rising and receding phases and high connectivity is found during the flood phase of poyang lake spatial changes in connectivity objects areas indicate that the heterogeneous floodplain is a sensitive area of the flood pulse system in order to highlight the inherent linkage between hydrological connectivity and eco environments the concepts of total connectivity tc general connectivity gc and effective connectivity ec were proposed and defined based on water inundation water depth and flow velocity distributions the substantial differences between the three connectivity types demonstrate that the joint influences of water depth and velocity ec may produce more dynamic and complex roles on connectivity than the other two scenarios tc and gc the modelling experiments provide new insight into the threshold effects of water depth and flow velocity on floodplain hydrological connectivity the results reveal that in general the variations in water depth thresholds may have a large effect on connectivity during the dry rising and receding limbs rather than the flooding limb while velocity seems to exert an opposite threshold role in affecting the wetting and drying cycle the influence of depth and velocity thresholds on connectivity will change along different water phases of the hydrological pulses indicating a temporal dynamic threshold behavior in flood pulse influenced systems our study highlights the importance of redefined connectivity concept for both management applications and providing

17117,membrane fouling by influent biopolymers and the formation of surface biofilms are major obstacles to the practical application of membrane technologies identifying reliable and sustainable pre treatment methods for membrane filtration remains a considerable challenge and is the subject of continuing research study worldwide herein the performance of a bench scale gravity driven up flow slow biofilter gusb as the pre treatment for ultrafiltration to reduce membrane fouling is presented dissolved organic carbon doc was shown efficiently removed by the gusb around 80 when treating a natural water influent more significantly biopolymers with molecular weight mw between 20 kda and 100 kda were effectively removed 62 8 reduction and this led to a lower rate of transmembrane pressure tmp development by the uf membrane microbial diversity analysis further unraveled the function of gusb in shaping microbes to degrade biopolymers contributing to lower accumulation and different distribution pattern of smp on the membrane surface moreover the biofilm formed on the membrane surface after the pre treatment of gusb was observed to have a relative porous structure compared to the control system which can also affect the fouling development long term operation of gusb further revealed its robust performance in reducing both natural organic matters and uf fouling propensity this study overall has demonstrated the potential advantages of applying a gusb to enhance uf process performance by reducing biofouling and improving effluent quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration biofiltration biopolymers microbial diversity membrane fouling 1 introduction the steadily increasing consumption of water and population growth are increasing the demands on global freshwater resources and the risks of scarcity and insufficient water supply it has been estimated that nearly two thirds of the global population have faced the problem of water shortage during the past several years mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to address this challenge it is imperative to develop efficient and sustainable methods of drinking water treatment membrane based separation technologies have long been recognized as effective and robust processes for water purification with a much smaller environmental footprint compared to conventional water treatment processes shannon et al 2008 and are gaining increasing popularity in situations of water scarcity and aquatic pollution werber et al 2016 however the propensity for fouling of the membrane after long term operation reduces its effectiveness and sustainability and therefore its suitability in practical applications consequently new approaches to reduce membrane fouling need to be developed to overcome the present limitations and facilitate a greater use of membrane processes in the future for water purification membrane fouling is often associated with biofilm adhesion on the membrane surface where a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps plays a fundamental role in forming the biofilm the eps mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and amphiphilic polymers giving biofilms a highly sophisticated functional scaffold such as extended interaction gene transfer nutrients capture and tolerance to antimicrobials etc flemming et al 2016 however the accumulation of eps is detrimental to the stable operation of membrane separation contributing to the development of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling specifically it has been revealed by several studies that soluble eps or soluble microbial products smp contribute most to the membrane fouling and these have moderate molecular weights which can be degraded as recycled electron donor substrates laspidou and rittmann 2002 wang et al 2014 wang and li 2008 therefore it is worthwhile exploring an efficient form of membrane pre treatment for smp reduction which by enhancing the membrane performance can increase its applicability and cost effectiveness in water treatment various pre treatment methods have been considered for membrane separation in terms of reducing membrane fouling coagulation for example is the most common pre treatment process for ultrafiltration uf and has long been considered as an efficient pre treatment method for alleviating membrane fouling huang et al 2009 however drawbacks such as inefficient removal of hydrophilic organic matter deng et al 2019 and the production of solid residuals sludges have restricted its practical application pre oxidation disinfection has also been widely adopted as a pre treatment method for mitigating membrane fouling but this also has its disadvantages for instance the dosing of chlorine can potentially increase the production of disinfection by products dbps in the treated drinking water which are of potential concern to human health gao et al 2011b in addition pre treatment with ozone might even exacerbate membrane fouling which depends highly on the properties of the organic components within raw waters yu et al 2017 moreover the long term usage of oxidants could also leads to the potential damage to membrane modules which is a factor that should be considered before practical application huang et al 2009 biofiltration is a green simple and robust pretreatment that particularly suits for decentralized drinking water systems biofiltration relies on the microbes that are indigenous to the feeding water proliferate on the surface of biofilter substrate contributing to the removal of contaminants kirisits et al 2019 natural biofiltration such as riverbank or acquirer filtration quanrud et al 2003 ray et al 2002 zucker et al 2015 and engineered biofiltration for instance the rapid rate filtration azzeh et al 2015 halle et al 2009 pramanik et al 2017 are generally two types of biofiltration systems wildly utilized in drinking water treatment systems for natural biofiltration though it has a better performance in natural organic matters nom removal its application was constrained due to the requirement of large footprint long retention time and specific geological condition which makes the engineered biofiltration a more competitive choice in practical situations nevertheless in another side the rapid rate biofilter with empty bed contact time ebct normally less than 30 min also brings some potential issues like the requirement of regular backwashing to manage headloss accumulation and relatively low nom removal efficiency less than 20 etc de vera et al 2019 peldszus et al 2012 terry and summers 2018 various studies showed that biopolymers could be biodegraded via biofiltration with the removal efficiency for example varied from 20 to 75 azzeh et al 2015 peldszus et al 2012 zheng et al 2010 and as the benefit the uf membrane irreversible fouling was shown to be reduced up to 68 when using biofilter as the pretreatment azzeh et al 2015 rahman et al 2014 very few work correlated the biodegradation of biopolymers via biofiltration with the microbial diversity and the morphology of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface only one previous work indicated that the biofilter fed with chlorinated raw water favoured the growth of obligate bacterial predator on the membrane surface which might contribute to the reduction of biofilm on ro membrane surface and therefore helping to the alleviation of biofouling jeong et al 2017 thus exploring the influence of biofiltration pre treatment on the biofilm formed on the membrane surface would help to further understand its contribution to membrane fouling mitigation herein a gravity driven up flow slow biofilter gusb was developed as the pretreatment of uf to enhance the nom removal and reduce the membrane fouling the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled by the following uf operation through adjusting a downstream peristaltic pump in particular a daily membrane tank emptying dmte strategy i e the membrane tank was emptied every 24 hrs during the phase ii stage with the consequent reduction of the hrt of the gusb was examined this was utilized to explore whether the accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank can be physically avoided and the influence of the shortened hrt on the removal of biopolymers special focus was put on the variation of the amount of biopolymers within the gusb system along the depth and the influence of gusb pretreatment on the microbial diversity and morphology of biofilm formed on the membrane surface both of which are deemed to directly determine the development of membrane fouling at the end the performance of the gusb on the nom removal including the biopolymers and the consequent uf fouling reduction was further evaluated after over one year s operation of the biofilter overall this study gave some further insights into the uf fouling alleviation through the biofiltration pretreatment and showed a feasible and promising strategy of biofiltration pretreatment i e the gusb especially for the small scale decentralized membrane based water purification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale uf and gusb uf systems set up and operation two parallel lab scale uf units hollow fiber uf membrane with cut off size of around 100 kda motimo membrane technology co ltd china were assembled based on our previous study yu et al 2019 one of the units treated the natural water sourced from a local lake directly olympic park beijing china and the other utilized a lab scale gusb as the pre treatment before the uf filtration to investigate its influence on the development of membrane fouling fig 1 the lab scale gusb was based on a plexiglass column with the dimensions of ϕ100 600 mm zeolite with an average particle size of 10 15 mm was used as the main substrate and the net liquid volume of the gusb was approximately 1 75 l gac granular activated carbon average particle size of 3 5 mm layers each with a depth of 30 50 mm were located on the top or sandwiched among the zeolite substrate to enhance the treatment efficiency the adsorptive capacities of zeolite and gac for doc in natural water can be found in supplementary information si figure s1 the distances of each gac layer top from the bottom of the zeolite were 100 250 400 and 500 mm respectively sampling ports of the gusb unit were located immediately after each gac layer termed as the bottom middle and top sampling port each uf unit was based on a membrane module of 1 1 mm ϕ pvdf hollow fibres with a total surface area of 0 0073 m2 in order to reduce the membrane fouling rate and minimize the volume of backwashing water both uf units operated on a cycle of 30 min filtration at a constant flux 10 lmh which corresponded to a flow rate of around 1 22 ml min and 1 min rest with simultaneous aeration 100 l h below the uf membrane modules the filtration flux of uf corresponded to the hrt of the gusb of approximately 1 day 1750 ml 24 h d 60 min h 1 22 ml min and the normalized filtration flux of the gusb is around 223 l m2 d the trans membrane pressure tmp of each uf unit was measured via an online pressure gage before the uf operation the gusb was continuously fed with the lake water with hrt of 1 day for 3 weeks in order to pre stabilize its performance 2 2 water quality analysis water sampled from the gusb

vwp shimadzu japan inorganic nutrients nh4 n and po4 3 p were quantified according to the apha standard methods and dissolved oxygen do ph and conductivity were measured using the respective laboratory meter mettler toledo usa eps extracted from the biofilm accumulated on the respective membrane surface or organic matter extracted from the membrane pores was also characterized by sec and eem details of the extraction methods were based on our previous work yu et al 2014b and can be found in supplementary information water samples from the respective membrane tanks and raw water were freeze dried and analysed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum two perkinelmer usa with quest atr accessory to elucidate details of the chemical bonding of organic constituents all the analyses involved at least duplicate measurements in order to ensure reproducibility of the results 2 3 dna extraction and microbial community analysis at the end of the membrane operation the membrane modules in respective systems were carefully taken out two membrane fibers duplicate samples each of 10 0 cm were cut off from the respective modules by sterilized scissors and immediately stored in sterilized centrifuge tubes at 20 c before further processing the biofilm on the respective membrane fibers were used for the microbial diversity analysis and the total genome dna was extracted as described in our previous study xu et al 2020 briefly dna was extracted using proteinase k and sds based lysis then purified with dna clean concentrator 25 kit zymo research usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was stored at 20 c until pcr amplification for microbial community analysis the 16s rrna v3 v4 regions were amplified using a specific primer with a barcode for high throughput sequencing thereafter the effective sequences obtained were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using uparse pipeline at similarity cutoff of 0 97 and the taxonomic classification was performed with the representative sequences of each otu through ribosomal database project rdp classifier against the silva database at the confidence threshold of 0 7 the venn diagram and heat map were constructed using r 2 4 membrane characterization at the end of the experiment the fouled uf modules of the respective systems were carefully taken out from the membrane tank and cut into several pieces for further analyses the fouled membranes after biofilm formation were also freeze dried and analysed by ftir confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm tcs sp5 leica germany was utilized to visualize the distribution of polysaccharides proteins and cells within the biofilm formed on the surface of the membrane using the methods as described in our previous work yu et al 2014a before scanning electron microscopy sem observations the fouled membrane pieces from the respective system were immersed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight and treated with gradient alcohol 10 30 50 70 90 and 100 each for 10 min for dehydration before they were dried the samples were then platinum coated by a sputter and observed under a field scanning electron microscope fsem su8000 hitachi japan 2 5 batch mode uf flux and fouling propensity tests after over one year s operation of the gusb from may 2019 to oct 2020 hrt maintained at 1 d after the continuous filtration experiment as described above its performance on uf fouling alleviation was further evaluated via batch mode flux tests flux and flux recovery were used to evaluate uf membrane fouling propensity as per our previous study yu et al 2018 briefly the filtration experiments were undertaken using flat sheet 76 mm diameter membranes in a laboratory pressure filtration system millipore amicon 8400 usa employing nitrogen gas as the means for obtaining a stable applied pressure 1 bar a digital balance ml3002 mettler toledo international inc usa was used to automatically weight the filtered water in real time by the data acquisition software raw water and the effluent of gusb were used as the test solutions to evaluate their fouling propensity prior to each test the pvdf uf membrane 100 kda was placed in di water for at least 24 h to remove impurities and production residues the initial flux of all the tested uf membranes was checked through the filtration of the di water under 1 0 bar and the membranes with the similar initial flux were chosen for the fouling tests in addition doc removal efficiency of the gusb system after long term operation was also examined to evaluate the stability of the system regarding its ability in nom removal biopolymers representing by polysaccharides and proteins intercepted by the uf membrane after filtrating 2 l of water samples raw water and gusb effluent respectively were quantified to obtain their removal efficiency via gusb treatment using methods as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of gusb on tmp development to examine the influence of utilizing a gusb as the pre treatment for uf the development of tmp was monitored throughout the experimental period as shown in fig 2 a the overall operation can be divided into two phases with phase i being from day 1 to day 27 hrt of 1 d and phase ii hrt of 0 5 d for another two weeks during the first phase it was evident that the differences in the tmp development between the two systems were not significant at the beginning and revealed a gradually widening trend thereafter this could be ascribed to the immaturely formed biofilms in the biofilter which usually takes a few months to reach a steady state and its ability to alleviate membrane fouling can be realized once the biofilms maturely formed specifically the increase rates of tmp development in the gusb uf system from the second week to the fourth week were 2 38 1 93 and 2 33 kpa d respectively while the corresponding values of the uf system were clearly greater which are 3 5 4 29 and 4 17 kpa d respectively it is also noteworthy that the irreversible fouling of the gusb uf system was also lower than the uf system after the four weeks of operation 16 vs 20 5 kpa for the second phase the rate of tmp development in the uf system showed a slight decrease from 3 21 to 3 1 kpa d in the fifth and sixth week respectively indicating a marginally improved performance after dmte however the behavior of the gusb uf system was somewhat different during the first week of the second phase the rate of tmp development was still low 1 64 kpa d but subsequently increased to 2 31 kpa d in the following week therefore it can be concluded that the dmte can slightly reduce the accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank which are believed to be the main cause of membrane fouling desmond et al 2018 howe and clark 2002 however the reduction of hrt of the gusb did not have a positive impact on fouling control possibly due to the insufficient contact time for biodegradation of biopolymers in the gusb in addition it was revealed that both nom like humic substance and the interactions between nom and biopolymers could also cause severe membrane fouling kim and dempsey 2013 myat et al 2014 therefore the slight increase of the doc in gusb effluent in phase ii from 1 09 0 28 to 1 39 0 28 mg l figure s1 could also induce a higher fouling development at the end of the operation i e the end of phase ii the surface morphology of the membrane from the respective systems after the removal of the biofouling layer using high pressure tap water and sponge was observed using sem compared to a blank pvdf membrane fig 2b the surface of the fouled membrane from both systems were clearly changed by the adhesion of foulant material in particular the foulants left on the membrane surface of the uf system fig 2d appeared to be denser than those of the gusb uf system fig 2c and clearly blocking most of the membrane pores this result was consistent with the higher irreversible fouling demonstrated by the uf system 29 5 vs 23 kpa 3 2 gusb as pre treatment for nutrients and dissolved organic matter removal from the results of nutrients removal figure s2 it can be found that the gusb could be effectively utilized as the pre treatment for water treatment by uf especially for doc removal 77 56 to 80 65 figures s2c and s2f thereafter further analysis was undertaken to distinguish different components of dom in the water samples via eem spectrofluorometry results showed that humic substances in the raw water were almost completely removed after passing through the gusb fig 3 which could ascribe mainly to adsorption sgroi et al 2018 wang and peng 2010 and partially to biodegradation qi et al 2004 at the initial period owing to the biorefractory properties of humic substances steinberg 2013 for smp like substances region iv ex at around 275 nm the peak intensity showed a significant reduction as well in the gusb system from 27 82 to 4 43 a u figs 3a 3d and s5a which could mainly result from the biodegradation siembida losch et al 2015 zheng et al 2010 since the biopolymers was shown not adsorb on gac velten et al 2011 in the membrane tank of the gusb uf system however biopolymers were found to accumulate slightly with the peak intensity increasing to 11 01 a u and this phenomenon was also observed in the uf system figs 3e 3g and s5a in terms of the simple aromatic proteins regions i and ii ex at around 225 nm similar effect was observed in the gusb system as for the smp like materials but their accumulation in the membrane tank was much greater figs 3e 3g and s5b after adopting dmte phase ii the shortened hrt further decreased the fluorescent intensities of both the smp like materials and simple aromatic proteins figs 3j to 3l s5c and s5d additionally the results also revealed a negligible accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank from the fluorescent intensity perspective figs 3m s5c and s5d in contrast the accumulation of simple aromatic proteins in the membrane tank of the uf system can still be obviously identified figs 3o and s5d recalling the development of membrane reversible and irreversible fouling during the second phase the increase rates of tmp in both systems actually did not follow the changing trend revealed by the changes of the fluorescent intensities however the reduction of the dom with fluorescent property might contribute to the reduction of irreversible fouling as shown in the gusb uf system fig 2a it was revealed that the biodegradation of fluorescent compounds involves ring cleavage by hydrolysis turning to non fluorescent substances fuchs et al 2011 therefore it can be understood that parts of the fluorescent biopolymers will turn to non fluorescent substances during the biodegradation these substances could still be high molecular weight organics if the degradation is not completely proceeded e g at lower hrt situation which could still contribute to the membrane fouling hence it can be concluded that the eem spectra alone cannot be fully relied upon to predict the development of membrane fouling and sec analysis was therefore utilized to further interpret the influence of the gusb pre treatment on the presence of uv active biopolymers within the system 3 3 influence of the pre treatment on the mw distribution of the dom as shown in fig 4 a the pre treatment of gusb can significantly reduce the amount of biopolymers passing to the uf membrane the integral area of the spectra between the mw sizes of 100 and 20 kda reduced 66 2 from 5 03 to 1 7 at the bottom with a slight increase to 2 16 in the middle and a decline to 1 87 at the top of the gusb it can be seen that the do concentration sharply decreased from 5 12 0 46 to 1 10 0 16 mg l indicating the transition from oxic to anoxic condition figure s3 the slight increase of biopolymers in the middle of the gusb column may be associated with the reduction of do as it has been shown by several studies that bacteria will secrete more eps to cope with a lower do environment applegate and bryers 1991 gao et al 2011a kim et al 2006 and the transition from aerobic to anoxic phase can also lead to the release of eps from the biofilm hong et al 2007 though the accumulation of biopolymers was found in the membrane tank of both systems the content of biopolymers in the membrane tank of the gusb system was clearly lower than for the uf system 3 29 compared to 6 47 the results were consistent with the development of the tmp in the respective systems since the relatively greater amounts of biopolymers accumulated in the membrane tank of the uf system would be expected to cause a more rapid increase in tmp development compared to the gusb uf system in terms of the low mw dom with mw size 10 kda fig 4b 4d a substantial decrease was observed most likely caused by the reduction of the humic substances however it can also be observed that uf itself can hardly remove these organics with mw size lower than 10 kda which could be ascribed to its high membrane cut off size additionally it can be seen that the dom with mw around 2 kda increased in the middle of the gusb and a new peak around 800 da appeared at the top of the gusb these results further revealed the biodegradation of high mw dom in the gusb system in comparison the adoption of the dmte regime resulted in a relatively different situation regarding the variation of biopolymers in both systems in the uf system the accumulation of biopolymers accounted for 22 6 of their original content in the raw water fig 4c while this value was 28 6 before changing the operation strategy fig 4a furthermore the reduction of biopolymers in the gusb system also decreased when its hrt reduced the content of the biopolymers at the bottom of the gusb only showed a 45 6 decrease compared to a 66 2 decline before adopting the dmte regime fig 4c moreover the biopolymers in the membrane tank of the gusb uf system showed a similar concentration as in the raw water indicating that a shorter hrt of the gusb reduced the degradation of biopolymers due to the insufficient contacting time zheng et al 2010 and therefore reduced in turn the performance of the following uf process for the low mw dom mw 10 kda fig 4d a similar trend was observed as before however no increase of the dom with mw around 2 kda and no extra peak were evident implying that the degradation of high mw biopolymers was less efficient after reducing the hrt 3 4 biopolymer accumulation on the membrane surface and in membrane pores analysis by ftir revealed a similar composition of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the respective systems figure s4b however the amount of smp extracted from the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system was significantly lower than the uf system which was verified by both eem and sec spectra figs 5 a to 5c results also revealed that the content of smp within the biofilm formed on the membrane surface directly determined the development of membrane fouling while the lb and tb eps are less correlated with the development of membrane fouling compared to smp figure s4 this is consistent with a previous study with a membrane bioreactor which claimed that the membrane fouling cake resistance was highly dependent on the content of smp wang et al 2014 the toc concentration of the corresponding organic matter om extracted from the biofilm on the respective membrane surfaces further supported the above analysis fig 5g before extracting the internal pore fouling material the membranes were firstly immersed in di water and ultrasonically treated for 10 min which were then analyzed to examine the comparatively firmly attached dom on the respective membrane surface figs 5d to 5f as shown in fig 5f the amount of detached biopolymers with mw between 30 and 100 kda was found to be higher in the uf system as well as the low mw om mainly comprising humic substances which indirectly reflected the greater accumulation of om on the membrane surface of the uf system moreover the accumulation of humic substances on the membrane surface of the uf system was also directly evident from the photographic images taken after removing the biofilm layer fig 4i pictures were taken at the end of the 1st cycle of phase ii in addition the om extracted from the membrane pores was measured via sec to assess its contribution to the degree of irreversible membrane fouling fig 5j it is evident that both the high mw biopolymers and low mw om within the membrane pores of the uf system were greater than that in the gusb uf system which is consistent with the lower irreversible fouling observed in the gusb uf system 3 5 microbial diversity eps accumulation and biofilm formation on the membrane surface microbial community analysis was utilized to indicate the influence of gusb pre treatment on the microbial diversity of the biofilm formed on the respective membrane surfaces after long term filtration the difference between the microbial diversity of the respective systems is shown by the venn diagram fig 6 a it can be seen that there were 160 and 117 otus confined to uf and gusb uf systems respectively with 344 otus common to two systems this result clearly revealed that the pre treatment of gusb changed the microbial diversity of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface specifically at the phylum level fig 6b proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in both systems and its proportion in the uf system was about 12 higher than the gusb uf system 87 62 4 61 vs 75 90 8 15 however phylum bacteroidetes in the uf system is significant lower than the gusb uf system 1 77 0 35 vs 13 39 7 37 the heat map of the top abundant genera enriched on the membrane surface of the respective systems further illustrated the difference of the bacterial diversity between the two systems fig 6c an unclassified genus and genus acidovorax both belong to the family burkholderiaceae showed great decrease from 29 97 0 73 and 11 93 0 07 to 19 88 3 17 and 3 70 0 39 respectively as revealed in several studies that the family burkholderiaceae plays an important role in biofilm formation and has a strong influence on biofouling development sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 its reduction in gusb uf system is therefore believed to favor the membrane fouling reduction additionally genera caulobacter and brevundimonas both belong to family caulobacteraceae revealed sharp decrement from 4 27 0 04 to 0 31 0 17 and 2 09 0 08 to less than 0 1 these genera are characterized for the holdfast eps or slime like eps secretion and irreversibly adhesion ability on solid surface chellam and xu 2006 sprecher et al 2017 genus singulisphaera belongs to filamentous bacteria with higher smp secretion he et al 2019 pan et al 2010 also showed a significant decrease from 1 66 0 76 to less than 0 01 furthermore the reduction of genus hydrogenophaga from 2 95 0 11 to 0 43 0 02 indicated the decline of the dehydrogenase activity which was reported correlated closely to the secretion of eps wang et al 2017 the decrease of these above mentioned genera is therefore considered to be partial of the reasons behind the fouling alleviation correspondently in the gusb uf system genera of the microbes within the biofilm on the membrane surface was found to shift towards eps or smp utilizing bacteria which could contribute to fouling alleviation for instance an unclassified genus which belongs to family env ops 17 and order sphingobacteriales increased prominently from 0 15 0 03 to 8 17 7 56 and the order sphingobacteriales is known for its wide ranging catabolic capacities for diverse organic substances including smp and eps zhou et al 2019 genera pajaroellobacter and sandaracinus which were reported to have the ability of degrading either cellulose or complex polysaccharides garcia and müller 2014 sharma et al 2016 also showed increase from 0 08 0 01 and 0 03 0 01 to 5 09 0 12 and 2 04 0 01 respectively moreover both genus sphingopyxis and an unclassified genus which belong to family saprospiraceae presented the increment from 0 52 0 04 to 3 18 0 53 and less than 0 01 to 1 11 0 25 respectively these two genera have the similar ability to utilize eps or smp at carbon source limited environment kim et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 clsm was utilized to further visually distinguish the differences between the two systems regarding the accumulation of eps on the membrane surface figs 6d to 6k pictures were taken at the end of phase ii the results showed clearly that proteins and polysaccharides were widely distributed on the membrane surfaces of both systems confirming the presence of fouling in both systems however there were distinct differences in terms of the accumulated eps in the respective systems the polysaccharides that adhered to the membrane surface in the uf system formed larger and denser clusters compared to the gusb uf system figs 6d and 6h which can exhibit significant effects on the filtration resistance wang and li 2008 additionally desmond et al found that greater quantities of polysaccharides can lead to the formation of a denser homogeneous physical structure of the biofilm and a propensity for more severe membrane fouling desmond et al 2018 with respect to the distribution of proteins it was notable that they were more evenly distributed as relatively compact small dots on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system fig 6e whereas larger aggregates of proteins were observed on the membrane surface of the uf system fig 6i similar observations about the presence of eps can be made regarding the accumulated dna on the membrane surface of the respective systems figs 6f and 6j these results clearly indicated that there was less accumulation of eps on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system after the pre treatment by gusb as shown in figs 6g and 6k which was consistent with the character of the microbial diversity of the respective systems above discussed the initial attachment adhesion of biopolymers and or smp on the membrane surface was believed to trigger or facilitate the subsequent biofilm formation based on the results of sem fig 7 the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the uf system appeared more cohesive than the biofilm of the gusb uf system and covered the entire membrane surface implying a greater eps accumulation or secretion by the microbes within the established biofilm layer it has been reported that a higher eps concentration can result in a relatively lower porosity of the biofilm layer kim et al 2006 possibly via filling the void spaces within the formed biofilm meng and yang 2007 and therefore inducing a higher tmp development significantly the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system appears more porous and rough than that in the uf system figs 7c and 7d indicating the glue or bridging effect of biopolymers on biofilm formation yu et al 2019 the comparatively higher porosity can not only reduce the chances of pore blocking by biopolymers but also can enhance water flow through the biofilm and therefore lead to a lower rate of tmp development in addition it was evident that the bacterial colonies propagated on the membrane surface of the uf system were denser than the gusb uf system and existed as clusters figs 7a and 7b which was consistent with the clsm observations illustrated above the cross section of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the respective systems further showed that the average thickness of the biofilm formed in the uf system appeared to be greater than that in the gusb uf system figs 7e and 7f which can be ascribed to the reduction of smp content within the biofilm it is also notable that the inner void spaces of the membrane in gusb uf system were cleaner than the uf system inserts in figs 7e and 7f indicating less accumulation of the foulants in the inner structure of the membrane which also contributed to the lower tmp development 3 6 performance of gusb on nom removal and uf membrane fouling alleviation after long term operation the performance of gusb on nom removal and uf fouling reduction were further evaluated after over one year s operation as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the overall doc removal efficiency only showed a slight reduction 75 16 from 10 13 1 61 to 2 52 0 64 mg l compared to the start up period 77 56 to 80 65 presenting its prominent ability in nom removal this makes gusb a competitive alternative candidate for rapid biofilter if the footprint is not the concern since the toc removal efficiency of rapid biofilter is normally less than 20 terry and summers 2018 it was presumed that the longer residence time endowed the superior performance in nom reduction after long term operation as also shown in a recent study the doc removal efficiency of an engineered biotreatment system with hrt of 0 5 to 1 day reached over 70 when treating secondary effluent influent doc of around 4 0 mg l bang et al 2019 biopolymers reduction in the effluent of gusb after long term operation representing by the contents of polysaccharides 76 reduction from 231 06 6 57 to 56 37 1 25 µg cm2 and proteins 84 reduction from 7 31 0 04 to 1 12 0 03 µg cm2 fig 8a contents were normalized to the uf membrane surface area which further ensured its ability as the pretreatment of uf for fouling reduction results from eem and sec further proved that gusb is efficient in reducing both macromolecular and humic substances figs 8b to 8d thereafter as expected uf flux tests showed the pretreatment via gusb could significantly reduce the fouling propensity with the equalizing flux of 99 96 16 02 and 221 37 16 64 lmh for raw water and gusb effluent respectively after three continuous filtration backwash cycles fig 8e in addition the continuous time vs filtration volume during the uf filtration tests also showed that the decreasing rate of the filtration rate of gusb effluent was much lower than raw water 0 054 vs 0 141 ml s after filtrating 2 l of water samples fig 8f which further implied that gusb could contribute to the lower fouling rate of uf 4 concluding remarks the application of gusb as pre treatment for membrane filtration provides an alternative approach for alleviating membrane fouling the results obtained in this study provide strong evidence that gusb has the capability not only for removing doc from general water quality improvement aspect such as lowering the risk of forming dbps in the subsequent disinfection process but also for reducing the biopolymers which are ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewater effluents and are a significant cause of membrane fouling significantly microbial diversity analysis essentially reveals that the pretreatment of biofiltration shapes the biodiversity of the microbes accumulated on the membrane surface during filtration the subsequent clsm and sem observations further implies that this action could led to the different distribution of biopolymers and structure of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface both of which are deemed to influence the membrane fouling development from long term operation perspective the gusb system also shows its robust performance in nom and uf fouling propensity reduction furthermore no backwash was performed and no clogging issue was observed during the long term operation of gusb revealing its advantage from low maintenance aspect overall this study shows that gusb could be a robust and eco environmental friendly pretreatment for uf which can be utilized for decentralized water purification especially the small or media sized communities in rural areas future works are still necessary to further improve its performance and demonstrate its practical application via long term pilot studies author contributions lei xu nigel graham and wenzheng yu design the experiments lei xu completed

17117,membrane fouling by influent biopolymers and the formation of surface biofilms are major obstacles to the practical application of membrane technologies identifying reliable and sustainable pre treatment methods for membrane filtration remains a considerable challenge and is the subject of continuing research study worldwide herein the performance of a bench scale gravity driven up flow slow biofilter gusb as the pre treatment for ultrafiltration to reduce membrane fouling is presented dissolved organic carbon doc was shown efficiently removed by the gusb around 80 when treating a natural water influent more significantly biopolymers with molecular weight mw between 20 kda and 100 kda were effectively removed 62 8 reduction and this led to a lower rate of transmembrane pressure tmp development by the uf membrane microbial diversity analysis further unraveled the function of gusb in shaping microbes to degrade biopolymers contributing to lower accumulation and different distribution pattern of smp on the membrane surface moreover the biofilm formed on the membrane surface after the pre treatment of gusb was observed to have a relative porous structure compared to the control system which can also affect the fouling development long term operation of gusb further revealed its robust performance in reducing both natural organic matters and uf fouling propensity this study overall has demonstrated the potential advantages of applying a gusb to enhance uf process performance by reducing biofouling and improving effluent quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration biofiltration biopolymers microbial diversity membrane fouling 1 introduction the steadily increasing consumption of water and population growth are increasing the demands on global freshwater resources and the risks of scarcity and insufficient water supply it has been estimated that nearly two thirds of the global population have faced the problem of water shortage during the past several years mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 to address this challenge it is imperative to develop efficient and sustainable methods of drinking water treatment membrane based separation technologies have long been recognized as effective and robust processes for water purification with a much smaller environmental footprint compared to conventional water treatment processes shannon et al 2008 and are gaining increasing popularity in situations of water scarcity and aquatic pollution werber et al 2016 however the propensity for fouling of the membrane after long term operation reduces its effectiveness and sustainability and therefore its suitability in practical applications consequently new approaches to reduce membrane fouling need to be developed to overcome the present limitations and facilitate a greater use of membrane processes in the future for water purification membrane fouling is often associated with biofilm adhesion on the membrane surface where a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps plays a fundamental role in forming the biofilm the eps mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins nucleic acids and amphiphilic polymers giving biofilms a highly sophisticated functional scaffold such as extended interaction gene transfer nutrients capture and tolerance to antimicrobials etc flemming et al 2016 however the accumulation of eps is detrimental to the stable operation of membrane separation contributing to the development of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling specifically it has been revealed by several studies that soluble eps or soluble microbial products smp contribute most to the membrane fouling and these have moderate molecular weights which can be degraded as recycled electron donor substrates laspidou and rittmann 2002 wang et al 2014 wang and li 2008 therefore it is worthwhile exploring an efficient form of membrane pre treatment for smp reduction which by enhancing the membrane performance can increase its applicability and cost effectiveness in water treatment various pre treatment methods have been considered for membrane separation in terms of reducing membrane fouling coagulation for example is the most common pre treatment process for ultrafiltration uf and has long been considered as an efficient pre treatment method for alleviating membrane fouling huang et al 2009 however drawbacks such as inefficient removal of hydrophilic organic matter deng et al 2019 and the production of solid residuals sludges have restricted its practical application pre oxidation disinfection has also been widely adopted as a pre treatment method for mitigating membrane fouling but this also has its disadvantages for instance the dosing of chlorine can potentially increase the production of disinfection by products dbps in the treated drinking water which are of potential concern to human health gao et al 2011b in addition pre treatment with ozone might even exacerbate membrane fouling which depends highly on the properties of the organic components within raw waters yu et al 2017 moreover the long term usage of oxidants could also leads to the potential damage to membrane modules which is a factor that should be considered before practical application huang et al 2009 biofiltration is a green simple and robust pretreatment that particularly suits for decentralized drinking water systems biofiltration relies on the microbes that are indigenous to the feeding water proliferate on the surface of biofilter substrate contributing to the removal of contaminants kirisits et al 2019 natural biofiltration such as riverbank or acquirer filtration quanrud et al 2003 ray et al 2002 zucker et al 2015 and engineered biofiltration for instance the rapid rate filtration azzeh et al 2015 halle et al 2009 pramanik et al 2017 are generally two types of biofiltration systems wildly utilized in drinking water treatment systems for natural biofiltration though it has a better performance in natural organic matters nom removal its application was constrained due to the requirement of large footprint long retention time and specific geological condition which makes the engineered biofiltration a more competitive choice in practical situations nevertheless in another side the rapid rate biofilter with empty bed contact time ebct normally less than 30 min also brings some potential issues like the requirement of regular backwashing to manage headloss accumulation and relatively low nom removal efficiency less than 20 etc de vera et al 2019 peldszus et al 2012 terry and summers 2018 various studies showed that biopolymers could be biodegraded via biofiltration with the removal efficiency for example varied from 20 to 75 azzeh et al 2015 peldszus et al 2012 zheng et al 2010 and as the benefit the uf membrane irreversible fouling was shown to be reduced up to 68 when using biofilter as the pretreatment azzeh et al 2015 rahman et al 2014 very few work correlated the biodegradation of biopolymers via biofiltration with the microbial diversity and the morphology of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface only one previous work indicated that the biofilter fed with chlorinated raw water favoured the growth of obligate bacterial predator on the membrane surface which might contribute to the reduction of biofilm on ro membrane surface and therefore helping to the alleviation of biofouling jeong et al 2017 thus exploring the influence of biofiltration pre treatment on the biofilm formed on the membrane surface would help to further understand its contribution to membrane fouling mitigation herein a gravity driven up flow slow biofilter gusb was developed as the pretreatment of uf to enhance the nom removal and reduce the membrane fouling the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled by the following uf operation through adjusting a downstream peristaltic pump in particular a daily membrane tank emptying dmte strategy i e the membrane tank was emptied every 24 hrs during the phase ii stage with the consequent reduction of the hrt of the gusb was examined this was utilized to explore whether the accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank can be physically avoided and the influence of the shortened hrt on the removal of biopolymers special focus was put on the variation of the amount of biopolymers within the gusb system along the depth and the influence of gusb pretreatment on the microbial diversity and morphology of biofilm formed on the membrane surface both of which are deemed to directly determine the development of membrane fouling at the end the performance of the gusb on the nom removal including the biopolymers and the consequent uf fouling reduction was further evaluated after over one year s operation of the biofilter overall this study gave some further insights into the uf fouling alleviation through the biofiltration pretreatment and showed a feasible and promising strategy of biofiltration pretreatment i e the gusb especially for the small scale decentralized membrane based water purification process 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale uf and gusb uf systems set up and operation two parallel lab scale uf units hollow fiber uf membrane with cut off size of around 100 kda motimo membrane technology co ltd china were assembled based on our previous study yu et al 2019 one of the units treated the natural water sourced from a local lake directly olympic park beijing china and the other utilized a lab scale gusb as the pre treatment before the uf filtration to investigate its influence on the development of membrane fouling fig 1 the lab scale gusb was based on a plexiglass column with the dimensions of ϕ100 600 mm zeolite with an average particle size of 10 15 mm was used as the main substrate and the net liquid volume of the gusb was approximately 1 75 l gac granular activated carbon average particle size of 3 5 mm layers each with a depth of 30 50 mm were located on the top or sandwiched among the zeolite substrate to enhance the treatment efficiency the adsorptive capacities of zeolite and gac for doc in natural water can be found in supplementary information si figure s1 the distances of each gac layer top from the bottom of the zeolite were 100 250 400 and 500 mm respectively sampling ports of the gusb unit were located immediately after each gac layer termed as the bottom middle and top sampling port each uf unit was based on a membrane module of 1 1 mm ϕ pvdf hollow fibres with a total surface area of 0 0073 m2 in order to reduce the membrane fouling rate and minimize the volume of backwashing water both uf units operated on a cycle of 30 min filtration at a constant flux 10 lmh which corresponded to a flow rate of around 1 22 ml min and 1 min rest with simultaneous aeration 100 l h below the uf membrane modules the filtration flux of uf corresponded to the hrt of the gusb of approximately 1 day 1750 ml 24 h d 60 min h 1 22 ml min and the normalized filtration flux of the gusb is around 223 l m2 d the trans membrane pressure tmp of each uf unit was measured via an online pressure gage before the uf operation the gusb was continuously fed with the lake water with hrt of 1 day for 3 weeks in order to pre stabilize its performance 2 2 water quality analysis water sampled from the gusb

vwp shimadzu japan inorganic nutrients nh4 n and po4 3 p were quantified according to the apha standard methods and dissolved oxygen do ph and conductivity were measured using the respective laboratory meter mettler toledo usa eps extracted from the biofilm accumulated on the respective membrane surface or organic matter extracted from the membrane pores was also characterized by sec and eem details of the extraction methods were based on our previous work yu et al 2014b and can be found in supplementary information water samples from the respective membrane tanks and raw water were freeze dried and analysed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectrum two perkinelmer usa with quest atr accessory to elucidate details of the chemical bonding of organic constituents all the analyses involved at least duplicate measurements in order to ensure reproducibility of the results 2 3 dna extraction and microbial community analysis at the end of the membrane operation the membrane modules in respective systems were carefully taken out two membrane fibers duplicate samples each of 10 0 cm were cut off from the respective modules by sterilized scissors and immediately stored in sterilized centrifuge tubes at 20 c before further processing the biofilm on the respective membrane fibers were used for the microbial diversity analysis and the total genome dna was extracted as described in our previous study xu et al 2020 briefly dna was extracted using proteinase k and sds based lysis then purified with dna clean concentrator 25 kit zymo research usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the extracted dna was stored at 20 c until pcr amplification for microbial community analysis the 16s rrna v3 v4 regions were amplified using a specific primer with a barcode for high throughput sequencing thereafter the effective sequences obtained were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using uparse pipeline at similarity cutoff of 0 97 and the taxonomic classification was performed with the representative sequences of each otu through ribosomal database project rdp classifier against the silva database at the confidence threshold of 0 7 the venn diagram and heat map were constructed using r 2 4 membrane characterization at the end of the experiment the fouled uf modules of the respective systems were carefully taken out from the membrane tank and cut into several pieces for further analyses the fouled membranes after biofilm formation were also freeze dried and analysed by ftir confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm tcs sp5 leica germany was utilized to visualize the distribution of polysaccharides proteins and cells within the biofilm formed on the surface of the membrane using the methods as described in our previous work yu et al 2014a before scanning electron microscopy sem observations the fouled membrane pieces from the respective system were immersed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight and treated with gradient alcohol 10 30 50 70 90 and 100 each for 10 min for dehydration before they were dried the samples were then platinum coated by a sputter and observed under a field scanning electron microscope fsem su8000 hitachi japan 2 5 batch mode uf flux and fouling propensity tests after over one year s operation of the gusb from may 2019 to oct 2020 hrt maintained at 1 d after the continuous filtration experiment as described above its performance on uf fouling alleviation was further evaluated via batch mode flux tests flux and flux recovery were used to evaluate uf membrane fouling propensity as per our previous study yu et al 2018 briefly the filtration experiments were undertaken using flat sheet 76 mm diameter membranes in a laboratory pressure filtration system millipore amicon 8400 usa employing nitrogen gas as the means for obtaining a stable applied pressure 1 bar a digital balance ml3002 mettler toledo international inc usa was used to automatically weight the filtered water in real time by the data acquisition software raw water and the effluent of gusb were used as the test solutions to evaluate their fouling propensity prior to each test the pvdf uf membrane 100 kda was placed in di water for at least 24 h to remove impurities and production residues the initial flux of all the tested uf membranes was checked through the filtration of the di water under 1 0 bar and the membranes with the similar initial flux were chosen for the fouling tests in addition doc removal efficiency of the gusb system after long term operation was also examined to evaluate the stability of the system regarding its ability in nom removal biopolymers representing by polysaccharides and proteins intercepted by the uf membrane after filtrating 2 l of water samples raw water and gusb effluent respectively were quantified to obtain their removal efficiency via gusb treatment using methods as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of gusb on tmp development to examine the influence of utilizing a gusb as the pre treatment for uf the development of tmp was monitored throughout the experimental period as shown in fig 2 a the overall operation can be divided into two phases with phase i being from day 1 to day 27 hrt of 1 d and phase ii hrt of 0 5 d for another two weeks during the first phase it was evident that the differences in the tmp development between the two systems were not significant at the beginning and revealed a gradually widening trend thereafter this could be ascribed to the immaturely formed biofilms in the biofilter which usually takes a few months to reach a steady state and its ability to alleviate membrane fouling can be realized once the biofilms maturely formed specifically the increase rates of tmp development in the gusb uf system from the second week to the fourth week were 2 38 1 93 and 2 33 kpa d respectively while the corresponding values of the uf system were clearly greater which are 3 5 4 29 and 4 17 kpa d respectively it is also noteworthy that the irreversible fouling of the gusb uf system was also lower than the uf system after the four weeks of operation 16 vs 20 5 kpa for the second phase the rate of tmp development in the uf system showed a slight decrease from 3 21 to 3 1 kpa d in the fifth and sixth week respectively indicating a marginally improved performance after dmte however the behavior of the gusb uf system was somewhat different during the first week of the second phase the rate of tmp development was still low 1 64 kpa d but subsequently increased to 2 31 kpa d in the following week therefore it can be concluded that the dmte can slightly reduce the accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank which are believed to be the main cause of membrane fouling desmond et al 2018 howe and clark 2002 however the reduction of hrt of the gusb did not have a positive impact on fouling control possibly due to the insufficient contact time for biodegradation of biopolymers in the gusb in addition it was revealed that both nom like humic substance and the interactions between nom and biopolymers could also cause severe membrane fouling kim and dempsey 2013 myat et al 2014 therefore the slight increase of the doc in gusb effluent in phase ii from 1 09 0 28 to 1 39 0 28 mg l figure s1 could also induce a higher fouling development at the end of the operation i e the end of phase ii the surface morphology of the membrane from the respective systems after the removal of the biofouling layer using high pressure tap water and sponge was observed using sem compared to a blank pvdf membrane fig 2b the surface of the fouled membrane from both systems were clearly changed by the adhesion of foulant material in particular the foulants left on the membrane surface of the uf system fig 2d appeared to be denser than those of the gusb uf system fig 2c and clearly blocking most of the membrane pores this result was consistent with the higher irreversible fouling demonstrated by the uf system 29 5 vs 23 kpa 3 2 gusb as pre treatment for nutrients and dissolved organic matter removal from the results of nutrients removal figure s2 it can be found that the gusb could be effectively utilized as the pre treatment for water treatment by uf especially for doc removal 77 56 to 80 65 figures s2c and s2f thereafter further analysis was undertaken to distinguish different components of dom in the water samples via eem spectrofluorometry results showed that humic substances in the raw water were almost completely removed after passing through the gusb fig 3 which could ascribe mainly to adsorption sgroi et al 2018 wang and peng 2010 and partially to biodegradation qi et al 2004 at the initial period owing to the biorefractory properties of humic substances steinberg 2013 for smp like substances region iv ex at around 275 nm the peak intensity showed a significant reduction as well in the gusb system from 27 82 to 4 43 a u figs 3a 3d and s5a which could mainly result from the biodegradation siembida losch et al 2015 zheng et al 2010 since the biopolymers was shown not adsorb on gac velten et al 2011 in the membrane tank of the gusb uf system however biopolymers were found to accumulate slightly with the peak intensity increasing to 11 01 a u and this phenomenon was also observed in the uf system figs 3e 3g and s5a in terms of the simple aromatic proteins regions i and ii ex at around 225 nm similar effect was observed in the gusb system as for the smp like materials but their accumulation in the membrane tank was much greater figs 3e 3g and s5b after adopting dmte phase ii the shortened hrt further decreased the fluorescent intensities of both the smp like materials and simple aromatic proteins figs 3j to 3l s5c and s5d additionally the results also revealed a negligible accumulation of biopolymers in the membrane tank from the fluorescent intensity perspective figs 3m s5c and s5d in contrast the accumulation of simple aromatic proteins in the membrane tank of the uf system can still be obviously identified figs 3o and s5d recalling the development of membrane reversible and irreversible fouling during the second phase the increase rates of tmp in both systems actually did not follow the changing trend revealed by the changes of the fluorescent intensities however the reduction of the dom with fluorescent property might contribute to the reduction of irreversible fouling as shown in the gusb uf system fig 2a it was revealed that the biodegradation of fluorescent compounds involves ring cleavage by hydrolysis turning to non fluorescent substances fuchs et al 2011 therefore it can be understood that parts of the fluorescent biopolymers will turn to non fluorescent substances during the biodegradation these substances could still be high molecular weight organics if the degradation is not completely proceeded e g at lower hrt situation which could still contribute to the membrane fouling hence it can be concluded that the eem spectra alone cannot be fully relied upon to predict the development of membrane fouling and sec analysis was therefore utilized to further interpret the influence of the gusb pre treatment on the presence of uv active biopolymers within the system 3 3 influence of the pre treatment on the mw distribution of the dom as shown in fig 4 a the pre treatment of gusb can significantly reduce the amount of biopolymers passing to the uf membrane the integral area of the spectra between the mw sizes of 100 and 20 kda reduced 66 2 from 5 03 to 1 7 at the bottom with a slight increase to 2 16 in the middle and a decline to 1 87 at the top of the gusb it can be seen that the do concentration sharply decreased from 5 12 0 46 to 1 10 0 16 mg l indicating the transition from oxic to anoxic condition figure s3 the slight increase of biopolymers in the middle of the gusb column may be associated with the reduction of do as it has been shown by several studies that bacteria will secrete more eps to cope with a lower do environment applegate and bryers 1991 gao et al 2011a kim et al 2006 and the transition from aerobic to anoxic phase can also lead to the release of eps from the biofilm hong et al 2007 though the accumulation of biopolymers was found in the membrane tank of both systems the content of biopolymers in the membrane tank of the gusb system was clearly lower than for the uf system 3 29 compared to 6 47 the results were consistent with the development of the tmp in the respective systems since the relatively greater amounts of biopolymers accumulated in the membrane tank of the uf system would be expected to cause a more rapid increase in tmp development compared to the gusb uf system in terms of the low mw dom with mw size 10 kda fig 4b 4d a substantial decrease was observed most likely caused by the reduction of the humic substances however it can also be observed that uf itself can hardly remove these organics with mw size lower than 10 kda which could be ascribed to its high membrane cut off size additionally it can be seen that the dom with mw around 2 kda increased in the middle of the gusb and a new peak around 800 da appeared at the top of the gusb these results further revealed the biodegradation of high mw dom in the gusb system in comparison the adoption of the dmte regime resulted in a relatively different situation regarding the variation of biopolymers in both systems in the uf system the accumulation of biopolymers accounted for 22 6 of their original content in the raw water fig 4c while this value was 28 6 before changing the operation strategy fig 4a furthermore the reduction of biopolymers in the gusb system also decreased when its hrt reduced the content of the biopolymers at the bottom of the gusb only showed a 45 6 decrease compared to a 66 2 decline before adopting the dmte regime fig 4c moreover the biopolymers in the membrane tank of the gusb uf system showed a similar concentration as in the raw water indicating that a shorter hrt of the gusb reduced the degradation of biopolymers due to the insufficient contacting time zheng et al 2010 and therefore reduced in turn the performance of the following uf process for the low mw dom mw 10 kda fig 4d a similar trend was observed as before however no increase of the dom with mw around 2 kda and no extra peak were evident implying that the degradation of high mw biopolymers was less efficient after reducing the hrt 3 4 biopolymer accumulation on the membrane surface and in membrane pores analysis by ftir revealed a similar composition of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the respective systems figure s4b however the amount of smp extracted from the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system was significantly lower than the uf system which was verified by both eem and sec spectra figs 5 a to 5c results also revealed that the content of smp within the biofilm formed on the membrane surface directly determined the development of membrane fouling while the lb and tb eps are less correlated with the development of membrane fouling compared to smp figure s4 this is consistent with a previous study with a membrane bioreactor which claimed that the membrane fouling cake resistance was highly dependent on the content of smp wang et al 2014 the toc concentration of the corresponding organic matter om extracted from the biofilm on the respective membrane surfaces further supported the above analysis fig 5g before extracting the internal pore fouling material the membranes were firstly immersed in di water and ultrasonically treated for 10 min which were then analyzed to examine the comparatively firmly attached dom on the respective membrane surface figs 5d to 5f as shown in fig 5f the amount of detached biopolymers with mw between 30 and 100 kda was found to be higher in the uf system as well as the low mw om mainly comprising humic substances which indirectly reflected the greater accumulation of om on the membrane surface of the uf system moreover the accumulation of humic substances on the membrane surface of the uf system was also directly evident from the photographic images taken after removing the biofilm layer fig 4i pictures were taken at the end of the 1st cycle of phase ii in addition the om extracted from the membrane pores was measured via sec to assess its contribution to the degree of irreversible membrane fouling fig 5j it is evident that both the high mw biopolymers and low mw om within the membrane pores of the uf system were greater than that in the gusb uf system which is consistent with the lower irreversible fouling observed in the gusb uf system 3 5 microbial diversity eps accumulation and biofilm formation on the membrane surface microbial community analysis was utilized to indicate the influence of gusb pre treatment on the microbial diversity of the biofilm formed on the respective membrane surfaces after long term filtration the difference between the microbial diversity of the respective systems is shown by the venn diagram fig 6 a it can be seen that there were 160 and 117 otus confined to uf and gusb uf systems respectively with 344 otus common to two systems this result clearly revealed that the pre treatment of gusb changed the microbial diversity of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface specifically at the phylum level fig 6b proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in both systems and its proportion in the uf system was about 12 higher than the gusb uf system 87 62 4 61 vs 75 90 8 15 however phylum bacteroidetes in the uf system is significant lower than the gusb uf system 1 77 0 35 vs 13 39 7 37 the heat map of the top abundant genera enriched on the membrane surface of the respective systems further illustrated the difference of the bacterial diversity between the two systems fig 6c an unclassified genus and genus acidovorax both belong to the family burkholderiaceae showed great decrease from 29 97 0 73 and 11 93 0 07 to 19 88 3 17 and 3 70 0 39 respectively as revealed in several studies that the family burkholderiaceae plays an important role in biofilm formation and has a strong influence on biofouling development sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 its reduction in gusb uf system is therefore believed to favor the membrane fouling reduction additionally genera caulobacter and brevundimonas both belong to family caulobacteraceae revealed sharp decrement from 4 27 0 04 to 0 31 0 17 and 2 09 0 08 to less than 0 1 these genera are characterized for the holdfast eps or slime like eps secretion and irreversibly adhesion ability on solid surface chellam and xu 2006 sprecher et al 2017 genus singulisphaera belongs to filamentous bacteria with higher smp secretion he et al 2019 pan et al 2010 also showed a significant decrease from 1 66 0 76 to less than 0 01 furthermore the reduction of genus hydrogenophaga from 2 95 0 11 to 0 43 0 02 indicated the decline of the dehydrogenase activity which was reported correlated closely to the secretion of eps wang et al 2017 the decrease of these above mentioned genera is therefore considered to be partial of the reasons behind the fouling alleviation correspondently in the gusb uf system genera of the microbes within the biofilm on the membrane surface was found to shift towards eps or smp utilizing bacteria which could contribute to fouling alleviation for instance an unclassified genus which belongs to family env ops 17 and order sphingobacteriales increased prominently from 0 15 0 03 to 8 17 7 56 and the order sphingobacteriales is known for its wide ranging catabolic capacities for diverse organic substances including smp and eps zhou et al 2019 genera pajaroellobacter and sandaracinus which were reported to have the ability of degrading either cellulose or complex polysaccharides garcia and müller 2014 sharma et al 2016 also showed increase from 0 08 0 01 and 0 03 0 01 to 5 09 0 12 and 2 04 0 01 respectively moreover both genus sphingopyxis and an unclassified genus which belong to family saprospiraceae presented the increment from 0 52 0 04 to 3 18 0 53 and less than 0 01 to 1 11 0 25 respectively these two genera have the similar ability to utilize eps or smp at carbon source limited environment kim et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 clsm was utilized to further visually distinguish the differences between the two systems regarding the accumulation of eps on the membrane surface figs 6d to 6k pictures were taken at the end of phase ii the results showed clearly that proteins and polysaccharides were widely distributed on the membrane surfaces of both systems confirming the presence of fouling in both systems however there were distinct differences in terms of the accumulated eps in the respective systems the polysaccharides that adhered to the membrane surface in the uf system formed larger and denser clusters compared to the gusb uf system figs 6d and 6h which can exhibit significant effects on the filtration resistance wang and li 2008 additionally desmond et al found that greater quantities of polysaccharides can lead to the formation of a denser homogeneous physical structure of the biofilm and a propensity for more severe membrane fouling desmond et al 2018 with respect to the distribution of proteins it was notable that they were more evenly distributed as relatively compact small dots on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system fig 6e whereas larger aggregates of proteins were observed on the membrane surface of the uf system fig 6i similar observations about the presence of eps can be made regarding the accumulated dna on the membrane surface of the respective systems figs 6f and 6j these results clearly indicated that there was less accumulation of eps on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system after the pre treatment by gusb as shown in figs 6g and 6k which was consistent with the character of the microbial diversity of the respective systems above discussed the initial attachment adhesion of biopolymers and or smp on the membrane surface was believed to trigger or facilitate the subsequent biofilm formation based on the results of sem fig 7 the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the uf system appeared more cohesive than the biofilm of the gusb uf system and covered the entire membrane surface implying a greater eps accumulation or secretion by the microbes within the established biofilm layer it has been reported that a higher eps concentration can result in a relatively lower porosity of the biofilm layer kim et al 2006 possibly via filling the void spaces within the formed biofilm meng and yang 2007 and therefore inducing a higher tmp development significantly the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the gusb uf system appears more porous and rough than that in the uf system figs 7c and 7d indicating the glue or bridging effect of biopolymers on biofilm formation yu et al 2019 the comparatively higher porosity can not only reduce the chances of pore blocking by biopolymers but also can enhance water flow through the biofilm and therefore lead to a lower rate of tmp development in addition it was evident that the bacterial colonies propagated on the membrane surface of the uf system were denser than the gusb uf system and existed as clusters figs 7a and 7b which was consistent with the clsm observations illustrated above the cross section of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface of the respective systems further showed that the average thickness of the biofilm formed in the uf system appeared to be greater than that in the gusb uf system figs 7e and 7f which can be ascribed to the reduction of smp content within the biofilm it is also notable that the inner void spaces of the membrane in gusb uf system were cleaner than the uf system inserts in figs 7e and 7f indicating less accumulation of the foulants in the inner structure of the membrane which also contributed to the lower tmp development 3 6 performance of gusb on nom removal and uf membrane fouling alleviation after long term operation the performance of gusb on nom removal and uf fouling reduction were further evaluated after over one year s operation as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the overall doc removal efficiency only showed a slight reduction 75 16 from 10 13 1 61 to 2 52 0 64 mg l compared to the start up period 77 56 to 80 65 presenting its prominent ability in nom removal this makes gusb a competitive alternative candidate for rapid biofilter if the footprint is not the concern since the toc removal efficiency of rapid biofilter is normally less than 20 terry and summers 2018 it was presumed that the longer residence time endowed the superior performance in nom reduction after long term operation as also shown in a recent study the doc removal efficiency of an engineered biotreatment system with hrt of 0 5 to 1 day reached over 70 when treating secondary effluent influent doc of around 4 0 mg l bang et al 2019 biopolymers reduction in the effluent of gusb after long term operation representing by the contents of polysaccharides 76 reduction from 231 06 6 57 to 56 37 1 25 µg cm2 and proteins 84 reduction from 7 31 0 04 to 1 12 0 03 µg cm2 fig 8a contents were normalized to the uf membrane surface area which further ensured its ability as the pretreatment of uf for fouling reduction results from eem and sec further proved that gusb is efficient in reducing both macromolecular and humic substances figs 8b to 8d thereafter as expected uf flux tests showed the pretreatment via gusb could significantly reduce the fouling propensity with the equalizing flux of 99 96 16 02 and 221 37 16 64 lmh for raw water and gusb effluent respectively after three continuous filtration backwash cycles fig 8e in addition the continuous time vs filtration volume during the uf filtration tests also showed that the decreasing rate of the filtration rate of gusb effluent was much lower than raw water 0 054 vs 0 141 ml s after filtrating 2 l of water samples fig 8f which further implied that gusb could contribute to the lower fouling rate of uf 4 concluding remarks the application of gusb as pre treatment for membrane filtration provides an alternative approach for alleviating membrane fouling the results obtained in this study provide strong evidence that gusb has the capability not only for removing doc from general water quality improvement aspect such as lowering the risk of forming dbps in the subsequent disinfection process but also for reducing the biopolymers which are ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewater effluents and are a significant cause of membrane fouling significantly microbial diversity analysis essentially reveals that the pretreatment of biofiltration shapes the biodiversity of the microbes accumulated on the membrane surface during filtration the subsequent clsm and sem observations further implies that this action could led to the different distribution of biopolymers and structure of the biofilm formed on the membrane surface both of which are deemed to influence the membrane fouling development from long term operation perspective the gusb system also shows its robust performance in nom and uf fouling propensity reduction furthermore no backwash was performed and no clogging issue was observed during the long term operation of gusb revealing its advantage from low maintenance aspect overall this study shows that gusb could be a robust and eco environmental friendly pretreatment for uf which can be utilized for decentralized water purification especially the small or media sized communities in rural areas future works are still necessary to further improve its performance and demonstrate its practical application via long term pilot studies author contributions lei xu nigel graham and wenzheng yu design the experiments lei xu completed

17118,the emergence of next generation sequencing ngs is revolutionizing the potential to address complex microbiological challenges in the water industry ngs technologies can provide holistic insight into microbial communities and their functional capacities in water and wastewater systems thus eliminating the need to develop a new assay for each target organism or gene however several barriers have hampered wide scale adoption of ngs by the water industry including cost need for specialized expertise and equipment challenges with data analysis and interpretation lack of standardized methods and the rapid pace of development of new technologies in this critical review we provide an overview of the current state of the science of ngs technologies as they apply to water wastewater and recycled water in addition a systematic literature review was conducted in which we identified over 600 peer reviewed journal articles on this topic and summarized their contributions to six key areas relevant to the water and wastewater fields taxonomic classification and pathogen detection functional and catabolic gene characterization antimicrobial resistance amr profiling bacterial toxicity characterization cyanobacteria and harmful algal bloom identification and virus characterization for each application we have presented key trends noteworthy advancements and proposed future

sequencing drinking water wastewater water reuse metagenomics metatranscriptomics introduction drinking water sources such as lakes and rivers treated drinking water and wastewater are all complex environments that span a range of water qualities in addition to being defined by variable physicochemical water quality characteristics these waters each comprise a rich and diverse microbial ecosystem even treated drinking water contains multitudes of microorganisms with 103 105 cells ml 1 typically detected in the water column hammes et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 vital et al 2012 and 106 1011 cells cm 2 lining distribution system pipe walls in biofilms morvay et al 2011 zacheus et al 2001 understanding the composition of the microbial communities in these waters can be beneficial for detecting pathogens and improving our understanding of their ecological niches tracking changes in the abundance of organisms responsible for adverse effects such as corrosion or biofouling and characterizing the assemblages of microbiota responsible for degradation of contaminants and microbial substrates in treatment processes while monitoring of water sources and systems remains heavily reliant on culture based approaches for enumeration of pathogenic bacteria and indicator organisms these methods often vastly underestimate true microbial numbers failing to detect viable but non culturable vbnc cells slow growing phenotypes and organisms for which the nutritional requirements and environmental niches are not easily replicated in a laboratory setting alleron et al 2008 byrd et al 1991 staley 1985 the use of targeted molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has become prevalent but requires a priori knowledge of organisms of interest while offering little insight into overall microbial community dynamics the emergence of next generation sequencing ngs technologies is revolutionizing the use of molecular techniques for understanding complex microbial communities however the application of ngs in the water sector has been somewhat limited due to cost need for specialized expertise and equipment challenges with data analysis and interpretation lack of standardized methods and the rapid pace of new technological developments given the immense potential of ngs for improving our understanding of complex microbial communities in water and wastewater effort is needed to overcome these obstacles and make ngs technologies accessible to water professionals the objectives of this critical review are to 1 provide an overview of existing and emerging ngs technologies relevant to water and wastewater 2 synthesize published literature to assess the current state of the science for their application towards addressing key needs in the water sector and 3 identify needs for additional research and standards development that can promote the value and application of ngs more broadly in water and wastewater contexts the development of resources to support application of ngs more broadly not only by researchers but also by utilities and regulators is critical to facilitate advances towards understanding and tackling a wide array of grand challenges in providing preserving and protecting a clean and sustainable water supply ngs technologies ngs is used to describe a variety of high throughput nucleic acid i e deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna sequencing technologies which now make it possible to directly and rapidly recover millions of dna or rna sequences from environmental samples shokralla et al 2012 ngs is a major advancement relative to the traditional first generation sequencing technology i e sanger sequencing which generates single sequences at a time at as much as two orders of magnitude higher cost per base pair bp niedringhaus et al 2011 short read sequencing technologies the majority of ngs studies published to date in the water and wastewater fields rely on the use of short read sequencing technologies primarily those marketed by illumina inc san diego ca studies relying on short read sequencing have also utilized other platforms including ion torrent semiconductor sequencing thermo fisher scientific inc and 454 pyrosequencing roche inc though the latter platform was discontinued in 2016 illumina sequencing produces millions or even billions of reads in each run ranging in length from 50 600 bp in this approach genomic dna or complementary dna cdna in the case of rna sequencing is fragmented or gene regions amplified and adapters are used to tether short dna fragments to the solid surface of a flow cell bridge amplification pcr serves to generate millions of copies of each dna fragment tethered to a solid surface resulting in the formation of millions of clusters the sequencing surface is flooded sequentially and repeatedly with each of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates dntps i e adenine a thymine t guanine g cytosine c and as dntps complementary to the first available position in a single stranded template are incorporated fluorescent signals are emitted shendure and ji 2008 detection of fluorescent signals or lack thereof as is the case when dgtps are incorporated on newer illumina models unique to each dntp is used to generate a sequence corresponding to each cluster the ion torrent family of sequencing technologies also produces short read sequencing data but rather than detecting a fluorescent signal the instrument records base calls by detecting a change in ph that occurs upon nucleotide incorporation wanger et al 2017 instead of tethering dna fragments to a solid substrate to form clusters each template dna strand is tethered to a bead and amplified via emulsion pcr each bead is then loaded into a microwell on a chip with each well producing one of millions of reads short read sequencing technologies are advantageous because they are massively high throughput capable of producing millions of sequences for a single sample and accurate with researchers documenting 0 26 0 80 of base calls being erroneous on illumina and 1 71 on ion torrent instruments quail et al 2012 this ability to generate millions of sequences for each sample is critical if metagenomics is to be used to randomly subsample a mixed microbial community and obtain representative profiles of its composition the primary disadvantages associated with short read sequencing technologies are the inability to generate longer reads and cost analysis of short reads is limited in the ability to understand the context of sequenced genes for example often making it impossible to identify the organism of origin for a gene while the cost to generate sequencing data on a per base basis has plummeted from over 5000 per megabase mb in 2001 to just 0 01 per mb in 2015 dna sequencing costs data 2018 the cost of preparing dna for sequencing and of generating sufficient data to be representative of a complex microbial community can still be quite expensive and is often a barrier to adopting the technology long read sequencing while short read sequencing technologies have dominated the scientific literature with respect to water wastewater and other environmental applications single molecule long read sequencing a k a third generation sequencing is emerging as a powerful alternative the key advantage of long read sequencing methods is that they generate extremely long reads often producing dna sequences exceeding 20 kilobases kb in length ardui et al 2018 the ability to generate long reads is particularly valuable for sequencing genomes mobile genetic elements and entire operons without the need for assembly long reads are especially critical for understanding gene context and ascertaining with higher certainty from which organism a gene originates or which other genes flank a gene of interest further the ability of long read systems to sequence a single dna molecule eliminates the need for amplification steps such as pcr and associated biases two platforms dominate the long read market pacific biosciences inc and oxford nanopore while pacific biosciences offers a traditional lab based instrument oxford nanopore has developed a range of platforms including highly portable sequencing platforms that can be easily transported and operated on site the key disadvantage of long read sequencing methods is that they often have error rates as high as 5 13 ardui et al 2018 batovska et al 2017 limiting the ability to detect gene mutations or characterize hypervariable regions using these methods however adaptations to long read sequencing have been developed such as circular consensus sequencing that can vastly improve the accuracy of these methods with an average of 99 8 accuracy reported wenger et al 2019 additionally in december 2020 oxford nanopore introduced improvements to their promethion flow cells reported to have an accuracy as high as 99 1 oxford nanopore technologies 2020 while long read sequencing technologies have historically yielded shallower sequencing depths than short read platforms judge et al 2015 kranz et al 2017 recent advances have substantially improved long read output with the recent promethion advancements reporting outputs as high as 10 terabases oxford nanopore technologies 2020 ngs methodologies the application of ngs technologies relevant to the water industry generally can be classified into four subcategories whole genome sequencing wgs metagenomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing and targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions i e amplicon sequencing while there are numerous approaches in practice an example workflow for each ngs approach is presented in fig 1 whole genome sequencing wgs is a powerful means of characterizing microorganisms that have been isolated via culture based methods once isolated as a pure culture dna is extracted and sequenced typically via short read shotgun sequencing approaches short read data sets are then assembled to construct the whole genome sequence using either de novo or guided assembly de novo relies on assembling short reads to create full sequences without using a template while guided assembly maps reads to a specified reference genome ng and kirkness 2010 in cases where an organism has not been previously sequenced or when the species of the isolate is unknown as is often the case with isolates obtained from complex water and wastewater communities de novo assembly must be used de novo assembly is computationally challenging but several open source tools have been developed to facilitate this need such as idba ud peng et al 2012 spades bankevich et al 2012 velvet zerbino and birney 2008 and megahit li et al 2015a among others the principal disadvantage of short read sequencing technologies for wgs is that enrichment of the target organism in pure culture is typically required to generate sufficient uncontaminated dna for sequencing while wgs has typically relied on isolation culture and short read sequencing technologies the emergence of long read sequencing platforms capable of generating the sequence of a single dna molecule may advance and simplify wgs in the future shapiro et al 2013 use of these long read technologies is also advancing the field of wgs by providing greater genome coverage than short read technologies wgs has been applied extensively in the water and wastewater field to track sources of drinking water outbreaks garner et al 2019a raphael et al 2016 as well as to identify catabolic pathways associated with nutrient removal chao et al 2016 meng et al 2019 metagenomic sequencing metagenomic sequencing also known as shotgun metagenomic sequencing refers to the random subsampling and sequencing of genetic material from an environmental sample or other mixed community schloss and handelsman 2005 this approach has grown rapidly in its application to examining microbial communities and their functional capacities in water and wastewater typically relying on short read sequencing technologies reads are annotated to genes in existing databases to determine their taxonomic origin or putative functions for example metagenomics is now commonly applied to identify antibiotic resistance genes args garner et al 2018a stamps and spear 2020 zhang et al 2015 genes associated with nitrification and denitrification in wastewater cai et al 2016 ye et al 2012 catabolic genes involved in biodegradation folch mallol et al

from within a mixed community cui et al 2019 kumaraswamy et al 2014 li et al 2015a saleem et al 2018 metagenomics is also increasingly used to support the assembly of complete or partial genomes from short read sequencing data generated from uncultured microbial communities i e metagenomic assembled genomes mags alneberg et al 2018 handley et al 2014 while short read sequencing is common in metagenomic sequencing use of long read sequencing is also emerging e g driscoll et al 2017 metatranscriptomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing relies on principles similar to metagenomic sequencing but targets rna rather than dna rna sequencing is especially key for identifying rna viruses e g sars cov 2 although this is typically still referred to as metagenomics because it targets rna genomes rather than mrna transcripts metatranscriptomics also can be applied to directly sequence rna transcripts and thus yield greater insight into microbial activity than metagenomics for example targeting messenger rna mrna provides direct information about which genes are actually being expressed carvalhais et al 2012 sequencing transcribed mrna can similarly provide a picture of which microbes are functionally active however it is important to recognize that metatranscriptomics is often hampered by the fact that rna degrades rapidly in environmental samples degradation rates may differ among species making preservation and analysis of mrna challenging pascault et al 2014 and large technical and biological variation is often observed in metatranscriptomics datasets tsementzi et al 2014 approaches for preservation of rna have been applied to help reduce decay in sensitive samples for subsequent analysis kohl et al 2017 tap et al 2019 an excess of ribosomal rna rrna in transcriptomes also creates challenges in characterizing mrna in environmental samples thus application of methods that deplete rrna prior to sequencing are of great value in generating high quality mrna datasets he et al 2010 due in part to these challenges the application of metatranscriptomics has been limited relative to methods that target dna in full scale water and wastewater systems targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions or amplicon sequencing relies on polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of a gene of interest followed by short read sequencing of the product most commonly this approach is applied to the 16s rrna gene which is universal to bacteria and archaea to determine the phylogeny i e evolutionary lineage or taxonomy of the members of the microbial community caporaso et al 2011 the method relies on the use of primers for pcr amplification that target highly conserved regions of the target gene but capture sufficient hypervariable regions to distinguish various forms of genes typically reads will be clustered based on similarity into operational taxonomic units or sequence variants and compared to existing databases to determine taxonomy although amplicon sequencing is powerful for resolving phylogenetic and taxonomic variation among members of microbial communities such approaches as applied to the 16s rrna gene are still most accurate at the phylum class and order levels with the ability to differentiate between microbes at the family genus species or strain level often limited amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes is often used to understand overarching shifts in microbial communities such as disturbances succession and temporal trends similar approaches have also been used to identify waterborne eukaryotes e g amoebae and protozoa by targeting the 18s rrna gene bradley et al 2016 fungal communities by targeting the internal transcribed spacer its region bokulich and mills 2013 and specific virus families for example by targeting the hexon gene specific to adenovirus iaconelli et al 2017 kuo et al 2015 commercial options are available that rely on this approach to target multiple gene targets simultaneously to profile multiple args or pathogens such as the ampliseq panels produced by thermo fisher scientific amplicon based approaches have become widely popular given their broad applicability and modest cost compared to metagenomic sequencing while short read sequencing is typically used to facilitate amplicon sequencing e g garner et al 2019b ji et al 2015 the use of long read sequencing to characterize amplicons is emerging haig et al 2018 applications of ngs sequencing for water and wastewater initially used to characterize soil bacterial diversity the application of ngs to environmental systems has grown to be commonly employed for studying a vast array of environments ranging from ancient permafrost samples d costa et al 2011 to surfaces in the international space station be et al 2017 venkateswaran et al 2014 ngs is now beginning to be proven as a valuable tool for expanding understanding of water wastewater and water reuse systems to synthesize the breadth of existing applications of ngs for studying water and wastewater a systematic review of the existing literature was conducted and key themes were identified as ways ngs is being applied to address water quality challenges criteria for inclusion and the methodology for the systematic literature review are detailed in the supplementary information si briefly a search was conducted of the clarivate analytics web of science database for studies published between january 1 2000 and december 31 2019 written in the english language a three tiered search strategy was employed to identify 1 studies that utilize ngs 2 studies focusing on water or wastewater environments that are related to the water industry and 3 studies that focus on key applications the specific search terms at each tier are detailed in the si the number of references identified in each tier are depicted in fig 2 in total 15 367 publications were identified that utilize ngs methodology of these 651 papers were returned via a keyword search as being relevant to the water industry and were further examined in this systematic review after manual exclusion of irrelevant publications six key application areas were identified where ngs is most commonly applied across drinking water source waters wastewater receiving water bodies and water reuse these areas include taxonomic classification and pathogen detection functional and catabolic gene characterization antimicrobial resistance amr profiling bacterial toxicity characterization cyanobacteria and harmful algal bloom identification and virus characterization the number of references for each application area identified within the water and wastewater area utilizing each ngs methodology are summarized in fig 3 and key findings of the systematic literature review are summarized in table 1 all articles compiled for this systematic review have been catalogued in a zotero library accessible at https www zotero org groups 2593738 pathogen detection and taxonomic classification in total 115 articles were identified that apply ngs for taxonomic studies of aquatic environments table s3 of these 77 utilized targeted sequencing of amplified hypervariable gene regions 74 targeting the 16s rrna gene three targeting its regions 26 utilized metagenomic sequencing and 18 utilized wgs sequencing across studies was primarily conducted on illumina platforms 82 with the second most prevalent being 454 pyrosequencing 18 ion torrent 5 nanopore 3 and pacbio 2 were far less common with the remaining studies using various outdated dna analysis technologies after 454 pyrosequencing was discontinued illumina s miseq became the dominant platform for amplicon sequencing 60 with the hiseq platforms primarily used for metagenomic studies bioinformatic approaches to amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna hypervariable regions used a handful of databases and software the most common being the rdp cole et al 2014 greengenes desantis et al 2006 silva quast et al 2013 patric davis et al 2020 and the national center for biotechnology information s ncbi refseq o leary et al 2016 databases with data typically analyzed utilizing qiime caporaso et al 2010 mothur schloss et al 2009 blast altschul et al 1990 or megan software huson et al 2007 or the mg rast meyer et al 2008 and rdp services cole et al 2014 freshwater environments were the focus of the majority of studies 81 including drinking water and drinking water distribution systems 28 premise plumbing and various drinking water infrastructure 22 and river water 21 wastewater treatment was analyzed in 16 studies including profiling the treatment train 10 biosolids 3 membrane bioreactors 2 activated sludge 2 and anaerobic digestion 1 general taxonomic surveys were the focus of 42 studies these studies examined the microbiomes of aquatic environments either through metagenomic or 16s rrna targeted sequencing to profile microbial communities and corresponding shifts in composition in response to various changes in condition with time to infer the effects of differential water quality parameters recently taxonomic surveys have revealed the surprising diversity of microbes inhabiting drinking water and drinking water distribution systems dwdss it has been discovered that drinking water microbiomes are strongly shaped by disinfectants water age pipe materials and seasonal and source water variations bae et al 2019 chiao et al 2014 douterelo et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2016 liu et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 shaw et al 2015 stamps et al 2018 wang et al 2014a for example potgieter et al 2018 performed a two year study of a full scale drinking water distribution system to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community across water age and disinfection regimes long term ngs studies are important as they avoid stochastic variations from single time point studies and can reveal the systemic processes infrastructure and environmental factors that affect the microbial communities in drinking water systems thus informing downstream management decisions in another exemplary study mansfeldt et al 2019 examined the impact of microbial residence time mrt on taxonomic composition in activated sludge the authors found that longer mrts resulted in a greater range of growth parameters enabling microorganism persistence thus increasing richness and diversity findings were verified using a model based on monod growth kinetics demonstrating the importance of efficient resource capture and survival during low production for persistence in activated sludge collectively such studies that utilize ngs to examine the underlying ecology of microbial systems make important progress towards addressing how microbiomes might be engineered to support effective degradation of wastewater substrates and optimize nutrient removal pathogen detection was a principal focus of the majority 79 of taxonomy related papers several important sub topics emerged with respect to studying pathogen profiles specifically including increasing the range and sensitivity of pathogens detected during screening of drinking water sources and recreational waters cui et al 2019 2017 fang et al 2018b haig et al 2018 hamner et al 2019 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2018 layton et al 2014 nadya et al 2016 shrestha et al 2019 2017 vadde et al 2019 vanmensel et al 2020 yang et al 2020 exploring pathogen content and ensuring adequate pathogen removal during wastewater treatment bibby et al 2010 cai and zhang 2013 chen et al 2019 guo and zhang 2012 harb and hong 2017 hembach et al 2019 huang et al 2018 leddy et al 2017 li et al 2015b lu et al 2015 osunmakinde et al 2019 wan et al 2018 yergeau et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and monitoring for pathogen regrowth during wastewater reuse applications and drinking water distribution and storage garner et al 2018b 2019a kumaraswamy et al 2014 obayomi et al 2019 proctor et al 2015 qin et al 2017 li et al 2015a used metagenomic sequencing of the influent activated sludge aeration basin biofilm aeration basin foam layer anaerobic digestion sludge and the final effluent of various wastewater treatment plants wwtp in hong kong to detect pathogens using a genetic marker taxonomic classifier metaphlan and a curated pathogen index the authors reported 98 removal efficiency of all pathogens and 4 log removal of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis from influent to effluent showing that secondary treatment is an effective means to reduce most bacterial pathogens in wastewater this study is important to the water industry because its straightforward bioinformatic workflow and application of engineering removal efficiencies closely resemble culture based and qpcr studies exemplifying the application of ngs for in situ pathogen detection and relative quantification in a related study kumaraswamy et al 2014 used amplicon sequencing with a nested pcr approach targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene paired with annotation against greengenes and a preconstructed human pathogenic bacteria 16s rrna database to assess the presence of potential pathogens in treated wastewater intended for reuse they found abundant pathogen markers in treated wastewater post disinfection that were not detected by culture particularly gram positive pathogens revealing an elevated health risk and warranting further screening and risk assessment these examples are of importance to the water industry because they highlight the utility of ngs techniques for pathogen screening to uncover trends in overall behavior of multiple putative pathogens that would not be possible by culturing thus more comprehensively informing downstream applications approximately one third 27 of the pathogen centered literature focused on monitoring opportunistic pathogens op such as pseudomonas aeruginosa mycobacterium avium and legionella spp in relevant water environments eleven studies assessed the epidemiological relationship between potential reservoirs of ops and patient isolates bartley et al 2016 david et al 2017 fitzhenry et al 2017 fleres et al 2018 graham et al 2014 lande et al 2019 lévesque et al 2016 2014 quick et al 2014 raphael et al 2016 runcharoen et al 2017 wüthrich et al 2019 for example bartley et al 2016 used wgs to analyze isolates from a hospital water distribution system infected patients and retrospective patients and found that a single l pneumophila population was responsible for all nosocomial infections in 2011 and 2013 wgs has proven to be an effective tool for real time outbreak investigations that rely on the rapid identification of the associated organisms to identify and mitigate sources of infection additionally nine studies focused on studying op colonization of cooling towers farhat et al 2018 fitzhenry et al 2017 lévesque et al 2014 llewellyn et al 2017 nakanishi et al 2019 paranjape et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 2017 wüthrich et al 2019 in parallel to studying the distribution of legionella in 196 cooling towers across eight us climate regions llewellyn et al 2017 used targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene to investigate the cooling tower microbial communities interestingly they found the taxonomic distributions were homogeneous across the u s method development and validation was the focus of 14 papers and focused largely on improving precision and sensitivity for targeted sequencing techniques albertsen et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 brandt and albertsen 2018 greay et al 2019 guo et al 2013 lee et al 2017 saingam et al 2018 sato et al 2019 spencer et al 2016 for example lee et al 2017 designed novel primer sets for 16s rrna gene amplification to increase the specificity for the cyanobacteria and proteobacteria phyla organism specific assays have also been developed for example pereira et al 2018 2017 developed genus specific ngs assays for both legionella spp and pseudomonas spp which employ organism specific pcr primer sets that target the 16s rrna hypervariable regions with the intent of increasing the taxonomic resolution to the species level this approach is particularly valuable in identifying potential risks associated with pathogen containing genera because methods that amplify the 16s rrna gene using conserved primers often lack the ability to resolve the presence of pathogenic species from genetically similar organisms sato et al 2019 developed a leptospira spp specific ngs assay to investigate epidemiological links in leptospirosis endemic regions of rural japan increasing the range and specificity of risk assessments in environmental waters there are many challenges associated with taxonomic profiling and pathogen screening of bacterial communities using ngs but the methods and platforms used are undoubtedly the most developed amongst other ngs applications the first challenge is that for any amplicon or shotgun based sequencing analysis an organism could still be present even if not detected i e false negatives sensitivity of microbial community analysis is dependent upon a multitude of factors including dna extraction methods pcr biases databases and classifiers used sequencing technique e g 16s rrna gene amplicon or metagenomic and most of all the sequencing depth albertsen et al 2015 brandt and albertsen 2018 guo et al 2013 yergeau et al 2016 none of which have been standardized a second challenge that the 16s rrna hypervariable region often does not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution for pathogen identification greay et al 2019 demonstrates that the v4 region did not exhibit the specificity necessary to differentiate the enterobacteriaceae family of gammaproteobacteria in wastewater a critical group of organisms for water quality monitoring this study also cross checked 16s rrna amplicons against the ncbi nucleotide collection nr nt and found that nine of the 12 pathogens detected were erroneously assigned using the greengenes database this issue is a systematic error that has most likely led to false positives in numerous ngs studies to date it should be noted that because strain level differentiation is often necessary only wgs has the resolution to reliably verify the presence of pathogens e g by lineage and presence of key virulence genes in contrast read based metagenomics and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at best only provide a screen for the potential presence of pathogens by identifying genus or higher ranks of taxonomic classification however when sequencing coverage is sufficient mags can be generated from metagenomic data and support strain level resolution quince et al 2017a while ongoing method development and validation is important for improving the application of taxonomic characterization of water and wastewater microbial communities these methods are promising in their ability to characterize typical and atypical microbial communities in water systems and to screen for the presence of a broad range of pathogens while bypassing culture bias functional and catabolic gene characterization in total 82 records were identified that applied ngs for studying metabolic and other functional activity in drinking water wastewater and recycled water table s4 of these 70 studies were focused on genomic dna seven on rna and five on a combination of both dna and rna metagenomic sequencing was most common 67 followed by metatranscriptomics 7 or a combination of the two 5 of the remaining papers two utilized amplicon sequencing and one implemented wgs sequencing was primarily conducted on illumina based platforms such as hiseq 42 miseq 9 and nextseq 2 with roche 454 pyrosequencing making up the second largest sequencing technology 15 utilized the rest of the studies employed various platforms wastewater was the focus of the majority of studies targeting wastewater in general 5 a2o process 1 anaerobic digestion 7 anammox 2 activated sludge 14 industrial treatment 8 membrane bioreactors 1 microbial fuel cells 3 biosolids 2 and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion 2 characterization of functional genes in various drinking water sources was also prevalent aquifers groundwater 8 freshwater 1 freshwater sediments 5 lakes 5 and rivers streams 6 other studies targeted drinking water treatment and distribution systems 8 fracking 2 constructed wetlands 1 and petroleum reservoirs 1 functional annotation was conducted using a variety of predefined 74 and custom databases 9 a large majority of studies utilized some combination of the seed overbeek 2005 kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 cog galperin et al 2019 and or eggnog huerta cepas et al 2019 databases cog and kegg 3 cog eggnog and kegg 1 kegg 11 kegg and eggnog 3 kegg uniref100 and uniprot 1 seed and cog 1 seed and kegg 20 and seed 11 or the mg rast m5nr meyer et al 2008 databases 9 which combines non redundant sequences from genbank seed img uniprot kegg and eggnog databases though functional analysis played a major role in all of these studies only six applied it as the sole focus with 77 conducting it in conjunction with taxonomy based analysis several common themes emerged with respect to how ngs has been used to study metabolic and other functional activity in relevant water environments the most common application of functionally applied ngs was functional gene profiling either comprehensively or by examining specific functions of interest these applications were often conducted in tandem to some degree and were applied in 73 studies with 27 focused heavily on general characterizations and 46 focused on specific functional profiles of interest among the 27 studies the majority applied the seed cog eggnog and or kegg databases to characterize a wide range of functionalities including cellular processes metabolism and information storage and processing here the application of metagenomics aimed at identifying functional genes served primarily to shed light on biological processes in effect characterizing the functional profiles within collected samples or comparing them across samples for example douterelo et al 2018 applied ngs annotated using mg rast and cog functional levels 1 and 2 returning results for cellular processes signaling information storage processing metabolism and poorly characterized to characterize the differences between biofilm and bulk water functional profiles finding that they were habitat dependent similarly sidhu et al 2017 utilized the seed and kegg databases to comprehensively profile the differences between raw sewage and treated sludge from a wwtp finding key genes responsible for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation a number of additional studies also applied general functional analysis to characterize their specific environments using similar approaches cai et al 2016 delforno et al 2017a hemme et al 2015 ju et al 2014 mohan et al 2014 saxena et al 2018 song et al 2019 van rossum et al 2015 vikram et al 2016 in contrast to comprehensive profiling of functional genes a number of specific functions of interests were the focus of 46 of the 73 studies including nitrogen cycling metabolism bai et al 2013 cai et al 2019 chao et al 2016 costa et al 2015 2015 crovadore et al 2017 emmanuel et al 2019 jewell et al 2016 keller et al 2015 liu et al 2019b mason et al 2014 peura et al 2015 pinto et al 2016

2015 metal transformation abbai and pillay 2013 bai et al 2013 costa et al 2015 dai et al 2018a hemme et al 2015 varrone et al 2014 methanogenesis bedoya et al 2019 biderre petit et al 2019 cai et al

2013 xia et al 2018 yang et al 2014b yu et al 2018 biofilm formation chao et al 2015 douterelo et al 2018 li et al 2019 rehman et al 2019 sun et al 2018 vikram et al 2016 and a wide range of metabolic processes cai et al 2013 2016 chao et al 2013 cleary et al 2018 dai et al 2018b das et al 2017 fang et al 2014 hamilton et al 2017 lu et al 2017 ludington et al 2017 ma et al 2019a medeiros et al 2016 mohan et al 2014 more et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 ruiz moreno et al 2019 saxena et al 2018 silva et al 2012 sul et al 2016 van rossum et al 2015 yadav et al 2015 yu and zhang 2012 studies also investigated transport mechanisms keller et al 2015 meng et al 2019 ye et al 2012 virulence defense and stress response dai et al 2018b medeiros et al 2016 schlüter et al 2008 foaming rosso et al 2018 and the impacts of disinfection chao et al 2013 mohan et al 2014 ye et al 2012 provide an exemplar of the ability for functional ngs to identify nitrogen related functional genes through utilization of the kegg database s annotation to quantify and characterize genes related to both nitrification and denitrification pathways in full scale and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors pinto et al 2016 also report metagenomic evidence for the presence of bacteria similar to nitrospira with the ability to completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate in a drinking water system i e comammox by discovering ammonia oxidation genes that were divergent from canonical ammonia oxidizers gou et al 2015 and yang et al 2014b provide examples of how functional ngs can be applied to characterize the methanogenesis pathways present in anaerobic digesters both of which found the acetoclastic pathway to be dominant douterelo et al 2018 applied metagenomics to characterize and compare differences between bulk water and biofilms within dwdss along with genes related to biofilm formation finding that that the functional profile differed between habitats and that biofilms preferentially possessed resistance mechanisms related to radical induced disinfection damage the majority of studies applying metagenomics focusing on identifying functional genes were aimed at assessing various metabolic processes with a wide breadth of environments and pathways examined aromatic compound degradation abbai and pillay 2013 bai et al 2013 delforno et al 2017a jadeja et al 2019 mason et al 2014 more et al 2014 sidhu et al 2017 silva et al 2013 yadav et al 2015 arsenic metabolism cai et al 2013 costa et al 2015 das et al 2017 edwardson and hollibaugh 2017 energy metabolism cleary et al 2018 hemme et al 2015 keller et al 2015 medeiros et al 2016 reid et al 2018 amino acid and fatty acid degradation emmanuel et al 2019 fang et al 2014 fang et al 2018a lu et al 2017 ma et al 2019a hydrogenases bai et al 2013 tomazetto et al 2015 varrone et al 2014 wexler et al 2005 and oxygenases bai et al 2013 fang et al 2013 jadeja et al 2014 mason et al 2014 silva et al 2013 singh et al 2010 yu and zhang 2012 were of wide interest in addition to the more general characterizations identified above for example cai et al 2016 effectively utilized metagenomics to reconstruct metabolic pathways related to methanogenesis and denitrification during a comparison of two biogas producing digesters in addition to finding that each digester had a high level of functional redundancy underlying their stability identification of novel functional genes was the focus of seven studies these studies utilized metagenomics to identify new genes and evaluate their functions for example folch mallol et al 2019 utilized metagenomics to describe a novel thioesterase gene involved in phenylacetic acid degradation seemingly phylogenetically related to actinobacterium additionally silva et al 2013 focused on novel genes pathways related to phenol and aromatic compound degradation by screening a metagenomic library for phenol hydroxylase genes and phenol degradation activity resulting in the identification of genes present in wastewater treatment involved in degradation of aromatic compound rather than directly examining functional genes inferring functional capacity from 16s rrna gene derived microbial taxonomy was the focus of 2 studies for example cleary et al 2018 applied picrust predictive functionality to two morphologically different cinachyrella samples from marine indonesian lakes with varying levels of connectivity to the sea with the goal of comparing bacterial and archaeal communities and their respective functional capabilities to each other and those found in lakes the authors noted pronounced differences between both morphospecies predicted functionality and shared enrichment of pathways related to energy metabolism stress response secondary metabolites and information processing when comparing both morphospecies to prokaryotic communities in water it should be noted however that approaches such as picrust are inherently limited because they indirectly infer functionality based on taxonomy rather than directly examining functional genes thus accuracy is subject to the extent to which the organisms detected are characterized bearing in mind that 16s rrna gene sequencing methods at best have genus level resolution while functions may vary at the strain level further the picrust developers caution that a nearest sequenced taxon index score of 0 03 is typically required to predict a target taxon at the species level and results should be carefully interpreted langille et al 2013 communities with diverse functional niches and the ability to adapt to different carbon sources would especially confound this approach thus while taxonomically derived functional inference methods may point to some potentially useful hypotheses for follow up study they should be applied with extreme caution to complex microbial communities such as those characteristic of wwtps and other water environments overall limited sample replication was apparent in a number of studies bedoya et al 2019 chao et al 2016 debroas et al 2009 li et al 2019 medeiros et al 2016 reid et al 2018 sánchez reyez et al 2017 xia et al 2018 which was likely a result of the high costs associated with implementation of ngs challenges in characterizing complex metabolisms characteristic of wastewater treatment and a high proportion of poorly characterized hits during functional annotation were widely noted which was impacted by limited databases for annotation roughly half of all studies were devoted to activated sludge reactors and anaerobic digesters which are characterized by a relatively strong foundational understanding of key microbiological processes involved however focusing on snapshots of singular processes fails to provide context with respect to how functional profiles change temporally and spatially throughout treatment trains and continued operation the lack of a substantial functional understanding of multiple treatment processes is especially notable with advanced treatment processes where no studies were found that functionally analyzed advanced treatment trains for recycled water or potable reuse waters it is worth noting that metagenomics has been applied to characterize the function of microbial communities associated with some emerging technologies in the water and wastewater field specifically in the form of bioelectrochemical systems and microbial fuel cells kiseleva et al 2015 varrone et al 2014 yu et al 2018 in general future research would benefit from better coupling of functional profiles to operational conditions and water quality data collectively available literature provides a good foundation for functional based metagenomic analysis with methods devoted to common metabolic pathways nitrogen cycling and general functional profiling being the most well developed at this stage metagenomics aimed at elucidating functional capacity of microbial communities is an important contribution to the water industry as these methods facilitate mechanistic understanding of microbial processes that can support improved engineering of water and wastewater treatment processes antimicrobial resistance in total 56 studies were identified that applied ngs for examining amr in relevant water environments table s5 of these 54 utilized metagenomic sequencing three utilized wgs one utilized metatranscriptomics and two utilized targeted sequencing to amplify the 16s rrna gene to provide insight into the relationship between microbial community and arg profiles wastewater raw sewage and biosolids were the focus of the majority 34 of studies followed by environmental source waters 34 drinking water treatment trains and distribution 7 and reclaimed water 2 several common themes emerged with most studies primarily focused on profiling resistomes i e args carried collectively across the microbial community in both pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria additionally studies applied wgs towards examining resistant isolates derived from water systems while other studies systematically evaluated how water treatment mechanisms shape resistomes several studies utilized metagenomics to probe wastewater effluents with specific emphasis on hospital and antibiotic manufacturing wastewaters as potential hotspots for args baral et al 2018 chu et al 2017 fróes et al 2016 garrido cardenas et al 2017 guo et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 hendriksen et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 lekunberri et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2019c ng et al 2017 rowe et al 2016 schlüter et al 2008 szczepanowski et al 2008 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014a additionally these studies often used assembly of short reads to assess the co occurrence of args with mobile genetic elements mge and metal resistance genes mrg this is important information in terms of assessing the potential for args to be mobilized among bacterial populations or to be co cross selected by other agents such as metals while most published studies to date employ short read sequencing a few more recent studies have begun to apply long read sequencing for example che et al 2019 used nanopore sequencing to identify args associated with plasmids the majority of studies have examined wastewater and the effects of effluent on receiving environments but water reuse and drinking water are also of interest for amr monitoring as potential direct routes of exposure chao et al 2013 dai et al 2018b douterelo et al 2018 garner et al 2018a jia et al 2019 ma et al 2019b yang et al 2013 in one study combining metagenomics and metatranscriptomics liu et al 2019c noted that only 65 percent of args identified by metagenomics in activated sludge were actively transcribed the presence of unexpressed args remains a concern as they could still be expressed in clinical situations when antibiotics are applied but such a study helps identify treatment processes that may also induce expression and likely selection of bacteria carrying args identifying how specific wastewater and drinking water treatment processes impact the resistome was the focus of 8 studies several studies concluded that chlorination can selectively increase the relative abundance of args compared to other genes chao et al 2013 jia et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 shi et al 2013 other studies have utilized metagenomics to characterize how activated sludge and bench scale digesters can alter selection pressure with respect to args encoding clinically relevant resistance bengtsson palme et al 2016 christgen et al 2015 yadav and kapley 2019 zhang et al 2015 understanding how specific treatment processes affect resistomes is critical in generating practical recommendations for the water industry sequencing resistant isolates derived from water systems was the focus of four studies where wgs was applied towards characterizing args and mges in bacteria such as e coli cameron et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 parsley et al 2010 roy et al 2018 in particular wgs enables a high degree of confidence in assembly which in turn improves the ability to characterize mechanisms of resistance and assess co occurrence of args with mges and other genes of interest coupled with phylogenetic analysis wgs can be applied towards assessing mechanisms by which amr is evolving across strains sequencing resistant e coli and enterococcus fecal indicators already in mainstream use by the water industry may enable monitoring of background resistance and sequencing can help identify if new resistance patterns are emerging fróes et al 2016 while the use of ngs technologies is critical for the water industry in characterizing the breadth of amr in water and wastewater systems that cannot be fully captured with culture or traditional molecular methods there are still critical knowledge gaps regarding how to best apply these technologies towards guiding management of these systems for the purpose of mitigating the spread of amr elements guidance is still needed to assess the utility of various ngs derived metrics and the extent to which they provide information about ecologically important processes or represent risk to human health for example the relative abundance of total args is thought to be indicative of the degree to which environmental conditions select for carriage of args across a microbial community while absolute abundance of total args is arguably a more direct indicator of magnitude of health risk additional guidance is needed in terms of how to most meaningfully normalize metagenomic data in a manner that enhances quantitative capacity and comparability across systems notably conclusions with respect to relative comparisons across samples can be substantially influenced as a function of sequencing platform sequencing depth and sample type many published studies employ assembly of short reads to assess co occurrences of args mges mrgs and pathogens but the lack of a means to verify if assemblies are correct is a major shortcoming additionally the quantitative value of metagenomic data is lost after assembling thus long read sequencing which eliminates the need for assembly holds particular promise for amr monitoring vastly increasing confidence in identification of bacterial hosts of args and their co occurrence with mges mrgs or other genes of interest wwtps in particular have been identified as key nodes both for the control and dissemination of amr and thus are an ideal point for surveillance of amr in a community and mitigation of args prior to release to the environment systematic evaluation of the efficacy of various treatment technologies for addressing amr would be beneficial bacterial toxicity in total 24 studies were identified that apply ngs for studying bacterial toxicity in relevant water environments table s6 of these records nine utilized metagenomic sequencing 13 utilized targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and two utilized both metagenomic sequencing and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing wastewater and drinking water were the focus of the majority 6 each of studies followed by groundwater 5 aquifer 2 surface water 2 sediment 2 and constructed wetlands 1 the toxic compounds most frequently studied were free chlorine 5 arsenic 5 other heavy metals 5 nanomaterials 2 and multiple other compounds twenty two studies met the criteria for both toxicity and amr searches and were addressed above in the amr section the effects of toxic contaminants in water sources and how they shift the microbial community were the focus of 13 studies these studies examined both natural and anthropogenic pollutants heavy metals costa et al 2015 hemme et al 2010 arsenic cai et al 2013 das et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 layton et al 2014 and hydrocarbon abbai and pillay 2013 fahrenfeld et al 2017 impacts were often studied in ground and surface water as well as stream sediments anthropogenic contaminants such as nanomaterials binh et al 2014 liu et al 2019a tetrachloroethene reiss et al 2016 and combinations of multiple pollutants lu et al 2017 sonthiphand et al 2019 were examined in aquifers constructed wetlands and surface water in general these studies examined shifts in microbial community composition and function that occurred due to exposure to pollutants for example fahrenfeld et al 2017 applied metagenomics to investigate how the microbial community shifted along a stream running through an unconventional oil and gas disposal facility the authors found that this wastewater release was associated with shifts in the microbial community structure and functions including functions related to dormancy and sporulation respiration and antimicrobial resistance similarly sonthiphand et al 2019 applied 16s rrna amplicon sequencing to investigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on the diversity abundance and dynamics of microbial communities in groundwater the authors found that microbial communities tended to cluster by the nature of the impact specifically adjacent landfills agricultural land and community areas these two examples provide helpful background understanding with respect to how toxins or pollutants can impact microbial communities associated with drinking water sources examining microbial communities in drinking water treatment plants wwtps and distribution or collection systems was the focus of nine studies for example some of the studies involving drinking water treatment plants examined the microbes within sand filters bai et al 2013 huang et al 2014 and after disinfection huang et al 2014 results indicated that microbial activity is important in removing harmful materials such as heavy metals arsenate and aromatic compounds free chlorine disinfection was found to reduce certain genera while enriching others as well as mges carrying virulence factors huang et al 2014 several studies have profiled how toxic compounds impact microbial communities in dwdss douterelo et al 2018 saleem et al 2018 shaw et al 2015 in wastewater reclamation and distribution systems lin et al 2016 and in sewer biofilms gomez alvarez et al 2012 for example douterelo et al 2018 applied metagenomics to investigate the taxonomy and gene functions characteristic of biofilm and bulk water within a chlorinated dwds the authors identified mechanisms of resistance and damage repair to external stressors such as chlorine and antibiotics within the biofilms this study is an example of how metagenomic studies of dwdss may help indicate infrastructure or treatment failures thereby protecting and promoting water quality and safety one study was identified by the toxicity search criteria but did not fall within any of the aforementioned sub categories handley et al 2014 assembled the whole genome of candidatus sulfuricurvum sp from an aquifer derived metagenome while this approach has been employed to assemble complete genomes of uncultured microorganisms in other environments this endeavor is inherently limited by achievable sequencing depth alneberg et al 2018 the authors identified genes indicative of heavy metal and arsenic tolerance which they presumed to be related to heavy metal contamination within the aquifer in summary ngs studies involving antimicrobial or toxic compounds in water primarily focused on how these compounds shifted the microbial community in contaminated water environments or within the drinking or wwtp or distribution collection systems of particular relevance to the water industry is new understanding being gained by examining the impact of free chlorine primarily in drinking water disinfection cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms in total 29 studies were identified that applied ngs to study cyanobacteria in freshwater drinking water and wastewater table s7 of these 6 utilized metagenomic sequencing 4 utilized metatranscriptomic sequencing 18 utilized targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 2 utilized both targeted and metagenomic sequencing and 1 utilized both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing freshwater was the focus of the majority 20 of studies including lakes 18 rivers 1 and reservoirs 1 followed by drinking water 6 wastewater 3 and aquatic biofilms 1 several common themes emerged as ways ngs has been used to study cyanobacteria in relevant water environments including characterization of cyanobacterial communities especially toxic strains in source water and water treatment systems identification of shifts in gene expression and control and removal of cyanobacteria in wastewater or drinking water targeted sequencing with an emphasis on 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing were the main ngs approaches used to study the cyanobacterial genome and its position in the microbial communities relevant to freshwater abia et al 2018 bakal et al 2019 driscoll et al 2017 eiler et al 2013 ghai et al 2014 hou et al 2019 kurilkina et al 2016 kurobe et al 2018 lee et al 2017 pope and patel 2008 qin et al 2019 reza et al 2018 saleem et al 2019 steffen et al 2015 vadde et al 2019 drinking water kori et al 2019 otten et al 2016 pei et al 2017 saleem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 or wastewater lee et al 2017 lu and lu 2014 for example kurobe et al 2018 applied metagenomic sequencing to investigate the shift in the cyanobacterial community from freshwater to brackish water during a microcystis bloom in the san francisco estuary they found microcystis was the predominant genus among cyanobacteria in both freshwater and brackish water with up to six microcystis genotypes identified these studies emphasize the importance of ngs approaches for tracking cyanobacterial communities especially toxic and bloom forming genera in freshwater systems in another exemplar otten et al 2016 utilized metagenomic sequencing to identify taste and odor producers and toxin producing cyanobacteria in a drinking water reservoir their results indicated that anabaena spp microcystis spp and an unresolved member of the order oscillatoriales are potentially responsible for some chemicals that produce taste or odor including geosmin microcystin and 2 methylisoborneol this research highlighted the need to apply ngs approaches to monitor cyanobacteria that have a negative impact on the drinking water quality identification of shifts in gene expression associated with metabolic pathways was the focus of seven studies chen et al 2018 davenport et al 2019 hampel et al 2019 harke et al 2016 mou et al 2013 pascault et al 2014 most of these papers emphasized cyanobacterial gene expression at different times and under different nutrient conditions during a bloom season for example davenport et al 2019 observed diel shifts in metabolic pathways of microcystis spp during a 48 h survey using metatranscriptomic sequencing daytime gene transcripts favored photosynthesis and nutrient uptake whereas nighttime transcripts were primarily related to protein synthesis lee et al 2017 similarly hampel et al 2019 analyzed shifts in gene expression using metatranscriptomic sequencing under a high nitrogen condition in early summer and a low nitrogen condition in late summer and found toxic planktothrix and microcystis relied heavily on regenerated ammonium when the nitrogen level became low in late summer these studies addressed the need for ngs approaches to track the impacts of different time scales and nutrient conditions on the evolution of the cyanobacterial community and their gene expression levels and suggested potentially useful nutrient control methods to reduce toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater and water treatment systems characterization of cyanobacteria in source water was the focus of 16 studies abia et al 2018 bakal et al 2019 driscoll et al 2017 eiler et al 2013 ghai et al 2014 hou et al 2019 kurilkina et al 2016 kurobe et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu and lu 2014 pope and patel 2008 qin et al 2019 reza et al 2018 saleem et al 2019 steffen et al 2012 vadde et al 2019 xu et al 2018 while an additional five looked at cyanobacteria in water treatment systems kori et al 2019 otten et al 2016 pei et al 2017 saleem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 control and removal of cyanobacteria in wastewater or drinking water was the focus of two studies bai et al 2014 zamyadi et al 2019 these studies utilized ngs to investigate the influence of different water treatment processes on cyanobacterial communities in the relevant water environment bai et al 2014 applied both targeted amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing to assess the impacts of treated and untreated wastewater discharges on bacterial communities in the river and concluded untreated water resulted in an increase of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria zamyadi et al 2019 proposed a critical control point for cyanobacteria removal in the drinking water treatment process they applied ngs along with microscopic analysis and cell integrity methods and found after pre oxidation treatment the remaining cyanobacterial cells 80 were undamaged with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post kmno4 treatment particularly in clarifier sludge both studies highlighted the importance of water treatment to control and remove potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the water systems and the need to apply ngs to improve the monitoring and management of water quality in summary the focus of the majority of cyanobacterial studies using ngs approaches is on the characterization of cyanobacterial communities in both source water and water treatment systems followed by evaluating of gene expressions key questions investigated included identification of community structure and toxic strains during bloom seasons and shifts in gene expressions under different environmental and nutrient conditions the remaining studies not covered in detail in this section only discussed cyanobacterial metagenomics as part of the larger bacterial or prokaryotic community rather than being the main focus characterization of viruses in total 80 records were identified that applied ngs for studying viruses in wastewater recycled water and freshwater table s8 of these records 54 utilized metagenomic sequencing 12 utilized wgs and 14 utilized targeted sequencing 5 targeting the hypervariable human adenovirus hexon gene 8 targeting specific enteroviruses and 1 targeting phage borne 16s rrna sequences wastewater was the focus of the majority 49 of studies followed by freshwater 30 including lakes 17 streams or rivers 4 and surface water 3 groundwater 1 and reclaimed water 1 several common themes emerged from the systematic review of how ngs has been used to study viruses in relevant water environments including characterization of environments method development and genotyping virome characterization of water environments was the focus of 54 studies the majority of these papers reported viromes of previously unstudied environments e g untreated sewage adriaenssens et al 2018 cantalupo et al 2011 ng et al 2012 o brien et al 2017 strubbia et al 2019a tamaki et al 2011 wang et al 2018 dairy lagoons alhamlan et al 2013 and freshwater lakes djikeng et al 2009 gong et al 2016 green et al 2015 gu et al 2018 hewson et al 2012 hewson et al 2018 hornstra et al 2019 kavagutti et al 2019 malki et al 2015 mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 okazaki et al 2019 palermo et al 2019 rosario et al 2009 sible et al 2015 skvortsov et al 2016 tamaki et al 2011 tseng et al 2013 watkins et al 2016 specific topics of interest within these studies included viral pathogen identification dna or rna virome characterization virus host interactions phage diversity and arg characterization within viruses tamaki et al 2011 used ngs to characterize dna viruses throughout the wastewater treatment process this study highlighted the uniqueness of the virome of wastewater compared to 42 other environmental settings bibby and peccia 2013 utilized ngs to characterize the virome of sewage sludge with a focus on describing the diversity of human viruses and understanding the risks associated with land application this study expanded our knowledge of human pathogenic viruses in wastewater samples and demonstrates that ngs can be used to identify human viruses in environmental samples nine studies focused on method development particularly improving methods to study viruses in aquatic environments bekliz et al 2019 brinkman et al 2018 fernandez cassi et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 labonte 2016 oshiki et al 2018 strubbia et al 2019b uyaguari diaz et al 2016 these studies mainly focused on methods to concentrate purify or extract viral nucleic acid from various water samples for example hjelmsø et al 2017 compared four viral particle concentration methods and four different extraction kits to evaluate viral community composition specificity richness and pathogen detection of raw sewage using ngs similarly fernandez cassi et al 2018 developed an optimized ultracentrifugation method or skimmed milk flocculation when ultracentrifugation is not available to concentrate viruses and target adenovirus and other viruses that could not always be detected using metagenomics this study addresses the sensitivity necessary for ngs to investigate the sewage virome to track human pathogens and highlights the importance of using viral metagenomics for public health surveillance viral genotyping using next generation amplicon or wgs was the subject of 12 studies boonchan et al 2017 brinkman et al 2017 fumian et al 2019 hata et al 2018b 2018b 2018a kaas et al 2019 majumdar et al 2018 mancini et al 2019 ogorzaly et al 2015 oshiki et al 2018 suffredini et al 2018 yoshitomi et al 2017 these studies used ngs to characterize the diversity of pathogenic viruses including adenovirus astrovirus and norovirus in wastewater or sewage impacted surface water for example hata et al 2018a used this approach to study occurrences of norovirus sapovirus rotavirus aichi virus and enterovirus they concluded that norovirus gii 17 strains were prevalent in surface water impacted by wastewater before becoming prevalent in gastroenteritis patients in japan oshiki et al 2018 used a microfluidic nested pcr approach combined with ngs amplicon sequencing to detect and genotype 11 human pathogenic rna viruses in human stool and sewage these studies prove the usefulness of using amplicon based ngs to study molecular epidemiology and monitor the emergence of viral pathogens using wastewater surveillance undoubtedly there are significant challenges associated with application of metagenomics for the study of viruses compared to other microorganisms behzad et al 2015 prussin et al 2014 rose et al 2016 simmonds 2015 the first challenge is that viruses do not share a conserved gene thus profiling viromes can only be achieved via shotgun metagenomics not targeted gene amplification ghurye et al 2016 shotgun metagenomics requires a substantial mass of genomic material which is particularly difficult to obtain from viruses in environmental samples in which concentrations are low behzad et al 2015 prussin et al 2014 one way to overcome this challenge is by collecting large sample volumes e g hundreds of liters breitbart et al 2002 rodriguez brito et al 2010 rosario et al 2009 however this is both time intensive and time sensitive even with proper precautions during sampling and nucleic acid extraction contaminants that could degrade genetic material may be introduced second many viruses have rna as their genetic material which degrades much more rapidly than dna if the rna degrades before sequencing there would be false negatives in the virome analysis and many potentially important viruses could be overlooked the third significant challenge associated with viral ngs is that reference databases are very limited especially compared to those for bacteria and fungi bibby and peccia 2013 suggested that less than one percent of viruses have been sequenced and uploaded to databases and they demonstrated that over 75 of viruses in sewage sludge are unidentifiable to improve viral databases viruses must first be isolated cultured and subjected to wgs prussin et al 2014 rohwer and edwards 2002 however viruses are very difficult to culture because they require a host e g bacteria for bacteriophages and some viruses are simply unculturable using current tools and approaches finally there is no standard user friendly data analysis pipeline for viromes as exists for bacterial archaeal 16s rrna genes e g qiime most virome pipelines require extensive bioinformatics and or computer science backgrounds with improved tools our knowledge of viruses in water and wastewater using ngs will rapidly improve however presently our understanding of viruses is fragmented especially in water and wastewater as such viruses have been described as the forgotten siblings of the microbiome family williams 2013 knowledge gaps and research needs need for standardized methods the field of ngs is rapidly evolving with a continually emerging pipeline of new platforms library preparation techniques and data analysis approaches such an expanse of evolving options creates challenges to ensuring that data collected across studies is comparable which is critical for informing broader conclusions across studies differences in sample volume dna extraction method library preparation method ngs platform read length sequencing depth and data quality filtering are all critical aspects of ngs that are not standardized and make it difficult to compare results thus standardized methods are critically needed to overcome key differences in approaches as well as to facilitate the adoption of ngs technologies by new stakeholders such as water utilities birko et al 2015 however the development of standardized methods for ngs application for studying water and wastewater should allow flexibility for the design of research studies aimed at asking novel questions that may not strictly conform to standard approaches as the utility of ngs to different sectors of the water and wastewater industry increases several agencies could potentially play a role in standardization of these methods for application in environmental samples for example the u s environmental protection agency u s centers for disease control and prevention world health organization national institute of standards and technology and clinical and laboratory standards institute sample processing substantial variability in methodology exists for sample collection concentration and extraction of dna and rna and can have critical impacts on downstream ngs analysis while the type of membrane used for sample concentration has been shown to have no discernable impact on microbial community structure djurhuus et al 2017 there are likely to be substantial differences based on whether hollow fiber filtration or precipitation and centrifugation is used compared to membrane filtration past studies have demonstrated that different dna extraction kits used with water and wastewater samples tend to produce microbial communities and resistomes that are largely similar but inconsistencies can be introduced by certain extraction kits or methods due to contamination or methodologies that favor certain groups of organisms i e gram negative vs gram positive djurhuus et al 2017 li et al 2017 walden et al 2017 sample matrix also likely has an impact on the optimum extraction method given that separation of microorganisms from complex organic matrices and carrier materials varies between matrices sanz and köchling 2019 biomass is expected to vary substantially by sample matrix and low biomass environments such as drinking water are likely to require more extensive concentration than more microbially dense environments this introduces challenges for comparison across water environments i e water wastewater sediment biofilm etc standardization of pre processing methods to collect and prepare samples for ngs is critical for producing comparable results across water and wastewater systems bioinformatic analysis the continuous optimization and declining costs of sequencing platforms have facilitated generation of a vast volume of sequencing data however rendering these deposited data into meaningful results that can inform decision making in the water industry is an ongoing challenge the analysis of ngs data largely depends on principles and standards established by the broader genomics community such as sequencing protocols and controls read mapping algorithms assembly algorithms methods for phylogenetic analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping however each step poses a variety of challenges that are briefly described below quality control qc is one of the most critical steps in the processing of ngs data it usually involves removing or trimming low quality reads and the unwanted sequences such as sequencing adapters host contamination that could pose problems in the downstream analysis as different datasets have their own characteristics and challenges it is advised to formulate the qc protocol that is best suited for the specific dataset in consideration for example metatranscriptome datasets could be contaminated with rrna transcripts that needs to be removed prior to any downstream analysis esteve codina 2018 similarly the qc tools framed for reads generated on short read platform may not be appropriate for reads generated on long reads platform due to the inherent differences in the two sequencing technologies fukasawa et al 2020 the traditional approach used for collectively detecting genes across microbial communities is using read alignment tools to annotate genomic or metagenomic data and applying a similarity search against a reference sequence using a best hit approach wilke et al 2013 the basic principle lies on the assumption that genes sharing homology perform similar functions however even a single base pair change in sequence can alter protein function thus the choice of stringency used in homology based annotation can substantially affect the interpretation and reproducibility of the data randle boggis et al 2016 for example a lower percentage identity cutoff will fail to differentiate two highly similar sequences while the best hit approach remains the most popular annotation strategy it is prone to producing a high rate of false positives randle boggis et al 2016 sequencing aimed at characterizing snps is still an under explored topic as it requires cost intensive deep sequencing with high coverage of sequenced genomes de novo assembly i e assembly conducted based on overlapping reads rather than mapping reads to reference genomes holds promise for overcoming the high false positive rates associated with the best hit approach applied to short reads while various assemblers are available to tackle complex ngs data it is advised to be cautious while selecting the appropriate assembler as different datasets metagenomics metatranscriptomics have their own challenges shakya et al 2019 further assembly is computationally expensive and often generation of contigs of sufficient length for target analyses is limited when faced with high microbial diversity characteristic of water samples often too few contigs are produced and with low confidence in accuracy diminishing the ability to carry out meaningful downstream analyses genome resolved assembly of metagenomic sequencing data though limited by the ability to obtain sufficient coverage holds promise for a wide range of applications including the ability to construct genomes of uncultured organisms and linking metabolism and function to phylogeny c quince et al 2017b the vast quantities of sequencing data being produced also create challenges for computational demands and data storage although public repositories such as the ncbi sequence read archive and the european nucleotide archive are readily used to publicly store and share metagenomic data substantial computational resources are still required to carry out in house analyses which can be a significant challenge to the application of ngs by the water industry one possible solution to tackle this issue is to establish a cloud based infrastructure which is readily used by many biotechnology companies ngs holds the capability of revolutionizing the water industry by providing a plethora of tools and frameworks to analyze water and wastewater microbial communities however owing to the daunting complexity of metagenomics an interdisciplinary work force composed of engineers and bioinformaticians will likely be needed to perform these analyses and inform decision making building such a work force would be essential in implementing and maintaining ngs capabilities in the water industry availability of annotation databases there are numerous well curated databases available for annotating ngs reads as demonstrated in table 2 while these databases are useful for annotating microbial phylogenetic origin and for key functional capacities such as antibiotic resistance many key attributes are missing from the available databases for example very little information is available regarding non bacterial microorganisms such as viruses amoebae and fungi which are often highly important in water and wastewater in addition few databases are available that curate metabolic genes making it difficult to screen samples for functional capacity the need for well curated databases is a critical limitation that often encumbers the study of emerging topics via ngs technologies determination of viability as with all techniques targeting dna most ngs techniques are unable to directly distinguish dna originating from live versus dead cells metatranscriptomics has been used to overcome this obstacle by targeting mrna rather than dna given that mrna is produced only by live cells and associated only with genes that are actively transcribed moran 2009 however this approach is particularly challenging for analyzing low biomass water samples such as those collected from drinking water which typically contain very low rna concentrations rna also degrades rapidly in the environment and is prone to contamination by hosts e g human cells in wastewater bashiardes et al 2016 the application of membrane impermeable intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma and ethidium monoazide ema have also been used to address challenges in detecting live vs dead cells while these methods initially showed great promise and raised significant interest among researchers for differentiating live and dead cells bae and wuertz 2009 chen et al 2011 hellein et al 2012 vesper et al 2008 yáñez et al 2011 many have highlighted critical limitations and shortcomings with the approach such as a lack of reproducibility scaturro et al 2016 tavernier and coenye 2015 taylor et al 2014 matrix interference taylor et al 2014 need for optimization according to target organism and sample characteristics taylor et al 2014 and ability to penetrate some intact cells flekna et al 2007 kobayashi et al 2009 nocker et al 2006 flow cytometry using cell sorting for differentiating live versus dead cells has been employed and paired with ngs in some studies berney et al 2007 hammes et al 2008 kahlisch et al 2010 use of ngs methods may be more relevant for studying certain water environments than others for example immediately following a disinfection process it is likely that a large portion of the genetic material present will be associated with inactivated cells or persisting extracellularly in contrast ngs is more promising for studying microorganisms in environments with more stable or slowly changing conditions affecting cell viability as would be expected in most other stages of water and wastewater treatment or in source waters and distribution systems improved methods are needed to accurately determine the viability of ngs targets quantitative capacity of ngs the quantitative capacity of ngs is another key dimension of importance for application in water and wastewater the ability to directly quantify targets is generally limited by sample and library preparation and on the normalization of samples to equal mass further during sequencing there is inherent variability in the number of reads obtained among samples therefore with metagenomics metatranscriptomics and targeted amplicon sequencing quantitative evaluation is usually restricted to a comparative fashion in terms of relative abundance i e by normalizing ngs data to a secondary metric internal to each sample such as number of reads percentage of total reads or number of reads annotated as a reference gene such as the 16s rrna gene nayfach and pollard 2016 weiss et al 2017 while relative abundances are highly informative and provide valuable information for understanding the composition and functional capacity of microbial communities in many cases it is often desirable to be able to measure microbial targets in terms of absolute abundance this is particularly important for informing risk assessment or for assessing infectious doses normalized ngs data has been transformed into absolute abundance data by pairing ngs measurements with independent quantifications of total cells or total 16s rrna genes garner et al 2016 vandeputte et al 2017 while this approach is promising further validation is needed achieving an appropriate sequencing depth and addressing differences in sequencing depth are also important for accurate and comparable quantification of microbial targets there are currently no standards for establishing the necessary depth or coverage of sequences for water or wastewater samples representing a key knowledge gap for facilitating comparison of samples across projects and ensuring sufficient reads are generated for each sample to capture genes of interest coverage and associated sequencing depth are likely to vary substantially based on the target environment i e drinking water wastewater etc as well as the target research question there are also a variety of approaches to address differences in sequencing depth among samples such as through application of rarefaction though no standards or consensus on appropriate methodologies currently exists mcmurdie and holmes 2014 weiss et al 2017 conclusion ngs technologies are revolutionizing microbial monitoring relevant to the water and wastewater industry including improving the ability to investigate topics such as taxonomic classification functional and catabolic gene characterization amr bacterial toxicity cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms and characterization of viruses ngs methods have been widely adopted for water research and are being translated to various applications in the water industry with new applications continuously emerging ngs has also recently been used to study the genome of sars cov 2 in wastewater nemudryi et al 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 while the application of ngs in water and wastewater practice presents many challenges such as cost need for specialized expertise and equipment challenges with data analysis and interpretation lack of standardized methods and the rapid pace of new technological developments the synthesis provided herein of the myriad of ways ngs tools can be applied helps pave a path forward for practical application of ngs for the water industry in sum ngs has already catalyzed transformative new understanding of the role and activities of microbes in water systems and with appropriate attention to addressing current limitations it is well poised for deeper integration into

17118,the emergence of next generation sequencing ngs is revolutionizing the potential to address complex microbiological challenges in the water industry ngs technologies can provide holistic insight into microbial communities and their functional capacities in water and wastewater systems thus eliminating the need to develop a new assay for each target organism or gene however several barriers have hampered wide scale adoption of ngs by the water industry including cost need for specialized expertise and equipment challenges with data analysis and interpretation lack of standardized methods and the rapid pace of development of new technologies in this critical review we provide an overview of the current state of the science of ngs technologies as they apply to water wastewater and recycled water in addition a systematic literature review was conducted in which we identified over 600 peer reviewed journal articles on this topic and summarized their contributions to six key areas relevant to the water and wastewater fields taxonomic classification and pathogen detection functional and catabolic gene characterization antimicrobial resistance amr profiling bacterial toxicity characterization cyanobacteria and harmful algal bloom identification and virus characterization for each application we have presented key trends noteworthy advancements and proposed future directions finally key needs to advance ngs technologies for broader application in water and wastewater fields are assessed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords next generation sequencing drinking water wastewater water reuse metagenomics metatranscriptomics introduction drinking water sources such as lakes and rivers treated drinking water and wastewater are all complex environments that span a range of water qualities in addition to being defined by variable physicochemical water quality characteristics these waters each comprise a rich and diverse microbial ecosystem even treated drinking water contains multitudes of microorganisms with 103 105 cells ml 1 typically detected in the water column hammes et al 2008 hoefel et al 2003 vital et al 2012 and 106 1011 cells cm 2 lining distribution system pipe walls in biofilms morvay et al 2011 zacheus et al 2001 understanding the composition of the microbial communities in these waters can be beneficial for detecting pathogens and improving our understanding of their ecological niches tracking changes in the abundance of organisms responsible for adverse effects such as corrosion or biofouling and characterizing the assemblages of microbiota responsible for degradation of contaminants and microbial substrates in treatment processes while monitoring of water sources and systems remains heavily reliant on culture based approaches for enumeration of pathogenic bacteria and indicator organisms these methods often vastly underestimate true microbial numbers failing to detect viable but non culturable vbnc cells slow growing phenotypes and organisms for which the nutritional requirements and environmental niches are not easily replicated in a laboratory setting alleron et al 2008 byrd et al 1991 staley 1985 the use of targeted molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has become prevalent but requires a priori knowledge of organisms of interest while offering little insight into overall microbial community dynamics the emergence of next generation sequencing ngs technologies is revolutionizing the use of molecular techniques for understanding complex microbial communities however the application of ngs in the water sector has been somewhat limited due to cost need for specialized expertise and equipment challenges with data analysis and interpretation lack of standardized methods and the rapid pace of new technological developments given the immense potential of ngs for improving our understanding of complex microbial communities in water and wastewater effort is needed to overcome these obstacles and make ngs technologies accessible to water professionals the objectives of this critical review are to 1 provide an overview of existing and emerging ngs technologies relevant to water and wastewater 2 synthesize published literature to assess the current state of the science for their application towards addressing key needs in the water sector and 3 identify needs for additional research and standards development that can promote the value and application of ngs more broadly in water and wastewater contexts the development of resources to support application of ngs more broadly not only by researchers but also by utilities and regulators is critical to facilitate advances towards understanding and tackling a wide array of grand challenges in providing preserving and protecting a clean and sustainable water supply ngs technologies ngs is used to describe a variety of high throughput nucleic acid i e deoxyribonucleic acid dna and ribonucleic acid rna sequencing technologies which now make it possible to directly and rapidly recover millions of dna or rna sequences from environmental samples shokralla et al 2012 ngs is a major advancement relative to the traditional first generation sequencing technology i e sanger sequencing which generates single sequences at a time at as much as two orders of magnitude higher cost per base pair bp niedringhaus et al 2011 short read sequencing technologies the majority of ngs studies published to date in the water and wastewater fields rely on the use of short read sequencing technologies primarily those marketed by illumina inc san diego ca studies relying on short read sequencing have also utilized other platforms including ion torrent semiconductor sequencing thermo fisher scientific inc and 454 pyrosequencing roche inc though the latter platform was discontinued in 2016 illumina sequencing produces millions or even billions of reads in each run ranging in length from 50 600 bp in this approach genomic dna or complementary dna cdna in the case of rna sequencing is fragmented or gene regions amplified and adapters are used to tether short dna fragments to the solid surface of a flow cell bridge amplification pcr serves to generate millions of copies of each dna fragment tethered to a solid surface resulting in the formation of millions of clusters the sequencing surface is flooded sequentially and repeatedly with each of the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates dntps i e adenine a thymine t guanine g cytosine c and as dntps complementary to the first available position in a single stranded template are incorporated fluorescent signals are emitted shendure and ji 2008 detection of fluorescent signals or lack thereof as is the case when dgtps are incorporated on newer illumina models unique to each dntp is used to generate a sequence corresponding to each cluster the ion torrent family of sequencing technologies also produces short read sequencing data but rather than detecting a fluorescent signal the instrument records base calls by detecting a change in ph that occurs upon nucleotide incorporation wanger et al 2017 instead of tethering dna fragments to a solid substrate to form clusters each template dna strand is tethered to a bead and amplified via emulsion pcr each bead is then loaded into a microwell on a chip with each well producing one of millions of reads short read sequencing technologies are advantageous because they are massively high throughput capable of producing millions of sequences for a single sample and accurate with researchers documenting 0 26 0 80 of base calls being erroneous on illumina and 1 71 on ion torrent instruments quail et al 2012 this ability to generate millions of sequences for each sample is critical if metagenomics is to be used to randomly subsample a mixed microbial community and obtain representative profiles of its composition the primary disadvantages associated with short read sequencing technologies are the inability to generate longer reads and cost analysis of short reads is limited in the ability to understand the context of sequenced genes for example often making it impossible to identify the organism of origin for a gene while the cost to generate sequencing data on a per base basis has plummeted from over 5000 per megabase mb in 2001 to just 0 01 per mb in 2015 dna sequencing costs data 2018 the cost of preparing dna for sequencing and of generating sufficient data to be representative of a complex microbial community can still be quite expensive and is often a barrier to adopting the technology long read sequencing while short read sequencing technologies have dominated the scientific literature with respect to water wastewater and other environmental applications single molecule long read sequencing a k a third generation sequencing is emerging as a powerful alternative the key advantage of long read sequencing methods is that they generate extremely long reads often producing dna sequences exceeding 20 kilobases kb in length ardui et al 2018 the ability to generate long reads is particularly valuable for sequencing genomes mobile genetic elements and entire operons without the need for assembly long reads are especially critical for understanding gene context and ascertaining with higher certainty from which organism a gene originates or which other genes flank a gene of interest further the ability of long read systems to sequence a single dna molecule eliminates the need for amplification steps such as pcr and associated biases two platforms dominate the long read market pacific biosciences inc and oxford nanopore while pacific biosciences offers a traditional lab based instrument oxford nanopore has developed a range of platforms including highly portable sequencing platforms that can be easily transported and operated on site the key disadvantage of long read sequencing methods is that they often have error rates as high as 5 13 ardui et al 2018 batovska et al 2017 limiting the ability to detect gene mutations or characterize hypervariable regions using these methods however adaptations to long read sequencing have been developed such as circular consensus sequencing that can vastly improve the accuracy of these methods with an average of 99 8 accuracy reported wenger et al 2019 additionally in december 2020 oxford nanopore introduced improvements to their promethion flow cells reported to have an accuracy as high as 99 1 oxford nanopore technologies 2020 while long read sequencing technologies have historically yielded shallower sequencing depths than short read platforms judge et al 2015 kranz et al 2017 recent advances have substantially improved long read output with the recent promethion advancements reporting outputs as high as 10 terabases oxford nanopore technologies 2020 ngs methodologies the application of ngs technologies relevant to the water industry generally can be classified into four subcategories whole genome sequencing wgs metagenomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing and targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions i e amplicon sequencing while there are numerous approaches in practice an example workflow for each ngs approach is presented in fig 1 whole genome sequencing wgs is a powerful means of characterizing microorganisms that have been isolated via culture based methods once isolated as a pure culture dna is extracted and sequenced typically via short read shotgun sequencing approaches short read data sets are then assembled to construct the whole genome sequence using either de novo or guided assembly de novo relies on assembling short reads to create full sequences without using a template while guided assembly maps reads to a specified reference genome ng and kirkness 2010 in cases where an organism has not been previously sequenced or when the species of the isolate is unknown as is often the case with isolates obtained from complex water and wastewater communities de novo assembly must be used de novo assembly is computationally challenging but several open source tools have been developed to facilitate this need such as idba ud peng et al 2012 spades bankevich et al 2012 velvet zerbino and birney 2008 and megahit li et al 2015a among others the principal disadvantage of short read sequencing technologies for wgs is that enrichment of the target organism in pure culture is typically required to generate sufficient uncontaminated dna for sequencing while wgs has typically relied on isolation culture and short read sequencing technologies the emergence of long read sequencing platforms capable of generating the sequence of a single dna molecule may advance and simplify wgs in the future shapiro et al 2013 use of these long read technologies is also advancing the field of wgs by providing greater genome coverage than short read technologies wgs has been applied extensively in the water and wastewater field to track sources of drinking water outbreaks garner et al 2019a raphael et al 2016 as well as to identify catabolic pathways associated with nutrient removal chao et al 2016 meng et al 2019 metagenomic sequencing metagenomic sequencing also known as shotgun metagenomic sequencing refers to the random subsampling and sequencing of genetic material from an environmental sample or other mixed community schloss and handelsman 2005 this approach has grown rapidly in its application to examining microbial communities and their functional capacities in water and wastewater typically relying on short read sequencing technologies reads are annotated to genes in existing databases to determine their taxonomic origin or putative functions for example metagenomics is now commonly applied to identify antibiotic resistance genes args garner et al 2018a stamps and spear 2020 zhang et al 2015 genes associated with nitrification and denitrification in wastewater cai et al 2016 ye et al 2012 catabolic genes involved in biodegradation folch mallol et al 2019 sidhu et al 2017 viruses bibby et al 2011 tamaki et al 2011 shifts or differences in overall microbial community structure brumfield et al 2020 hull et al 2017 and genes associated with pathogens from within a mixed community cui et al 2019 kumaraswamy et al 2014 li et al 2015a saleem et al 2018 metagenomics is also increasingly used to support the assembly of complete or partial genomes from short read sequencing data generated from uncultured microbial communities i e metagenomic assembled genomes mags alneberg et al 2018 handley et al 2014 while short read sequencing is common in metagenomic sequencing use of long read sequencing is also emerging e g driscoll et al 2017 metatranscriptomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing relies on principles similar to metagenomic sequencing but targets rna rather than dna rna sequencing is especially key for identifying rna viruses e g sars cov 2 although this is typically still referred to as metagenomics because it targets rna genomes rather than mrna transcripts metatranscriptomics also can be applied to directly sequence rna transcripts and thus yield greater insight into microbial activity than metagenomics for example targeting messenger rna mrna provides direct information about which genes are actually being expressed carvalhais et al 2012 sequencing transcribed mrna can similarly provide a picture of which microbes are functionally active however it is important to recognize that metatranscriptomics is often hampered by the fact that rna degrades rapidly in environmental samples degradation rates may differ among species making preservation and analysis of mrna challenging pascault et al 2014 and large technical and biological variation is often observed in metatranscriptomics datasets tsementzi et al 2014 approaches for preservation of rna have been applied to help reduce decay in sensitive samples for subsequent analysis kohl et al 2017 tap et al 2019 an excess of ribosomal rna rrna in transcriptomes also creates challenges in characterizing mrna in environmental samples thus application of methods that deplete rrna prior to sequencing are of great value in generating high quality mrna datasets he et al 2010 due in part to these challenges the application of metatranscriptomics has been limited relative to methods that target dna in full scale water and wastewater systems targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions targeted sequencing of amplified gene regions or amplicon sequencing relies on polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of a gene of interest followed by short read sequencing of the product most commonly this approach is applied to the 16s rrna gene which is universal to bacteria and archaea to determine the phylogeny i e evolutionary lineage or taxonomy of the members of the microbial community caporaso et al 2011 the method relies on the use of primers for pcr amplification that target highly conserved regions of the target gene but capture sufficient hypervariable regions to distinguish various forms of genes typically reads will be clustered based on similarity into operational taxonomic units or sequence variants and compared to existing databases to determine taxonomy although amplicon sequencing is powerful for resolving phylogenetic and taxonomic variation among members of microbial communities such approaches as applied to the 16s rrna gene are still most accurate at the phylum class and order levels with the ability to differentiate between microbes at the family genus species or strain level often limited amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna genes is often used to understand overarching shifts in microbial communities such as disturbances succession and temporal trends similar approaches have also been used to identify waterborne eukaryotes e g amoebae and protozoa by targeting the 18s rrna gene bradley et al 2016 fungal communities by targeting the internal transcribed spacer its region bokulich and mills 2013 and specific virus families for example by targeting the hexon gene specific to adenovirus iaconelli et al 2017 kuo et al 2015 commercial options are available that rely on this approach to target multiple gene targets simultaneously to profile multiple args or pathogens such as the ampliseq panels produced by thermo fisher scientific amplicon based approaches have become widely popular given their broad applicability and modest cost compared to metagenomic sequencing while short read sequencing is typically used to facilitate amplicon sequencing e g garner et al 2019b ji et al 2015 the use of long read sequencing to characterize amplicons is emerging haig et al 2018 applications of ngs sequencing for water and wastewater initially used to characterize soil bacterial diversity the application of ngs to environmental systems has grown to be commonly employed for studying a vast array of environments ranging from ancient permafrost samples d costa et al 2011 to surfaces in the international space station be et al 2017 venkateswaran et al 2014 ngs is now beginning to be proven as a valuable tool for expanding understanding of water wastewater and water reuse systems to synthesize the breadth of existing applications of ngs for studying water and wastewater a systematic review of the existing literature was conducted and key themes were identified as ways ngs is being applied to address water quality challenges criteria for inclusion and the methodology for the systematic literature review are detailed in the supplementary information si briefly a search was conducted of the clarivate analytics web of science database for studies published between january 1 2000 and december 31 2019 written in the english language a three tiered search strategy was employed to identify 1 studies that utilize ngs 2 studies focusing on water or wastewater environments that are related to the water industry and 3 studies that focus on key applications the specific search terms at each tier are detailed in the si the number of references identified in each tier are depicted in fig 2 in total 15 367 publications were identified that utilize ngs methodology of these 651 papers were returned via a keyword search as being relevant to the water industry and were further examined in this systematic review after manual exclusion of irrelevant publications six key application areas were identified where ngs is most commonly applied across drinking water source waters wastewater receiving water bodies and water reuse these areas include taxonomic classification and pathogen detection functional and catabolic gene characterization antimicrobial resistance amr profiling bacterial toxicity characterization cyanobacteria and harmful algal bloom identification and virus characterization the number of references for each application area identified within the water and wastewater area utilizing each ngs methodology are summarized in fig 3 and key findings of the systematic literature review are summarized in table 1 all articles compiled for this systematic review have been catalogued in a zotero library accessible at https www zotero org groups 2593738 pathogen detection and taxonomic classification in total 115 articles were identified that apply ngs for taxonomic studies of aquatic environments table s3 of these 77 utilized targeted sequencing of amplified hypervariable gene regions 74 targeting the 16s rrna gene three targeting its regions 26 utilized metagenomic sequencing and 18 utilized wgs sequencing across studies was primarily conducted on illumina platforms 82 with the second most prevalent being 454 pyrosequencing 18 ion torrent 5 nanopore 3 and pacbio 2 were far less common with the remaining studies using various outdated dna analysis technologies after 454 pyrosequencing was discontinued illumina s miseq became the dominant platform for amplicon sequencing 60 with the hiseq platforms primarily used for metagenomic studies bioinformatic approaches to amplicon sequencing of 16s rrna hypervariable regions used a handful of databases and software the most common being the rdp cole et al 2014 greengenes desantis et al 2006 silva quast et al 2013 patric davis et al 2020 and the national center for biotechnology information s ncbi refseq o leary et al 2016 databases with data typically analyzed utilizing qiime caporaso et al 2010 mothur schloss et al 2009 blast altschul et al 1990 or megan software huson et al 2007 or the mg rast meyer et al 2008 and rdp services cole et al 2014 freshwater environments were the focus of the majority of studies 81 including drinking water and drinking water distribution systems 28 premise plumbing and various drinking water infrastructure 22 and river water 21 wastewater treatment was analyzed in 16 studies including profiling the treatment train 10 biosolids 3 membrane bioreactors 2 activated sludge 2 and anaerobic digestion 1 general taxonomic surveys were the focus of 42 studies these studies examined the microbiomes of aquatic environments either through metagenomic or 16s rrna targeted sequencing to profile microbial communities and corresponding shifts in composition in response to various changes in condition with time to infer the effects of differential water quality parameters recently taxonomic surveys have revealed the surprising diversity of microbes inhabiting drinking water and drinking water distribution systems dwdss it has been discovered that drinking water microbiomes are strongly shaped by disinfectants water age pipe materials and seasonal and source water variations bae et al 2019 chiao et al 2014 douterelo et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2016 liu et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2016 pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 roeselers et al 2015 saleem et al 2018 shaw et al 2015 stamps et al 2018 wang et al 2014a for example potgieter et al 2018 performed a two year study of a full scale drinking water distribution system to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community across water age and disinfection regimes long term ngs studies are important as they avoid stochastic variations from single time point studies and can reveal the systemic processes infrastructure and environmental factors that affect the microbial communities in drinking water systems thus informing downstream management decisions in another exemplary study mansfeldt et al 2019 examined the impact of microbial residence time mrt on taxonomic composition in activated sludge the authors found that longer mrts resulted in a greater range of growth parameters enabling microorganism persistence thus increasing richness and diversity findings were verified using a model based on monod growth kinetics demonstrating the importance of efficient resource capture and survival during low production for persistence in activated sludge collectively such studies that utilize ngs to examine the underlying ecology of microbial systems make important progress towards addressing how microbiomes might be engineered to support effective degradation of wastewater substrates and optimize nutrient removal pathogen detection was a principal focus of the majority 79 of taxonomy related papers several important sub topics emerged with respect to studying pathogen profiles specifically including increasing the range and sensitivity of pathogens detected during screening of drinking water sources and recreational waters cui et al 2019 2017 fang et al 2018b haig et al 2018 hamner et al 2019 huang et al 2014 jin et al 2018 layton et al 2014 nadya et al 2016 shrestha et al 2019 2017 vadde et al 2019 vanmensel et al 2020 yang et al 2020 exploring pathogen content and ensuring adequate pathogen removal during wastewater treatment bibby et al 2010 cai and zhang 2013 chen et al 2019 guo and zhang 2012 harb and hong 2017 hembach et al 2019 huang et al 2018 leddy et al 2017 li et al 2015b lu et al 2015 osunmakinde et al 2019 wan et al 2018 yergeau et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and monitoring for pathogen regrowth during wastewater reuse applications and drinking water distribution and storage garner et al 2018b 2019a kumaraswamy et al 2014 obayomi et al 2019 proctor et al 2015 qin et al 2017 li et al 2015a used metagenomic sequencing of the influent activated sludge aeration basin biofilm aeration basin foam layer anaerobic digestion sludge and the final effluent of various wastewater treatment plants wwtp in hong kong to detect pathogens using a genetic marker taxonomic classifier metaphlan and a curated pathogen index the authors reported 98 removal efficiency of all pathogens and 4 log removal of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis from influent to effluent showing that secondary treatment is an effective means to reduce most bacterial pathogens in wastewater this study is important to the water industry because its straightforward bioinformatic workflow and application of engineering removal efficiencies closely resemble culture based and qpcr studies exemplifying the application of ngs for in situ pathogen detection and relative quantification in a related study kumaraswamy et al 2014 used amplicon sequencing with a nested pcr approach targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene paired with annotation against greengenes and a preconstructed human pathogenic bacteria 16s rrna database to assess the presence of potential pathogens in treated wastewater intended for reuse they found abundant pathogen markers in treated wastewater post disinfection that were not detected by culture particularly gram positive pathogens revealing an elevated health risk and warranting further screening and risk assessment these examples are of importance to the water industry because they highlight the utility of ngs techniques for pathogen screening to uncover trends in overall behavior of multiple putative pathogens that would not be possible by culturing thus more comprehensively informing downstream applications approximately one third 27 of the pathogen centered literature focused on monitoring opportunistic pathogens op such as pseudomonas aeruginosa mycobacterium avium and legionella spp in relevant water environments eleven studies assessed the epidemiological relationship between potential reservoirs of ops and patient isolates bartley et al 2016 david et al 2017 fitzhenry et al 2017 fleres et al 2018 graham et al 2014 lande et al 2019 lévesque et al 2016 2014 quick et al 2014 raphael et al 2016 runcharoen et al 2017 wüthrich et al 2019 for example bartley et al 2016 used wgs to analyze isolates from a hospital water distribution system infected patients and retrospective patients and found that a single l pneumophila population was responsible for all nosocomial infections in 2011 and 2013 wgs has proven to be an effective tool for real time outbreak investigations that rely on the rapid identification of the associated organisms to identify and mitigate sources of infection additionally nine studies focused on studying op colonization of cooling towers farhat et al 2018 fitzhenry et al 2017 lévesque et al 2014 llewellyn et al 2017 nakanishi et al 2019 paranjape et al 2020 pereira et al 2018 2017 wüthrich et al 2019 in parallel to studying the distribution of legionella in 196 cooling towers across eight us climate regions llewellyn et al 2017 used targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene to investigate the cooling tower microbial communities interestingly they found the taxonomic distributions were homogeneous across the u s method development and validation was the focus of 14 papers and focused largely on improving precision and sensitivity for targeted sequencing techniques albertsen et al 2015 bautista de los santos et al 2016 brandt and albertsen 2018 greay et al 2019 guo et al 2013 lee et al 2017 saingam et al 2018 sato et al 2019 spencer et al 2016 for example lee et al 2017 designed novel primer sets for 16s rrna gene amplification to increase the specificity for the cyanobacteria and proteobacteria phyla organism specific assays have also been developed for example pereira et al 2018 2017 developed genus specific ngs assays for both legionella spp and pseudomonas spp which employ organism specific pcr primer sets that target the 16s rrna hypervariable regions with the intent of increasing the taxonomic resolution to the species level this approach is particularly valuable in identifying potential risks associated with pathogen containing genera because methods that amplify the 16s rrna gene using conserved primers often lack the ability to resolve the presence of pathogenic species from genetically similar organisms sato et al 2019 developed a leptospira spp specific ngs assay to investigate epidemiological links in leptospirosis endemic regions of rural japan increasing the range and specificity of risk assessments in environmental waters there are many challenges associated with taxonomic profiling and pathogen screening of bacterial communities using ngs but the methods and platforms used are undoubtedly the most developed amongst other ngs applications the first challenge is that for any amplicon or shotgun based sequencing analysis an organism could still be present even if not detected i e false negatives sensitivity of microbial community analysis is dependent upon a multitude of factors including dna extraction methods pcr biases databases and classifiers used sequencing technique e g 16s rrna gene amplicon or metagenomic and most of all the sequencing depth albertsen et al 2015 brandt and albertsen 2018 guo et al 2013 yergeau et al 2016 none of which have been standardized a second challenge that the 16s rrna hypervariable region often does not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution for pathogen identification greay et al 2019 demonstrates that the v4 region did not exhibit the specificity necessary to differentiate the enterobacteriaceae family of gammaproteobacteria in wastewater a critical group of organisms for water quality monitoring this study also cross checked 16s rrna amplicons against the ncbi nucleotide collection nr nt and found that nine of the 12 pathogens detected were erroneously assigned using the greengenes database this issue is a systematic error that has most likely led to false positives in numerous ngs studies to date it should be noted that because strain level differentiation is often necessary only wgs has the resolution to reliably verify the presence of pathogens e g by lineage and presence of key virulence genes in contrast read based metagenomics and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing at best only provide a screen for the potential presence of pathogens by identifying genus or higher ranks of taxonomic classification however when sequencing coverage is sufficient mags can be generated from metagenomic data and support strain level resolution quince et al 2017a while ongoing method development and validation is important for improving the application of taxonomic characterization of water and wastewater microbial communities these methods are promising in their ability to characterize typical and atypical microbial communities in water systems and to screen for the presence of a broad range of pathogens while bypassing culture bias functional and catabolic gene characterization in total 82 records were identified that applied ngs for studying metabolic and other functional activity in drinking water wastewater and recycled water table s4 of these 70 studies were focused on genomic dna seven on rna and five on a combination of both dna and rna metagenomic sequencing was most common 67 followed by metatranscriptomics 7 or a combination of the two 5 of the remaining papers two utilized amplicon sequencing and one implemented wgs sequencing was primarily conducted on illumina based platforms such as hiseq 42 miseq 9 and nextseq 2 with roche 454 pyrosequencing making up the second largest sequencing technology 15 utilized the rest of the studies employed various platforms wastewater was the focus of the majority of studies targeting wastewater in general 5 a2o process 1 anaerobic digestion 7 anammox 2 activated sludge 14 industrial treatment 8 membrane bioreactors 1 microbial fuel cells 3 biosolids 2 and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion 2 characterization of functional genes in various drinking water sources was also prevalent aquifers groundwater 8 freshwater 1 freshwater sediments 5 lakes 5 and rivers streams 6 other studies targeted drinking water treatment and distribution systems 8 fracking 2 constructed wetlands 1 and petroleum reservoirs 1 functional annotation was conducted using a variety of predefined 74 and custom databases 9 a large majority of studies utilized some combination of the seed overbeek 2005 kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 cog galperin et al 2019 and or eggnog huerta cepas et al 2019 databases cog and kegg 3 cog eggnog and kegg 1 kegg 11 kegg and eggnog 3 kegg uniref100 and uniprot 1 seed and cog 1 seed and kegg 20 and seed 11 or the mg rast m5nr meyer et al 2008 databases 9 which combines non redundant sequences from genbank seed img uniprot kegg and eggnog databases though functional analysis played a major role in all of these studies only six applied it as the sole focus with 77 conducting it in conjunction with taxonomy based analysis several common themes emerged with respect to how ngs has been used to study metabolic and other functional activity in relevant water environments the most common application of functionally applied ngs was functional gene profiling either comprehensively or by examining specific functions of interest these applications were often conducted in tandem to some degree and were applied in 73 studies with 27 focused heavily on general characterizations and 46 focused on specific functional profiles of interest among the 27 studies the majority applied the seed cog eggnog and or kegg databases to characterize a wide range of functionalities including cellular processes metabolism and information storage and processing here the application of metagenomics aimed at identifying functional genes served primarily to shed light on biological processes in effect characterizing the functional profiles within collected samples or comparing them across samples for example douterelo et al 2018 applied ngs annotated using mg rast and cog functional levels 1 and 2 returning results for cellular processes signaling information storage processing metabolism and poorly characterized to characterize the differences between biofilm and bulk water functional profiles finding that they were habitat dependent similarly sidhu et al 2017 utilized the seed and kegg databases to comprehensively profile the differences between raw sewage and treated sludge from a wwtp finding key genes responsible for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation a number of additional studies also applied general functional analysis to characterize their specific environments using similar approaches cai et al 2016 delforno et al 2017a hemme et al 2015 ju et al 2014 mohan et al 2014 saxena et al 2018 song et al 2019 van rossum et al 2015 vikram et al 2016 in contrast to comprehensive profiling of functional genes a number of specific functions of interests were the focus of 46 of the 73 studies including nitrogen cycling metabolism bai et al 2013

and the impacts of disinfection chao et al 2013 mohan et al 2014 ye et al 2012 provide an exemplar of the ability for functional ngs to identify nitrogen related functional genes through utilization of the kegg database s annotation to quantify and characterize genes related to both nitrification and denitrification pathways in full scale and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors pinto et al 2016 also report metagenomic evidence for the presence of bacteria similar to nitrospira with the ability to completely oxidize ammonia to nitrate in a drinking water system i e comammox by discovering ammonia oxidation genes that were divergent from canonical ammonia oxidizers gou et al 2015 and yang et al 2014b provide examples of how functional ngs can be applied to characterize the methanogenesis pathways present in anaerobic digesters both of which found the acetoclastic pathway to be dominant douterelo et al 2018 applied metagenomics to characterize and compare differences between bulk water and biofilms within dwdss along with genes related to biofilm formation finding that that the functional profile differed between habitats and that biofilms preferentially possessed resistance mechanisms related to radical induced disinfection damage the majority of studies applying metagenomics focusing on identifying functional genes were aimed at assessing various metabolic processes with a wide breadth of environments and pathways examined aromatic compound degradation abbai and pillay 2013 bai et al 2013 delforno et al 2017a jadeja et al 2019 mason et al 2014 more et al 2014 sidhu et al 2017 silva et al 2013 yadav et al 2015 arsenic metabolism cai et al 2013 costa et al 2015 das et al 2017 edwardson and hollibaugh 2017 energy metabolism cleary et al 2018 hemme et al 2015 keller et al 2015 medeiros et al 2016 reid et al 2018 amino acid and fatty acid degradation emmanuel et al 2019 fang et al 2014 fang et al 2018a lu et al 2017 ma et al 2019a hydrogenases bai et al 2013 tomazetto et al 2015 varrone et al 2014 wexler et al 2005 and oxygenases bai et al 2013 fang et al 2013 jadeja et al 2014 mason et al 2014 silva et al 2013 singh et al 2010 yu and zhang 2012 were of wide interest in addition to the more general characterizations identified above for example cai et al 2016 effectively utilized metagenomics to reconstruct metabolic pathways related to methanogenesis and denitrification during a comparison of two biogas producing digesters in addition to finding that each digester had a high level of functional redundancy underlying their stability identification of novel functional genes was the focus of seven studies these studies utilized metagenomics to identify new genes and evaluate their functions for example folch mallol et al 2019 utilized metagenomics to describe a novel thioesterase gene involved in phenylacetic acid degradation seemingly phylogenetically related to actinobacterium additionally silva et al 2013 focused on novel genes pathways related to phenol and aromatic compound degradation by screening a metagenomic library for phenol hydroxylase genes and phenol degradation activity resulting in the identification of genes present in wastewater treatment involved in degradation of aromatic compound rather than directly examining functional genes inferring functional capacity from 16s rrna gene derived microbial taxonomy was the focus of 2 studies for example cleary et al 2018 applied picrust predictive functionality to two morphologically different cinachyrella samples from marine indonesian lakes with varying levels of connectivity to the sea with the goal of comparing bacterial and archaeal communities and their respective functional capabilities to each other and those found in lakes the authors noted pronounced differences between both morphospecies predicted functionality and shared enrichment of pathways related to energy metabolism stress response secondary metabolites and information processing when comparing both morphospecies to prokaryotic communities in water it should be noted however that approaches such as picrust are inherently limited because they indirectly infer functionality based on taxonomy rather than directly examining functional genes thus accuracy is subject to the extent to which the organisms detected are characterized bearing in mind that 16s rrna gene sequencing methods at best have genus level resolution while functions may vary at the strain level further the picrust developers caution that a nearest sequenced taxon index score of 0 03 is typically required to predict a target taxon at the species level and results should be carefully interpreted langille et al 2013 communities with diverse functional niches and the ability to adapt to different carbon sources would especially confound this approach thus while taxonomically derived functional inference methods may point to some potentially useful hypotheses for follow up study they should be applied with extreme caution to complex microbial communities such as those characteristic of wwtps and other water environments overall limited sample replication was apparent in a number of studies bedoya et al 2019 chao et al 2016 debroas et al 2009 li et al 2019 medeiros et al 2016 reid et al 2018 sánchez reyez et al 2017 xia et al 2018 which was likely a result of the high costs associated with implementation of ngs challenges in characterizing complex metabolisms characteristic of wastewater treatment and a high proportion of poorly characterized hits during functional annotation were widely noted which was impacted by limited databases for annotation roughly half of all studies were devoted to activated sludge reactors and anaerobic digesters which are characterized by a relatively strong foundational understanding of key microbiological processes involved however focusing on snapshots of singular processes fails to provide context with respect to how functional profiles change temporally and spatially throughout treatment trains and continued operation the lack of a substantial functional understanding of multiple treatment processes is especially notable with advanced treatment processes where no studies were found that functionally analyzed advanced treatment trains for recycled water or potable reuse waters it is worth noting that metagenomics has been applied to characterize the function of microbial communities associated with some emerging technologies in the water and wastewater field specifically in the form of bioelectrochemical systems and microbial fuel cells kiseleva et al 2015 varrone et al 2014 yu et al 2018 in general future research would benefit from better coupling of functional profiles to operational conditions and water quality data collectively available literature provides a good foundation for functional based metagenomic analysis with methods devoted to common metabolic pathways nitrogen cycling and general functional profiling being the most well developed at this stage metagenomics aimed at elucidating functional capacity of microbial communities is an important contribution to the water industry as these methods facilitate mechanistic understanding of microbial processes that can support improved engineering of water and wastewater treatment processes antimicrobial resistance in total 56 studies were identified that applied ngs for examining amr in relevant water environments table s5 of these 54 utilized metagenomic sequencing three utilized wgs one utilized metatranscriptomics and two utilized targeted sequencing to amplify the 16s rrna gene to provide insight into the relationship between microbial community and arg profiles wastewater raw sewage and biosolids were the focus of the majority 34 of studies followed by environmental source waters 34 drinking water treatment trains and distribution 7 and reclaimed water 2 several common themes emerged with most studies primarily focused on profiling resistomes i e args carried collectively across the microbial community in both pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria additionally studies applied wgs towards examining resistant isolates derived from water systems while other studies systematically evaluated how water treatment mechanisms shape resistomes several studies utilized metagenomics to probe wastewater effluents with specific emphasis on hospital and antibiotic manufacturing wastewaters as potential hotspots for args baral et al 2018 chu et al 2017 fróes et al 2016 garrido cardenas et al 2017 guo et al 2017 gupta et al 2018 hendriksen et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 lekunberri et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2019c ng et al 2017 rowe et al 2016 schlüter et al 2008 szczepanowski et al 2008 tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014a additionally these studies often used assembly of short reads to assess the co occurrence of args with mobile genetic elements mge and metal resistance genes mrg this is important information in terms of assessing the potential for args to be mobilized among bacterial populations or to be co cross selected by other agents such as metals while most published studies to date employ short read sequencing a few more recent studies have begun to apply long read sequencing for example che et al 2019 used nanopore sequencing to identify args associated with plasmids the majority of studies have examined wastewater and the effects of effluent on receiving environments but water reuse and drinking water are also of interest for amr monitoring as potential direct routes of exposure chao et al 2013 dai et al 2018b douterelo et al 2018 garner et al 2018a jia et al 2019 ma et al 2019b yang et al 2013 in one study combining metagenomics and metatranscriptomics liu et al 2019c noted that only 65 percent of args identified by metagenomics in activated sludge were actively transcribed the presence of unexpressed args remains a concern as they could still be expressed in clinical situations when antibiotics are applied but such a study helps identify treatment processes that may also induce expression and likely selection of bacteria carrying args identifying how specific wastewater and drinking water treatment processes impact the resistome was the focus of 8 studies several studies concluded that chlorination can selectively increase the relative abundance of args compared to other genes chao et al 2013 jia et al 2019 kumar et al 2018 shi et al 2013 other studies have utilized metagenomics to characterize how activated sludge and bench scale digesters can alter selection pressure with respect to args encoding clinically relevant resistance bengtsson palme et al 2016 christgen et al 2015 yadav and kapley 2019 zhang et al 2015 understanding how specific treatment processes affect resistomes is critical in generating practical recommendations for the water industry sequencing resistant isolates derived from water systems was the focus of four studies where wgs was applied towards characterizing args and mges in bacteria such as e coli cameron et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 parsley et al 2010 roy et al 2018 in particular wgs enables a high degree of confidence in assembly which in turn improves the ability to characterize mechanisms of resistance and assess co occurrence of args with mges and other genes of interest coupled with phylogenetic analysis wgs can be applied towards assessing mechanisms by which amr is evolving across strains sequencing resistant e coli and enterococcus fecal indicators already in mainstream use by the water industry may enable monitoring of background resistance and sequencing can help identify if new resistance patterns are emerging fróes et al 2016 while the use of ngs technologies is critical for the water industry in characterizing the breadth of amr in water and wastewater systems that cannot be fully captured with culture or traditional molecular methods there are still critical knowledge gaps regarding how to best apply these technologies towards guiding management of these systems for the purpose of mitigating the spread of amr elements guidance is still needed to assess the utility of various ngs derived metrics and the extent to which they provide information about ecologically important processes or represent risk to human health for example the relative abundance of total args is thought to be indicative of the degree to which environmental conditions select for carriage of args across a microbial community while absolute abundance of total args is arguably a more direct indicator of magnitude of health risk additional guidance is needed in terms of how to most meaningfully normalize metagenomic data in a manner that enhances quantitative capacity and comparability across systems notably conclusions with respect to relative comparisons across samples can be substantially influenced as a function of sequencing platform sequencing depth and sample type many published studies employ assembly of short reads to assess co occurrences of args mges mrgs and pathogens but the lack of a means to verify if assemblies are correct is a major shortcoming additionally the quantitative value of metagenomic data is lost after assembling thus long read sequencing which eliminates the need for assembly holds particular promise for amr monitoring vastly increasing confidence in identification of bacterial hosts of args and their co occurrence with mges mrgs or other genes of interest wwtps in particular have been identified as key nodes both for the control and dissemination of amr and thus are an ideal point for surveillance of amr in a community and mitigation of args prior to release to the environment systematic evaluation of the efficacy of various treatment technologies for addressing amr would be beneficial bacterial toxicity in total 24 studies were identified that apply ngs for studying bacterial toxicity in relevant water environments table s6 of these records nine utilized metagenomic sequencing 13 utilized targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and two utilized both metagenomic sequencing and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing wastewater and drinking water were the focus of the majority 6 each of studies followed by groundwater 5 aquifer 2 surface water 2 sediment 2 and constructed wetlands 1 the toxic compounds most frequently studied were free chlorine 5 arsenic 5 other heavy metals 5 nanomaterials 2 and multiple other compounds twenty two studies met the criteria for both toxicity and amr searches and were addressed above in the amr section the effects of toxic contaminants in water sources and how they shift the microbial community were the focus of 13 studies these studies examined both natural and anthropogenic pollutants heavy metals costa et al 2015 hemme et al 2010 arsenic cai et al 2013 das et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 layton et al 2014 and hydrocarbon abbai and pillay 2013 fahrenfeld et al 2017 impacts were often studied in ground and surface water as well as stream sediments anthropogenic contaminants such as nanomaterials binh et al 2014 liu et al 2019a tetrachloroethene reiss et al 2016 and combinations of multiple pollutants lu et al 2017 sonthiphand et al 2019 were examined in aquifers constructed wetlands and surface water in general these studies examined shifts in microbial community composition and function that occurred due to exposure to pollutants for example fahrenfeld et al 2017 applied metagenomics to investigate how the microbial community shifted along a stream running through an unconventional oil and gas disposal facility the authors found that this wastewater release was associated with shifts in the microbial community structure and functions including functions related to dormancy and sporulation respiration and antimicrobial resistance similarly sonthiphand et al 2019 applied 16s rrna amplicon sequencing to investigate the impact of anthropogenic activities on the diversity abundance and dynamics of microbial communities in groundwater the authors found that microbial communities tended to cluster by the nature of the impact specifically adjacent landfills agricultural land and community areas these two examples provide helpful background understanding with respect to how toxins or pollutants can impact microbial communities associated with drinking water sources examining microbial communities in drinking water treatment plants wwtps and distribution or collection systems was the focus of nine studies for example some of the studies involving drinking water treatment plants examined the microbes within sand filters bai et al 2013 huang et al 2014 and after disinfection huang et al 2014 results indicated that microbial activity is important in removing harmful materials such as heavy metals arsenate and aromatic compounds free chlorine disinfection was found to reduce certain genera while enriching others as well as mges carrying virulence factors huang et al 2014 several studies have profiled how toxic compounds impact microbial communities in dwdss douterelo et al 2018 saleem et al 2018 shaw et al 2015 in wastewater reclamation and distribution systems lin et al 2016 and in sewer biofilms gomez alvarez et al 2012 for example douterelo et al 2018 applied metagenomics to investigate the taxonomy and gene functions characteristic of biofilm and bulk water within a chlorinated dwds the authors identified mechanisms of resistance and damage repair to external stressors such as chlorine and antibiotics within the biofilms this study is an example of how metagenomic studies of dwdss may help indicate infrastructure or treatment failures thereby protecting and promoting water quality and safety one study was identified by the toxicity search criteria but did not fall within any of the aforementioned sub categories handley et al 2014 assembled the whole genome of candidatus sulfuricurvum sp from an aquifer derived metagenome while this approach has been employed to assemble complete genomes of uncultured microorganisms in other environments this endeavor is inherently limited by achievable sequencing depth alneberg et al 2018 the authors identified genes indicative of heavy metal and arsenic tolerance which they presumed to be related to heavy metal contamination within the aquifer in summary ngs studies involving antimicrobial or toxic compounds in water primarily focused on how these compounds shifted the microbial community in contaminated water environments or within the drinking or wwtp or distribution collection systems of particular relevance to the water industry is new understanding being gained by examining the impact of free chlorine primarily in drinking water disinfection cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms in total 29 studies were identified that applied ngs to study cyanobacteria in freshwater drinking water and wastewater table s7 of these 6 utilized metagenomic sequencing 4 utilized metatranscriptomic sequencing 18 utilized targeted sequencing of the 16s rrna gene 2 utilized both targeted and metagenomic sequencing and 1 utilized both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing freshwater was the focus of the majority 20 of studies including lakes 18 rivers 1 and reservoirs 1 followed by drinking water 6 wastewater 3 and aquatic biofilms 1 several common themes emerged as ways ngs has been used to study cyanobacteria in relevant water environments including characterization of cyanobacterial communities especially toxic strains in source water and water treatment systems identification of shifts in gene expression and control and removal of cyanobacteria in wastewater or drinking water targeted sequencing with an emphasis on 16s rrna gene and metagenomic sequencing were the main ngs approaches used to study the cyanobacterial genome and its position in the microbial communities relevant to freshwater abia et al 2018 bakal et al 2019 driscoll et al 2017 eiler et al 2013 ghai et al 2014 hou et al 2019 kurilkina et al 2016 kurobe et al 2018 lee et al 2017 pope and patel 2008 qin et al 2019 reza et al 2018 saleem et al 2019 steffen et al 2015 vadde et al 2019 drinking water kori et al 2019 otten et al 2016 pei et al 2017 saleem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 or wastewater lee et al 2017 lu and lu 2014 for example kurobe et al 2018 applied metagenomic sequencing to investigate the shift in the cyanobacterial community from freshwater to brackish water during a microcystis bloom in the san francisco estuary they found microcystis was the predominant genus among cyanobacteria in both freshwater and brackish water with up to six microcystis genotypes identified these studies emphasize the importance of ngs approaches for tracking cyanobacterial communities especially toxic and bloom forming genera in freshwater systems in another exemplar otten et al 2016 utilized metagenomic sequencing to identify taste and odor producers and toxin producing cyanobacteria in a drinking water reservoir their results indicated that anabaena spp microcystis spp and an unresolved member of the order oscillatoriales are potentially responsible for some chemicals that produce taste or odor including geosmin microcystin and 2 methylisoborneol this research highlighted the need to apply ngs approaches to monitor cyanobacteria that have a negative impact on the drinking water quality identification of shifts in gene expression associated with metabolic pathways was the focus of seven studies chen et al 2018 davenport et al 2019 hampel et al 2019 harke et al 2016 mou et al 2013 pascault et al 2014 most of these papers emphasized cyanobacterial gene expression at different times and under different nutrient conditions during a bloom season for example davenport et al 2019 observed diel shifts in metabolic pathways of microcystis spp during a 48 h survey using metatranscriptomic sequencing daytime gene transcripts favored photosynthesis and nutrient uptake whereas nighttime transcripts were primarily related to protein synthesis lee et al 2017 similarly hampel et al 2019 analyzed shifts in gene expression using metatranscriptomic sequencing under a high nitrogen condition in early summer and a low nitrogen condition in late summer and found toxic planktothrix and microcystis relied heavily on regenerated ammonium when the nitrogen level became low in late summer these studies addressed the need for ngs approaches to track the impacts of different time scales and nutrient conditions on the evolution of the cyanobacterial community and their gene expression levels and suggested potentially useful nutrient control methods to reduce toxic cyanobacteria in freshwater and water treatment systems characterization of cyanobacteria in source water was the focus of 16 studies abia et al 2018 bakal et al 2019 driscoll et al 2017 eiler et al 2013 ghai et al 2014 hou et al 2019 kurilkina et al 2016 kurobe et al 2018 lee et al 2017 lu and lu 2014 pope and patel 2008 qin et al 2019 reza et al 2018 saleem et al 2019 steffen et al 2012 vadde et al 2019 xu et al 2018 while an additional five looked at cyanobacteria in water treatment systems kori et al 2019 otten et al 2016 pei et al 2017 saleem et al 2018 xu et al 2018 control and removal of cyanobacteria in wastewater or drinking water was the focus of two studies bai et al 2014 zamyadi et al 2019 these studies utilized ngs to investigate the influence of different water treatment processes on cyanobacterial communities in the relevant water environment bai et al 2014 applied both targeted amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing to assess the impacts of treated and untreated wastewater discharges on bacterial communities in the river and concluded untreated water resulted in an increase of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria zamyadi et al 2019 proposed a critical control point for cyanobacteria removal in the drinking water treatment process they applied ngs along with microscopic analysis and cell integrity methods and found after pre oxidation treatment the remaining cyanobacterial cells 80 were undamaged with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post kmno4 treatment particularly in clarifier sludge both studies highlighted the importance of water treatment to control and remove potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the water systems and the need to apply ngs to improve the monitoring and management of water quality in summary the focus of the majority of cyanobacterial studies using ngs approaches is on the characterization of cyanobacterial communities in both source water and water treatment systems followed by evaluating of gene expressions key questions investigated included identification of community structure and toxic strains during bloom seasons and shifts in gene expressions under different environmental and nutrient conditions the remaining studies not covered in detail in this section only discussed cyanobacterial metagenomics as part of the larger bacterial or prokaryotic community rather than being the main focus characterization of viruses in total 80 records were identified that applied ngs for studying viruses in wastewater recycled water and freshwater table s8 of these records 54 utilized metagenomic sequencing 12 utilized wgs and 14 utilized targeted sequencing 5 targeting the hypervariable human adenovirus hexon gene 8 targeting specific enteroviruses and 1 targeting phage borne 16s rrna sequences wastewater was the focus of the majority 49 of studies followed by freshwater 30 including lakes 17 streams or rivers 4 and surface water 3 groundwater 1 and reclaimed water 1 several common themes emerged from the systematic review of how ngs has been used to study viruses in relevant water environments including characterization of environments method development and genotyping virome characterization of water environments was the focus of 54 studies the majority of these papers reported viromes of previously unstudied environments e g untreated sewage adriaenssens et al 2018 cantalupo et al 2011 ng et al 2012 o brien et al 2017 strubbia et al 2019a tamaki et al 2011 wang et al 2018 dairy lagoons alhamlan et al 2013 and freshwater lakes djikeng et al 2009 gong et al 2016 green et al 2015 gu et al 2018 hewson et al 2012 hewson et al 2018 hornstra et al 2019 kavagutti et al 2019 malki et al 2015 mohiuddin and schellhorn 2015 okazaki et al 2019 palermo et al 2019 rosario et al 2009 sible et al 2015 skvortsov et al 2016 tamaki et al 2011 tseng et al 2013 watkins et al 2016 specific topics of interest within these studies included viral pathogen identification dna or rna virome characterization virus host interactions phage diversity and arg characterization within viruses tamaki et al 2011 used ngs to characterize dna viruses throughout the wastewater treatment process this study highlighted the uniqueness of the virome of wastewater compared to 42 other environmental settings bibby and peccia 2013 utilized ngs to characterize the virome of sewage sludge with a focus on describing the diversity of human viruses and understanding the risks associated with land application this study expanded our knowledge of human pathogenic viruses in wastewater samples and demonstrates that ngs can be used to identify human viruses in environmental samples nine studies focused on method development particularly improving methods to study viruses in aquatic environments bekliz et al 2019 brinkman et al 2018 fernandez cassi et al 2018 hjelmsø et al 2017 labonte 2016 oshiki et al 2018 strubbia et al 2019b uyaguari diaz et al 2016 these studies mainly focused on methods to concentrate purify or extract viral nucleic acid from various water samples for example hjelmsø et al 2017 compared four viral particle concentration methods and four different extraction kits to evaluate viral community composition specificity richness and pathogen detection of raw sewage using ngs similarly fernandez cassi et al 2018 developed an optimized ultracentrifugation method or skimmed milk flocculation when ultracentrifugation is not available to concentrate viruses and target adenovirus and other viruses that could not always be detected using metagenomics this study addresses the sensitivity necessary for ngs to investigate the sewage virome to track human pathogens and highlights the importance of using viral metagenomics for public health surveillance viral genotyping using next generation amplicon or wgs was the subject of 12 studies boonchan et al 2017 brinkman et al 2017 fumian et al 2019 hata et al 2018b 2018b 2018a kaas et al 2019 majumdar et al 2018 mancini et al 2019 ogorzaly et al 2015 oshiki et al 2018 suffredini et al 2018 yoshitomi et al 2017 these studies used ngs to characterize the diversity of pathogenic viruses including adenovirus astrovirus and norovirus in wastewater or sewage impacted surface water for example hata et al 2018a used this approach to study occurrences of norovirus sapovirus rotavirus aichi virus and enterovirus they concluded that norovirus gii 17 strains were prevalent in surface water impacted by wastewater before becoming prevalent in gastroenteritis patients in japan oshiki et al 2018 used a microfluidic nested pcr approach combined with ngs amplicon sequencing to detect and genotype 11 human pathogenic rna viruses in human stool and sewage these studies prove the usefulness of using amplicon based ngs to study molecular epidemiology and monitor the emergence of viral pathogens using wastewater surveillance undoubtedly there are significant challenges associated with application of metagenomics for the study of viruses compared to other microorganisms behzad et al 2015 prussin et al 2014 rose et al 2016 simmonds 2015 the first challenge is that viruses do not share a conserved gene thus profiling viromes can only be achieved via shotgun metagenomics not targeted gene amplification ghurye et al 2016 shotgun metagenomics requires a substantial mass of genomic material which is particularly difficult to obtain from viruses in environmental samples in which concentrations are low behzad et al 2015 prussin et al 2014 one way to overcome this challenge is by collecting large sample volumes e g hundreds of liters breitbart et al 2002 rodriguez brito et al 2010 rosario et al 2009 however this is both time intensive and time sensitive even with proper precautions during sampling and nucleic acid extraction contaminants that could degrade genetic material may be introduced second many viruses have rna as their genetic material which degrades much more rapidly than dna if the rna degrades before sequencing there would be false negatives in the virome analysis and many potentially important viruses could be overlooked the third significant challenge associated with viral ngs is that reference databases are very limited especially compared to those for bacteria and fungi bibby and peccia 2013 suggested that less than one percent of viruses have been sequenced and uploaded to databases and they demonstrated that over 75 of viruses in sewage sludge are unidentifiable to improve viral databases viruses must first be isolated cultured and subjected to wgs prussin et al 2014 rohwer and edwards 2002 however viruses are very difficult to culture because they require a host e g bacteria for bacteriophages and some viruses are simply unculturable using current tools and approaches finally there is no standard user friendly data analysis pipeline for viromes as exists for bacterial archaeal 16s rrna genes e g qiime most virome pipelines require extensive bioinformatics and or computer science backgrounds with improved tools our knowledge of viruses in water and wastewater using ngs will rapidly improve however presently our understanding of viruses is fragmented especially in water and wastewater as such viruses have been described as the forgotten siblings of the microbiome family williams 2013 knowledge gaps and research needs need for standardized methods the field of ngs is rapidly evolving with a continually emerging pipeline of new platforms library preparation techniques and data analysis approaches such an expanse of evolving options creates challenges to ensuring that data collected across studies is comparable which is critical for informing broader conclusions across studies differences in sample volume dna extraction method library preparation method ngs platform read length sequencing depth and data quality filtering are all critical aspects of ngs that are not standardized and make it difficult to compare results thus standardized methods are critically needed to overcome key differences in approaches as well as to facilitate the adoption of ngs technologies by new stakeholders such as water utilities birko et al 2015 however the development of standardized methods for ngs application for studying water and wastewater should allow flexibility for the design of research studies aimed at asking novel questions that may not strictly conform to standard approaches as the utility of ngs to different sectors of the water and wastewater industry increases several agencies could potentially play a role in standardization of these methods for application in environmental samples for example the u s environmental protection agency u s centers for disease control and prevention world health organization national institute of standards and technology and clinical and laboratory standards institute sample processing substantial variability in methodology exists for sample collection concentration and extraction of dna and rna and can have critical impacts on downstream ngs analysis while the type of membrane used for sample concentration has been shown to have no discernable impact on microbial community structure djurhuus et al 2017 there are likely to be substantial differences based on whether hollow fiber filtration or precipitation and centrifugation is used compared to membrane filtration past studies have demonstrated that different dna extraction kits used with water and wastewater samples tend to produce microbial communities and resistomes that are largely similar but inconsistencies can be introduced by certain extraction kits or methods due to contamination or methodologies that favor certain groups of organisms i e gram negative vs gram positive djurhuus et al 2017 li et al 2017 walden et al 2017 sample matrix also likely has an impact on the optimum extraction method given that separation of microorganisms from complex organic matrices and carrier materials varies between matrices sanz and köchling 2019 biomass is expected to vary substantially by sample matrix and low biomass environments such as drinking water are likely to require more extensive concentration than more microbially dense environments this introduces challenges for comparison across water environments i e water wastewater sediment biofilm etc standardization of pre processing methods to collect and prepare samples for ngs is critical for producing comparable results across water and wastewater systems bioinformatic analysis the continuous optimization and declining costs of sequencing platforms have facilitated generation of a vast volume of sequencing data however rendering these deposited data into meaningful results that can inform decision making in the water industry is an ongoing challenge the analysis of ngs data largely depends on principles and standards established by the broader genomics community such as sequencing protocols and controls read mapping algorithms assembly algorithms methods for phylogenetic analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping however each step poses a variety of challenges that are briefly described below quality control qc is one of the most critical steps in the processing of ngs data it usually involves removing or trimming low quality reads and the unwanted sequences such as sequencing adapters host contamination that could pose problems in the downstream analysis as different datasets have their own characteristics and challenges it is advised to formulate the qc protocol that is best suited for the specific dataset in consideration for example metatranscriptome datasets could be contaminated with rrna transcripts that needs to be removed prior to any downstream analysis esteve codina 2018 similarly the qc tools framed for reads generated on short read platform may not be appropriate for reads generated on long reads platform due to the inherent differences in the two sequencing technologies fukasawa et al 2020 the traditional approach used for collectively detecting genes across microbial communities is using read alignment tools to annotate genomic or metagenomic data and applying a similarity search against a reference sequence using a best hit approach wilke et al 2013 the basic principle lies on the assumption that genes sharing homology perform similar functions however even a single base pair change in sequence can alter protein function thus the choice of stringency used in homology based annotation can substantially affect the interpretation and reproducibility of the data randle boggis et al 2016 for example a lower percentage identity cutoff will fail to differentiate two highly similar sequences while the best hit approach remains the most popular annotation strategy it is prone to producing a high rate of false positives randle boggis et al 2016 sequencing aimed at characterizing snps is still an under explored topic as it requires cost intensive deep sequencing with high coverage of sequenced genomes de novo assembly i e assembly conducted based on overlapping reads rather than mapping reads to reference genomes holds promise for overcoming the high false positive rates associated with the best hit approach applied to short reads while various assemblers are available to tackle complex ngs data it is advised to be cautious while selecting the appropriate assembler as different datasets metagenomics metatranscriptomics have their own challenges shakya et al 2019 further assembly is computationally expensive and often generation of contigs of sufficient length for target analyses is limited when faced with high microbial diversity characteristic of water samples often too few contigs are produced and with low confidence in accuracy diminishing the ability to carry out meaningful downstream analyses genome resolved assembly of metagenomic sequencing data though limited by the ability to obtain sufficient coverage holds promise for a wide range of applications including the ability to construct genomes of uncultured organisms and linking metabolism and function to phylogeny c quince et al 2017b the vast quantities of sequencing data being produced also create challenges for computational demands and data storage although public repositories such as the ncbi sequence read archive and the european nucleotide archive are readily used to publicly store and share metagenomic data substantial computational resources are still required to carry out in house analyses which can be a significant challenge to the application of ngs by the water industry one possible solution to tackle this issue is to establish a cloud based infrastructure which is readily used by many biotechnology companies ngs holds the capability of revolutionizing the water industry by providing a plethora of tools and frameworks to analyze water and wastewater microbial communities however owing to the daunting complexity of metagenomics an interdisciplinary work force composed of engineers and bioinformaticians will likely be needed to perform these analyses and inform decision making building such a work force would be essential in implementing and maintaining ngs capabilities in the water industry availability of annotation databases there are numerous well curated databases available for annotating ngs reads as demonstrated in table 2 while these databases are useful for annotating microbial phylogenetic origin and for key functional capacities such as antibiotic resistance many key attributes are missing from the available databases for example very little information is available regarding non bacterial microorganisms such as viruses amoebae and fungi which are often highly important in water and wastewater in addition few databases are available that curate metabolic genes making it difficult to screen samples for functional capacity the need for well curated databases is a critical limitation that often encumbers the study of emerging topics via ngs technologies determination of viability as with all techniques targeting dna most ngs techniques are unable to directly distinguish dna originating from live versus dead cells metatranscriptomics has been used to overcome this obstacle by targeting mrna rather than dna given that mrna is produced only by live cells and associated only with genes that are actively transcribed moran 2009 however this approach is particularly challenging for analyzing low biomass water samples such as those collected from drinking water which typically contain very low rna concentrations rna also degrades rapidly in the environment and is prone to contamination by hosts e g human cells in wastewater bashiardes et al 2016 the application of membrane impermeable intercalating dyes such as propidium monoazide pma and ethidium monoazide ema have also been used to address challenges in detecting live vs dead cells while these methods initially showed great promise and raised significant interest among researchers for differentiating live and dead cells bae and wuertz 2009 chen et al 2011 hellein et al 2012 vesper et al 2008 yáñez et al 2011 many have highlighted critical limitations and shortcomings with the approach such as a lack of reproducibility scaturro et al 2016 tavernier and coenye 2015 taylor et al 2014 matrix interference taylor et al 2014 need for optimization according to target organism and sample characteristics taylor et al 2014 and ability to penetrate some intact cells flekna et al 2007 kobayashi et al 2009 nocker et al 2006 flow cytometry using cell sorting for differentiating live versus dead cells has been employed and paired with ngs in some studies berney et al 2007 hammes et al 2008 kahlisch et al 2010 use of ngs methods may be more relevant for studying certain water environments than others for example immediately following a disinfection process it is likely that a large portion of the genetic material present will be associated with inactivated cells or persisting extracellularly in contrast ngs is more promising for studying microorganisms in environments with more stable or slowly changing conditions affecting cell viability as would be expected in most other stages of water and wastewater treatment or in source waters and distribution systems improved methods are needed to accurately determine the viability of ngs targets quantitative capacity of ngs the quantitative capacity of ngs is another key dimension of importance for application in water and wastewater the ability to directly quantify targets is generally limited by sample and library preparation and on the normalization of samples to equal mass further during sequencing there is inherent variability in the number of reads obtained among samples therefore with metagenomics metatranscriptomics and targeted amplicon sequencing quantitative evaluation is usually restricted to a comparative fashion in terms of relative abundance i e by normalizing ngs data to a secondary metric internal to each sample such as number of reads percentage of total reads or number of reads annotated as a reference gene such as the 16s rrna gene nayfach and pollard 2016 weiss et al 2017 while relative abundances are highly informative and provide valuable information for understanding the composition and functional capacity of microbial communities in many cases it is often desirable to be able to measure microbial targets in terms of absolute abundance this is particularly important for informing risk assessment or for assessing infectious doses normalized ngs data has been transformed into absolute abundance data by pairing ngs measurements with independent quantifications of total cells or total 16s rrna genes garner et al 2016 vandeputte et al 2017 while this approach is promising further validation is needed achieving an appropriate sequencing depth and addressing differences in sequencing depth are also important for accurate and comparable quantification of microbial targets there are currently no standards for establishing the necessary depth or coverage of sequences for water or wastewater samples representing a key knowledge gap for facilitating comparison of samples across projects and ensuring sufficient reads are generated for each sample to capture genes of interest coverage and associated sequencing depth are likely to vary substantially based on the target environment i e drinking water wastewater etc as well as the target research question there are also a variety of approaches to address differences in sequencing depth among samples such as through application of rarefaction though no standards or consensus on appropriate methodologies currently exists mcmurdie and holmes 2014 weiss et al 2017 conclusion ngs technologies are revolutionizing microbial monitoring relevant to the water and wastewater industry

17119,this paper provides new insight into how the hydraulic transients that occur within drinking water distribution networks can mobilise material adhered to the pipe wall and hence cause unacceptable water quality and customer dissatisfaction results are reported from extensive representative physical experiments covering a wide range of repeatable rapidly accelerating and decelerating hydraulic conditions novel time synchronous analysis shows that mobilisation always occurs in the first dynamic surge of the transient however differences in the physical processes that govern mobilisation were observed between the two groups of transient type studied a function to estimate the mobilising force is proposed and applied to the physical experiments performed the research provides important insights for identifying and understanding the mechanisms and forces induced during transients vital for ensuring the supply of safe drinking water in operational distribution systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydraulic transients mobilisation water quality drinking water distribution systems 1 introduction poor water quality in drinking water distribution systems dwds can threaten public health through outbreaks of infectious water related diseases and cause customer dissatisfaction and significant economic costs identifying the processes and forces that led to water quality failures is therefore crucial only when these processes are examined and understood can effective management strategies by developed to maintain safe and acceptable drinking water a risk to water quality exists when adhered particles such as metals chemical contaminants pathogens are mobilised from the pipe wall boxall and saul 2005 such material is known to build up ubiquitously on the surface of all pipes comprising dwds as a function of the bulk water quality corrosion and other deterioration of the assets themselves husband and boxall 2016 mobilisation is commonly due to the imposed hydraulic force exceeding resistance force adhering the particles to the pipe wall vreeburg and boxall 2007 this imbalance causes the particles to mobilise into the bulk flow where they are potentially then carried to customers typically the imposed hydraulic forces are considered as steady state conditions yet emerging research has demonstrated the persistence of transient events throughout dwds creasey and garrow 2011 gullick et al 2004 starczewska et al 2015 complex processes are generated during hydraulic transient events as the dwds environment is transformed from one set of steady state conditions to another initial conditions of flow rate and pressure form the boundary conditions of a transient however transients are also characterised by the change in hydraulic conditions either by defining the change itself or the conditions post transient transients may induce the hydraulic forces necessary to mobilise adhered particles thus causing a risk to water quality mobilisation due to transients has previously been investigated through physical karney and brunone 1999 mustonen et al 2008 aisopou et al 2012 and numerical experiments naser and karney 2008 aisopou et al 2010 to determine if transients are able to mobilise adhered material in dwds the results of these studies were suggestive but inconclusive due to reasons such as lack of repetition lack of synchronous high temporal resolution data and uncertainty in the generation of near instantaneous transients weston et al 2019 conducted carefully controlled full scale laboratory experiments that consistently demonstrated that transients can mobilise adhered material the work showed that the transient mobilisation effects were greater than those of the associated steady state conditions this evidences that transient induced mobilisation forces are generated in addition to steady state hydraulic conditions but not the nature of these forces nor the mechanisms by which they cause mobilisation previous research has postulated that high intensities of shear stress generated during transient events may cause biofilm sloughing and particle resuspension vreeburg et al 2004 wood et al 2005 such shear stress is known to be induced during transients which peaks in the early stages of the transient before decaying due to damping effects vardy and brown 2003 complex velocity profiles associated with boundary shear stress have also been measured under decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 brunone et al 2000 riasi et al 2009 silva araya and chaudhry 1997 zidouh 2009 there are few equivalent studies for accelerating flow transients naser and karney 2008 zidouh and elmaimouni 2013 a bias observed by naser and karney 2008 bergant et al 2002 stated that the models for decelerating flow transients do not always transfer well to accelerating flow transients suggesting separate approaches are necessary nonetheless steep near wall velocity profiles have been shown to be induced for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 naser and karney 2008 most previous studies of hydraulic transients focus on idealised extreme transients either starting or ending in zero flow conditions however in real operational systems transient conditions are seen superimposed on steady state flows that is transients that do not transition to or from a zero flow state there is very little published data on the shear stress and velocity profiles in these conditions covas et al 2004 this study aims to investigate what forces generated by transients cause mobilisation and how these forces relate to the characteristics of the transient to address this aim three objectives are proposed 1 to determine if and how mobilisation forces relate to pre post and change in transient conditions including transients that transition to or from a non zero flow state 2 to measure when during the transient mobilisation is instigated and 3 to compare these findings for accelerating and decelerating flow transients to determine if differences exist to avoid limiting this research with previous speculation of transient mechanisms for mobilisation an extensive and unbiased series of representative laboratory experiments were performed these experiments encompassed a wide range of accelerating and decelerating flow transients to provide a unique dataset against which to systematically explore the study objectives from this a predictive mobilisation expression is then proposed and theoretically possible mechanisms are evaluated 2 experimental approach rigorous laboratory experiments were performed in a representative full scale pipeline facility the pipeline consists of 141 m of 50 mm internal diameter mdpe as illustrated in fig 2 and is described in detail in previous papers weston et al 2017 2018 2019 this laboratory facilitated high temporal measurements in a controlled setting to investigate subtle transient phenomena that could be overshadowed by temporal and spatial variability and uncertainty in an operational water distribution network 2 1 experimental analogue for pipe wall adhered material an essential component of this research was to create an experimental analogue that replicated pipe wall adhered material found in dwds described in detail in previous papers weston et al 2017 2018 2019 it was vital that this analogue could replicate key features of pipe wall adhered material with high repeatability and control so that transient mobilisation mechanisms could be clearly identified and investigated the solution developed was to place an electromagnet flush against the outside of a transparent acrylic section of the pipeline and magnetic particles placed in the pipe invert see fig 1 direct current through the electromagnet was used as a quick and repeatable method of controlling and quantifying the pipe wall adhesion force the particles experienced mobilisation was defined as being observed when the magnetic particles within the pipeline surpassed a predetermined distance based threshold in the streamwise direction the current at which mobilisation occurred for given hydraulic conditions became an effective means of quantifying the mobilisation force in order to create the simplest analogue to investigate transient mobilisation mechanisms the particles utilised in this experiment were highly consistent grade 10 aisi 5200 spherical ball bearings φ 500 µm weighing 0 00051 g each see fig 1 these particles were placed individually in the pipe invert to eliminate any effects of particle interaction thus creating a simple structure to examine hydraulic processes experiments were always performed with a current i e magnetic field such that induced adherence force was the dominant parameter being investigated rather than the relatively constant self weight of the particles details of how particles were inserted into the pipeline and justification of the distance based threshold for mobilisation can be found in weston et al 2019 a novel objective of these experiments was to define when during the transient event the particles began to mobilise this required the mobilisation behaviour exhibited by the particles to be synchronised with the hydraulic time series data a 400 hz camera used to track the particles was activated with an external trigger which produced a simultaneous electric pulse as a datum for synchronisation of both time series 2 2 hydraulic tests 2 2 1 transient generation valve operations are the most common instigator of dynamic events in operational systems bosserman ii et al 2008 chaudhry 2014 nerella and venkata rathnam 2015 starczewska et al 2015 valve operations can also be readily controlled and adjusted to cover a wide range of conditions and closely approximate other sources thus are fully representative of dynamic events in operational systems therefore accelerating and decelerating transients were performed by manual rapid operation of a butterfly valve 1 36 m downstream of the magnetic particle this operation produced highly repeatable transients with comparison of pressure changes across repeats producing root mean square error rmse values of 0 19 m or less weston 2019 moreover preliminary tests demonstrated that fluid structure interactions due to the valve operation were unlikely to be a factor in mobilisation weston et al 2019 overall system flow and pressure was controlled by a final outlet valve and upstream variable speed pump to test consistent physical movements and repeatable hydraulic forces the butterfly valve was rapidly transitioned within 0 2 s from fully closed to fully open accelerating flow transient and vice versa decelerating flow transient to gain a fuller insight into the forces generated by the transient this study included transients that transitioned to or from zero and non zero flow states to enable non zero states pre and post transient a small length of bypass pipeline diameter consistent with the main pipeline was installed that enabled a controlled flow around the system when the transient valve was fully closed see fig 2 2 2 2 isolating transient mobilisation forces in order to investigate the mobilisation forces induced by transients the dynamic forces needed to be separated from steady state mobilisation forces a steady state baseline relationship was therefore created by performing preliminary experiments for a range of steady state flow rates to determine the currents at which mobilisation occurred these results were originally given in weston et al 2019 and are included as appropriate for comparison here a strong linear relationship was produced coefficient of determination 0 996 values below those defined by this relationship indicate that mobilisation would always occur due to steady state forces during subsequent experiments additional repeats of baseline steady state conditions were periodically performed there was no variation from this relationship reinforcing the physical relationship and indicating experimental control and repeatability accelerating and decelerating flow transients were tested for a wide range of pre and post transient conditions five repeats were performed at every condition tested this enabled a systematic approach to determine if mobilisation forces relate to pre transient post transient or the change between pre and post transient steady state conditions of flow rate and pressure experiments first investigated the extremes of conditions possible with the laboratory facility conditions found to be of interest were then studied in greater detail the testing conditions for the transients presented in this paper are summarised in table 1 see weston et al 2020 for full details and hydraulic data 2 3 determining the instigation time of mobilisation to define the moment of mobilisation the speed of the ball bearing was calculated by tracking its centroid location in the streamwise direction through each frame of the high speed videos mobilisation was considered instigated when the speed of the ball bearing exceeded three standard deviations of the particle s speed in the pre transient flow the mobilisation time window became the time between two adjacent video frames 0 0025 s apart where mobilisation had not begun in the first within three standard deviations but had been instigated in the second beyond three standard deviations fig 3 a presents an example of the mobilisation time window for an accelerating flow transient that transitioned from a zero pre transient flow rate to 0 5 l s post transient flow rate at a pre transient pressure of 45 m fig 3b shows the mobilisation time window synchronised with the corresponding pressure data the time between the start of the transient and the start of the mobilisation time window will be designated δ t which in this example was 0 0825 s 3 results 3 1 accelerating flow transients 3 1 1 investigating pre transient conditions the possible extremes of both pre transient flow rate and pressure used to generate accelerating flow transients were found to cause mobilisation where steady state would not have done the currents at which mobilisation occurred also changed significantly hence both pre transient flow rate and pressure conditions were studied in detail a range of accelerating flow transients were performed with pre transient flow rate ranging from 0 l s 0 7 l s and pre transient pressure ranging from 25 m 45 m the post transient flow conditions also varied from 0 36 l s to 0 9 l s figs 4 and 5 present the currents at which mobilisation occurred for the accelerating flow transients with respect to pre transient flow rate and pressure respectively with the corresponding variable shown by point markers the mobilisation currents being above the steady state case demonstrates that additional forces are present during the transient events fig 4 shows that pre transient flow rate does play a role in transient mobilisation but it is not the only dependent factor the currents at which mobilisation occurred exhibited narrower ranges as pre transient flow rate increased or that at higher flow rate the effects of pressure become less important fig 5 shows that as pre transient pressure increased the current at which mobilisation occurred also increased however at higher pre transient pressures the range of currents increases as the effects of pre transient flow rate also come into effect these figures suggest that pre transient flow rate and pressure both play a role in transient mobilisation coupling in a complex way 3 1 2 investigating post transient conditions accelerating flow transients were performed with zero pre transient flow rate and constant post transient pressure of 45 m so that post transient flow rate was the only parameter being investigated 0 2 l s 0 7 l s physical system constraints prevented a range of post transient pressure conditions to be investigated mobilisation occurred in all transients generated and the currents at which mobilisation occurred were significantly higher than the equivalent steady state flow rates again demonstrating accelerating flow transients can mobilise the adhered particles where steady state cannot however the current at which mobilisation occurred was the same across all the extremes of what was practically possible here 369 ma to 390 ma the standard deviation across these values 6 7 ma was equivalent to standard deviations between repeats therefore the different conditions tested could not be separated from experimental errors this led to the conclusion that the post transient flow rate conditions of accelerating flow transients do not relate to the current at which mobilisation occurred and hence do not relate to mechanisms of mobilisation 3 1 3 investigating change in transient conditions the accelerating flow transients described in section 3 1 2 were performed with zero pre transient flow rates therefore the changes in transient conditions pre to post transient steady states were equal to the post transient flow rates as the later was observed not to relate to mobilisation it is unlikely that change in transient conditions was related to mobilisation to verify the accelerating flow transients performed in section 3 1 1 were compared across consistent changes in pre to post transient flow rates it was observed that for the same change in flow 0 2 l s and same pre transient pressure 45 m mobilisation occurred at a wide range of currents 234 ma to 380 ma therefore the change in flow rate generating the transient conditions does not relate to mechanisms of mobilisation 3 2 decelerating flow transients 3 2 1 investigating pre transient conditions decelerating flow transients were first performed with constant pre transient pressure and zero post transient flow rate so that pre transient flow rate was the parameter being investigated 0 1 l s 1 3 l s the results of these transients were originally presented in weston et al 2019 and are reprinted in fig 6 during the transients mobilisation occurred at higher currents than for the equivalent pre transient flow rates demonstrating that these decelerating flow transients can mobilise the adhered particles where steady state cannot fig 6 presents a strong linear relationship between current at which mobilisation occurred and pre transient flow rate coefficient of determination 0 998 this demonstrates that pre transient flow rate is a factor in transient mobilisation fig 6 also shows that the difference in average current at which mobilisation occurs between decelerating flow transients and steady state conditions decreases as flow rate increases this difference in average current represents the isolated dynamic force induced which implies that for decelerating flow transients the transient mechanism for mobilisation diminishes as the pre transient flow rate increases 3 2 2 investigating post transient and change in transient conditions decelerating flow transients were performed with non zero post transient flow rates the same range of pre transient flow rates 0 1 l s to 1 3 l s with a constant pre transient pressure of 45 m were used as in section 3 2 1 to enable comparison irrespective of the pre and post transient flow rates tested the ball bearing particle was unable to mobilise due to the transients generated for the decelerating flow transients performed only those with a zero post transient flow rate caused mobilisation irrespective of the pre transient or change in transient conditions for example mobilisation occurred during transients that transitioned from both 1 3 l s the highest pre transient flow rate tested and 0 1 l s the lowest pre transient flow rate tested to zero post transient flow rate yet mobilisation did not occur in the decelerating flow transient that transitioned from 1 3 l s to 0 1 l s a zero post transient flow rate appears to be critical to the mechanisms of mobilisation due to a decelerating flow transient 3 3 instigation of when mobilisation occurred the mobilisation time window was determined for all experiments where the particle was mobilised due to the transient conditions all δt times calculated for accelerating and decelerating flow transients were less than the pipeline period or characteristic time of the system which is the time required for a pressure wave to travel from its source of generation through the system and reflected back to its source the pipeline period is calculated as twice the distance between the source and reflection point over the wavespeed which in these experiments was calculated to be 0 51 s this demonstrates that mobilisation was initiated by mechanisms generated within the first dynamic surge the δt times calculated were investigated as a function of pre transient conditions flow rate and pressure no relationship was observed between δt times and pre transient pressure pearson coefficient calculated as 0 01 for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients when δt times were compared to pre transient flow rates see fig 7 there appeared to be a step change in δt times between accelerating flow transients that have pre transient zero transitional flow rate and those that have pre transient turbulent flow the only exception to this step change exists at pre transient flow rate of 0 5 l s where the δt times for three transients are lower than expected the cause of these outliers has not been identified in the data in contrast decelerating flow transients that caused mobilisation exhibited a much narrower range of δt times and appeared independent of the pre transient flow rate pearson coefficient calculated as 0 00 it is interesting to observe that accelerating flow transients with non turbulent pre transient flow rates produce similar δt times to all decelerating flow transients moreover δt times for accelerating flow transients with turbulent pre transient flow rates do not correspond with those for turbulent decelerating flow transients this would suggest that the physical processes for mobilisation differ between accelerating and decelerating flow and turbulence may be a factor in mobilisation effects for accelerating flow transients 4 expression of mobilisation this section proposes a function to estimate the mobilising force based on experimental findings specifically that transient mobilisation forces correlate with pre transient conditions and are instigated by mechanisms generated within the first dynamic surge of the transient transient equations that predict wall shear stress frequently use the addition of a steady state term to an unsteady term a similar structure will be utilised for the mobilising function proposed here during the first surge of a transient the joukowski equation is applicable wylie and streeter 1978 and will be used to express the dynamic component of the mobilising function whilst the bulk pseudo instantaneous change in flow rate and pressure induced during the first surge are synonymous the mobilising function will be expressed in terms of flow rate as this is conceptually more meaningful and useful 4 1 peak mobilisation flow the function developed is termed the peak mobilisation flow and comprises of the pre transient steady state flow rate q p r e t r a n s i e n t and the bulk pseudo instantaneous change in flow rate induced during the first surge of the transient δ q 1 p e a k m o b i l i s a t i o n f l o w q p r e t r a n s i e n t δ q within the first surge of the transient the joukowski equation relates bulk pseudo instantaneous changes in flow rate δ q and pressure δ p through a linear inversion 2 δ q k δ p the constant k is equal to g a c where g is the gravitational constant a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and c is wavespeed pipes with a low impedance 1 k such as those used in these experiments will exhibit oscillatory behaviour of both velocity and pressure zhang et al 2019 during accelerating flow transients the steady state and dynamic components will inherently act in the same downstream direction as illustrated in fig 8 a a positive δ q will be induced by a pseudo instantaneous depressurisation δ q k δ p during decelerating flow transients the two components will act in opposite directions as illustrated in fig 8b a negative δ q will be induced by a pseudo instantaneous pressurisation δ q k δ p consequently decelerating flow transients will cause mobilisation when the dynamic force upstream is equal to or exceeds twice the pre transient steady state force 4 2 application to experimental results the dynamic δ q was not directly measured but rather calculated using eq 2 where δ p was determined from the high temporal pressure data cross sectional area remained constant at 1 96 10 3 m2 various methods from data and theory were applied to determine wavespeed such as peak to peak time pipeline period calculation and korteweg formula for wavespeed which produced a range of values from 332 m s to 458 m s the preferred method was peak to peak time due to utilising the in situ experimental data however this method has inherent uncertainty in the exact identification of peaks in the wave forms these errors are random therefore an average value of 375 m s was utilised for all δ q calculations the peak mobilisation flow expression estimates a flow when mobilisation would occur if these estimates are accurate then plotting the observed mobilisation currents against these values rather than pre transient or change in flow as in figs 4 and 6 would translate all data onto the steady state trend as shown in fig 9 this is the case for all accelerating flow transients with steady state measurements and peak mobilisation flow estimates being statistically similar p 0 05 this suggests that the mobilisation expression provides an accurate estimate of the mobilisation effects fig 9 also presents peak mobilisation flow estimates for decelerating flow transients that caused mobilisation this data set is statistically dissimilar to steady state results p 0 05 this dissimilarity held at the lower and upper wavespeed values calculated 5 discussion 5 1 experimental set up to rigorously investigate transient mobilisation forces highly consistent spherical ball bearings were individually placed in the pipe invert this created the simplest analogue for experimentation as any effects of particle interaction were eliminated and the magnetic adherence forces acting upon the particles were repeatable across the range of accelerating and decelerating flow transients consequently the induced hydraulic forces dominated any mobilisation effects rather than variability in the adhered material analogue this pseudo material however does limit understanding of how adhered organic material shown to accumulate in dwds would respond to transient forces organic material may be more resistant to transients due to its elastic properties and predominant structure in the viscous sub layer whilst the rigid ball bearing particles encroached into different boundary layers as a function of the pre transient flow rate which impacts turbulence related forces generated in this work a key benefit of a single ball bearing was that the particles were easily trackable through the high temporal videos this enabled rigorous mobilisation criteria and the unique synchronisation of high temporal hydraulic and visual mobilisation data through which the forces for mobilisation could be investigated thus while the analogy used here is not a perfect representation useful insight is obtained 5 2 mobilisation mechanisms this section will discuss the experimental work performed with regard to how transients could induce forces for mobilisation two transient mechanisms for generating mobilisation forces are postulated the first is driven by pressure and the second by near wall velocity these mechanisms are evaluated against the experimental findings and peak mobilisation flow expression proposed with a focus on the differences found between accelerating and decelerating flow transients 5 2 1 pressure wave front mechanism there is a significant pressure differential across a transient pressure wave front that causes a short lived streamwise imbalance of forces on the front and back surfaces of adhered material this differential is hence a potential mobilisation mechanism that could induce mobilisation as the wave passes over the adhered material this mechanism is conceptually greatest during the first surge prior to significant damping which is consistent with the instigation of mobilisation observations to assess if this was the primary mobilisation mechanism occurring during the experiments the magnitude of the pressure differential was calculated and compared to the experimental results pressure differential across the wave front can be described as the change in pressure over a distance along the pipe d p d x during the primary transient surge the ball bearing particles were sufficiently close to the transient valve that friction was negligible and therefore ignored the standard frictionless wave equation says that that spatial rate of change is proportional to the temporal rate of change d p d t this value of d p d t was calculated by applying a linear regression to the first surge of each pressure trace in these experiments d p d t was linearly proportional to δ p as shown in fig 10 either could have been used to quantify the force induced by the pressure wave front mechanism two observations from the experimental results can be examined with regard to this mechanism firstly the decelerating flow transients that did not cause mobilisation those with non zero post transient flow rate exhibited similar δ p values as other transients that did cause mobilisation see fig 11 these overlapping values of δ p would suggest that the same magnitude of δ p could cause mobilisation in some transients but not cause mobilisation in others secondly the distance between the butterfly valve and the magnetic particles was 1 36 m if the pressure wave travels at a speed of 375 m s the wave passes the particle 0 0036 s after generation this is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the time taken for the particles to commence mobilising minimum δ t 0 053 s implying that the pressure wave front has significantly travelled past the particles before mobilisation is instigated these observations infer that the pressure wave front is not the primary mechanism for mobilisation however it should be noted that the t junction in the bypass system could have created a non symmetrical pressure wave that impacted the transmission of the pressure wave this effect could have introduced an error in quantifying the mechanism and perhaps caused the decelerating flow transients with non zero post transient flow not to mobilise in summary there may be an imbalance of forces on the adhered particle due to the pressure wave front but it does not appear to be causing mobilisation 5 2 2 velocity profile mechanism complex near wall velocity profiles are known to be generated during transients where these result in steep near wall velocity profile gradients a significant shear stress force is generated that could cause mobilisation however velocity profiles were not measured during these experiments previous research has presented velocity profile measurements due to accelerating flow transients bergant et al 2002 naser and karney 2008 zidouh and elmaimouni 2013 many of these studies report near wall velocity profiles during the early stages of transients that are steeper than the preceding or proceeding steady state conditions the shear stress force induced by this effect could explain the observed mobilisation of all accelerating flow transients and agrees with the instigation of mobilisation δ t data during the experiments a step change in δ t times was evidenced between accelerating flow transients with pre transient non turbulent and turbulent flows it is postulated that the existing turbulence in the pre transient flow rate interacts with the physical dynamic mechanism of the transient i e the near wall velocity profiles causing the observed step change this potential interaction is not a straightforward process and requires further work to break down the physical effects occurring previous research has also measured velocity profiles due to decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 brunone et al 2000 riasi et al 2009 silva araya and chaudhry 1997 zidouh 2009 these studies show that rapid inversion of the velocity profile can occur creating a steep near wall velocity gradient hence shear stress force and mobilisation brunone and berni 2010 showed it is possible for the bulk velocity to be lower than the pre transient steady state velocity or even zero but a steep near wall velocity profile could still induce additional unsteady shear stresses these inversions were observed to occur and to be strongest in the first surge of the transient which again agrees with the mobilisation results reported in this work significantly none of the studies investigated decelerating flow transients that did not fully halt the flow i e post transient flow conditions that were non zero it is possible in these cases inversions of the velocity profile and associated steep near wall velocity profile gradients do not occur this assertion would explain the observed lack of mobilisation during the post transient non zero flow decelerating flow transients tested 5 3 peak mobilisation flow function the proposed function aimed to estimate the equivalent mobilising flow rate induced by accelerating and decelerating flow transients this function uses the addition of a steady state term to a dynamic term which is not only common in transient wall shear stress equations but builds on observations from the experimental results this simple 1d approach is shown to accurately represent the accelerating flow cases which induce steep near wall velocity profiles however there is no mechanism captured by the function to represent the near wall velocity profile inversion effect or associated vortices induced in decelerating flow transients pothof 2008 this most likely explains why the peak mobilisation flow function aligns with steady state results for accelerating flow transients but not for decelerating flow transients this finding agrees with bergant et al 2002 and pothof 2008 who stated that modelling approaches may differ between accelerating and decelerating flow transients due to the physical differences in the flow processes present 5 4 practical implications the results of this work illustrate another important reason for water network engineers to manage and preferably reduce transients in operational networks in addition to risks of asset failures due to extreme or cyclic loading fatigue effects all accelerating flow transients have been shown to cause mobilisation of adhered material in addition to that due to the steady or pseudo steady state change and hence pose an increased risk to water quality the peak mobilisation flow function could be effectively used to estimate these forces and the corresponding risk decelerating flow transients where the flow is completely halted also caused mobilisation however decelerating flow transients with non zero post transient flow were unable to cause mobilisation this difference highlights the practical significance of careful valve operation in reducing water quality risks this is particularly relevant with the knowledge that the change in flow is highly nonlinear with valve operation hence the final stages of valve closure present an even greater risk 6 conclusions the physical experiments presented in this paper provide rigorous evidence of transient forces causing mobilisation of adhered particles where steady state conditions would not the results demonstrate that pre transient conditions of both flow and pressure combine in a complex manner and play key roles in the mobilisation effects of both accelerating and decelerating flow transients further analysis shows that in transients with decelerating flow conditions post transient flow rate is also important for mobilisation all accelerating flow transients caused mobilisation those starting at zero flow and those starting with non zero flow rates conversely only decelerating flow transients that ended at zero flow conditions caused mobilisation independent of the magnitude of the change in flow novel evidence from the time synchronisation of the hydraulic and mobilisation behaviour provided new insight that the physical processes instigating mobilisation occur within the first dynamic surge of the transient for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients the timing of mobilisation was shown to be slower than the propagation of pressure wave front suggesting the pressure wave front is not responsible for the mobilisation conversely links are made to the boundary shear stress of dynamic changes in velocity profiles observed in other research these are at a maxima during this first surge at a commensurate time a function was developed to quantify the mobilising force induced during transients estimates from this function were compared to the mobilisation behaviour observed in the physical experiments it describes the behaviour observed due to accelerating flow transients but not the

17119,this paper provides new insight into how the hydraulic transients that occur within drinking water distribution networks can mobilise material adhered to the pipe wall and hence cause unacceptable water quality and customer dissatisfaction results are reported from extensive representative physical experiments covering a wide range of repeatable rapidly accelerating and decelerating hydraulic conditions novel time synchronous analysis shows that mobilisation always occurs in the first dynamic surge of the transient however differences in the physical processes that govern mobilisation were observed between the two groups of transient type studied a function to estimate the mobilising force is proposed and applied to the physical experiments performed the research provides important insights for identifying and understanding the mechanisms and forces induced during transients vital for ensuring the supply of safe drinking water in operational distribution systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydraulic transients mobilisation water quality drinking water distribution systems 1 introduction poor water quality in drinking water distribution systems dwds can threaten public health through outbreaks of infectious water related diseases and cause customer dissatisfaction and significant economic costs identifying the processes and forces that led to water quality failures is therefore crucial only when these processes are examined and understood can effective management strategies by developed to maintain safe and acceptable drinking water a risk to water quality exists when adhered particles such as metals chemical contaminants pathogens are mobilised from the pipe wall boxall and saul 2005 such material is known to build up ubiquitously on the surface of all pipes comprising dwds as a function of the bulk water quality corrosion and other deterioration of the assets themselves husband and boxall 2016 mobilisation is commonly due to the imposed hydraulic force exceeding resistance force adhering the particles to the pipe wall vreeburg and boxall 2007 this imbalance causes the particles to mobilise into the bulk flow where they are potentially then carried to customers typically the imposed hydraulic forces are considered as steady state conditions yet emerging research has demonstrated the persistence of transient events throughout dwds creasey and garrow 2011 gullick et al 2004 starczewska et al 2015 complex processes are generated during hydraulic transient events as the dwds environment is transformed from one set of steady state conditions to another initial conditions of flow rate and pressure form the boundary conditions of a transient however transients are also characterised by the change in hydraulic conditions either by defining the change itself or the conditions post transient transients may induce the hydraulic forces necessary to mobilise adhered particles thus causing a risk to water quality mobilisation due to transients has previously been investigated through physical karney and brunone 1999 mustonen et al 2008 aisopou et al 2012 and numerical experiments naser and karney 2008 aisopou et al 2010 to determine if transients are able to mobilise adhered material in dwds the results of these studies were suggestive but inconclusive due to reasons such as lack of repetition lack of synchronous high temporal resolution data and uncertainty in the generation of near instantaneous transients weston et al 2019 conducted carefully controlled full scale laboratory experiments that consistently demonstrated that transients can mobilise adhered material the work showed that the transient mobilisation effects were greater than those of the associated steady state conditions this evidences that transient induced mobilisation forces are generated in addition to steady state hydraulic conditions but not the nature of these forces nor the mechanisms by which they cause mobilisation previous research has postulated that high intensities of shear stress generated during transient events may cause biofilm sloughing and particle resuspension vreeburg et al 2004 wood et al 2005 such shear stress is known to be induced during transients which peaks in the early stages of the transient before decaying due to damping effects vardy and brown 2003 complex velocity profiles associated with boundary shear stress have also been measured under decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 brunone et al 2000 riasi et al 2009 silva araya and chaudhry 1997 zidouh 2009 there are few equivalent studies for accelerating flow transients naser and karney 2008 zidouh and elmaimouni 2013 a bias observed by naser and karney 2008 bergant et al 2002 stated that the models for decelerating flow transients do not always transfer well to accelerating flow transients suggesting separate approaches are necessary nonetheless steep near wall velocity profiles have been shown to be induced for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 naser and karney 2008 most previous studies of hydraulic transients focus on idealised extreme transients either starting or ending in zero flow conditions however in real operational systems transient conditions are seen superimposed on steady state flows that is transients that do not transition to or from a zero flow state there is very little published data on the shear stress and velocity profiles in these conditions covas et al 2004 this study aims to investigate what forces generated by transients cause mobilisation and how these forces relate to the characteristics of the transient to address this aim three objectives are proposed 1 to determine if and how mobilisation forces relate to pre post and change in transient conditions including transients that transition to or from a non zero flow state 2 to measure when during the transient mobilisation is instigated and 3 to compare these findings for accelerating and decelerating flow transients to determine if differences exist to avoid limiting this research with previous speculation of transient mechanisms for mobilisation an extensive and unbiased series of representative laboratory experiments were performed these experiments encompassed a wide range of accelerating and decelerating flow transients to provide a unique dataset against which to systematically explore the study objectives from this a predictive mobilisation expression is then proposed and theoretically possible mechanisms are evaluated 2 experimental approach rigorous laboratory experiments were performed in a representative full scale pipeline facility the pipeline consists of 141 m of 50 mm internal diameter mdpe as illustrated in fig 2 and is described in detail in previous papers weston et al 2017 2018 2019 this laboratory facilitated high temporal measurements in a controlled setting to investigate subtle transient phenomena that could be overshadowed by temporal and spatial variability and uncertainty in an operational water distribution network 2 1 experimental analogue for pipe wall adhered material an essential component of this research was to create an experimental analogue that replicated pipe wall adhered material found in dwds described in detail in previous papers weston et al 2017 2018 2019 it was vital that this analogue could replicate key features of pipe wall adhered material with high repeatability and control so that transient mobilisation mechanisms could be clearly identified and investigated the solution developed was to place an electromagnet flush against the outside of a transparent acrylic section of the pipeline and magnetic particles placed in the pipe invert see fig 1 direct current through the electromagnet was used as a quick and repeatable method of controlling and quantifying the pipe wall adhesion force the particles experienced mobilisation was defined as being observed when the magnetic particles within the pipeline surpassed a predetermined distance based threshold in the streamwise direction the current at which mobilisation occurred for given hydraulic conditions became an effective means of quantifying the mobilisation force in order to create the simplest analogue to investigate transient mobilisation mechanisms the particles utilised in this experiment were highly consistent grade 10 aisi 5200 spherical ball bearings φ 500 µm weighing 0 00051 g each see fig 1 these particles were placed individually in the pipe invert to eliminate any effects of particle interaction thus creating a simple structure to examine hydraulic processes experiments were always performed with a current i e magnetic field such that induced adherence force was the dominant parameter being investigated rather than the relatively constant self weight of the particles details of how particles were inserted into the pipeline and justification of the distance based threshold for mobilisation can be found in weston et al 2019 a novel objective of these experiments was to define when during the transient event the particles began to mobilise this required the mobilisation behaviour exhibited by the particles to be synchronised with the hydraulic time series data a 400 hz camera used to track the particles was activated with an external trigger which produced a simultaneous electric pulse as a datum for synchronisation of both time series 2 2 hydraulic tests 2 2 1 transient generation valve operations are the most common instigator of dynamic events in operational systems bosserman ii et al 2008 chaudhry 2014 nerella and venkata rathnam 2015 starczewska et al 2015 valve operations can also be readily controlled and adjusted to cover a wide range of conditions and closely approximate other sources thus are fully representative of dynamic events in operational systems therefore accelerating and decelerating transients were performed by manual rapid operation of a butterfly valve 1 36 m downstream of the magnetic particle this operation produced highly repeatable transients with comparison of pressure changes across repeats producing root mean square error rmse values of 0 19 m or less weston 2019 moreover preliminary tests demonstrated that fluid structure interactions due to the valve operation were unlikely to be a factor in mobilisation weston et al 2019 overall system flow and pressure was controlled by a final outlet valve and upstream variable speed pump to test consistent physical movements and repeatable hydraulic forces the butterfly valve was rapidly transitioned within 0 2 s from fully closed to fully open accelerating flow transient and vice versa decelerating flow transient to gain a fuller insight into the forces generated by the transient this study included transients that transitioned to or from zero and non zero flow states to enable non zero states pre and post transient a small length of bypass pipeline diameter consistent with the main pipeline was installed that enabled a controlled flow around the system when the transient valve was fully closed see fig 2 2 2 2 isolating transient mobilisation forces in order to investigate the mobilisation forces induced by transients the dynamic forces needed to be separated from steady state mobilisation forces a steady state baseline relationship was therefore created by performing preliminary experiments for a range of steady state flow rates to determine the currents at which mobilisation occurred these results were originally given in weston et al 2019 and are included as appropriate for comparison here a strong linear relationship was produced coefficient of determination 0 996 values below those defined by this relationship indicate that mobilisation would always occur due to steady state forces during subsequent experiments additional repeats of baseline steady state conditions were periodically performed there was no variation from this relationship reinforcing the physical relationship and indicating experimental control and repeatability accelerating and decelerating flow transients were tested for a wide range of pre and post transient conditions five repeats were performed at every condition tested this enabled a systematic approach to determine if mobilisation forces relate to pre transient post transient or the change between pre and post transient steady state conditions of flow rate and pressure experiments first investigated the extremes of conditions possible with the laboratory facility conditions found to be of interest were then studied in greater detail the testing conditions for the transients presented in this paper are summarised in table 1 see weston et al 2020 for full details and hydraulic data 2 3 determining the instigation time of mobilisation to define the moment of mobilisation the speed of the ball bearing was calculated by tracking its centroid location in the streamwise direction through each frame of the high speed videos mobilisation was considered instigated when the speed of the ball bearing exceeded three standard deviations of the particle s speed in the pre transient flow the mobilisation time window became the time between two adjacent video frames 0 0025 s apart where mobilisation had not begun in the first within three standard deviations but had been instigated in the second beyond three standard deviations fig 3 a presents an example of the mobilisation time window for an accelerating flow transient that transitioned from a zero pre transient flow rate to 0 5 l s post transient flow rate at a pre transient pressure of 45 m fig 3b shows the mobilisation time window synchronised with the corresponding pressure data the time between the start of the transient and the start of the mobilisation time window will be designated δ t which in this example was 0 0825 s 3 results 3 1 accelerating flow transients 3 1 1 investigating pre transient conditions the possible extremes of both pre transient flow rate and pressure used to generate accelerating flow transients were found to cause mobilisation where steady state would not have done the currents at which mobilisation occurred also changed significantly hence both pre transient flow rate and pressure conditions were studied in detail a range of accelerating flow transients were performed with pre transient flow rate ranging from 0 l s 0 7 l s and pre transient pressure ranging from 25 m 45 m the post transient flow conditions also varied from 0 36 l s to 0 9 l s figs 4 and 5 present the currents at which mobilisation occurred for the accelerating flow transients with respect to pre transient flow rate and pressure respectively with the corresponding variable shown by point markers the mobilisation currents being above the steady state case demonstrates that additional forces are present during the transient events fig 4 shows that pre transient flow rate does play a role in transient mobilisation but it is not the only dependent factor the currents at which mobilisation occurred exhibited narrower ranges as pre transient flow rate increased or that at higher flow rate the effects of pressure become less important fig 5 shows that as pre transient pressure increased the current at which mobilisation occurred also increased however at higher pre transient pressures the range of currents increases as the effects of pre transient flow rate also come into effect these figures suggest that pre transient flow rate and pressure both play a role in transient mobilisation coupling in a complex way 3 1 2 investigating post transient conditions accelerating flow transients were performed with zero pre transient flow rate and constant post transient pressure of 45 m so that post transient flow rate was the only parameter being investigated 0 2 l s 0 7 l s physical system constraints prevented a range of post transient pressure conditions to be investigated mobilisation occurred in all transients generated and the currents at which mobilisation occurred were significantly higher than the equivalent steady state flow rates again demonstrating accelerating flow transients can mobilise the adhered particles where steady state cannot however the current at which mobilisation occurred was the same across all the extremes of what was practically possible here 369 ma to 390 ma the standard deviation across these values 6 7 ma was equivalent to standard deviations between repeats therefore the different conditions tested could not be separated from experimental errors this led to the conclusion that the post transient flow rate conditions of accelerating flow transients do not relate to the current at which mobilisation occurred and hence do not relate to mechanisms of mobilisation 3 1 3 investigating change in transient conditions the accelerating flow transients described in section 3 1 2 were performed with zero pre transient flow rates therefore the changes in transient conditions pre to post transient steady states were equal to the post transient flow rates as the later was observed not to relate to mobilisation it is unlikely that change in transient conditions was related to mobilisation to verify the accelerating flow transients performed in section 3 1 1 were compared across consistent changes in pre to post transient flow rates it was observed that for the same change in flow 0 2 l s and same pre transient pressure 45 m mobilisation occurred at a wide range of currents 234 ma to 380 ma therefore the change in flow rate generating the transient conditions does not relate to mechanisms of mobilisation 3 2 decelerating flow transients 3 2 1 investigating pre transient conditions decelerating flow transients were first performed with constant pre transient pressure and zero post transient flow rate so that pre transient flow rate was the parameter being investigated 0 1 l s 1 3 l s the results of these transients were originally presented in weston et al 2019 and are reprinted in fig 6 during the transients mobilisation occurred at higher currents than for the equivalent pre transient flow rates demonstrating that these decelerating flow transients can mobilise the adhered particles where steady state cannot fig 6 presents a strong linear relationship between current at which mobilisation occurred and pre transient flow rate coefficient of determination 0 998 this demonstrates that pre transient flow rate is a factor in transient mobilisation fig 6 also shows that the difference in average current at which mobilisation occurs between decelerating flow transients and steady state conditions decreases as flow rate increases this difference in average current represents the isolated dynamic force induced which implies that for decelerating flow transients the transient mechanism for mobilisation diminishes as the pre transient flow rate increases 3 2 2 investigating post transient and change in transient conditions decelerating flow transients were performed with non zero post transient flow rates the same range of pre transient flow rates 0 1 l s to 1 3 l s with a constant pre transient pressure of 45 m were used as in section 3 2 1 to enable comparison irrespective of the pre and post transient flow rates tested the ball bearing particle was unable to mobilise due to the transients generated for the decelerating flow transients performed only those with a zero post transient flow rate caused mobilisation irrespective of the pre transient or change in transient conditions for example mobilisation occurred during transients that transitioned from both 1 3 l s the highest pre transient flow rate tested and 0 1 l s the lowest pre transient flow rate tested to zero post transient flow rate yet mobilisation did not occur in the decelerating flow transient that transitioned from 1 3 l s to 0 1 l s a zero post transient flow rate appears to be critical to the mechanisms of mobilisation due to a decelerating flow transient 3 3 instigation of when mobilisation occurred the mobilisation time window was determined for all experiments where the particle was mobilised due to the transient conditions all δt times calculated for accelerating and decelerating flow transients were less than the pipeline period or characteristic time of the system which is the time required for a pressure wave to travel from its source of generation through the system and reflected back to its source the pipeline period is calculated as twice the distance between the source and reflection point over the wavespeed which in these experiments was calculated to be 0 51 s this demonstrates that mobilisation was initiated by mechanisms generated within the first dynamic surge the δt times calculated were investigated as a function of pre transient conditions flow rate and pressure no relationship was observed between δt times and pre transient pressure pearson coefficient calculated as 0 01 for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients when δt times were compared to pre transient flow rates see fig 7 there appeared to be a step change in δt times between accelerating flow transients that have pre transient zero transitional flow rate and those that have pre transient turbulent flow the only exception to this step change exists at pre transient flow rate of 0 5 l s where the δt times for three transients are lower than expected the cause of these outliers has not been identified in the data in contrast decelerating flow transients that caused mobilisation exhibited a much narrower range of δt times and appeared independent of the pre transient flow rate pearson coefficient calculated as 0 00 it is interesting to observe that accelerating flow transients with non turbulent pre transient flow rates produce similar δt times to all decelerating flow transients moreover δt times for accelerating flow transients with turbulent pre transient flow rates do not correspond with those for turbulent decelerating flow transients this would suggest that the physical processes for mobilisation differ between accelerating and decelerating flow and turbulence may be a factor in mobilisation effects for accelerating flow transients 4 expression of mobilisation this section proposes a function to estimate the mobilising force based on experimental findings specifically that transient mobilisation forces correlate with pre transient conditions and are instigated by mechanisms generated within the first dynamic surge of the transient transient equations that predict wall shear stress frequently use the addition of a steady state term to an unsteady term a similar structure will be utilised for the mobilising function proposed here during the first surge of a transient the joukowski equation is applicable wylie and streeter 1978 and will be used to express the dynamic component of the mobilising function whilst the bulk pseudo instantaneous change in flow rate and pressure induced during the first surge are synonymous the mobilising function will be expressed in terms of flow rate as this is conceptually more meaningful and useful 4 1 peak mobilisation flow the function developed is termed the peak mobilisation flow and comprises of the pre transient steady state flow rate q p r e t r a n s i e n t and the bulk pseudo instantaneous change in flow rate induced during the first surge of the transient δ q 1 p e a k m o b i l i s a t i o n f l o w q p r e t r a n s i e n t δ q within the first surge of the transient the joukowski equation relates bulk pseudo instantaneous changes in flow rate δ q and pressure δ p through a linear inversion 2 δ q k δ p the constant k is equal to g a c where g is the gravitational constant a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and c is wavespeed pipes with a low impedance 1 k such as those used in these experiments will exhibit oscillatory behaviour of both velocity and pressure zhang et al 2019 during accelerating flow transients the steady state and dynamic components will inherently act in the same downstream direction as illustrated in fig 8 a a positive δ q will be induced by a pseudo instantaneous depressurisation δ q k δ p during decelerating flow transients the two components will act in opposite directions as illustrated in fig 8b a negative δ q will be induced by a pseudo instantaneous pressurisation δ q k δ p consequently decelerating flow transients will cause mobilisation when the dynamic force upstream is equal to or exceeds twice the pre transient steady state force 4 2 application to experimental results the dynamic δ q was not directly measured but rather calculated using eq 2 where δ p was determined from the high temporal pressure data cross sectional area remained constant at 1 96 10 3 m2 various methods from data and theory were applied to determine wavespeed such as peak to peak time pipeline period calculation and korteweg formula for wavespeed which produced a range of values from 332 m s to 458 m s the preferred method was peak to peak time due to utilising the in situ experimental data however this method has inherent uncertainty in the exact identification of peaks in the wave forms these errors are random therefore an average value of 375 m s was utilised for all δ q calculations the peak mobilisation flow expression estimates a flow when mobilisation would occur if these estimates are accurate then plotting the observed mobilisation currents against these values rather than pre transient or change in flow as in figs 4 and 6 would translate all data onto the steady state trend as shown in fig 9 this is the case for all accelerating flow transients with steady state measurements and peak mobilisation flow estimates being statistically similar p 0 05 this suggests that the mobilisation expression provides an accurate estimate of the mobilisation effects fig 9 also presents peak mobilisation flow estimates for decelerating flow transients that caused mobilisation this data set is statistically dissimilar to steady state results p 0 05 this dissimilarity held at the lower and upper wavespeed values calculated 5 discussion 5 1 experimental set up to rigorously investigate transient mobilisation forces highly consistent spherical ball bearings were individually placed in the pipe invert this created the simplest analogue for experimentation as any effects of particle interaction were eliminated and the magnetic adherence forces acting upon the particles were repeatable across the range of accelerating and decelerating flow transients consequently the induced hydraulic forces dominated any mobilisation effects rather than variability in the adhered material analogue this pseudo material however does limit understanding of how adhered organic material shown to accumulate in dwds would respond to transient forces organic material may be more resistant to transients due to its elastic properties and predominant structure in the viscous sub layer whilst the rigid ball bearing particles encroached into different boundary layers as a function of the pre transient flow rate which impacts turbulence related forces generated in this work a key benefit of a single ball bearing was that the particles were easily trackable through the high temporal videos this enabled rigorous mobilisation criteria and the unique synchronisation of high temporal hydraulic and visual mobilisation data through which the forces for mobilisation could be investigated thus while the analogy used here is not a perfect representation useful insight is obtained 5 2 mobilisation mechanisms this section will discuss the experimental work performed with regard to how transients could induce forces for mobilisation two transient mechanisms for generating mobilisation forces are postulated the first is driven by pressure and the second by near wall velocity these mechanisms are evaluated against the experimental findings and peak mobilisation flow expression proposed with a focus on the differences found between accelerating and decelerating flow transients 5 2 1 pressure wave front mechanism there is a significant pressure differential across a transient pressure wave front that causes a short lived streamwise imbalance of forces on the front and back surfaces of adhered material this differential is hence a potential mobilisation mechanism that could induce mobilisation as the wave passes over the adhered material this mechanism is conceptually greatest during the first surge prior to significant damping which is consistent with the instigation of mobilisation observations to assess if this was the primary mobilisation mechanism occurring during the experiments the magnitude of the pressure differential was calculated and compared to the experimental results pressure differential across the wave front can be described as the change in pressure over a distance along the pipe d p d x during the primary transient surge the ball bearing particles were sufficiently close to the transient valve that friction was negligible and therefore ignored the standard frictionless wave equation says that that spatial rate of change is proportional to the temporal rate of change d p d t this value of d p d t was calculated by applying a linear regression to the first surge of each pressure trace in these experiments d p d t was linearly proportional to δ p as shown in fig 10 either could have been used to quantify the force induced by the pressure wave front mechanism two observations from the experimental results can be examined with regard to this mechanism firstly the decelerating flow transients that did not cause mobilisation those with non zero post transient flow rate exhibited similar δ p values as other transients that did cause mobilisation see fig 11 these overlapping values of δ p would suggest that the same magnitude of δ p could cause mobilisation in some transients but not cause mobilisation in others secondly the distance between the butterfly valve and the magnetic particles was 1 36 m if the pressure wave travels at a speed of 375 m s the wave passes the particle 0 0036 s after generation this is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the time taken for the particles to commence mobilising minimum δ t 0 053 s implying that the pressure wave front has significantly travelled past the particles before mobilisation is instigated these observations infer that the pressure wave front is not the primary mechanism for mobilisation however it should be noted that the t junction in the bypass system could have created a non symmetrical pressure wave that impacted the transmission of the pressure wave this effect could have introduced an error in quantifying the mechanism and perhaps caused the decelerating flow transients with non zero post transient flow not to mobilise in summary there may be an imbalance of forces on the adhered particle due to the pressure wave front but it does not appear to be causing mobilisation 5 2 2 velocity profile mechanism complex near wall velocity profiles are known to be generated during transients where these result in steep near wall velocity profile gradients a significant shear stress force is generated that could cause mobilisation however velocity profiles were not measured during these experiments previous research has presented velocity profile measurements due to accelerating flow transients bergant et al 2002 naser and karney 2008 zidouh and elmaimouni 2013 many of these studies report near wall velocity profiles during the early stages of transients that are steeper than the preceding or proceeding steady state conditions the shear stress force induced by this effect could explain the observed mobilisation of all accelerating flow transients and agrees with the instigation of mobilisation δ t data during the experiments a step change in δ t times was evidenced between accelerating flow transients with pre transient non turbulent and turbulent flows it is postulated that the existing turbulence in the pre transient flow rate interacts with the physical dynamic mechanism of the transient i e the near wall velocity profiles causing the observed step change this potential interaction is not a straightforward process and requires further work to break down the physical effects occurring previous research has also measured velocity profiles due to decelerating flow transients brunone and berni 2010 brunone et al 2000 riasi et al 2009 silva araya and chaudhry 1997 zidouh 2009 these studies show that rapid inversion of the velocity profile can occur creating a steep near wall velocity gradient hence shear stress force and mobilisation brunone and berni 2010 showed it is possible for the bulk velocity to be lower than the pre transient steady state velocity or even zero but a steep near wall velocity profile could still induce additional unsteady shear stresses these inversions were observed to occur and to be strongest in the first surge of the transient which again agrees with the mobilisation results reported in this work significantly none of the studies investigated decelerating flow transients that did not fully halt the flow i e post transient flow conditions that were non zero it is possible in these cases inversions of the velocity profile and associated steep near wall velocity profile gradients do not occur this assertion would explain the observed lack of mobilisation during the post transient non zero flow decelerating flow transients tested 5 3 peak mobilisation flow function the proposed function aimed to estimate the equivalent mobilising flow rate induced by accelerating and decelerating flow transients this function uses the addition of a steady state term to a dynamic term which is not only common in transient wall shear stress equations but builds on observations from the experimental results this simple 1d approach is shown to accurately represent the accelerating flow cases which induce steep near wall velocity profiles however there is no mechanism captured by the function to represent the near wall velocity profile inversion effect or associated vortices induced in decelerating flow transients pothof 2008 this most likely explains why the peak mobilisation flow function aligns with steady state results for accelerating flow transients but not for decelerating flow transients this finding agrees with bergant et al 2002 and pothof 2008 who stated that modelling approaches may differ between accelerating and decelerating flow transients due to the physical differences in the flow processes present 5 4 practical implications the results of this work illustrate another important reason for water network engineers to manage and preferably reduce transients in operational networks in addition to risks of asset failures due to extreme or cyclic loading fatigue effects all accelerating flow transients have been shown to cause mobilisation of adhered material in addition to that due to the steady or pseudo steady state change and hence pose an increased risk to water quality the peak mobilisation flow function could be effectively used to estimate these forces and the corresponding risk decelerating flow transients where the flow is completely halted also caused mobilisation however decelerating flow transients with non zero post transient flow were unable to cause mobilisation this difference highlights the practical significance of careful valve operation in reducing water quality risks this is particularly relevant with the knowledge that the change in flow is highly nonlinear with valve operation hence the final stages of valve closure present an even greater risk 6 conclusions the physical experiments presented in this paper provide rigorous evidence of transient forces causing mobilisation of adhered particles where steady state conditions would not the results demonstrate that pre transient conditions of both flow and pressure combine in a complex manner and play key roles in the mobilisation effects of both accelerating and decelerating flow transients further analysis shows that in transients with decelerating flow conditions post transient flow rate is also important for mobilisation all accelerating flow transients caused mobilisation those starting at zero flow and those starting with non zero flow rates conversely only decelerating flow transients that ended at zero flow conditions caused mobilisation independent of the magnitude of the change in flow novel evidence from the time synchronisation of the hydraulic and mobilisation behaviour provided new insight that the physical processes instigating mobilisation occur within the first dynamic surge of the transient for both accelerating and decelerating flow transients the timing of mobilisation was shown to be slower than the propagation of pressure wave front suggesting the pressure wave front is not responsible for the mobilisation conversely links are made to the boundary shear stress of dynamic changes in velocity profiles observed in other research these are at a maxima during this first surge at a commensurate time a function was developed to quantify the mobilising force induced during transients estimates from this function were compared to the mobilisation behaviour observed in the physical experiments it describes the behaviour observed due to accelerating flow transients but not the behaviour under decelerating flow transients declaration of competing interest none
