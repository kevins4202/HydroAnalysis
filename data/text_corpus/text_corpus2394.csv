11970,this study provides a detailed scientific data on the quality of groundwater in oleh it aimed at helping to facilitate the planning of potable water supply scheme for the community water samples from boreholes bhs and hand dug wells hdws in the community were obtained for the determination of biological and physicochemical parameters from december 10 2016 to march 10 2017 for dry season and may 01 2017 to august 01 2017 for wet season structured interviews were also organized for households for the estimation of degree of access to safe drinking water quality perception and awareness of domestic treatment techniques but for ph being lower in some locations results arrived at reveal that the physicochemical parameters were within the world health organization who and standard organization of nigeria son limits cd and pb in the bhs and hdws were generally slightly higher than the maximum limits of the who and son though total coliform tc bacteria and escherichia coli were found in the samples hdws had higher values the small elevated values of pb and cd could be linked to crude oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region while most of the hdw samples 72 were found to be in the category of low risk fc 11 100 cfu 100 ml result of the survey showed that over 30 of households sourced their drinking water from hand dug wells and had no working knowledge of domestic water treatment keywords groundwater quality monitoring health perception correlation niger delta 1 introduction the importance of energy and access to water of reasonable quantity and quality to the growth and development of a country s economy cannot be overemphasized owamah et al 2020 owamah 2020a onokwai et al 2020 owamah and izinyon 2015 regular monitoring of drinking water quality abstracted underground is very important to the public health of developing nations as majority of their citizens in rural and sub urban communities depend on individual boreholes bhs and hand dug wells hdws for drinking water mkwate et al 2017 oleh is one of the popular sub urban communities in nigeria it is home to the faculties of engineering and law of the delta state university in the niger delta region of nigeria it is also the administrative headquarters of the isoko south local government area islga of delta state the inability of the nigerian government to meet the water need of the citizens has forced a large percentage of the population to depend on other sources such as individual boreholes hand dug wells and streams safe and adequate drinking water is not only essential to human health but necessary for diseases reduction mkwate et al 2017 owamah 2020b various opportunistic pathogens that occur naturally in the environment cause diseases in humans with infants young children and the elderly being at the greatest risk of infection holma et al 2018 natural sources wells and boreholes are increasingly used as drinking water sources in rural and sub urban communities in nigeria and many developing countries without tests to ascertain their potability owamah 2020b presently there have been huge efforts at raising access to safe drinking water and improvement in sanitation by the recently launched united nations sustainable development goals owamah 2020b holma et al 2018 though it has been reported that within the last three decades about 2 6 billion people in the world gained access to safe drinking water access remains a global challenge as about 663 million people consume water that is not clean and safe owamah 2020b who unicef jmp report 2015 inadequate hygiene poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water cause over one million global annual deaths and about 80 of water related ailments in developing countries who 2012 furthermore about half of the people in the globe consuming unsafe drinking water live in sub saharan africa although the who and unicef recently reported that sub saharan africa had made progress as a result of granting about 43 of her population access to improved drinking water mkwate et al 2017 in many sub urban communities in nigeria women and children still walk long distance to fetch household water access to safe water has long been identified as a major determinant of public health in nigeria owamah et al 2013 frn 2000 though a couple of studies have indicated that household water treatment hwt is an effective and economical method of preventing waterborne diseases in developing nations households in rural and sub urban communities rarely use hwt sojobi 2016 scientific data on water quality domestic treatment and safe storage practices for oleh community and environs in the niger delta region of nigeria are either non existent or scanty in the literature such information is however needed for water supply policy formulation and improved human health this research was therefore carried out to determine the level of conformity of the physico chemical and microbial parameters of groundwater in the community with the world health organization who and standard organization of nigeria son standards the study also assessed the extent of adoption of household treatment of drinking water by residents and the level of water related diseases prevalent in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 description of study area oleh is the administrative headquarters islga and host to one of the delta state university abraka campuses nigeria population commission estimated that islga had a population 323 800 as at 2016 npc 2018 though getting the actual current population of oleh community is hard to come by it happens to be one of the most populated communities in the islga while the coordinates of islga is 5 43 n 6 20 e that of oleh is 5 27 32 17 n latitude and 6 12 11 13 e longitude fig 1 islga resides within the tropical rainforest axis with luxuriant vegetation it does experience wet and dry climate with relative constant temperatures all through the year owamah et al 2013 civil service work farming trading and artisanship are some of the major economic activities of the residents of the study area oleh besides being a host to a campus of the delta state university abraka has several primary and secondary schools its current predominant religion is christianity the islga like its neighboring isoko north local government area has mean precipitation annual monthly temperature average and relative humidity range of 2800 mm 31 c and 76 90 respectively owamah 2020b the islga is a prominent crude oil producing part of the south south zone nigeria there is a flow station near the faculty of engineering delta state university oleh campus 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of the study area oleh is one of the popular towns in the south south geo political zone of nigeria popularly called the niger delta region the region is generally of flat topography and slopes slightly towards the sea akpokodje and etu efeotor 1987 atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the region lies in the sedimentary basin and without outcrop it experiences flooding during the wet season and has a mean elevation of about 10 m above the sea level geologically the region comprises three major subsurface lithostratigraphic units overlain by quaternary deposits atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the akata formation is the base of the unit and consists majorly of marine shales the thickness of the formation is within the range of 550 to over 6000 m the overlying paralic sequence is the agbada formation comprising interbedded sands and shale with a thickness range of 300 to 4500 m with the upper most unit being the benin formation details of the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area is documented in atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the hydraulic conductivity has been reported to be in the range of 3 82 10 3 to 9 0 10 2 cm s implying that the aquifer is productive offodile 1991 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 2 3 water sampling and analysis 2 3 1 collection of water sample oleh community was divided into six districts for the sake of data collection and reporting convenience government residential area gra engineering faculty ef old emede road oer yanga market ym ichofu ic and faculty of law fl districts the sampled groundwater sources of this study are regularly used by residents sampling was therefore representative as sources were purged by regular usage this notwithstanding about 100 l was pumped prior to sampling to ensure proper rinsing of all equipment samples were directly collected from taps for boreholes bhs spouts for hand pump wells and from dedicated community sampling rope and bucket for shallow wells to obtain representative samples and prevent cross contamination in this study hand pump wells and shallow wells were grouped together as hand dug wells hdws due to the fact that while some places had only hand pump wells others had shallow wells only a few places had both and in such situations the authors sampled the hand dug well more frequently used by the residents taps spouts ropes and buckets were pre cleaned before water samples were collected bamigboye et al 2020 ward et al 2020 one and half 1 5 l high density pet screw capped containers were utilized for fetching water samples from bhs and hdws from december 10 2016 to march 10 2017 for dry season and may 01 2017 to august 01 2017 for wet season twenty 24 raw water samples four 4 from each district 2 no bh 2 no hdw were collected every month to give one hundred and forty four 144 samples each for bh and hdw before collection of the actual sample the pet containers were washed thoroughly with distilled water and followed by washing with water to be sampled thereafter the stoppered and labeled containers were ice cooled and transported to the laboratory within 2 h from the time of sample collection as was done by owamah 2020b and shakerkhatibi et al 2019 at each sampling point while one bottle was filled with un acidified water the other was acidified through the addition of little drops of hydrogen trioxo nitrate v acid to end microbial activities collection of samples for microbiological analysis was done with sterilized autoclaved bottles while acidified samples were used for metals analysis the non acidified samples were used for the determination of the concentration of physical parameters and anions apha 2012 for the preservation of the integrity of water samples before analyses samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 2 procedures for parameters analyses total dissolved solids vsi 22 vsi electronics india temperature hi 98517 hanna instr ph hi 9024 c hanna usa electrical conductivity hi 2315 and salinity hi 19311 were analyzed in situ with the stated hand held digital meters following apha 1992 dissolved oxygen was determined by the azide modification of winkler s method determination of the concentration of chloride was done by titration technique in line with procedures in apha 1992 through the use of a uv spectrophotometer uv s dr 2800 hach usa and uv s screening method the major anions were determined khan et al 2013 owamah 2020b to ensure reproducibility of the analyses pre analyzed standard and blank samples were analyzed at the end of all 10 samples sojobi 2016 the total coliform bacteria as maximum probability number in the samples were counted following standard methods apha 2012 metals analysis was carried out by the use of atomic absorption spectrophotometer sens aa 3000 australia following stipulations in apha 2012 calculated conductivities deviated from measured conductivities by only 2 as expected apha 2012 2 4 ill health water quality awareness and household water treatment survey for better understanding of the implications of drinking contaminated water on health a health survey was carried out through the use of structured questionnaires the sample size was estimated using eq 1 developed by krejcie and morgan 1970 1 n x 2 n p 1 p d 2 n 1 x 2 p 1 p where n sample size n population size p population proportion assumed to be the maximum 50 x2 table value of chi square for 1 degree of freedom at the desired confidence level 1 962 3 8416 and d degree of accuracy expressed as a proportion based on the estimated population of oleh response rate of 30 and error margin of 3 5 krejcie and morgan 1970 a sample size of 784 was estimated at 95 confidence level which was rounded up to 1000 hence a 1000 respondents comprising male and female with at least primary school level education were surveyed these 1000 respondents comprised 260 male adults 310 female adults 250 and 180 male and female children respectively the children were aged between 12 and 17 years for water quality awareness and household water treatment survey 200 families having at least three inhabitants were captured occupational and demographic data and habits of the interviewees were also recorded the reason for the difference in number of respondents for both surveys is that while the health disease survey was carried out among individuals the household survey for perception on water quality and level of household treatment was carried out at household level and targeted at the heads the household heads father or mother were mainly targeted for interview after their consent had been sort and obtained this is in sync with previous reports khan et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 the survey team consisted of three 3 fairly knowledgeable persons on health and six 6 civil and environmental engineering undergraduate students though random selection of respondents was adopted their consents were sought before the questionnaire documents were administered to them the team members did their best to explain hard words and phrases in the questionnaire to respondents dahunsi et al 2014 2 5 statistical analyses analyses of data obtained were done using the 2010 microsoft office excel software package and the analysis of variance anova statistical tool at p 0 005 the mean and standard deviation of the parameters studied were generated for both seasons adopting wet season as the point of reference seasonal mean variations were also computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical parameters figs 2 a 2e and table 1 show the values of some of the physico chemical parameters obtained in this study the discussion of results obtained was done through direct comparison of values obtained with the who 2006 and the son 2007 standards for drinking water ph was found to range from 4 90 to 6 20 in hdws and 4 40 to 6 70 in bhs table 1 ph value ranged from 4 4 to 6 2 in the wet season and 4 8 to 6 7 in the dry season a seasonal average difference of 0 2 was also obtained this indicates that the ph of groundwater sources in the community was fairly constant season notwithstanding granted this ph values in the wet season were however slightly higher than dry season values this could be associated with the rise of water level during wet seasons which brings with it some level of dilution the ph spatial map of fig 3 a shows that majority of the acidic values were got from bhs of ym district and hdws of oer district for both wet and dry seasons bh samples were found to be more acidic than hdw samples a maximum ph of 6 7 was obtained from a borehole in gra district in the month of july table 1 figs 2b fig 3a ph values of this study are similar to those of groundwater sources in neighboring isoko north communities owamah et al 2013 since the who prescription for ph lies between 6 5 and 8 5 water abstracted from a few groundwater sources in the community may need to be treated with lime to raise it to the desired level though ph is not a major health related water quality parameter low levels of it alter the state of other water quality parameters and hence it could cause indirect health problems to humans khan et al 2013 drinking water with low ph could also cause gastrointestinal irritations the lower than permissible ph range obtained from the different water sources may be linked to the geology of the study area sojobi 2016 it could also be due to the presence of organic matter in the soil or gas flaring in the area that produces co which could have been percolating in dissolved form into the groundwater to reduce ph nwankwoala and walter 2012 similar findings of low ph values were obtained from groundwater sources of neighboring isoko north local governmental area inlga communities by owamah et al 2013 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in ph among the sampling sites for the boreholes and hand dug wells and across the seasons for electrical conductivity ec the highest ec was obtained from a bh within fl district 486 μs cm 1 in the month of february this was closely followed by another hdw at oer district 450 μs cm 1 table 1 fig 2a ec values obtained are within the prescribed limit 1000 μs cm 1 set by the son 2007 and who 2006 for drinking water there was no significant variability p 0 05 among the different sources locations and seasons ec results obtained are consistent with findings from other parts of nigeria while a maximum and minimum ec of 500 41 5 μs cm 1 and 75 3 3 μs cm 1 were obtained for neighboring inlga communities by owamah et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 obtained 308 33 1 53 μs cm 1 and 22 4 0 53 μs cm 1 as maximum and minimum ec for selected communities in ogun and lagos states the tds values of the water samples were less than the highest permissible value of 500 mgl 1 set by the who 2006 and son 2007 for drinking water while tds shows the total ions ec is a function of the ionic activities of a solution owamah 2020b lenntech 2016 respectively the mean tds values obtained for wet and dry seasons are 54 and 52 mg l 1 the seasonal average variation obtained is 2 mg l 1 wet dry while the wet season values ranged from 10 to 134 mg l 1 it was 12 134 mg l 1 for dry season hdw water samples from oer district had the maximum dry and wet season tds of 134 and 130 mg l 1 respectively fig 2e compared with bh samples table 1 fig 2e water samples from the hand dug wells had higher values this can be linked to the intrusion of runoff into them following the absence of borehole casings and caps it could also be the result of soil disturbance within the well during water withdrawals mkwate et al 2017 similar values of higher tds for shallow wells were obtained by dahunsi et al 2014 for towns in nigeria s south west and owamah et al 2013 for isoko north local government area communities the seasonal average values for do are 9 mg l 1 wet season and 8 mg l 1 dry season it ranged from 10 to 13 mg l 1 wet season and 10 12 mg l 1 dry season fig 2c shows the values of do obtained from boreholes and hand dug wells in both seasons the do values obtained in the study area are above the who 2006 prescribed minimum value of 4 mg l 1 and hence in order bod ranged from 5 to 7 mg l 1 for the wet season and 4 8 mg l 1 for the dry season fig 2d for both seasons the average value is 6 mg l 1 table 1 and is within the maximum allowable value ademoroti 1996 3 2 anions anions were considered in this study because of their influence on water quality and human health table 1 shows the average values of the various anions determined in the study the range of chloride concentration gotten was 4 58 mg l 1 for wet season and 5 65 mg l 1 for the dry season seasonal average values of 17 mg l 1 wet and 13 mg l 1 dry were obtained in line with the report of egboh and emeshili 2008 of higher chloride concentration in the wet season for neighboring communities chloride values obtained were higher in hdws and during the wet season while the minimum cl concentration of 2 0 5 mg l 1 was obtained from a bh in ic district during the dry season the maximum of 65 1 6 mg l 1 was from a hand dug well in gra district in the wet season small values of the standard deviation imply minor variability in the concentration of cl the values of cl concentration obtained are below the stipulated maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l 1 by the son 2007 indicating that chloride may not be an issue of health concern in the community a previous study by dahunsi et al 2014 on some major cities in ogun and lagos states nigeria also reported low concentration of chloride of the range of 1 97 9 04 mg l 1 for bhs and hdws mkwate et al 2017 equally reported low levels of chloride in the range of 5 45 89 84 mg l 1 for boreholes and shallow wells in balaka district malawi showing that chloride was not a source of worry for groundwater used as drinking water in the areas studied the average values of no3 obtained were 1 and 3 mg l 1 for dry and wet season respectively these are similar to values obtained in the neighboring ndokwa east and isoko north local government areas of delta state by egboh and emeshili 2008 and owamah et al 2013 respectively at p 0 005 using anova no3 values were found to be significantly higher in hdw samples compared to bhs it also varied across the districts for the hand dug wells and boreholes though nitrate was not detected in one hdw and two bhs from three different districts table 1 its concentration of 1 3 mg l 1 in the rest other samples is below the stipulated maximum level of 50 mg l 1 set by the son 2007 and hence indicates non contamination there was no significant p 0 05 variation of nitrate concentration among all the sampling locations and among the wells across the seasons the concentration range of so4 2 was 2 28 mg l 1 the seasonal mean concentrations were 10 mg l 1 for wet season and 7 mg l 1 for the dry seasons while a seasonal mean variation of 3 mg l 1 was obtained hdw samples of the wet season had higher values sulfate though a minor toxic anion its consumption in excess can lead to dehydration who 1996 dahunsi et al 2014 sulfate values obtained for the area of study are within the who 2006 and son 2007 stipulated guidelines of 500 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 respectively table 2 3 3 metals the mean concentrations of metals of pb c mg ca na k zn cu fe and ba detected in this study are shown in table 3 na concentration range of 2200 110 72 to 100 13 340 μg l 1 from this present study is below the prescribed maximum limit of 200 000 μg l 1 set by the who 2006 and son 2007 table 3 and hence not considered a contaminant according to hem 1985 the range of fe usually found in natural fresh water is 0 5 50 mg l 1 apart from water samples of the hdw in ym district with fe concentration 850 290 μg l 1 above the prescribed maximum limit of 300 μg l 1 by the son 2007 and with very high variability as indicted by the standard deviation the rest other values obtained across the districts table 3 were below the specified maximum permissible level high levels of fe in water could lead to characteristic reddish staining and increased turbidity mkwate et al 2017 the value of potassium k obtained is in line with the claim of mkwate et al 2017 that k concentration in natural waters has been widely reported to be low 0 15 000 μg l 1 potassium levels obtained in this study are below the recommended limits of 25 000 50 000 μg l 1 sojobi 2016 for drinking water as shown in table 3 the seasonal average concentration values of na k mg and ca are 17 700 μg l 1 15 300 μg l 1 12 100 μg l 1 9000 μg l 1 11 000 μg l 1 4000 μg l 1 and 10 000 μg l 1 8000 μg l 1 wet dry respectively values of the metals obtained for the study area are all within the prescribed limits of the who and son table 2 fig 3b shows the spatial water quality map for ca and mg obtained for the study area and reveals that about the same values of mg and ca were obtained from the bhs and hdws in oleh the reason for the higher values of na k mg and ca in the wet season could be due to the higher dissolution of rock containing the minerals of these metals during the rains na k mg and ca were all detected at lower than prescribed maximum limits of the who and son similar values were obtained for the groundwater of neighboring emevor community owamah 2020b the maximum concentration of zn 3410 1500 μg l 1 was obtained in july from a hand dug well water sample in gra district the concentration of zn ranged from 60 30 μg l 1 3410 1500 μg l 1 wet season and 60 10 μg l 1 2510 1300 μg l 1 dry season for the seasonal average values of zn 1320 μg l 1 and 275 μg l 1 were respectively obtained for the wet and dry seasons only the zn of hdw 3410 1500 μg l 1 wet season and bh 3010 1400 dry season of gra district slightly surpassed the who 2006 and son 2007 maximum acceptable limit of 3000 μg l 1 table 2 zinc is majorly introduced into groundwater by artificial pathways it mainly comes into groundwater through erosion of zn containing rock and soil minerals however since zn only dissolves in water at low concentration high natural levels of zn in water are usually associated with high concentration of other metals such as lead and cadmium though zn is an important nutrient for body growth and development high levels of zinc can lead to nausea vomiting and stomach cramps owamah et al 2013 the maximum concentration of pb of 300 20 μg l 1 was obtained from a borehole in oer district in the month of december the minimum concentration of 10 μg l 1 was obtained from borehole and hand dug well water samples from ym ic gra and lf districts pb was detected in the various bh and hdw water samples from the six 6 representative districts seasonal average concentrations of 28 μg l 1 and 41 μg l 1 for wet and dry seasons were respectively obtained the concentration of cd ranged from 10 μg l 1 to 80 μg l 1 for both wet and dry seasons with mean concentration of 20 μg l 1 wet season and 10 μg l 1 dry season also the concentration of cu ranged from 20 20 μg l 1 2110 700 μg l 1 wet season and from 10 20 μg l 1 1370 150 μg l 1 dry season while the mean cu concentration for the wet season is 18 μg l 1 that of the dry is 310 μg l 1 furthermore while the concentration of ba ranged from 50 10 μg l 1 2510 440 μg l 1 in the wet season and from 40 20 μg l 1 1540 1540 μg l 1 in the dry season the seasonal average values are 1275 μg l 1 and 380 μg l 1 for wet and dry seasons respectively apart from pb and cd mean concentrations wet and dry season concentrations of the other metals reported were below the who 2006 and son 2007 stipulated maximum limits table 2 using anova at p 0 005 no significant difference in the metals concentration of hand dug well and bore hole water samples was obtained the presence of slightly elevated levels of lead in some samples in the study area may be due to exploration and processing of crude oil in the area and the indiscriminate dumping of various forms of electronic wastes and spent batteries on the soil owamah 2020b the presence of a flow station could also be contributory further study on generation rate and management of electronic wastes in the community and by extension the niger delta region of nigeria is suggested according owamah et al 2013 ingestion of high levels of pb can damage the kidney and brain and sometimes cause miscarriage reports also show that elevated levels of pb in kids could cause convulsion and neurological damages usepa 1991 khan et al 2013 in men high level of pb may destroy organs of reproduction cadmium and its various compounds are reportedly carcinogenic sojobi 2016 at high levels of exposure cd can cause vomiting and diarrhea lower levels for a long time can also cause accumulation of the metal in the kidney and later kidney impairment usepa 1977 mkwate et al 2017 other health challenges associated with drinking water containing high levels of pb and cd are contained in sojobi 2016 3 4 microbial parameters mean values of total coliform bacteria tcb of hdw and bh samples are shown in table 1 among the six representative districts surveyed the lf bhs for dry and wet seasons had the lowest tcb of 5 and 3 per 100 ml respectively it ranged from 1 to 6 per 100 ml in the wet season and 1 to 5 per 100 ml in the dry season values gotten in the wet season were higher than those of dry season this can be linked to the general poorer management of domestic waste during wet seasons in rural and sub urban communities owamah et al 2017 hdw samples also had higher values than bhs similar findings were reported for the isoko north local government area communities by owamah et al 2013 anova at p 0 005 revealed a significant variation in the samples of the boreholes and hand dug wells in the six selected districts the maximum of 6 per 100 ml was gotten from a hand dug well water sample obtained in ym district in july son 2007 and who 2006 standards table 2 give maximum of 10 and 0 count per 100 ml respectively following the who 2006 guideline majority of the samples from bhs and hdws in oleh community were contaminated by coliform bacteria cb higher tcb found in oer and ym samples may be due to higher population as a result of the undergraduate students living around the oer district and the presence of numerous businesses in the ym district generally the availability of cb in a good number of samples could be linked to the use of pit latrines abstraction of water from wells that are shallow open defecation and transportation of biological contaminants into shallow wells by runoff the siting of water wells close to pit toilets and septic tanks could also be contributory the presence of cb indicates that they could be some pathogenic organisms in the groundwater sources these organisms cause hepatitis intestinal disorders cholera etc owamah et al 2014 sojobi 2016 the household family survey showed that some pit latrines were sited close 20 m to water wells the survey also revealed the presence of many shallow wells of depth 5 8 m the main isolated microorganisms of interest from the bh and hdw samples were enterobacter aerogenes and e coli these isolated organisms are characteristic of the intestinal tract of humans and animals sojobi 2016 and indicates that some groundwater sources of the study area may have been contaminated with feces jacinta and adebayo 2015 dahunsi et al 2014 earlier reported that the boreholes and shallow wells in parts of ogun and lagos states nigeria were contaminated by these microorganisms sojobi 2016 also noted the same for groundwater sources in omu aran kwara state nigeria and linked it to animal droppings in the study area some boreholes and hand dug wells were observed to be littered with droppings of domestic animals and also sited near improperly built septic tanks thirty 30 of respondents from the household survey agreed to practicing open defecation sometimes jacinta and adebayo 2015 reported e aerogenes and e coli for the groundwater of gwagwalada abuja nigeria sickness like fever skin rash and diarrhea could be caused by e aerogenes okiki and ivbijaro 2013 sojobi 2016 though e aerogenes was in early time generally seen as non pathogenic dauda 2010 reported that the organisms could be pathogenic as they are resistant to antibiotics sojobi 2016 had also reported the presence of these two microorganism in the groundwater of omu aran nigeria the same was reported of lagos state okiki and ivbijaro 2013 and sloan city pradesh thakur et al 2012 olufemi and oluwole 2012 reported that these two microorganisms found in the groundwater of the study led to a cholera outbreak in ibadan the household survey also showed that there is poor sanitation and waste management practices by some households in the community filled and smelling waste bins were found in some houses especially those of the very poor there is no engineered landfill in the community domestic and commercial wastes are mainly disposed into open dumps that are sometimes close to residential houses and groundwater sources the need for good sanitation practices at family level and siting of water wells far from latrines and septic tanks can therefore not be overemphasized according to mkwate et al 2017 many of the samples from hand dug wells and bore holes 78 n 39 were noted to be in the low risk category with fc counts of less than 11 100 cfu 100 ml this indicates the need for treatment disinfection especially for the hdws this however must be on a case by case basis and could be by simple boiling chlorination etc 3 5 correlation analyses table 4 shows the correlation coefficient values of the main parameters investigated and indicates that the prominent cations and anions affecting the total dissolved solid tds are respectively sodium na 0 92 magnesium mg 0 85 calcium ca 0 83 potassium k 0 77 and sulfate so4 2 0 89 and chloride cl 0 88 respectively it follows the claim of sojobi 2016 that ca is one of most important parameters for the prediction of omu aran community groundwater tds table 4 therefore indicates that for the groundwater the most relevant cation and anion for estimating tds are na 0 92 and so4 2 0 89 respectively though the groundwater in isoko communities are generally not salty owamah et al 2013 linear correlation of ec against na k and cl had the following results r2 0 93 na r2 0 83 k and r2 0 94 cl indicates that cl and na are the two most prominent elements affecting groundwater mineralization cl was observed to be associated with na mg group given the perfect correlation range of 0 92 0 90 table 4 shows that there was a very strong correlation between pb and cd and the anions from table 4 while there was a strong correlation between so4 2 and ba na k and mg the perfect positive correlation of 0 92 that exist between so4 2 and na is indicative of strong interconnectedness with respect to their source into the groundwater which is notably anthropogenic sojobi 2016 in the same vein mg and so4 2 were found to be perfectly related 0 91 the mg and so4 2 could have also come from the same anthropogenic sources such as domestic wastewaters no3 correlated poorly with all cations suggesting that its availability in the groundwater would be more of natural than anthropogenic origin table 4 reveals that cl does have strong preferential affinity for na mg k ca surprisingly so4 2 has strong preferential affinity for na mg k ca just like cl though mg abundant aquifer permits mg to dissolve into the aquifer mg in dissolved form is often not the preferred cation by many anions in an aquifer sojobi 2016 and therefore could be responsible for the large concentration of mg in the groundwater of the community akri 2015 had stated that the chemistry of aquifers is majorly determined by the disintegration of halite ion exchanges and human activities sojobi 2016 finding from this study is indicative of the presence of halite and na rich carbonate sources in the geological formation of the community table 4 shows that ec correlated poorly with do 0 09 no3 0 447418 fe 0 04 ph 0 11 and bod5 0 22 indicating that do no3 fe ca ph and bod5 cannot be conveniently used for the prediction of ec in the groundwater of oleh community it is however different from sojobi 2016 finding for the groundwater of omu aran a nigerian community in kwara state as expected the correlation between tds and ec obtained in this study was positively perfect r2 0 90 showing that they are usually affected by similar geological factors 3 6 family water treatment and storing of drinking water according to mwabi et al 2012 treatment of water for drinking purposes can be done at home through solar disinfection boiling chlorination and many other ways majority of the households surveyed 80 were found not to have attempted any kind of water treatment at home furthermore about 52 of the households were found not to have good knowledge of household water treatment apart from the traditional boiling method fig 4 displays percentage distribution of households surveyed by water storage it shows that while 67 accepted that they store drinking water with plastic drums 32 claimed they fetch and use as needed and do not store ten 10 of however indicated that they make use of jerry cans for their water storage the survey also showed that a good number of the not too highly educated residents were unware of the health benefits of treating water at home before drinking 3 7 quality perception of drinking water sources in the study area the survey showed that the common sources of drinking water for most of the homes were bhs 65 hdws 32 and others 3 astonishingly with respect to quality perception only about 50 of the interviewees showed concern for how safe their drinking water sources were this indicates that the respondents think that their water sources are safe or are careless about the quality of their drinking water there is therefore the need for public enlightenment programmes in the community these finding is contrary to that of mkwate et al 2017 for balaka malawi as a lot of the interviewees 73 reported to be unsatisfied with the odour and turbidity of water from hdws and classified them as potential means of waterborne ill health result of household survey in this study also showed that virtually all the families 95 that had bhs showed deep satisfaction with the quality and safety of their drinking water without any test since the establishment of the bhs 3 8 health the respondents answered in the affirmative if they have suffered the cases before currently on it or noticed signs of the ailments cholera 6 diarrhea 18 gastroenteritis 16 typhoid 25 and dysentery 26 were reported by the respondents table 5 these water borne diseases are popularly associated with water contamination by bacteria dahunsi et al 2014 and therefore reinforces the microbial findings of the current study six 6 4 and 4 of the interviewees indicated that they have either being diagnosed of or have noticed symptoms of hepatitis a b and c respectively the huge percetangtes for constispation 24 dysentry 26 typhoid 25 and diarrhea 18 could be associated with bacterial contamination dahunsi et al 2014 the gastroenteritis ill health condition that was reported by 16 of the respondents can be attributed to presence of lead and cadmium in the groundwater sojobi 2016 health issues like pneumonia anemia nausea cancer and skin diseases reported by a few 3 could also be linked to ingestion of pb and cd from drinking water sojobi 2016 4 conclusion and recommendation some groundwater sources in oleh community nigeria was found to be slightly polluted with metals of pb and ca coliform bacteria and escherichia coli samples from hand dug wells hdws were noted to have higher values of these contaminants while the bacteria contamination was attributed to the poor disposal of wastes and nearness of water wells to poorly constructed septic tanks and pit latrines contamination by metals was attributed to oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region some of the health challenges reported by residents had basic relationship with the contaminants found in the groundwater the small elevated values of pb and cd could be linked to oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region though most of the hdw samples were found to be in the category of low risk fc 11 100 cfu 100 ml about 32 of the families obtained their drinking water from hand dug wells and had no working knowledge of domestic water treatment development of modern sanitary system is recommended for the area of study while government agencies in charge of clean water provision are advised to take priority in providing potable water household water treatment is recommended in the interim for the residents declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11970,this study provides a detailed scientific data on the quality of groundwater in oleh it aimed at helping to facilitate the planning of potable water supply scheme for the community water samples from boreholes bhs and hand dug wells hdws in the community were obtained for the determination of biological and physicochemical parameters from december 10 2016 to march 10 2017 for dry season and may 01 2017 to august 01 2017 for wet season structured interviews were also organized for households for the estimation of degree of access to safe drinking water quality perception and awareness of domestic treatment techniques but for ph being lower in some locations results arrived at reveal that the physicochemical parameters were within the world health organization who and standard organization of nigeria son limits cd and pb in the bhs and hdws were generally slightly higher than the maximum limits of the who and son though total coliform tc bacteria and escherichia coli were found in the samples hdws had higher values the small elevated values of pb and cd could be linked to crude oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region while most of the hdw samples 72 were found to be in the category of low risk fc 11 100 cfu 100 ml result of the survey showed that over 30 of households sourced their drinking water from hand dug wells and had no working knowledge of domestic water treatment keywords groundwater quality monitoring health perception correlation niger delta 1 introduction the importance of energy and access to water of reasonable quantity and quality to the growth and development of a country s economy cannot be overemphasized owamah et al 2020 owamah 2020a onokwai et al 2020 owamah and izinyon 2015 regular monitoring of drinking water quality abstracted underground is very important to the public health of developing nations as majority of their citizens in rural and sub urban communities depend on individual boreholes bhs and hand dug wells hdws for drinking water mkwate et al 2017 oleh is one of the popular sub urban communities in nigeria it is home to the faculties of engineering and law of the delta state university in the niger delta region of nigeria it is also the administrative headquarters of the isoko south local government area islga of delta state the inability of the nigerian government to meet the water need of the citizens has forced a large percentage of the population to depend on other sources such as individual boreholes hand dug wells and streams safe and adequate drinking water is not only essential to human health but necessary for diseases reduction mkwate et al 2017 owamah 2020b various opportunistic pathogens that occur naturally in the environment cause diseases in humans with infants young children and the elderly being at the greatest risk of infection holma et al 2018 natural sources wells and boreholes are increasingly used as drinking water sources in rural and sub urban communities in nigeria and many developing countries without tests to ascertain their potability owamah 2020b presently there have been huge efforts at raising access to safe drinking water and improvement in sanitation by the recently launched united nations sustainable development goals owamah 2020b holma et al 2018 though it has been reported that within the last three decades about 2 6 billion people in the world gained access to safe drinking water access remains a global challenge as about 663 million people consume water that is not clean and safe owamah 2020b who unicef jmp report 2015 inadequate hygiene poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water cause over one million global annual deaths and about 80 of water related ailments in developing countries who 2012 furthermore about half of the people in the globe consuming unsafe drinking water live in sub saharan africa although the who and unicef recently reported that sub saharan africa had made progress as a result of granting about 43 of her population access to improved drinking water mkwate et al 2017 in many sub urban communities in nigeria women and children still walk long distance to fetch household water access to safe water has long been identified as a major determinant of public health in nigeria owamah et al 2013 frn 2000 though a couple of studies have indicated that household water treatment hwt is an effective and economical method of preventing waterborne diseases in developing nations households in rural and sub urban communities rarely use hwt sojobi 2016 scientific data on water quality domestic treatment and safe storage practices for oleh community and environs in the niger delta region of nigeria are either non existent or scanty in the literature such information is however needed for water supply policy formulation and improved human health this research was therefore carried out to determine the level of conformity of the physico chemical and microbial parameters of groundwater in the community with the world health organization who and standard organization of nigeria son standards the study also assessed the extent of adoption of household treatment of drinking water by residents and the level of water related diseases prevalent in the study area 2 methodology 2 1 description of study area oleh is the administrative headquarters islga and host to one of the delta state university abraka campuses nigeria population commission estimated that islga had a population 323 800 as at 2016 npc 2018 though getting the actual current population of oleh community is hard to come by it happens to be one of the most populated communities in the islga while the coordinates of islga is 5 43 n 6 20 e that of oleh is 5 27 32 17 n latitude and 6 12 11 13 e longitude fig 1 islga resides within the tropical rainforest axis with luxuriant vegetation it does experience wet and dry climate with relative constant temperatures all through the year owamah et al 2013 civil service work farming trading and artisanship are some of the major economic activities of the residents of the study area oleh besides being a host to a campus of the delta state university abraka has several primary and secondary schools its current predominant religion is christianity the islga like its neighboring isoko north local government area has mean precipitation annual monthly temperature average and relative humidity range of 2800 mm 31 c and 76 90 respectively owamah 2020b the islga is a prominent crude oil producing part of the south south zone nigeria there is a flow station near the faculty of engineering delta state university oleh campus 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics of the study area oleh is one of the popular towns in the south south geo political zone of nigeria popularly called the niger delta region the region is generally of flat topography and slopes slightly towards the sea akpokodje and etu efeotor 1987 atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the region lies in the sedimentary basin and without outcrop it experiences flooding during the wet season and has a mean elevation of about 10 m above the sea level geologically the region comprises three major subsurface lithostratigraphic units overlain by quaternary deposits atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the akata formation is the base of the unit and consists majorly of marine shales the thickness of the formation is within the range of 550 to over 6000 m the overlying paralic sequence is the agbada formation comprising interbedded sands and shale with a thickness range of 300 to 4500 m with the upper most unit being the benin formation details of the hydrogeological characteristics of the study area is documented in atakpo and ayolabi 2009 the hydraulic conductivity has been reported to be in the range of 3 82 10 3 to 9 0 10 2 cm s implying that the aquifer is productive offodile 1991 olobaniyi and owoyemi 2006 2 3 water sampling and analysis 2 3 1 collection of water sample oleh community was divided into six districts for the sake of data collection and reporting convenience government residential area gra engineering faculty ef old emede road oer yanga market ym ichofu ic and faculty of law fl districts the sampled groundwater sources of this study are regularly used by residents sampling was therefore representative as sources were purged by regular usage this notwithstanding about 100 l was pumped prior to sampling to ensure proper rinsing of all equipment samples were directly collected from taps for boreholes bhs spouts for hand pump wells and from dedicated community sampling rope and bucket for shallow wells to obtain representative samples and prevent cross contamination in this study hand pump wells and shallow wells were grouped together as hand dug wells hdws due to the fact that while some places had only hand pump wells others had shallow wells only a few places had both and in such situations the authors sampled the hand dug well more frequently used by the residents taps spouts ropes and buckets were pre cleaned before water samples were collected bamigboye et al 2020 ward et al 2020 one and half 1 5 l high density pet screw capped containers were utilized for fetching water samples from bhs and hdws from december 10 2016 to march 10 2017 for dry season and may 01 2017 to august 01 2017 for wet season twenty 24 raw water samples four 4 from each district 2 no bh 2 no hdw were collected every month to give one hundred and forty four 144 samples each for bh and hdw before collection of the actual sample the pet containers were washed thoroughly with distilled water and followed by washing with water to be sampled thereafter the stoppered and labeled containers were ice cooled and transported to the laboratory within 2 h from the time of sample collection as was done by owamah 2020b and shakerkhatibi et al 2019 at each sampling point while one bottle was filled with un acidified water the other was acidified through the addition of little drops of hydrogen trioxo nitrate v acid to end microbial activities collection of samples for microbiological analysis was done with sterilized autoclaved bottles while acidified samples were used for metals analysis the non acidified samples were used for the determination of the concentration of physical parameters and anions apha 2012 for the preservation of the integrity of water samples before analyses samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 2 procedures for parameters analyses total dissolved solids vsi 22 vsi electronics india temperature hi 98517 hanna instr ph hi 9024 c hanna usa electrical conductivity hi 2315 and salinity hi 19311 were analyzed in situ with the stated hand held digital meters following apha 1992 dissolved oxygen was determined by the azide modification of winkler s method determination of the concentration of chloride was done by titration technique in line with procedures in apha 1992 through the use of a uv spectrophotometer uv s dr 2800 hach usa and uv s screening method the major anions were determined khan et al 2013 owamah 2020b to ensure reproducibility of the analyses pre analyzed standard and blank samples were analyzed at the end of all 10 samples sojobi 2016 the total coliform bacteria as maximum probability number in the samples were counted following standard methods apha 2012 metals analysis was carried out by the use of atomic absorption spectrophotometer sens aa 3000 australia following stipulations in apha 2012 calculated conductivities deviated from measured conductivities by only 2 as expected apha 2012 2 4 ill health water quality awareness and household water treatment survey for better understanding of the implications of drinking contaminated water on health a health survey was carried out through the use of structured questionnaires the sample size was estimated using eq 1 developed by krejcie and morgan 1970 1 n x 2 n p 1 p d 2 n 1 x 2 p 1 p where n sample size n population size p population proportion assumed to be the maximum 50 x2 table value of chi square for 1 degree of freedom at the desired confidence level 1 962 3 8416 and d degree of accuracy expressed as a proportion based on the estimated population of oleh response rate of 30 and error margin of 3 5 krejcie and morgan 1970 a sample size of 784 was estimated at 95 confidence level which was rounded up to 1000 hence a 1000 respondents comprising male and female with at least primary school level education were surveyed these 1000 respondents comprised 260 male adults 310 female adults 250 and 180 male and female children respectively the children were aged between 12 and 17 years for water quality awareness and household water treatment survey 200 families having at least three inhabitants were captured occupational and demographic data and habits of the interviewees were also recorded the reason for the difference in number of respondents for both surveys is that while the health disease survey was carried out among individuals the household survey for perception on water quality and level of household treatment was carried out at household level and targeted at the heads the household heads father or mother were mainly targeted for interview after their consent had been sort and obtained this is in sync with previous reports khan et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 the survey team consisted of three 3 fairly knowledgeable persons on health and six 6 civil and environmental engineering undergraduate students though random selection of respondents was adopted their consents were sought before the questionnaire documents were administered to them the team members did their best to explain hard words and phrases in the questionnaire to respondents dahunsi et al 2014 2 5 statistical analyses analyses of data obtained were done using the 2010 microsoft office excel software package and the analysis of variance anova statistical tool at p 0 005 the mean and standard deviation of the parameters studied were generated for both seasons adopting wet season as the point of reference seasonal mean variations were also computed 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical parameters figs 2 a 2e and table 1 show the values of some of the physico chemical parameters obtained in this study the discussion of results obtained was done through direct comparison of values obtained with the who 2006 and the son 2007 standards for drinking water ph was found to range from 4 90 to 6 20 in hdws and 4 40 to 6 70 in bhs table 1 ph value ranged from 4 4 to 6 2 in the wet season and 4 8 to 6 7 in the dry season a seasonal average difference of 0 2 was also obtained this indicates that the ph of groundwater sources in the community was fairly constant season notwithstanding granted this ph values in the wet season were however slightly higher than dry season values this could be associated with the rise of water level during wet seasons which brings with it some level of dilution the ph spatial map of fig 3 a shows that majority of the acidic values were got from bhs of ym district and hdws of oer district for both wet and dry seasons bh samples were found to be more acidic than hdw samples a maximum ph of 6 7 was obtained from a borehole in gra district in the month of july table 1 figs 2b fig 3a ph values of this study are similar to those of groundwater sources in neighboring isoko north communities owamah et al 2013 since the who prescription for ph lies between 6 5 and 8 5 water abstracted from a few groundwater sources in the community may need to be treated with lime to raise it to the desired level though ph is not a major health related water quality parameter low levels of it alter the state of other water quality parameters and hence it could cause indirect health problems to humans khan et al 2013 drinking water with low ph could also cause gastrointestinal irritations the lower than permissible ph range obtained from the different water sources may be linked to the geology of the study area sojobi 2016 it could also be due to the presence of organic matter in the soil or gas flaring in the area that produces co which could have been percolating in dissolved form into the groundwater to reduce ph nwankwoala and walter 2012 similar findings of low ph values were obtained from groundwater sources of neighboring isoko north local governmental area inlga communities by owamah et al 2013 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in ph among the sampling sites for the boreholes and hand dug wells and across the seasons for electrical conductivity ec the highest ec was obtained from a bh within fl district 486 μs cm 1 in the month of february this was closely followed by another hdw at oer district 450 μs cm 1 table 1 fig 2a ec values obtained are within the prescribed limit 1000 μs cm 1 set by the son 2007 and who 2006 for drinking water there was no significant variability p 0 05 among the different sources locations and seasons ec results obtained are consistent with findings from other parts of nigeria while a maximum and minimum ec of 500 41 5 μs cm 1 and 75 3 3 μs cm 1 were obtained for neighboring inlga communities by owamah et al 2013 dahunsi et al 2014 obtained 308 33 1 53 μs cm 1 and 22 4 0 53 μs cm 1 as maximum and minimum ec for selected communities in ogun and lagos states the tds values of the water samples were less than the highest permissible value of 500 mgl 1 set by the who 2006 and son 2007 for drinking water while tds shows the total ions ec is a function of the ionic activities of a solution owamah 2020b lenntech 2016 respectively the mean tds values obtained for wet and dry seasons are 54 and 52 mg l 1 the seasonal average variation obtained is 2 mg l 1 wet dry while the wet season values ranged from 10 to 134 mg l 1 it was 12 134 mg l 1 for dry season hdw water samples from oer district had the maximum dry and wet season tds of 134 and 130 mg l 1 respectively fig 2e compared with bh samples table 1 fig 2e water samples from the hand dug wells had higher values this can be linked to the intrusion of runoff into them following the absence of borehole casings and caps it could also be the result of soil disturbance within the well during water withdrawals mkwate et al 2017 similar values of higher tds for shallow wells were obtained by dahunsi et al 2014 for towns in nigeria s south west and owamah et al 2013 for isoko north local government area communities the seasonal average values for do are 9 mg l 1 wet season and 8 mg l 1 dry season it ranged from 10 to 13 mg l 1 wet season and 10 12 mg l 1 dry season fig 2c shows the values of do obtained from boreholes and hand dug wells in both seasons the do values obtained in the study area are above the who 2006 prescribed minimum value of 4 mg l 1 and hence in order bod ranged from 5 to 7 mg l 1 for the wet season and 4 8 mg l 1 for the dry season fig 2d for both seasons the average value is 6 mg l 1 table 1 and is within the maximum allowable value ademoroti 1996 3 2 anions anions were considered in this study because of their influence on water quality and human health table 1 shows the average values of the various anions determined in the study the range of chloride concentration gotten was 4 58 mg l 1 for wet season and 5 65 mg l 1 for the dry season seasonal average values of 17 mg l 1 wet and 13 mg l 1 dry were obtained in line with the report of egboh and emeshili 2008 of higher chloride concentration in the wet season for neighboring communities chloride values obtained were higher in hdws and during the wet season while the minimum cl concentration of 2 0 5 mg l 1 was obtained from a bh in ic district during the dry season the maximum of 65 1 6 mg l 1 was from a hand dug well in gra district in the wet season small values of the standard deviation imply minor variability in the concentration of cl the values of cl concentration obtained are below the stipulated maximum permissible limit of 250 mg l 1 by the son 2007 indicating that chloride may not be an issue of health concern in the community a previous study by dahunsi et al 2014 on some major cities in ogun and lagos states nigeria also reported low concentration of chloride of the range of 1 97 9 04 mg l 1 for bhs and hdws mkwate et al 2017 equally reported low levels of chloride in the range of 5 45 89 84 mg l 1 for boreholes and shallow wells in balaka district malawi showing that chloride was not a source of worry for groundwater used as drinking water in the areas studied the average values of no3 obtained were 1 and 3 mg l 1 for dry and wet season respectively these are similar to values obtained in the neighboring ndokwa east and isoko north local government areas of delta state by egboh and emeshili 2008 and owamah et al 2013 respectively at p 0 005 using anova no3 values were found to be significantly higher in hdw samples compared to bhs it also varied across the districts for the hand dug wells and boreholes though nitrate was not detected in one hdw and two bhs from three different districts table 1 its concentration of 1 3 mg l 1 in the rest other samples is below the stipulated maximum level of 50 mg l 1 set by the son 2007 and hence indicates non contamination there was no significant p 0 05 variation of nitrate concentration among all the sampling locations and among the wells across the seasons the concentration range of so4 2 was 2 28 mg l 1 the seasonal mean concentrations were 10 mg l 1 for wet season and 7 mg l 1 for the dry seasons while a seasonal mean variation of 3 mg l 1 was obtained hdw samples of the wet season had higher values sulfate though a minor toxic anion its consumption in excess can lead to dehydration who 1996 dahunsi et al 2014 sulfate values obtained for the area of study are within the who 2006 and son 2007 stipulated guidelines of 500 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 respectively table 2 3 3 metals the mean concentrations of metals of pb c mg ca na k zn cu fe and ba detected in this study are shown in table 3 na concentration range of 2200 110 72 to 100 13 340 μg l 1 from this present study is below the prescribed maximum limit of 200 000 μg l 1 set by the who 2006 and son 2007 table 3 and hence not considered a contaminant according to hem 1985 the range of fe usually found in natural fresh water is 0 5 50 mg l 1 apart from water samples of the hdw in ym district with fe concentration 850 290 μg l 1 above the prescribed maximum limit of 300 μg l 1 by the son 2007 and with very high variability as indicted by the standard deviation the rest other values obtained across the districts table 3 were below the specified maximum permissible level high levels of fe in water could lead to characteristic reddish staining and increased turbidity mkwate et al 2017 the value of potassium k obtained is in line with the claim of mkwate et al 2017 that k concentration in natural waters has been widely reported to be low 0 15 000 μg l 1 potassium levels obtained in this study are below the recommended limits of 25 000 50 000 μg l 1 sojobi 2016 for drinking water as shown in table 3 the seasonal average concentration values of na k mg and ca are 17 700 μg l 1 15 300 μg l 1 12 100 μg l 1 9000 μg l 1 11 000 μg l 1 4000 μg l 1 and 10 000 μg l 1 8000 μg l 1 wet dry respectively values of the metals obtained for the study area are all within the prescribed limits of the who and son table 2 fig 3b shows the spatial water quality map for ca and mg obtained for the study area and reveals that about the same values of mg and ca were obtained from the bhs and hdws in oleh the reason for the higher values of na k mg and ca in the wet season could be due to the higher dissolution of rock containing the minerals of these metals during the rains na k mg and ca were all detected at lower than prescribed maximum limits of the who and son similar values were obtained for the groundwater of neighboring emevor community owamah 2020b the maximum concentration of zn 3410 1500 μg l 1 was obtained in july from a hand dug well water sample in gra district the concentration of zn ranged from 60 30 μg l 1 3410 1500 μg l 1 wet season and 60 10 μg l 1 2510 1300 μg l 1 dry season for the seasonal average values of zn 1320 μg l 1 and 275 μg l 1 were respectively obtained for the wet and dry seasons only the zn of hdw 3410 1500 μg l 1 wet season and bh 3010 1400 dry season of gra district slightly surpassed the who 2006 and son 2007 maximum acceptable limit of 3000 μg l 1 table 2 zinc is majorly introduced into groundwater by artificial pathways it mainly comes into groundwater through erosion of zn containing rock and soil minerals however since zn only dissolves in water at low concentration high natural levels of zn in water are usually associated with high concentration of other metals such as lead and cadmium though zn is an important nutrient for body growth and development high levels of zinc can lead to nausea vomiting and stomach cramps owamah et al 2013 the maximum concentration of pb of 300 20 μg l 1 was obtained from a borehole in oer district in the month of december the minimum concentration of 10 μg l 1 was obtained from borehole and hand dug well water samples from ym ic gra and lf districts pb was detected in the various bh and hdw water samples from the six 6 representative districts seasonal average concentrations of 28 μg l 1 and 41 μg l 1 for wet and dry seasons were respectively obtained the concentration of cd ranged from 10 μg l 1 to 80 μg l 1 for both wet and dry seasons with mean concentration of 20 μg l 1 wet season and 10 μg l 1 dry season also the concentration of cu ranged from 20 20 μg l 1 2110 700 μg l 1 wet season and from 10 20 μg l 1 1370 150 μg l 1 dry season while the mean cu concentration for the wet season is 18 μg l 1 that of the dry is 310 μg l 1 furthermore while the concentration of ba ranged from 50 10 μg l 1 2510 440 μg l 1 in the wet season and from 40 20 μg l 1 1540 1540 μg l 1 in the dry season the seasonal average values are 1275 μg l 1 and 380 μg l 1 for wet and dry seasons respectively apart from pb and cd mean concentrations wet and dry season concentrations of the other metals reported were below the who 2006 and son 2007 stipulated maximum limits table 2 using anova at p 0 005 no significant difference in the metals concentration of hand dug well and bore hole water samples was obtained the presence of slightly elevated levels of lead in some samples in the study area may be due to exploration and processing of crude oil in the area and the indiscriminate dumping of various forms of electronic wastes and spent batteries on the soil owamah 2020b the presence of a flow station could also be contributory further study on generation rate and management of electronic wastes in the community and by extension the niger delta region of nigeria is suggested according owamah et al 2013 ingestion of high levels of pb can damage the kidney and brain and sometimes cause miscarriage reports also show that elevated levels of pb in kids could cause convulsion and neurological damages usepa 1991 khan et al 2013 in men high level of pb may destroy organs of reproduction cadmium and its various compounds are reportedly carcinogenic sojobi 2016 at high levels of exposure cd can cause vomiting and diarrhea lower levels for a long time can also cause accumulation of the metal in the kidney and later kidney impairment usepa 1977 mkwate et al 2017 other health challenges associated with drinking water containing high levels of pb and cd are contained in sojobi 2016 3 4 microbial parameters mean values of total coliform bacteria tcb of hdw and bh samples are shown in table 1 among the six representative districts surveyed the lf bhs for dry and wet seasons had the lowest tcb of 5 and 3 per 100 ml respectively it ranged from 1 to 6 per 100 ml in the wet season and 1 to 5 per 100 ml in the dry season values gotten in the wet season were higher than those of dry season this can be linked to the general poorer management of domestic waste during wet seasons in rural and sub urban communities owamah et al 2017 hdw samples also had higher values than bhs similar findings were reported for the isoko north local government area communities by owamah et al 2013 anova at p 0 005 revealed a significant variation in the samples of the boreholes and hand dug wells in the six selected districts the maximum of 6 per 100 ml was gotten from a hand dug well water sample obtained in ym district in july son 2007 and who 2006 standards table 2 give maximum of 10 and 0 count per 100 ml respectively following the who 2006 guideline majority of the samples from bhs and hdws in oleh community were contaminated by coliform bacteria cb higher tcb found in oer and ym samples may be due to higher population as a result of the undergraduate students living around the oer district and the presence of numerous businesses in the ym district generally the availability of cb in a good number of samples could be linked to the use of pit latrines abstraction of water from wells that are shallow open defecation and transportation of biological contaminants into shallow wells by runoff the siting of water wells close to pit toilets and septic tanks could also be contributory the presence of cb indicates that they could be some pathogenic organisms in the groundwater sources these organisms cause hepatitis intestinal disorders cholera etc owamah et al 2014 sojobi 2016 the household family survey showed that some pit latrines were sited close 20 m to water wells the survey also revealed the presence of many shallow wells of depth 5 8 m the main isolated microorganisms of interest from the bh and hdw samples were enterobacter aerogenes and e coli these isolated organisms are characteristic of the intestinal tract of humans and animals sojobi 2016 and indicates that some groundwater sources of the study area may have been contaminated with feces jacinta and adebayo 2015 dahunsi et al 2014 earlier reported that the boreholes and shallow wells in parts of ogun and lagos states nigeria were contaminated by these microorganisms sojobi 2016 also noted the same for groundwater sources in omu aran kwara state nigeria and linked it to animal droppings in the study area some boreholes and hand dug wells were observed to be littered with droppings of domestic animals and also sited near improperly built septic tanks thirty 30 of respondents from the household survey agreed to practicing open defecation sometimes jacinta and adebayo 2015 reported e aerogenes and e coli for the groundwater of gwagwalada abuja nigeria sickness like fever skin rash and diarrhea could be caused by e aerogenes okiki and ivbijaro 2013 sojobi 2016 though e aerogenes was in early time generally seen as non pathogenic dauda 2010 reported that the organisms could be pathogenic as they are resistant to antibiotics sojobi 2016 had also reported the presence of these two microorganism in the groundwater of omu aran nigeria the same was reported of lagos state okiki and ivbijaro 2013 and sloan city pradesh thakur et al 2012 olufemi and oluwole 2012 reported that these two microorganisms found in the groundwater of the study led to a cholera outbreak in ibadan the household survey also showed that there is poor sanitation and waste management practices by some households in the community filled and smelling waste bins were found in some houses especially those of the very poor there is no engineered landfill in the community domestic and commercial wastes are mainly disposed into open dumps that are sometimes close to residential houses and groundwater sources the need for good sanitation practices at family level and siting of water wells far from latrines and septic tanks can therefore not be overemphasized according to mkwate et al 2017 many of the samples from hand dug wells and bore holes 78 n 39 were noted to be in the low risk category with fc counts of less than 11 100 cfu 100 ml this indicates the need for treatment disinfection especially for the hdws this however must be on a case by case basis and could be by simple boiling chlorination etc 3 5 correlation analyses table 4 shows the correlation coefficient values of the main parameters investigated and indicates that the prominent cations and anions affecting the total dissolved solid tds are respectively sodium na 0 92 magnesium mg 0 85 calcium ca 0 83 potassium k 0 77 and sulfate so4 2 0 89 and chloride cl 0 88 respectively it follows the claim of sojobi 2016 that ca is one of most important parameters for the prediction of omu aran community groundwater tds table 4 therefore indicates that for the groundwater the most relevant cation and anion for estimating tds are na 0 92 and so4 2 0 89 respectively though the groundwater in isoko communities are generally not salty owamah et al 2013 linear correlation of ec against na k and cl had the following results r2 0 93 na r2 0 83 k and r2 0 94 cl indicates that cl and na are the two most prominent elements affecting groundwater mineralization cl was observed to be associated with na mg group given the perfect correlation range of 0 92 0 90 table 4 shows that there was a very strong correlation between pb and cd and the anions from table 4 while there was a strong correlation between so4 2 and ba na k and mg the perfect positive correlation of 0 92 that exist between so4 2 and na is indicative of strong interconnectedness with respect to their source into the groundwater which is notably anthropogenic sojobi 2016 in the same vein mg and so4 2 were found to be perfectly related 0 91 the mg and so4 2 could have also come from the same anthropogenic sources such as domestic wastewaters no3 correlated poorly with all cations suggesting that its availability in the groundwater would be more of natural than anthropogenic origin table 4 reveals that cl does have strong preferential affinity for na mg k ca surprisingly so4 2 has strong preferential affinity for na mg k ca just like cl though mg abundant aquifer permits mg to dissolve into the aquifer mg in dissolved form is often not the preferred cation by many anions in an aquifer sojobi 2016 and therefore could be responsible for the large concentration of mg in the groundwater of the community akri 2015 had stated that the chemistry of aquifers is majorly determined by the disintegration of halite ion exchanges and human activities sojobi 2016 finding from this study is indicative of the presence of halite and na rich carbonate sources in the geological formation of the community table 4 shows that ec correlated poorly with do 0 09 no3 0 447418 fe 0 04 ph 0 11 and bod5 0 22 indicating that do no3 fe ca ph and bod5 cannot be conveniently used for the prediction of ec in the groundwater of oleh community it is however different from sojobi 2016 finding for the groundwater of omu aran a nigerian community in kwara state as expected the correlation between tds and ec obtained in this study was positively perfect r2 0 90 showing that they are usually affected by similar geological factors 3 6 family water treatment and storing of drinking water according to mwabi et al 2012 treatment of water for drinking purposes can be done at home through solar disinfection boiling chlorination and many other ways majority of the households surveyed 80 were found not to have attempted any kind of water treatment at home furthermore about 52 of the households were found not to have good knowledge of household water treatment apart from the traditional boiling method fig 4 displays percentage distribution of households surveyed by water storage it shows that while 67 accepted that they store drinking water with plastic drums 32 claimed they fetch and use as needed and do not store ten 10 of however indicated that they make use of jerry cans for their water storage the survey also showed that a good number of the not too highly educated residents were unware of the health benefits of treating water at home before drinking 3 7 quality perception of drinking water sources in the study area the survey showed that the common sources of drinking water for most of the homes were bhs 65 hdws 32 and others 3 astonishingly with respect to quality perception only about 50 of the interviewees showed concern for how safe their drinking water sources were this indicates that the respondents think that their water sources are safe or are careless about the quality of their drinking water there is therefore the need for public enlightenment programmes in the community these finding is contrary to that of mkwate et al 2017 for balaka malawi as a lot of the interviewees 73 reported to be unsatisfied with the odour and turbidity of water from hdws and classified them as potential means of waterborne ill health result of household survey in this study also showed that virtually all the families 95 that had bhs showed deep satisfaction with the quality and safety of their drinking water without any test since the establishment of the bhs 3 8 health the respondents answered in the affirmative if they have suffered the cases before currently on it or noticed signs of the ailments cholera 6 diarrhea 18 gastroenteritis 16 typhoid 25 and dysentery 26 were reported by the respondents table 5 these water borne diseases are popularly associated with water contamination by bacteria dahunsi et al 2014 and therefore reinforces the microbial findings of the current study six 6 4 and 4 of the interviewees indicated that they have either being diagnosed of or have noticed symptoms of hepatitis a b and c respectively the huge percetangtes for constispation 24 dysentry 26 typhoid 25 and diarrhea 18 could be associated with bacterial contamination dahunsi et al 2014 the gastroenteritis ill health condition that was reported by 16 of the respondents can be attributed to presence of lead and cadmium in the groundwater sojobi 2016 health issues like pneumonia anemia nausea cancer and skin diseases reported by a few 3 could also be linked to ingestion of pb and cd from drinking water sojobi 2016 4 conclusion and recommendation some groundwater sources in oleh community nigeria was found to be slightly polluted with metals of pb and ca coliform bacteria and escherichia coli samples from hand dug wells hdws were noted to have higher values of these contaminants while the bacteria contamination was attributed to the poor disposal of wastes and nearness of water wells to poorly constructed septic tanks and pit latrines contamination by metals was attributed to oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region some of the health challenges reported by residents had basic relationship with the contaminants found in the groundwater the small elevated values of pb and cd could be linked to oil exploration and processing activities in the sub region though most of the hdw samples were found to be in the category of low risk fc 11 100 cfu 100 ml about 32 of the families obtained their drinking water from hand dug wells and had no working knowledge of domestic water treatment development of modern sanitary system is recommended for the area of study while government agencies in charge of clean water provision are advised to take priority in providing potable water household water treatment is recommended in the interim for the residents declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

11971,groundwater is the second most important natural resource of freshwater in egypt after the river nile groundwater is the unique reliable water resource in the egyptian deserts for domestic agriculture and industrial uses field hydrological data and twenty groundwater samples were collected from the quaternary aquifer boreholes to ascertain their quality for drinking and agricultural purposes in the desert area south al waqf upper egypt the groundwater is slightly alkaline with variable salinity tds varies from 455 to 4595 mg l the predominant ions were na and cl and the predominant water type is na k cl so4 the water sediment interaction considered the main controller of water chemistry the groundwater is unsuitable for human drinking purposes wherein the case of one

quality egypt 1 introduction groundwater is the second most important natural resource of the earth and is widely distributed it supports life on earth uses as drinking water and aids in the agricultural industrial and overall economic growth in opposite to surface water groundwater is mostly less vulnerable to pollution salman 2013 the impurities that replenish the groundwater system are removed while infiltrating through the soil and rocks this natural resource is recharged mainly in a cyclic manner with rainwater it has a constant temperature dependable color taste and odor and generally free from pathogens radiochemical and other poisonous contaminations osman et al 2012 singh 2017 the chemical composition of the groundwater depends upon the mineral composition of the sediments through which the water passes hem 1970 salman et al 2013 2019a it has been shown that the dissolved cations are derived from the solution of minerals in rocks and soil while the anions are mostly derived from non lithological sources the bicarbonate present in water is mainly derived from carbon dioxide that is extracted from the air and liberated in the soil through biochemical activities as far as the concentration of chloride and sulfate ions in the groundwater are concerned it has been found that some rocks also serve as direct sources therefore the different types of rocks have a different impact on the chemical composition of groundwater as it is governed by the mineral composition of the rocks salman et al 2019b water pollution is the most horrible crisis facing humankind today and can be classified as geogenic and anthropogenic pollution kashyap et al 2016 most crises arise from the anthropogenic activities including urban agriculture industrial and speedy natural resource exploitation owing to population explosion islam et al 2014 zeid et al 2018 nyambura et al 2020 water pollutants refer to anything causing a change in water physicochemical and biological characteristics and can be divided into biologic e g bacteria organic e g ddt and inorganic e g nox and heavy metals behera 2015 the most recorded water pollutants are heavy metals and have been linked to many health problems worldwide hasan et al 2016 melegy et al 2014 salman et al 2019a polluted water with heavy metals can cause various cancers paul 2017 salman et al 2019a renal failure melegy et al 2014 paul 2017 parkinson s disease alzheimer s and muscular dystrophy verma and dwivedi 2013 salman 2013 pointed out the role of surplus infiltration of irrigation water and land application of domestic wastewater disposal through hand dug wells in the pollution of groundwater water should be of certain physical and chemical characteristics to be used safely for irrigation saline water can adversely affect plant growth and yield dpird 2019 in addition heavy metals can change physiological and biochemical activities within the plant and hence reduce their growth and yield chibuike and obiora 2014 in egypt urban expansion owing to overpopulation and narrow river nile floodplain led to the expansion in the desert fringes reclamation and consequentially groundwater exploration and abstraction groundwater represents the second resource of freshwater for different purposes after the river nile the study area is lying south al waqf city qena governorate egypt between latitudes of 25 57 n to of 26 06 n and longitudes of 32 21 e to 32 33 e fig 1 this area includes many new reclaimed farmlands which depends mainly on groundwater for irrigation these farms produce manly seasonal crops such as vegetables wheat egyptian clover and corn therefore this work was conducted to evaluate groundwater hydrochemistry and suitability for different purposes in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrogeological settings the study area is of arid climate with temperature varies between 27 c 47 c and 7 c 28 c in summer and winter respectively rainfall rarely occurs the average annual rainfall does not exceed 4 mm year abdallatief et al 2012 many authors studied geology of qena e g ahmed 1983 askalany 1988 el belasy 1994 issawi and mccauley 1992 mansour and kamal el dein 2001 omer 1996 said 1962 1981 and 1990 qena area fig 2 covered by sediments and sedimentary rocks ranging in age from lower eocene to recent the pliocene consists of a long series of interbedded red brown clay madamud formation which acts as an aquiclude for the overlying quaternary aquifer the pleistocene and recent subdivided into different formations these are fluviatile and alluvial deposits covering most of the study area in the form of gravel coarse sand and loamy materials the water bearing unit is composed of pleistocene sediments gravely sand saturated sediments intercalated with clay layers the aquifer thickness is not uniform due to the effect of the fault structure system of the nile elsheikh et al 2015 the aquifer thickness is increased to the north and northwest direction from 60 to 120 m in some locations clay lenses were detected in different depths so the aquifer is found under the unconfined to semi confined conditions the depth to the water table is gradually increased from 2 m in the north next to the river nile to about 72 m in the southern area the aquifer is recharged mainly by seepage from the irrigation system and excess irrigation water groundwater general flows from south to north but the intensive pumping in the center reclamation area formed a big depression cone accompanied by many local groundwater flow directions elsheikh et al 2015 2 2 sampling and analyses twenty groundwater samples were collected in 1 l polypropylene bottles from the boreholes within the study area to ascertain the quality of the quaternary aquifer during september 2019 the wells were continuously pumped for almost 15 min before sampling the ph temperature t c electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds with instrument factor 0 45 ec were determined in situ using a combined electrode hanna hi 991301 which was calibrated before taking the readings in the laboratory all samples were filtered and split into different polyethylene bottles for subsequent analyses of cations and anions the samples were analyzed for chemical constituents by using standard procedures of apha 2012 high purity chemicals double distilled water high precision balance adam pw 124 0 0001 g were used in all analyses besides all chemical analyses were done in triplicate calcium magnesium carbonate bicarbonate and chloride were analyzed by volumetric methods sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer nitrate and sulfate were determined by using the hanna spectrophotometer instrument model hi 83215 heavy metals fe mn as cd cu pb and

10 4 1 3 results and discussion the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the study area including temperature t total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec acidity ph and major minor and trace ionic concentrations are illustrated in table 1 the temperature recorded is due to its vital role in the biological physical and chemical activities in the water the gases o2 co2 n2 and ch4 solubility in water is decreased with increasing temperature yilmaz and koc 2014 the recorded temperature 25 7 c is acceptable for different water usage and is consistent with the ambient air temperature it is mostly negatively correlated low significance with the studied parameters table 2 indicating their low role in the solubility of these ions the groundwater ph was slightly alkaline varied from 7 06 to 7 88 and this is preferred for water quality because of water alkalinity heavy metals can be precipitated from the water with carbonate or bicarbonate ahipathy and puttaiah 2006 in the studied area the ph value is mainly controlled by the strong acid ions so4 and cl as supported by the negative correlation table 2 between ph and both so4 r 0 71 and cl r 0 59 oyem et al 2014 also recorded a negative correlation between ph and water salts the very wide range of tds from 455 to 4595 mg l and ec from 1010 to 10210 μs cm suggests that many intermixed processes including the natural water sediment interaction and the anthropogenic activities infiltration of surplus irrigation water loaded with washed salts and leaching of salts from the nearby metallurgical industrial area aluminum industry control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area moreover this is supported by the wide difference between q3 and q1 table 1 and the positive correlation with the studied major cations natural as well as with cd as and pb anthropogenic table 2 besides the aridity of the study area and hence the high evaporation rate can cause the enrichment of tds and ec ismail et al 2020 the estimated ca and mg of the analyzed groundwater samples display a great variation implies that their behavior is controlled by water sediment interaction the positive correlation of ca and mg with the tds chloride sulfate sodium and potassium indicates the leaching of ca and mg from the reworked pliocene clays and other silicate minerals that incorporated in the pleistocene sediments besides the dissolution of sulfate minerals from these sediments is another important source of calcium on the other hand the negative correlation of bicarbonate with ca and mg suggests that the dissolution of the carbonate materials in these sediments has an insignificant influence on their behavior the concentration of sodium displays a very large range of fluctuating from 106 to 943 mg l table 1 the dissolution of na bearing minerals particularly sodium chloride from the pliocene marine sediments through the water sediment interaction is an essential source of sodium in groundwater of this aquifer el rawy et al 2019 salman and elnazer 2015 this is confirmed by the very strong positive correlation between na and cl r 0 99 therefore the same natural processes control the behavior of sodium and anthropogenic activities that affect salinity the potassium concentration in the groundwater samples analyzed varies from 8 to 46 mg l this reflects the effect of using potassium fertilizers on the reclaimed land as indicated by the positive correlation table 2 between k and so4 r 0 69 leaching of k from the fine argillaceous sediments may be another factor elevating the potassium content as indicated from the positive correlation between potassium and tds r 0 77 na r 0 8 ca r 0 67 and mg r 0 61 chloride contents of the analyzed groundwater samples display a very wide variation with a mean value of 530 mg l the stated vast range in the chloride values from 98 to 1350 mg l suggested that numerous intermixed processes control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer the strong positive correlation between chloride and both sodium r 0 97 and tds r 0 98 indicates that chloride is affected by the same natural processes and the anthropogenic activities mentioned there in addition this strong correlation indicated that evaporate dissolution like halite and gypsum increasing groundwater salinization chen et al 2014 the distribution pattern of chloride that is nearly identical to that of sodium and tds confirms the mentioned conclusion sulfates display a great variation in concentration ranging from 53 to 1218 mg l table 1 implying that several intermixed processes including the water sediment interaction and the anthropogenic activities control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area sulfates have a strong positive correlation with tds r 0 98 chloride r 0 93 and sodium r 0 96 reflecting the similarity of their behavior this means that sulfates are the main component of the dissolved salts in the more saline groundwater the measured bicarbonate of the groundwater samples analyzed varies from 51 to 194 mg l consequently the low bicarbonate hco3 content in these samples although the abundant calcareous materials grains and cement in the contained sediments omer 1996 is due to the low co2 content in groundwater of the studied area the use of drip irrigation instead of flood irrigation considered the main cause of the low co2 content in the aquifer that reduces the dissolution of caco3 and confirms the low vulnerability of this aquifer the variation in water chemistry in the study area can be attributed naturally to the geologic settings the study area contains many faults and clay lenses that can control water movement and chemistry abu el ella 1993 omer 1996 the chemistry of water is affected also by the aquifer hydraulic parameters salman et al 2019b in the study area the hydraulic characteristics vary from one place to another due to lateral and vertical lithofacies changes where transmissivity is varying from 155 to 420 m2 day storativity from 0 00021 to 0 0064 hydraulic conductivity from 1 3 to 5 2 m day elsheikh et al 2015 the increase of transmissivity in the central part of the study area may attribute to fracture lateral facies and thickness changes of the aquifer caused by faulting of the aquifer layer depths to water table vary from site to site 10 70 m with the variation in the topographic elevations fig 3 the variable pumping rates aquifer lithofacies and structural setting led to divergent groundwater flow paths the main trend of groundwater flow is from north to south fig 4 suggesting the recharge from the river nile the heavy pumping in the center part of the study area led to the appearance of groundwater down cone accompanied by many local groundwater flow directions fig 4 the change in the study area hydrogeological parameters e g hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity gives a great variation in the vulnerability of the aquifer fig 4 from very low to very high vulnerable areas elsheikh et al 2015 the end member plot was applied to understand the water sediment interaction influence on the groundwater chemistry gaillardet et al 1999 in the diagram fig 5 two geochemical processes silicate weathering and evaporates dissolution control groundwater chemistry in the study area another important factor affecting groundwater chemistry is the evaporation process as a result of the aridity in the study area the evaporation impact can be dedicated to the stabilization of the na cl molar ratio with increasing ec kumar et al 2006 ismail et al 2020 and the low correlation r 0 14 supports the evaporation role fig 6 spatial distribution maps of the water physicochemical properties were prepared by interpolating the measurements at the 20 sampling sites the spatial distribution pattern of the studied parameters was figs 7 and 8 markedly followed the same trend in the study area as proved by their strong interrelation table 2 generally the studied parameters increased in the western part of the study area toward the industrial area however ph has the opposite distribution pattern for the studied parameters this may be attributed to the high concentrations of acidic radicals cl and so4 in the studied water samples in addition hco3 has its unique distribution trend in the study area and this may be referred to as a different factor controlling its distribution differently from the other parameters 3 1 hydrochemical facies the plotting of studied groundwater samples on piper 1944 diagram fig 9 shows that the samples are dominant in section ii na k cl so4 type indicating the prevailing of alkalies na k and stronger acidic anions cl so4 over the alkaline earths ca mg and weaker acidic anions co3 hco3 this class indicated the halite weathering kaur et al 2019 and the infiltration of surface salts with surplus irrigation water the predominance of na in the groundwater samples may be attributed to silicate mineral weathering and ion exchange processes on clay particles herojeet et al 2017 the presence of alkalis cation facies represents the prevalence of human interventions like leaching of industrial effluent and fertilizers from agricultural fields over natural weathering srivastava and ramanathan 2018 only one sample falls in the field i ca mg cl so4 type indicating the prevailing of the alkaline earths ca mg and stronger acidic anions cl so4 over the alkalies na k and weaker acidic anions co3 hco3 3 2 heavy metals the determining of heavy metals concentrations in water is of great importance due to their direct influence on human health animals and living plants the source of these elements is from rocks weathering and human activities agricultural and industrial activities elnazer et al 2018 salman et al 2017 the iron in the study area is not detected while only mn was detected in two samples table 1 this may be related to the geological nature of the water bearing sediments in the study area qena and kom ombo formations that lack ferromagnesian minerals omer 2003 the recorded manganese was close to the river nile course in addition cu and zn were not exceeded 100 and 12 μg l respectively in the studied samples and accordingly these samples have not any risk from these elements for drinking purposes table 3 the main risk for the studied samples emerged from the unacceptable elevated concentrations of as 22 52 μg l and pb 40 347 μg l which surplus the desired limit of 10 μg l for drinking according to who 2011 for both elements exposure to high concentrations of as can lead to nerve function disordered causing hands and feet pins and needles stomach pain vomiting diarrhea and many dermal diseases including dark pocks and skin cancer who 2011 children are more sustainable to the adverse impact of water polluted with as than adults because they drink more water per body weight unit than adults drinking of polluted water with as even though at low concentrations of as for long time can increase the risk of developing variable cancers like kidney lung and bladder who 2011 it was observed that the highest concentrations of as were recorded in the center of the study area fig 10 in samples 10 11 13 14 and 18 the main sources of pb and as contamination may be attributed to agricultural activities fertilizers uses in the recharge areas and the applied coal in the nearby metallurgical industrial area aluminum industry a high dose of pb has been known as a general cumulative metabolic toxicity acute poisoning symptoms include slight abdominal discomfort tiredness lassitude irritability anemia and change of behavior in children selvam 2013 the distribution of pb in the study area is differentiated into three regions two regions with the highest concentrations at east and west of the study area and the third region with the lowest concentrations at the center fig 10 the cadmium concentration ranges from bdl to 6 μg l it is evident that most of the studied wells in the studied area are unpolluted with cadmium ions because their concentration was less than the permissible drinking limit 3 μg l who 2011 except for the samples no 1 2 8 18 19 and 20 which are mainly directed to the center of the studied area fig 10 this may be attributed to agricultural activities fertilizers uses in the recharge areas and over pumping in addition to the industrial activities and waste disposal in the study area biochemically cd replaces zn in the body causing liver and kidney damage high blood pressure and anemia it also destroys red blood cells and testicular tissue generally the groundwater in the study area is unsuitable for human drinking purposes wherein the case of a suitable element table 3 another element is not suitable especially the pollution of water by as and pb 3 3 suitability for agriculture purposes the main purpose of drilling wells in the study area is to reclaim the desert the water used for agriculture should be free of some salts that can adversely affect the osmotic pressure of the soil water and consequentially prevent roots from water absorption the most used water quality guideline for crop productivity is the water salinity hazard as measured by electrical conductivity bauder et al 2007 the electrical conductivity of groundwater samples table 1 ranges from 1010 to 10210 μs cm about 50 of the studied samples 9 samples were permissible for irrigation with ec 2250vμs cm fig 11 the rest of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation purposes in addition based on ec values table 1 the studied water is suitable for planting most types of crops according to todd 2007 classification table 4 another important element that affects the quality of irrigation water is na because it replaces ca and mg absorbed on clay minerals and causes dispersion of soil particles causing deflocculation dispersion and impairment of the tilth and permeability of soils karanth 1994 sodium hazard can be expressed by calculating sar richards 1954 are listed in table 5 most of the samples collected during this study 17 samples belong to the s1 group with sar values 10 fig 11 and can be used safely for all types of soil on the other hand 3 samples are belonging to the s2 group it is clear that all groundwater samples are located within the permissible limits sar 15

quality egypt 1 introduction groundwater is the second most important natural resource of the earth and is widely distributed it supports life on earth uses as drinking water and aids in the agricultural industrial and overall economic growth in opposite to surface water groundwater is mostly less vulnerable to pollution salman 2013 the impurities that replenish the groundwater system are removed while infiltrating through the soil and rocks this natural resource is recharged mainly in a cyclic manner with rainwater it has a constant temperature dependable color taste and odor and generally free from pathogens radiochemical and other poisonous contaminations osman et al 2012 singh 2017 the chemical composition of the groundwater depends upon the mineral composition of the sediments through which the water passes hem 1970 salman et al 2013 2019a it has been shown that the dissolved cations are derived from the solution of minerals in rocks and soil while the anions are mostly derived from non lithological sources the bicarbonate present in water is mainly derived from carbon dioxide that is extracted from the air and liberated in the soil through biochemical activities as far as the concentration of chloride and sulfate ions in the groundwater are concerned it has been found that some rocks also serve as direct sources therefore the different types of rocks have a different impact on the chemical composition of groundwater as it is governed by the mineral composition of the rocks salman et al 2019b water pollution is the most horrible crisis facing humankind today and can be classified as geogenic and anthropogenic pollution kashyap et al 2016 most crises arise from the anthropogenic activities including urban agriculture industrial and speedy natural resource exploitation owing to population explosion islam et al 2014 zeid et al 2018 nyambura et al 2020 water pollutants refer to anything causing a change in water physicochemical and biological characteristics and can be divided into biologic e g bacteria organic e g ddt and inorganic e g nox and heavy metals behera 2015 the most recorded water pollutants are heavy metals and have been linked to many health problems worldwide hasan et al 2016 melegy et al 2014 salman et al 2019a polluted water with heavy metals can cause various cancers paul 2017 salman et al 2019a renal failure melegy et al 2014 paul 2017 parkinson s disease alzheimer s and muscular dystrophy verma and dwivedi 2013 salman 2013 pointed out the role of surplus infiltration of irrigation water and land application of domestic wastewater disposal through hand dug wells in the pollution of groundwater water should be of certain physical and chemical characteristics to be used safely for irrigation saline water can adversely affect plant growth and yield dpird 2019 in addition heavy metals can change physiological and biochemical activities within the plant and hence reduce their growth and yield chibuike and obiora 2014 in egypt urban expansion owing to overpopulation and narrow river nile floodplain led to the expansion in the desert fringes reclamation and consequentially groundwater exploration and abstraction groundwater represents the second resource of freshwater for different purposes after the river nile the study area is lying south al waqf city qena governorate egypt between latitudes of 25 57 n to of 26 06 n and longitudes of 32 21 e to 32 33 e fig 1 this area includes many new reclaimed farmlands which depends mainly on groundwater for irrigation these farms produce manly seasonal crops such as vegetables wheat egyptian clover and corn therefore this work was conducted to evaluate groundwater hydrochemistry and suitability for different purposes in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydrogeological settings the study area is of arid climate with temperature varies between 27 c 47 c and 7 c 28 c in summer and winter respectively rainfall rarely occurs the average annual rainfall does not exceed 4 mm year abdallatief et al 2012 many authors studied geology of qena e g ahmed 1983 askalany 1988 el belasy 1994 issawi and mccauley 1992 mansour and kamal el dein 2001 omer 1996 said 1962 1981 and 1990 qena area fig 2 covered by sediments and sedimentary rocks ranging in age from lower eocene to recent the pliocene consists of a long series of interbedded red brown clay madamud formation which acts as an aquiclude for the overlying quaternary aquifer the pleistocene and recent subdivided into different formations these are fluviatile and alluvial deposits covering most of the study area in the form of gravel coarse sand and loamy materials the water bearing unit is composed of pleistocene sediments gravely sand saturated sediments intercalated with clay layers the aquifer thickness is not uniform due to the effect of the fault structure system of the nile elsheikh et al 2015 the aquifer thickness is increased to the north and northwest direction from 60 to 120 m in some locations clay lenses were detected in different depths so the aquifer is found under the unconfined to semi confined conditions the depth to the water table is gradually increased from 2 m in the north next to the river nile to about 72 m in the southern area the aquifer is recharged mainly by seepage from the irrigation system and excess irrigation water groundwater general flows from south to north but the intensive pumping in the center reclamation area formed a big depression cone accompanied by many local groundwater flow directions elsheikh et al 2015 2 2 sampling and analyses twenty groundwater samples were collected in 1 l polypropylene bottles from the boreholes within the study area to ascertain the quality of the quaternary aquifer

10 4 1 3 results and discussion the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the study area including temperature t total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec acidity ph and major minor and trace ionic concentrations are illustrated in table 1 the temperature recorded is due to its vital role in the biological physical and chemical activities in the water the gases o2 co2 n2 and ch4 solubility in water is decreased with increasing temperature yilmaz and koc 2014 the recorded temperature 25 7 c is acceptable for different water usage and is consistent with the ambient air temperature it is mostly negatively correlated low significance with the studied parameters table 2 indicating their low role in the solubility of these ions the groundwater ph was slightly alkaline varied from 7 06 to 7 88 and this is preferred for water quality because of water alkalinity heavy metals can be precipitated from the water with carbonate or bicarbonate ahipathy and puttaiah 2006 in the studied area the ph value is mainly controlled by the strong acid ions so4 and cl as supported by the negative correlation table 2 between ph and both so4 r 0 71 and cl r 0 59 oyem et al 2014 also recorded a negative correlation between ph and water salts the very wide range of tds from 455 to 4595 mg l and ec from 1010 to 10210 μs cm suggests that many intermixed processes including the natural water sediment interaction and the anthropogenic activities infiltration of surplus irrigation water loaded with washed salts and leaching of salts from the nearby metallurgical industrial area aluminum industry control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area moreover this is supported by the wide difference between q3 and q1 table 1 and the positive correlation with the studied major cations natural as well as with cd as and pb anthropogenic table 2 besides the aridity of the study area and hence the high evaporation rate can cause the enrichment of tds and ec ismail et al 2020 the estimated ca and mg of the analyzed groundwater samples display a great variation implies that their behavior is controlled by water sediment interaction the positive correlation of ca and mg with the tds chloride sulfate sodium and potassium indicates the leaching of ca and mg from the reworked pliocene clays and other silicate minerals that incorporated in the pleistocene sediments besides the dissolution of sulfate minerals from these sediments is another important source of calcium on the other hand the negative correlation of bicarbonate with ca and mg suggests that the dissolution of the carbonate materials in these sediments has an insignificant influence on their behavior the concentration of sodium displays a very large range of fluctuating from 106 to 943 mg l table 1 the dissolution of na bearing minerals particularly sodium chloride from the pliocene marine sediments through the water sediment interaction is an essential source of sodium in groundwater of this aquifer el rawy et al 2019 salman and elnazer 2015 this is confirmed by the very strong positive correlation between na and cl r 0 99 therefore the same natural processes control the behavior of sodium and anthropogenic activities that affect salinity the potassium concentration in the groundwater samples analyzed varies from 8 to 46 mg l this reflects the effect of using potassium fertilizers on the reclaimed land as indicated by the positive correlation table 2 between k and so4 r 0 69 leaching of k from the fine argillaceous sediments may be another factor elevating the potassium content as indicated from the positive correlation between potassium and tds r 0 77 na r 0 8 ca r 0 67 and mg r 0 61 chloride contents of the analyzed groundwater samples display a very wide variation with a mean value of 530 mg l the stated vast range in the chloride values from 98 to 1350 mg l suggested that numerous intermixed processes control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer the strong positive correlation between chloride and both sodium r 0 97 and tds r 0 98 indicates that chloride is affected by the same natural processes and the anthropogenic activities mentioned there in addition this strong correlation indicated that evaporate dissolution like halite and gypsum increasing groundwater salinization chen et al 2014 the distribution pattern of chloride that is nearly identical to that of sodium and tds confirms the mentioned conclusion sulfates display a great variation in concentration ranging from 53 to 1218 mg l table 1 implying that several intermixed processes including the water sediment interaction and the anthropogenic activities control the hydrochemistry of groundwater in the study area sulfates have a strong positive correlation with tds r 0 98 chloride r 0 93 and sodium r 0 96 reflecting the similarity of their behavior this means that sulfates are the main component of the dissolved salts in the more saline groundwater the measured bicarbonate of the groundwater samples analyzed varies from 51 to 194 mg l consequently the low bicarbonate hco3 content in these samples although the abundant calcareous materials grains and cement in the contained sediments omer 1996 is due to the low co2 content in groundwater of the studied area the use of drip irrigation instead of flood irrigation considered the main cause of the low co2 content in the aquifer that reduces the dissolution of caco3 and confirms the low vulnerability of this aquifer the variation in water chemistry in the study area can be attributed naturally to the geologic settings the study area contains many faults and clay lenses that can control water movement and chemistry abu el ella 1993 omer 1996 the chemistry of water is affected also by the aquifer hydraulic parameters salman et al 2019b in the study area the hydraulic characteristics vary from one place to another due to lateral and vertical lithofacies changes where transmissivity is varying from 155 to 420 m2 day storativity from 0 00021 to 0 0064 hydraulic conductivity from 1 3 to 5 2 m day elsheikh et al 2015 the increase of transmissivity in the central part of the study area may attribute to fracture lateral facies and thickness changes of the aquifer caused by faulting of the aquifer layer depths to water table vary from site to site 10 70 m with the variation in the topographic elevations fig 3 the variable pumping rates aquifer lithofacies and structural setting led to divergent groundwater flow paths the main trend of groundwater flow is from north to south fig 4 suggesting the recharge from the river nile the heavy pumping in the center part of the study area led to the appearance of groundwater down cone accompanied by many local groundwater flow directions fig 4 the change in the study area hydrogeological parameters e g hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity gives a great variation in the vulnerability of the aquifer fig 4 from very low to very high vulnerable areas elsheikh et al 2015 the end member plot was applied to understand the water sediment interaction influence on the groundwater chemistry gaillardet et al 1999 in the diagram fig 5 two geochemical processes silicate weathering and evaporates dissolution control groundwater chemistry in the study area another important factor affecting groundwater chemistry is the evaporation process as a result of the aridity in the study area the evaporation impact can be dedicated to the stabilization of the na cl molar ratio with increasing ec kumar et al 2006 ismail et al 2020 and the low correlation r 0 14 supports the evaporation role fig 6 spatial distribution maps of the water physicochemical properties were prepared by interpolating the measurements at the 20 sampling sites the spatial distribution pattern of the studied parameters was figs 7 and 8 markedly followed the same trend in the study area as proved by their strong interrelation table 2 generally the studied parameters increased in the western part of the study area toward the industrial area however ph has the opposite distribution pattern for the studied parameters this may be attributed to the high concentrations of acidic radicals cl and so4 in the studied water samples in addition hco3 has its unique distribution trend in the study area and this may be referred to as a different factor controlling its distribution differently from the other parameters 3 1 hydrochemical facies the plotting of studied groundwater samples on piper 1944 diagram fig 9 shows that the samples are dominant in section ii na k cl so4 type indicating the prevailing of alkalies na k and stronger acidic anions cl so4 over the alkaline earths ca mg and weaker acidic anions co3 hco3 this class indicated the halite weathering kaur et al 2019 and the infiltration of surface salts with surplus irrigation water the predominance of na in the groundwater samples may be attributed to silicate mineral weathering and ion exchange processes on clay particles herojeet et al 2017 the presence of alkalis cation facies represents the prevalence of human interventions like leaching of industrial effluent and fertilizers from agricultural fields over natural weathering srivastava and ramanathan 2018 only one sample falls in the field i ca mg cl so4 type indicating the prevailing of the alkaline earths ca mg and stronger acidic anions cl so4 over the alkalies na k and weaker acidic anions co3 hco3 3 2 heavy metals the determining of heavy metals concentrations in water is of great importance due to their direct influence on human health animals and living plants the source of these elements is from rocks weathering and human activities agricultural and industrial activities elnazer et al 2018 salman et al 2017 the iron in the study area is not detected while only mn was detected in two samples table 1 this may be related to the geological nature of the water bearing sediments in the study area qena and kom ombo formations that lack ferromagnesian minerals omer 2003 the recorded manganese was close to the river nile course in addition cu and zn were not exceeded 100 and 12 μg l respectively in the studied samples and accordingly these samples have not any risk from these elements for drinking purposes table 3 the main risk for the studied samples emerged from the unacceptable elevated concentrations of as 22 52 μg l and pb 40 347 μg l which surplus the desired limit of 10 μg l for drinking according to who 2011 for both elements exposure to high concentrations of as can lead to nerve function disordered causing hands and feet pins and needles stomach pain vomiting diarrhea and many dermal diseases including dark pocks and skin cancer who 2011 children are more sustainable to the adverse impact of water polluted with as than adults because they drink more water per body weight unit than adults drinking of polluted water with as even though at low concentrations of as for long time can increase the risk of developing variable cancers like kidney lung and bladder who 2011 it was observed that the highest concentrations of as were recorded in the center of the study area fig 10 in samples 10 11 13 14 and 18 the main sources of pb and as contamination may be attributed to agricultural activities fertilizers uses in the recharge areas and the applied coal in the nearby metallurgical industrial area aluminum industry a high dose of pb has been known as a general cumulative metabolic toxicity acute poisoning symptoms include slight abdominal discomfort tiredness lassitude irritability anemia and change of behavior in children selvam 2013 the distribution of pb in the study area is differentiated into three regions two regions with the highest concentrations at east and west of the study area and the third region with the lowest concentrations at the center fig 10 the cadmium concentration ranges from bdl to 6 μg l it is evident that most of the studied wells in the studied area are unpolluted with cadmium ions because their concentration was less than the permissible drinking limit 3 μg l who 2011 except for the samples no 1 2 8 18 19 and 20 which are mainly directed to the center of the studied area fig 10 this may be attributed to agricultural activities fertilizers uses in the recharge areas and over pumping in addition to the industrial activities and waste disposal in the study area biochemically cd replaces zn in the body causing liver and kidney damage high blood pressure and anemia it also destroys red blood cells and testicular tissue generally the groundwater in the study area is unsuitable for human drinking purposes wherein the case of a suitable element table 3 another element is not suitable especially the pollution of water by as and pb 3 3 suitability for agriculture purposes the main purpose of drilling wells in the study area is to reclaim the desert the water used for agriculture should be free of some salts that can adversely affect the osmotic pressure of the soil water and consequentially prevent roots from water absorption the most used water quality guideline for crop productivity is the water salinity hazard as measured by electrical conductivity bauder et al 2007 the electrical conductivity of groundwater samples table 1 ranges from 1010 to 10210 μs cm about 50 of the studied samples 9 samples were permissible for irrigation with ec 2250vμs cm fig 11 the rest of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation purposes in addition based on ec values table 1 the studied water is suitable for planting most types of crops according to todd 2007 classification table 4 another important element that affects the quality of irrigation water is na because it replaces ca and mg absorbed on clay minerals and causes dispersion of soil particles causing deflocculation dispersion and impairment of the tilth and permeability of soils karanth 1994 sodium hazard can be expressed by calculating sar richards 1954 are listed in table 5 most of the samples collected during this study 17 samples belong to the s1 group with sar values 10 fig 11 and can be used safely for all types of soil on the other hand 3 samples are belonging to the s2 group it is clear that all groundwater samples are located within the permissible limits sar 15

11972,gaya a prominent city of bihar india with rich cultural and religious significance has been susceptible to massive urbanization population growth and pollution which have huge impact on its surface water bodies the study was conducted on five major ponds of gaya namely bisar dighi vaitarni ramsagar and suryakund this paper attempts to evaluate their drinking and irrigational water quality status trace metal contamination in water and sediments except suryakund hydrogeochemical characterization and evolutionary trends and processes involved in the water chemistry the wqi values 130 revealed that the ponds are facing heavy pollution load and the water is not fit for drinking purposes however irrigational indices indicates that the water of these ponds is suitable for irrigational purposes the ponds water and sediments are heavily contaminated with trace metals particularly cobalt cf and pi 17 and lead cf 1 4 and pi 5 in sediments the pca and hca were also performed to find the relevant sources trends and groups in trace metal contamination in their water the hydrogeochemical profile of surface water piper s plot durov s diagram gibbs diagram and ibe indicated that they are of mixed water type with most abundant facies being na ca mg cl ca na mg cl and ca na mg cl hco3 si values showed ponds to be oversaturated with ca mg based minerals and dissolution of halite magnesite and anhydrite indicating high degree of rock water interaction and reverse cation exchange process dominating the water chemistry however extensive mixing of pollutants and dissolution has caused the overall geochemical character of water to change the overall study shows that urbanization may further increase the rate of anthropogenic activities overtime which could enhance trace metal accumulation in the ponds and pose a serious health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry surface water multivariate analysis urbanization water quality index trace metal 1 introduction india is endowed with various types of lentic ecosystems like ponds lakes tanks and reservoirs wetzel 2001 these ecosystems are mostly studied by ecologists for their importance as a source of drinking water and the development of fisheries and irrigation beckerman 2014 apart from these there are many tangible and non tangible services rendered by such ecosystems in the past few decades rising population and increased dependency on ponds and lakes for potable water has disturbed the ecological health of water bodies kumar et al 2019 unplanned growth of cities and industrialization has further put a break on survival capacity of lentic ecosystems like ponds incessant urbanization of cities particularly already dense northern region of india has led to a widespread loss and extinction of surface water bodies construction activities filling of pond beds and pollution channelled through population explosion have rendered the surface water bodies as the most vulnerable ecosystems laloo and ranjan 2017 encroachments of green belts for setting up of factories and buildings have also led to fragmentation of habitats leading to variable climatic conditions and disturbed ecological character koduru and dutta 2013 according to the world commission report on environment and sustainability by 2020 if these activities are not urgently checked it may pose a humongous problem of water scarcity and pollution in future brundtland 1987 surface water bodies apart from being a source of water they also recharge the groundwater national environmental engineering research institute neeri is of the view that 70 of india s freshwater is polluted govindasamy and viji 2012 however numerous attempts are being made to restore the ecological health of these water bodies the first step towards achieving that is the identification of the level of pollution through water quality monitoring and assessment bhat and pandit 2014 the present study focuses on five ponds of gaya city of bihar which is going through a tremendous pressure to meet the demands of rising population and also faces dry spells which render them waterless in summer months the gaya city is also in the grip of the water crisis as the water level in the town block has shrunk by several inches within a month in 2017 ians 2019 most of the ponds have dried up at present the number of ponds has come down to ten out of which six falls in the shrine areas alone ojha 2018 the problem is more intense where addition of domestic wastes generated from different households and sewage outlet entering the ponds contaminate the water bodies additional source of contamination is the waste generated from the religious rituals and idol immersions performed during festivals apart from few studies on accounting of ecological species of the suryakund pond hardly any literature is available on the hydrochemical status of the surface water bodies of the gaya region nag et al 2014 to ascertain the level of ecological damage ponds have undergone and subsequently to define the application limits of the ponds it is imperative to outline the hydrogeochemical status of these ponds of gaya region the assessment of trace metals in water as well as sediments can indicate a lot about the impacts of anthropogenic and industrial load on the water bodies and thus might help in mitigating the risks posed to it saleem et al 2015 therefore the objectives undertaken in the present study include a ascertaining physico chemical properties of bisar dighi suryakund ramsagar and vaitarni ponds and estimate water quality index for water pollution load b quantifying the trace metal load in the pond waters and sediments c ascertaining the suitability of pond waters for irrigational purpose by applying relevant indices d estimating the distribution of various hydrochemical species and identifying the major processes involved in the water chemistry 2 study area five ponds were selected for the study namely bisar dighi ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni fig 1 all ponds are situated in the heart of gaya city bihar india latitude 24 17 n to 25 04 n and longitude 84 18 e to 85 24 e the gaya city is religiously significant especially for hindus and bodh gaya for buddhists thus a high percentage of water from ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni ponds are used for performing sacred rituals like pind daan though rainwater is the primary source of water in these ponds local sewer lines were found to be a source of influent wastewater as per site investigation these ponds are used by local people for domestic purposes and fishing table 1 2 1 religious and cultural significance gaya is a prominent city of bihar with religious and cultural significance for hindus jains and buddhists it is believed to be the place where lord rama paid his last tributes to his father dasharatha after his demise by offering pind daan in gaya for buddhists this place holds special respect as a place of enlightenment as lord buddha earned enlightenment in bodh gaya mahabodhi temple the famous mahabodhi temple is also a world heritage site as declared by unesco whc 2002 this city is also important from the perspective of tourism and culture as it is marked by the presence of many magnificent temples and shrines namely vishnupad temple yama temple dungeshwari cave temple and mangla gauri temple mostly water bodies and ponds are adjacent to these pilgrimage sites where devotees take bath and holy dips marking purity of soul and for washing away of sins geary 2009 has highlighted the significance of religious and cultural tourism in bodhgaya which has played a significant role in boosting the economy and urban planning in gaya district additionally gaya tourism has upgraded the socio economic conditions of local people due to a large number of pilgrims coming from eastern and north western world srivastava 2010 according to the official website of bihar state tourism development about 56 lakh persons visited gaya city and bodhgaya in gaya district in 2019 out of this over 6 lakh visitors were foreigners and the remaining accounted for the domestic crowd alone the pitri paksha event including vishnu puja and pind daan saw the incoming of over 9 lakhs tourists in the month of september 2019 of which foreigners accounted for 20 000 monthly segregation of data indicated the highest tourist footfall in the months from december to february reaching peak in january this may be due to the onset of kalachakra puja during the month of january bhonsale 2019 the summer months particularly june received the lowest number of visitors 2 2 demography and economy gaya district comprises a large chunk of southern region of bihar state it is fifth most populous district of bihar with specifically high population density towards gaya city from the 2011 census data it is reported that the total population stands at 4 391 418 with 51 76 males and 48 24 females out of the total area of 4976 sq km gaya municipal corporation is distributed in the area of 50 17 sq km dpg 2017 the overall population density is 880 persons per sq km 86 of the population are found to be living in rural areas whereas 14 are limited to urban areas as far as industrial contribution to economy is concerned there is no major industrial configuration present in gaya the economy is primarily dependant on agricultural activities it houses many household and cottage industries including tilkut agarbatti perfume snacks power loom paints etc also significant are some stone and artefacts factories wooden furniture warehouses food processing units oil mills and some sugar mills cdp 2011 gaya provides a major transportation aid by connecting various cities and metros via road rail and airways 2 3 topography and geology the gaya district is a land area comprising of two units gangetic plains in the north and a demarcation in the southern part by a highland area spurting from chhota nagpur plateau substantial area is characterized by deep deposits of alluvial soil however many parts are randomly characterized by hilly and rocky regions with isolated peaks at some spots the gaya city the main study area lies along the ganges river and marks the periphery of gangetic plains with chhotanagpur plateau pletcher 2014 the area is also marked by three groups of rocky hills the gaya city is influenced by the topography of brahmayoni hill and murli and ramsila hills in the northern part katari hill and plateau towards the west and northern west the city is lined by pretsila hills such topography causes the depressions formed in the urban city to be waterlogged during the monsoon periods often the periphery of gaya city near vishnupad and brahmayoni hill has a natural slope which drains the water over a large stretch of lowland area forming small channels before merging into river falgu cdp 2011 as for geology gaya district which belongs to quaternary age has mostly unconsolidated sediments of alluvial and consolidated sediments of satpura range the supra crystals of satpura range are of low grade and exposed in the hills of gaya city and include ferruginous phyllites quartzite and slate few patches belonging to archaeon ages have some of the old rock formations existing predominantly the rock type found is gneiss granites and amphiboles the alluvium near rivers and streams has gradual deposits of medium to fine textured sands gaya is rich in mineral resources like mica sandstone quartzite and sand dsr 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis water samples were collected from eight different directions e ne n nw w sw s se from each pond in polypropylene bottles samples were brought to the laboratory in an icebox and stored at 4 c for further analysis the field parameters like ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were analyzed on site itself with portable digital meters eutech other parameters like dissolved oxygen do total alkalinity total hardness biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and chlorides were analyzed according to the standard procedures apha 2012 turbidity was measured by digital turbidity meter systronics nephlometer sodium and potassium were measured on flame photometer systronics anions like nitrate sulphate and phosphate were estimated with the help of spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 25 3 2 trace metals in water trace metals were analyzed by directly aspiring preserved water sample to thermo scientific atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3000 3 3 digestion of sediment sample and trace metal analysis trace metal analysis in sediments was carried out for all ponds except suryakund pond 0 5 gm of sediment was digested with aqua regia and hydrogen peroxide subsequently and later filtered with 0 45 μm whatman filter paper and diluted to 100 ml behera et al 2013 samples were analyzed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo scientific ice3000 3 4 quality control and assurance measures the accuracy and precision of sample collection and handling of water and sediments were based on the international standards of usgs 2018 and usepa 1999 respectively most of the water analyses was undertaken by following certified protocols suggested by iso or and apha 2012 all results were analyzed and kept within the suggested standard confidence limit of 95 all experimental glassware and containers were pre cleaned with lab grade soap pre soaked in 4 hno3 followed by rinsing with deionised water for trace metals analysis sediment samples were processed and digested according to the international standards usepa 1996 varol 2011 quality control was established by including reagent blank run analysis of replicates using standard calibration measures by accurate dilution of the 1000 ppm stock solution for parameters merck 1113550100 icp multi element standard solution iv 3 5 statistical analysis general descriptive statistics coefficient correlation and statistical diagrams were analyzed using microsoft excel ms office 2007 all statistical analyses were carried out at 95 confidence level multivariate analytical tool of minitab 17 software was used for understanding complex data analysis factor analysis was undertaken using a varimax rotation module factor analysis has been frequently used in environmental assessment tanvir rahman et al 2017 in hydrogeochemistry where many variables interplay to govern the water chemistry it is important to come up with a deductive approach to simplify the analysis the basic idea behind applying factor analysis is to reduce the number of variables and identify the underlying factors governing the hydrogeochemistry of water bodies other multivariate analyses namely principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were employed to study the significance of various trace metals in ponds water pca is one of the most important dimensional data reduction techniques which provide considerable insights regarding an important set of variables without loss of much information it also assesses hidden relationships among random variables and groups by acknowledging correlated variables eigen values can be used to ascertain the acceptable amount of variances kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 kowalska et al 2018 hierarchical cluster analysis is useful in identifying the trends and groups of similar observations and variables which it classifies based on clusters and sub clusters shirani et al 2020 it also helps in identifying sources and evolutionary history of variables which might have similar character and significance cluster analysis was applied on euclidean distances and similarity coefficients for classifying data ward linkage method minimum variance was used for cluster analysis lima et al 2019 3 6 drinking and irrigational water quality indices water quality index was calculated to address its potability and level of pollution existing in the ponds of gaya chatterjee 1992 supplementary table 1 for the calculation of wqi the standards of drinking water quality recommended by world health organization who 1997 bureau of indian standards bis 2012 and icmr indian council of medical research were used supplementary table 2 weighted arithmetic index was used for estimating wqi brown et al 1972 apart from this sub index qn was also measured using the following formula q n 100 v n v i o s n v i o where qn quality rating for the nth water parameter vn estimated value of the nth parameter at a given sampling site vio ideal value of nth parameter in pure water sn standard permissible value of the nth parameter unit weight was calculated based on value inversely proportional to the recommended standard value sn of the corresponding parameter wn k sn w n unit weight for the nth parameter k proportionality constant the final wqi was formulated in this way wqi qnwn wn suitability of water for irrigational purposes was assessed based on many hydrogeochemical indices table 2 3 7 source and mechanism of rock water interaction 1 gibbs ratio and plot gibbs 1970 proposed a boomerang diagram to depict the interaction theme between ionic components of water as a function of tds and the underlying rock structure the hydrological processes that can govern the dynamics of water chemistry like precipitation and evaporation are also taken into account gibbs ratio i cl cl hco3 gibbs ratio ii na k na k ca 2 indices base exchange ibe the ionic balance irregularity caused by the effect of environmental and geomorphological factors on water body cannot be controlled but it can be tracked down by assessing the ionic exchange process during mobility or resting phase of water bodies johnson 1979 sastri 1994 this can be done by the use of chlor alkaline indices suggested by schoeller 1977 the values are computed on the principle that na and k are exchanged with ca and mg and vice versa 3 saturation indices si waterbody interacts with underlying mineralogical structures and rock body and maintain reaction equilibrium this equilibrium state can be assessed by computing the saturation index of different mineral species garrels and mackenzie 1971 singh et al 2008 the dissolubility of various cationic and anionic species can reveal a lot about the type of parent rock and other sources if present saturation index si is the ratio of the calculated log value of ion activity product iap and mineral equilibrium constant and was performed using phreeqc mode in aquachem software 3 8 assessment of trace metal pollution in sediment pollution indices were used for assessing the intensity of trace metals contamination in the sediments of gaya ponds contamination factor was used as a single pollution index malsiu et al 2020 it enables in identifying metal pollution load by considering the gap between pre industrial reference and current value it is thus the ratio of various metal concentrations in sediment and the background pre industrial level håkanson 1980 gong et al 2008 pandey et al 2019 cf classes were defined as cf 1 low 1 cf 3 moderate 3 cf 6 considerable cf 6 very high c f metal content in sediment background level of the metal complex pollution index namely pollution load index pli was used pli provides simple comparative values which enable us to understand the overall trace metal pollution status of a component of an area varol 2011 it is defined as the square root of multiplication of the pollution index pi of metals pi identifies the metals which poses the greatest risk to the soil environment kowalska et al 2018 p i c n g b where cn is the concentration of the metal in sample and gb is the geochemical background in this case background value of average crustal abundance value ucc was used for calculation rudnick and gao 2003 islam et al 2015 alahabadi and malvandi 2018 pi classes were interpreted as pi 1 absent 1 pi 2 low 2 pi 3 moderate 3 pi 5 strong pi 5 very strong varol 2011 pollution load index is calculated as p l i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 p i n 1 n where n the number of analyzed elements and pi is the single pollution index 4 result and discussions 4 1 water quality parameters the ponds were studied based on important water quality parameters and hydrogeochemical facies present in the water bodies the general descriptive statistics like the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of water quality parameters were calculated table 3 4 1 1 ph ec and temperature moderately high ph was witnessed in all major ponds of gaya 8 1 8 7 moderate ph is essential for the survival of life forms in pond water moderately high ph could have been associated with high evapoconcentration high co2 demand by growing plants and in turn slow diffusion of co2 from the atmosphere mosley and reid 2015 high carbonate content can lead to buffering of ph of pond water and moderation of dissolved minerals almendinger and leete 1998 water also reacts with carbonates and organic carbon in the presence of co2 and buffers the increase in ph thus moderating the overall ph high values for ec was found in all ponds associated with very high variability highest value was for bisar pond 1192 50 μs cm and the lowest for ramsagar pond 537 50 μs cm high range of ph and ec reflects the high level of interaction with soil and mineral substances and high rates of evaporation gerla 2013 high fluctuations in the ec concentration are mostly due to the variability in the total dissolved solids and salinity mosley and reid 2015 as well as anthropogenic interventions which lead to disruption in natural biogeochemical processes including altered ph and ec the temperature of the pond ecosystem plays a major role in defining the biotic structure of the water body rajagopal et al 2010 as observed by welch 1952 shallow pond water s temperature is approximately the same as the surrounding air temperature this study is in line with measured temperature during analysis on site during the monsoon or post monsoon period the temperature of the pond goes down as the warmer water is replaced by cooler incoming waters from upstreams van buren et al 2000 since the sampling was done during november december period the temperature of ponds ranged between 16 and 17 c table 3 4 1 2 do bod and cod dissolved oxygen do is not only an indicator of water quality but also determines the metabolism of all life forms present in the water body do depends on certain factors like the rate of photosynthesis the saturation point of gas in water and temperature at lower temperature do tends to increase and vice versa ganai et al 2014 in this study do ranges between 3 12 mg l dighi pond to 8 16 mg l vaitarni pond biological oxygen demand bod is a tool for measuring the biochemically oxidizable carbonaceous load in the water body gupta et al 2003 high bod results from the high rate of decomposition of organic matter at the higher temperature excess turbidity and stagnant water conditions azumi and bichi 2010 the present study reveals moderately high bod in gaya ponds which ranged between 9 94 mg l suryakund to 19 7 mg l bisar another tool for assessing the organic load in a water body is chemical oxygen demand cod which is always higher than the bod value as it entails complete oxidizable organic load in water body all the ponds have high degree of cod present ranging between 29 24 mg l ramsagar to 72 5 mg l bisar directional variations were seen in the ponds with sd reaching 30 for dighi and vaitarni ponds table 3 both bod and cod reveal that a lot of domestic effluents sewage and other organic debris are entering the ponds sanap et al 2006 iloms et al 2020 4 1 3 total alkalinity total hardness and turbidity alkalinity values in ponds of gaya ranged between 86 mg l vaitarni and 52 5 mg l ramsagar table 3 carbonates in water have the ability to resist any change in the ph when acid is added in water mahananda et al 2010 high alkalinity in ponds is witnessed when carbonates in sediments dissolves and co2 rich water interacts releasing bicarbonates high variability in alkalinity values were seen in the ponds of gaya similar to observations made by jhingram 1991 in tropical ponds another factor which affects alkalinity is the geology of the rocks and substrates lying below lagler 1978 the values of total hardness ranged between 130 62 mg l to 330 62 mg l table 3 hardness is associated with the occurrence of alkaline earth metals like calcium and magnesium also an increase in the hardness can be attributed to evapoconcentration presence of domestic effluents like detergents chlorides sulphates and nitrates etc rajagopal et al 2010 eruola et al 2011 hardness in water has been observed in ponds near temples where people come to have holy baths angadi et al 2005 high turbidity is an objectionable sight in water bodies however the ponds of gaya had turbidity at a threshold level of 5 approximately with the maximum value being 5 9 and the minimum being 1 88 turbidity is the suspended solids in the form of mud silt clay or may also result from inorganic particulates phytoplankton and microscopic organisms welch 1952 it is a variable parameter which changes according to seasons the demography of the pond basin rate of sedimentation etc lakshmanan 1967 4 2 general hydrogeochemistry of ions and its characterization 4 2 1 water chemistry of cations the major ion chemistry is first analyzed through descriptive statistics to account for their general abundance and mapping distribution in water bodies table 4 the bisar pond is found to have sodium na in the range of 98 4 105 6 mg l sodium is a natural constituent of surface waters and is the most abundant cation in freshwater la baugh 1986 sodium results from weathering of rocks domestic wastewater precipitation runoff etc mishra et al 2014 calcium ca was in the range of 54 1 92 1 mg l ca is an important nutrient for all organisms and high concentrations of it does not cause any adverse effect on organisms apart from causing hardness in water system lehr et al 1980 magnesium with the minimum value of 21 64 mg l and the maximum at 53 1 mg l is the third most abundant cation their possible sources might be from rock water interaction and dissolution of magnesium and calcium rich mineral phases and possible anthropogenic factors like domestic sewage potasznik and szymczyk 2015 potassium was least abundant with a range of 21 27 23 54 mg l it being the third most important micronutrient for plants it plays a major role in plant productivity most of the potassium comes from geologic origin but it also results from dead plants animals excreta and then eventually gets absorbed by plant roots thitame and pondhe 2010 the mean concentrations of na ca mg and k were 101 8 2 59 74 1 16 34 25 14 75 and 22 3 0 684 mg l respectively the maximum permissible limit of these cations in irrigational water should be 200 80 35 and 30 mg l for na ca mg and k respectively duncan and carrow 2000 the cationic abundance trend followed in bisar pond was na ca mg k dighi pond followed a cationic abundance trend of na ca k mg with mean concentrations at 91 3 4 60 2 6 4 20 14 4 94 and 31 6 2 69 mg l for na ca mg and k respectively ramsagar pond s overall cationic abundance seemed to be on the lighter side with the trend being ca na k mg the mean and standard deviation for na ca mg and k were 40 8 1 14 47 3 9 45 8 9 4 18 and 28 8 mg l 0 83 respectively suryakund and vaitarni pond followed similar cationic abundance trend as na ca k mg the percentage abundance of cations for each pond has been compared through stacked bar diagrams fig 2 a it is clear from the stacked bar diagrams that all pond waters are marked by heavy percentage distribution of na 40 and ca 34 potassium follows next with about 16 abundance but high variability exists among different water bodies magnesium is found generally in least concentration at almost all sites 11 4 2 2 water chemistry of anions anions also play a major role in hydrogeochemistry as together with cations they form salts and define the water types existing in the water bodies the major anions studied are cl hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 no3 and po4 3 table 4 the maximum permissible limit of hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 in irrigation water is 250 15 250 and 180 mg l respectively duncan and carrow 2000 bisar pond has chlorides in major concentration with mean as 136 7 2 67 mg l chlorides are naturally present in surface waters however high concentration denotes the presence of high organic waste from domestic sources thresh et al 1944 eutrophic systems are found to have a higher concentration of chlorides subbamma and ramasarma 1992 bicarbonates are the next most abundant species with a mean concentration of 61 5 5 83 mg l carbonates are found in this pond with a mean concentration of 11 75 mg l 4 83 carbonates in water can resist any change in the ph when acid is added in water as discussed in the alkalinity section before mahananda et al 2010 sulphates stand with a mean concentration of 28 1 0 81 mg l sulphates act as oxidizing agents and act as electron acceptors for microorganisms sulphate is generally seen to be sourced from industrial and domestic sewage water jhingram 1991 suryakund being prominent holy bathing site explains the highest concentration of sulphates in it although it is not heavily loaded by other pollutants the anionic abundance trend follows as cl hco3 so4 co3 similar anionic abundance trend was followed by dighi pond as cl hco3 so4 co3 ramsagar pond showed the highest mean concentration for bicarbonate with 45 15 27 mg l chloride was the second most abundant anion with a mean value of 43 0 58 mg l then followed sulphate and carbonate with mean values of 6 01 0 59 and 7 5 5 53 mg l respectively suryakund reported anionic abundance trend as cl hco3 so4 co3 vaitarni reported anionic abundance trend as hco3 cl so4 co3 it is evident from the stacked diagram fig 2b that percentage distribution of chlorides 49 overtakes other anionic species in four ponds except dighi pond bicarbonates 36 also dominate highly and seem to have a clear niche in forming hydrochemical facies sulphates 11 and carbonates 2 lag far behind and seem to not participate in regulating water chemistry of ponds water of gaya town nitrate concentration ranged between 4 30 mg l ramsagar to 5 33 mg l bisar which was well below the permissible limit given by bis however in large concentrations nitrates can cause serious health hazards to livestock and humans nitrate finds its way into natural waters through many sources like livestock waste agricultural waste waste water treatment systems septic tanks anthropogenic sources of sewage fertilizers and industrial wastes adeyeye and abulude 2004 manahan 1994 similarly phosphates too arise from anthropogenic sources like soaps detergents that causes increased productivity in pond systems phosphate concentration was seen to be slightly greater than the normal values in natural waters 0 29 1 13 mg l moreover post monsoon values are generally higher owing to the accumulation of phosphorus from surrounding run offs particularly domestic effluent and mineralization of solid waste and organic matter saha et al 1971 anshumali ramanathan 2007 4 2 3 trace metals in water trace metals concentration in all ponds were found to be high above the permissible limit who 2017 bis 2012 table 5 all ponds were heavily contaminated with co permissible value 0 05 mg l mn permissible value 0 5 mg l and pb permissible value 0 01 mg l except zinc permissible value 3 mg l the decreasing trend of trace metals in water for bisar dighi and ramsagar was co mn cr pb zn and for suryakund and vaitarni it was co cr mn pb zn these high concentrations might have resulted from increased influx of sewage inorganic and organic wastes derived from adjoining area particularly in monsoon al wesabi et al 2015 however metals might also have leached from the geologic settings underneath or from seasonal effect of weathering heath 1987 also a clear impact of urbanization can be seen and anthropogenic effect on water bodies is indicated onsite observations revealed that the water bodies are located in the heart of gaya city amid factories and are linked to residential and commercial sewer lines at some spots many small factories warehouses and raw materials processing units can also be observed around ponds some of them include paint wholesale stores stone crushing warehouses cement and putty dealers soaps watch making metal pipes and food chicken and meat processing factories apart from these all types of domestic and commercial waste and chemicals released through sewer lines might have added to the metal pollution in the water bodies pca analysis yielded 3 relevant principal components which were used in the interpretation of results table 6 they explained 78 of variance in the data with 35 variance covered by pc1 eigen value 1 75 28 by pc2 eigen value 1 4 and 15 variance supported by pc3 eigen value 0 7 the output was also visually represented though the score plot supplementary fig 1 and biplot fig 3 pc1 shows a high positive correlation for lead and cobalt and a high negative correlation for manganese the biplot also clearly indicates high loading for lead and cobalt signifying their common sources and evolutionary history heavy abundance of trace metal in water can indicate transportation by leaching and precipitation singh and shashtri 2011 values greater than acceptable limits hint towards anthropogenic effects from urbanization alahabadi and malvandi 2018 thus pb and co reflects mutual contribution to the metal abundance possibly from common sources lead and cobalt might have similar anthropogenic sources from lead cobalt based batteries paints and dyeing materials lead and cobalt enriched fertilizers kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 long term historical usage mining and human activities of such trace metals and their progressive accumulation plays a major role in their mobility kowalska et al 2018 duncan et al 2018 heavy load of pb is a significant indicator of pollution from municipal wastewater and precipitation of vehicular discharge harikumar and jisha 2010 nature of parent material paedogenesis and weathering of river sediments also contribute to the trace metals enrichment manganese shows a very high negative correlation with pb and exists independently without having common sources or showing compatibility with other metals a high negative correlation exhibits their contrasting behaviour and character with pb similar observations were made by other researchers e g shiji et al 2015 manganese abundance pattern reveals natural lithogenic contribution to water mostly from weathering which fluctuates under changing ph temperature and do duncan et al 2018 omwene et al 2018 biplot goes on to further substantiate the result where bisar and dighi are found to have lesser lead abundance compared to manganese whereas suryakund ramsagar and some samples of vaitarni pond show high abundance of lead pc2 shows high correlation for zinc and chromium and the loading plot also signifies the same indicating some common processes and sources involved in their distribution zinc and chromium is extensively used in electroplating industries and find common occurrence in urban untreated wastes shiji et al 2015 zinc is an integral part of crystal structure of minerals and weathering may cause their mobility in water carbonate and hydroxide rich minerals mostly release zinc in water systems singh and shashtri 2011 chromium ore is also found in the earth s crust as chromite but their natural sources in gaya city is not confirmed chromium is also used in pesticides and fertilizers and past applications over the decade might have contributed to their enrichment in the system pc3 does not explain a large amount of variance in the data it has very high loading for cobalt which seems to cause high degree metal contamination in the waters of gaya heavy load of cobalt must have resulted from urban waste water runoff and sewer lines from commercial and domestic sources which find its way into the ponds kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 the score plot for various sample observations help in visually interpreting clusters trends and outliers in the first two components it can be seen that pc1 has been successful in demarcating bisar and dighi ponds from suryakund and ramsagar ponds pc2 further differentiates between bisar and dighi and ramsagar and suryakund to some extent however the close association patterns between bisar and dighi and suryakund and ramsagar is clearly visible vaitarni pond shows high variability in trace meal abundance and its samples are grouped with ramsagar and suryakund but also some outliers exist indicating some significant contribution from random or specific in situ sources hierarchical cluster analysis hca provides important insight by placing trace metal variables and sample observations into groups with similar characteristics lima et al 2020 the output obtained was perfectly in sync with the pca performed decena et al 2018 two types of hca was undertaken one being cluster for variables and the other for observations hca performed on variables yielded identical result to pca wherein cr and zn formed cluster 1 with similarity level of 66 5 fig 4 the second cluster included pb and co having similarity index of 63 2 the third cluster had manganese separately which had higher similarity index with cluster 2 48 6 than cluster 1 24 2 but these associations were not remarkably significant hca performed on observations provided with insights into similarities that existed among different ponds six clusters were identified supplementary fig 2 cluster 1 with five samples from mostly bisar had the highest load of trace metal pollution with the sum of means being 5 31 mg l cluster 2 9 samples groups samples of dighi and a few from bisar having a mean sum of 4 67 mg l cluster 3 3 samples groups samples of dighi and 1 sample of vaitarni having less trace metal load 4 13 mg l however the similarity coefficient with cluster 1 and 2 were high signifying similar underlying character and behaviour cluster 4 11 samples and 5 9 samples were very similar with a mean trace metal abundance as 4 40 and 4 36 respectively all samples of suryakund and ramsagar were included in these clusters with samples of vaitarni pond finding its way in cluster 6 exclusively separated 3 samples of vaitarni pond which showed higher variability and high metal load of 5 15 mg l these seem to be outliers in our data as observed in pca analysis thus hca was able to demarcate between samples of bisar cluster 1 and dighi cluster 2 and 3 but had high similarity comparatively with each other than with cluster 4 5 and 6 4 2 4 trace metals assessment in sediments sediments have been more frequently used as environmental indicators for the assessment of metal pollution in water bodies md islam et al 2015 the result shows that all four ponds depicted similar kind of metal pollution with little variability table 7 gaya with a dry weather and rocky terrain may have contributed towards the high trace metal concentration through leaching from its geologic settings apart from untreated sewage direct solid wastes dumping which might have precipitated and complexed with the sediments pendias and pendias 2001 pierzynski et al 2000 trace metals concentration were significantly higher than the permissible limit in all four ponds sampled but comparatively higher in ramsagar pond pb is the only studied metal whose concentrations were below the permissible limit in all four ponds manganese and cobalt showed extreme abundance and concentration significantly higher than the normal values the abundance may be owed to the effect of domestic waste and natural geological rocks senthilkumar et al 2011 manganese and cobalt was shown to have the highest concentration in ramsagar pond with 109 40 mg kg and 189 99 mg kg respectively copper was also found to be higher than the recommended standards ranging from 28 10 mg kg in dighi to 40 62 mg kg in ramsagar the decreasing trend of trace metals in sediments of dighi bisar ramsagar and vaitarni ponds were as follows co mn cu pb trace metal contamination in water bodies is mainly attributed to the increased rate of anthropogenic activities overtime which leads to more rapid accumulation than in natural undisturbed ecosystems d amore et al 2005 subsequently these trace metals can further get incorporated in sediment components and react through ion exchange absorption and precipitation yuan et al 2004 the usage of single pollution indices like contamination factor cf and pollution index pi and integrated pollution index namely pollution load index pli gives an overall view of the risk and metal pollution threat faced by gaya ponds the mean contamination factor for cobalt was very high 17 69 1 79 whereas for metals like manganese lead and copper it ranged from low to moderate level table 7 single pollution index pi generated for pond sediments had the highest mean values for cobalt 5 table 7 indicating great anthropogenically induced pollution risk lead also posed a great threat to the soil environment and biota around with mean pi value of 5 25 other metals like manganese and copper come under the low pollution class with mean values of 1 31 0 18 and 1 21 0 43 respectively pli values calculated for the sediments of gaya ponds were based on pi index of metals and indicated massive deterioration of sediment quality and high progressive accumulation rate of trace metals table 7 the average pli value for sediments was found to be 3 12 0 89 which denotes high progressive deterioration of sediment quality varol 2011 independently all ponds have pli values 3 with a decreasing trend in ramsagar vaitarni bisar dighi the cf and pi both indices show a decreasing trend of risk from trace metals as co pb mn cu the sediments have high susceptibility to absorb adsorb and precipitate trace metals at moderate to high ph as was the case in gaya sediments 4 2 5 mapping of ionic activity quantifying the sum of cations and sum of anions is an important method of assessing the balance in the hydrochemical facies present in the water body major cations and anions were depicted thematically on a radial chart fig 5 signifying the eight directions from where samples were taken these directions are n s e w sw nw se and ne a normal water body has complete ionic balance of cations and anions however surface water bodies in a densely populated region may have an unaccounted source of anionic species like organic anions nitrates fluorides and nutrients which may lead to higher ionic balance hem 1985 bisar pond depicts even distribution of cations and anions in all directions implying water being well mixed and having a common source of transfusion fig 5a however it may be noted that se direction reports maximum values 12 14 meq l and least at ne direction irregularities in anthropogenic discharge may be the cause of such disturbance major anions are also evenly distributed overall with the maximum value being reported from nw 7 09 meq l and least at sw 6 68 meq l dighi pond also overall has even distribution of cations and anions in all directions with se indicating the maximum concentrations for cations and anions at 10 19 meq l and 6 12 meq l respectively fig 5b there might be the dissolution of salts or rock water interaction taking place causing a spurt in overall concentration ramsagar pond shows slight variability in the distribution of some of cations and anions with a drastic decrease of cations at sw 4 34 meq l whereas a decrease of anions in opposite directions at ne 1 88 meq l fig 5c suryakund pond witnesses high cationic activity at nw with the value 9 01 meq l fig 5d anionic activity was even at all premises of the pond vaitarni pond showcases variable distribution of anionic and cationic facies indicating different factors or unknown nutrients at different points causing the disturbance fig 5e 4 3 hydrogeochemical classification and process evaluation most of the samples in bisar pond were of na ca mg cl type 62 5 dighi pond is characterized by the presence of hydrochemical facies of na ca cl 50 and na ca mg cl 37 5 water type ramsagar pond mostly includes water type of ca na mg cl 37 5 with two samples including ca na mg cl hco3 type 25 and others belonging to ca na cl na ca k cl hco3 and ca na cl hco3 analysis of suryakund pond reveals the existence of mixed water type comprising na ca mg cl 12 5 ca na mg cl 62 5 and mg na ca cl type of water 12 5 vaitarni pond has an overall presence of na ca mg cl hco3 62 5 type of water similar water type has been reported by bhattacharya et al 2006 the overall water type mostly seen in the surface water of gaya city was na ca mg cl followed by ca na mg cl and ca na mg cl hco3 from piper 1953 trilinear diagram fig 6 it is very much evident that most of the water types have mixed facies especially cations about 80 of total samples fall into a mixed category type where the alkalis dominate but the water character is of alkaline earth type obeidat et al 2013 dighi samples show exclusive dominance of na cl type water overall 70 of samples are mixed cl type whereas 30 fall in the category of mixed cl hco3 type the first category entails the character of highly mineralized water bisar dighi and suryakund and the latter one implies less loaded waters tlili zrelli et al 2013 the presence of mineral species like calcite dolomite and aragonite explain the dominance of carbonate chemistry and frequent rock water interaction and presence of ca mg silicates thilagavathi et al 2012 to further understand the type of processes occurring in the pond waters durov s plot was formulated durov 1948 it is quite similar to piper s diagram but it is a composite diagram that in addition to two ternary plots quantified as milli equivalents of percentages of facies it also includes parameters such as tds and ph the durov s plot fig 7 indicates reverse cation exchange processes as well as simple dissolution or mixing to be mainly responsible for hydrogeochemistry of sampled ponds of gaya ravikumar et al 2015 it is evident from the piper and durov plot that most of the ponds show no cation no anion dominance indicating evolved water type the mixing of processes evolved from reverse cation exchange mixing and dissolution of rocks and clay structure and cation exchange lose their distinctive character and is an amalgamation of reactions arising out of many origins xu et al 2019 however different ponds do show some distinctive behaviour which has a unique profile for the identification of sources bisar and dighi ponds show high salinity content with high tds values the dominant process indicated by their behaviour is of reverse cation exchange type ziani et al 2017 when na concentration in the system is about 50 it triggers sodium ions to move towards ca mg based rocks and minerals and displace them through reverse cation exchange process zaidi et al 2019 it results when highly saline wastewater comes in contact with raw freshwater which might be the case with bisar and dighi with high anthropogenic wastes entering the pond system e g al khatib and al najar 2011 this causes enrichment of ca ions in water but potential for halite dissolution also increases these two ponds have high dominance of na cl ion which might have resulted from halite albite based minerals singh et al 2017 na cl abundance is also marked by enrichment of evaporates like na cl salts and concentration by evaporation obeidat et al 2013 na cl ratio is another way of determining the source and presence of salinity in water the na cl ratio provides information regarding the balance of these ionic species hinting at the type of dissolution occurring kumari et al 2012 in the case of bisar and dighi the ratio is 1 which means it undergoes mixing of saline waste sources and loss of sodium ions through reverse ion exchange process all ponds have ratios of ca mg hco3 much 0 5 which substantiates the evidence that reverse cation exchange process and mixing are dominant processes zaidi et al 2019 quite variable water types were observed from ramsagar pond few samples aligning near reverse exchange process to few deflecting towards direct ion exchange ramsagar and suryakund both show mixing and dissolution as the dominant process with prevalence of ca na mg cl type waters 80 of samples have na cl ratios equal to one suggesting the prevalence of halite dissolution prevalence and predominance ca mg is indicative of high degree rock water interaction and dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of high ph ziani et al 2017 dissolution of calcites dolomites with halites and anthropogenically loaded wastewaters might have evolved such water type vaitarni pond shows no abundance of particular ionic species it is of mixed na cl hco3 evolved from the process of halite and alumina silicate weathering and dissolution reverse cation exchange and mixing of pollutants though na and k based mineral dissolution occurred as evidence suggests the k ion is hard to leach or participate in the process as it has higher tendency to adsorb on clay particles and thus shows low abundance in water zaidi et al 2019 discharge from domestic wastewater has changed the geochemical character of all the ponds of gaya to a large extent evapoconcentration and enrichment of ionic species has led to the profiling of water from being less loaded to highly mineralized systems i e from ca hco3 to na ca cl end member 4 4 factor analysis factor analysis was preceded as per meeting the minimum criteria to carry forward the analysis three factors have been chosen based on eigen values 1 factor loading has been classified as strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and weak 0 5 unmesh et al 2006 82 2 of the variance in data is accounted for from factor 1 2 and 3 cumulatively table 8 factor 1 has the highest role to play in water chemistry of gaya ponds with 56 factor 2 accounts for 26 of the variation and least impact is shown by factor 3 by accounting 16 of the variation factor 1 has strong loadings for ec tds and cations like na and anion like cl sodium and chloride dominance seem to be anthropogenic coming from highly loaded domestic sewage milliot 1970 and dissolution of halite mineral which is found to be undersaturated in pond waters of gaya evapoconcentration and enrichment of evaporates like na cl salt has a huge role to play in evolving the water type of gaya ponds ec and tds imply total soluble solids play a greater role in ionic chemistry pond waters are found to be corrosive in nature the dominant dissolubility activity explains the above phenomenon moderate loading of ca mg and k reveals lithological source playing an important role in deciding the hydrogeochemistry the calcite and dolomite and k type minerals like feldspar mica and ca and mg silicates might be an important source from weathering through rock water interaction as gaya has a strong granite gneiss and limestone based geological character dsr 2018 singh et al 2005 factor 2 has strong implications derived from variables like alkalinity ph and bicarbonates this justifies the dominance of carbonate chemistry in gaya waters which is oversaturated with carbonate minerals so factor1 and factor 2 can be said to have a common area of leaching bodies from where ca and mg silicates and carbonates might be driving the ionic chemistry of pond waters however ph is the main driver of this process which renders the evident alkaline nature to water the third factor which is least important among three is marked by extreme negative loading of sulphates this goes on to explain non implication of sulphates in rock water interaction and that it does not play a major role in the water chemistry even in the other two factors their background concentration can be attributed to anthropogenic sources and domestic application of pond waters it can thus be concluded that majority of factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry are regulated by constituents derived by rock water interaction and dissolution of na rich minerals however wastewater added from anthropogenic activities also have a role in rendering the overall mixed type hydrological character 4 5 source and mechanism of rock water interaction 4 5 1 gibbs ratio gibbs diagrams fig 8 a and b provide some insight into the on going water chemistry mostly water samples of ponds of gaya town exhibit a transitional activity between rock dominance and evaporation dominance visibly in bisar and dighi ponds high concentration of na cl might have resulted from enrichment by evaporates with is suggested here clearly however water chemistry seems to be influenced primarily by the underlying lithology of the pond systems in all cases dissolution of rocks and cation clay structures has an important implication on the hydrological character of the ponds 4 5 2 indices base exchange ibe positive value reflects the exchange of na and k in water with mg and ca in rocks whereas negative value explains the opposite scenario during this mechanism the lithology is the driving factor regulating ionic exchange nagaraju et al 2014 after analyzing pond water bodies of gaya town it was found that all 100 water samples of bisar and dighi ponds have positive values for ion exchange index this shows reverse ion exchange mechanism plays the dominant role in these two water bodies however ramsagar and suryakund yielded negative values for all its samples hinting at disequilibrium causing dissolution and subsequent mixing of facies vaitarni pond exhibited positive values for all samples in case of chl 1 but 50 samples showed negative values in case of chl 2 thus vaitarni pond shows a little variable character where it transitions between reverse ion exchange process and simple dissolution processes 4 5 3 hydrochemical modelling the si values less than zero indicate the water body being undersaturated with respective mineral species the absolute zero figure hints at neutrality with the water body being at equilibrium with the mineral phase the positive values imply oversaturation of the mineral phase which may result in precipitation of the minerals the si indices were calculated for minerals like anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite gypsum halite and magnesite supplementary table 3 anhydrite mineral seems to be undersaturated for all the five ponds of gaya the sulphate species seem to be deficient in the mineralogy of these ponds but it is evident that minerals like aragonite calcite and dolomite are supersaturated in these water bodies from the study undertaken by dsr 2018 it has been evident that the presence of limestone and calcite type minerals has been a part of gaya s geological structure the dominance and supersaturation of calcium and carbonate minerals like calcite aragonite and dolomite provides evidence about presence of carbonate based rock minerals below the hydrologic barrier strongly the ionic species of these minerals may be leaching out through dissolution and weathering but external deposition through runoffs cannot be negated singh and shashtri 2011 the mineral like halite is under saturated hinting at their constituents coming from other sources too or existing in other forms singh et al 2008 dissolution of silicate minerals like feldspar amphiboles and pyroxenes may also lead to the enrichment of na in water however the weathering rate of minerals like evaporates and carbonates are 80 and 12 times rapid than silicates owing to the lower equilibrium constants of calcite and dolomite they end up precipitating faster in water bodies this is another reason why minerals like calcite and dolomite precipitate faster the magnesite mineral shows transition between under saturation and oversaturation in most pond waters thus contributing to the magnesium presence 4 6 water quality index wqi the calculation of wqi of five ponds of gaya depicts heavy pollution load in the waters table 9 bisar pond s wqi stands at 248 04 it is exceedingly higher than the normal drinking water index value bisar pond s water is not apt for drinking and fishing purposes wqi value of dighi pond is 208 97 which again is not at all fit for drinking purpose supplementary table 1 similar results were also seen for ramsagar 137 33 suryakund 153 7 and vaitarni 177 15 ponds respectively all five ponds have been recommended to be unfit for drinking purposes as the values are much higher than wqi of 50 the decreasing trend for wqi of five ponds studied are bisar dighi vaitarni suryakund ramsagar 4 7 irrigational water quality surface water has often been the source of various big and small purposes including irrigation the studied ponds of gaya town have been suggested to be unfit for drinking purposes to look into the irrigational suitability of these water bodies several indices are suggested which helps in the evaluation of water quality from the perspective of irrigational use table 2 4 7 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar water promotes healthy and sustainable growth of plants if the availability of micronutrients is balanced or in a good proportion sodium adsorption ratio sar is a well accepted parameter for evaluating irrigational water quality as na in proportion with ca and mg governs the extent of soil permeability and clay structure kumar et al 2009 irregularities in soil processes cause a reduction in crop productivity and leads to stunted growth of plants srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 another parameter ec is an important entity which highlights the presence of dissolved solids compositely called salts irrigational water should hold a balanced quantity of dissolved solids as it can indirectly affect plant growth ussl 1954 developed the classification format for alkali hazard and salinity hazard ec after richards 1954 it can be seen fig 9 that water samples of pond bisar dighi and vaitarni fall under c3s1 category whereas ponds ramsagar and suryakund rest under c2s1 category both the classes show that the water is good and suitable for irrigation purposes on most types of crops 4 7 2 percentage sodium percentage sodium na can provide great insight into the suitability of water for irrigational purposes wilcox 1955 the wilcox diagram fig 10 depicts the values of percentage sodium in association with conductivity to present a larger picture on the classification of samples high na indicates the dominance of alkali through ion exchange and rock water dilution processes it is evident that samples of ramsagar and suryakund exhibit excellent properties for irrigational purposes whereas samples of bisar vaitarni and dighi fall in the category of good to permissible fig 10 4 7 3 permeability index permeability of soil is an important factor that decides the infiltration rate and the structure of soil aggregates and therefore affects the growth of plants major cations and anion hco3 have an important influence on the irrigational quality of water and also permeability srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 when there is a lack of important cations the soil water matrix would be replaced by higher hco3 concentration causing toxic reactions with plants doneen 1964 explained the application of the permeability index in deciding the usability of water for irrigational purpose the doneen s chart fig 11 is divided into classes i ii and iii class i and ii stand for good category of water whereas class iii falls under unsuitable category it was noticed that the water samples of all five ponds of gaya town are suitable for irrigational purposes as they fall under class i category 4 7 4 residual sodium carbonate in water bodies if carbonate and bicarbonate are in excess to cations like calcium and magnesium it leads to precipitation of residual calcium and magnesium and deems the water body to be unfit for irrigational purpose richards 1954 prasanna et al 2011 if an opposite scenario occurs rsc values turn out to be zero raju et al 2011 according to richards 1954 classification rsc value 1 25 is suggested to be safe for irrigation range of 1 25 2 5 is of moderate quality and values 2 5 are deemed unsuitable all the water samples of ponds bisar dighi ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni are highly suitable from this aspect as the values are much below 1 25 supplementary table 4 4 7 5 magnesium hazard paliwal 1972 introduced magnesium hazard in irrigational water by computing magnesium ratio any water body having high magnesium content will cause a disruption in plant growth this is due to the water becoming too alkaline in nature srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 the mr values 50 are considered to be suitable for irrigation whereas values 50 are suggested to be unfit for irrigational purposes almost all water samples of the studies five ponds are considered to be suitable for irrigation only 7 5 of samples from bisar pond were found to be unfit for irrigation supplementary table 4 4 7 6 corrosivity ratio corrosivity ratio helps in evaluating the corrosive properties of water bodies on metallic pipes or materials susceptible to corrosion this ratio was first used by ryzner in 1944 the value 1 is considered to be safe whereas values above 1 are supposed to unsafe and need mitigation in case of corrosive water type pvc pipes or corrosivity resistant materials should be used corrosion of hydraulic carriers also leads to further toxicity of water which can be detected by employing this index as expected water of gaya ponds are highly corrosive in nature supplementary table 4 5 conclusions and future recommendations the study on the major ponds of gaya revealed that it is undergoing rapid deterioration due to discharge of heavy domestic and urban wastewater usage of ponds by numerous pilgrims has exacerbated the problem rendering it unfit for drinking purposes however the water is safe to be used for agricultural purposes all ponds water show oversaturation of carbonate minerals like calcite dolomite and aragonite indicating reverse cation exchange process and na enrichment from halite dissolution and evapoconcentration of na cl based salts anthropogenic mixing of wastewater from domestic sewage channels and urban rain water runoffs flowing into the water bodies also alter the geochemical character of water to a great extent ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni ponds show dominance of ca na cl hco3 and na ca cl hco3 water type in addition reverse cation exchange process dissolution of halite and silicate minerals also govern the hydrogeochemical characteristics of ponds water the study also shows that water and sediments are heavily loaded with trace metals particularly co lead pb although present in high concentration in waters is below the acceptable limit in case of sediments however greater pi values of lead in sediments signify it to be a potential threat to the environment owing to its great susceptibility for leaching high pli values 3 for sediments of gaya ponds indicate progressive deterioration of sediment quality thus a clear impact of urbanization and tourism is evident in the pondswater of gaya city urgent management policies and their proper implementation are required to overcome the pollution hazard and health risks proper treatment of sewage effluents before dumping in water bodies needs to be prioritized declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

11972,gaya a prominent city of bihar india with rich cultural and religious significance has been susceptible to massive urbanization population growth and pollution which have huge impact on its surface water bodies the study was conducted on five major ponds of gaya namely bisar dighi vaitarni ramsagar and suryakund this paper attempts to evaluate their drinking and irrigational water quality status trace metal contamination in water and sediments except suryakund hydrogeochemical characterization and evolutionary trends and processes involved in the water chemistry the wqi values 130 revealed that the ponds are facing heavy pollution load and the water is not fit for drinking purposes however irrigational indices indicates that the water of these ponds is suitable for irrigational purposes the ponds water and sediments are heavily contaminated with trace metals particularly cobalt cf and pi 17 and lead cf 1 4 and pi 5 in sediments the pca and hca were also performed to find the relevant sources trends and groups in trace metal contamination in their water the hydrogeochemical profile of surface water piper s plot durov s diagram gibbs diagram and ibe indicated that they are of mixed water type with most abundant facies being na ca mg cl ca na mg cl and ca na mg cl hco3 si values showed ponds to be oversaturated with ca mg based minerals and dissolution of halite magnesite and anhydrite indicating high degree of rock water interaction and reverse cation exchange process dominating the water chemistry however extensive mixing of pollutants and dissolution has caused the overall geochemical character of water to change the overall study shows that urbanization may further increase the rate of anthropogenic activities overtime which could enhance trace metal accumulation in the ponds and pose a serious health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry surface water multivariate analysis urbanization water quality index trace metal 1 introduction india is endowed with various types of lentic ecosystems like ponds lakes tanks and reservoirs wetzel 2001 these ecosystems are mostly studied by ecologists for their importance as a source of drinking water and the development of fisheries and irrigation beckerman 2014 apart from these there are many tangible and non tangible services rendered by such ecosystems in the past few decades rising population and increased dependency on ponds and lakes for potable water has disturbed the ecological health of water bodies kumar et al 2019 unplanned growth of cities and industrialization has further put a break on survival capacity of lentic ecosystems like ponds incessant urbanization of cities particularly already dense northern region of india has led to a widespread loss and extinction of surface water bodies construction activities filling of pond beds and pollution channelled through population explosion have rendered the surface water bodies as the most vulnerable ecosystems laloo and ranjan 2017 encroachments of green belts for setting up of factories and buildings have also led to fragmentation of habitats leading to variable climatic conditions and disturbed ecological character koduru and dutta 2013 according to the world commission report on environment and sustainability by 2020 if these activities are not urgently checked it may pose a humongous problem of water scarcity and pollution in future brundtland 1987 surface water bodies apart from being a source of water they also recharge the groundwater national environmental engineering research institute neeri is of the view that 70 of india s freshwater is polluted govindasamy and viji 2012 however numerous attempts are being made to restore the ecological health of these water bodies the first step towards achieving that is the identification of the level of pollution through water quality monitoring and assessment bhat and pandit 2014 the present study focuses on five ponds of gaya city of bihar which is going through a tremendous pressure to meet the demands of rising population and also faces dry spells which render them waterless in summer months the gaya city is also in the grip of the water crisis as the water level in the town block has shrunk by several inches within a month in 2017 ians 2019 most of the ponds have dried up at present the number of ponds has come down to ten out of which six falls in the shrine areas alone ojha 2018 the problem is more intense where addition of domestic wastes generated from different households and sewage outlet entering the ponds contaminate the water bodies additional source of contamination is the waste generated from the religious rituals and idol immersions performed during festivals apart from few studies on accounting of ecological species of the suryakund pond hardly any literature is available on the hydrochemical status of the surface water bodies of the gaya region nag et al 2014 to ascertain the level of ecological damage ponds have undergone and subsequently to define the application limits of the ponds it is imperative to outline the hydrogeochemical status of these ponds of gaya region the assessment of trace metals in water as well as sediments can indicate a lot about the impacts of anthropogenic and industrial load on the water bodies and thus might help in mitigating the risks posed to it saleem et al 2015 therefore the objectives undertaken in the present study include a ascertaining physico chemical properties of bisar dighi suryakund ramsagar and vaitarni ponds and estimate water quality index for water pollution load b quantifying the trace metal load in the pond waters and sediments c ascertaining the suitability of pond waters for irrigational purpose by applying relevant indices d estimating the distribution of various hydrochemical species and identifying the major processes involved in the water chemistry 2 study area five ponds were selected for the study namely bisar dighi ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni fig 1 all ponds are situated in the heart of gaya city bihar india latitude 24 17 n to 25 04 n and longitude 84 18 e to 85 24 e the gaya city is religiously significant especially for hindus and bodh gaya for buddhists thus a high percentage of water from ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni ponds are used for performing sacred rituals like pind daan though rainwater is the primary source of water in these ponds local sewer lines were found to be a source of influent wastewater as per site investigation these ponds are used by local people for domestic purposes and fishing table 1 2 1 religious and cultural significance gaya is a prominent city of bihar with religious and cultural significance for hindus jains and buddhists it is believed to be the place where lord rama paid his last tributes to his father dasharatha after his demise by offering pind daan in gaya for buddhists this place holds special respect as a place of enlightenment as lord buddha earned enlightenment in bodh gaya mahabodhi temple the famous mahabodhi temple is also a world heritage site as declared by unesco whc 2002 this city is also important from the perspective of tourism and culture as it is marked by the presence of many magnificent temples and shrines namely vishnupad temple yama temple dungeshwari cave temple and mangla gauri temple mostly water bodies and ponds are adjacent to these pilgrimage sites where devotees take bath and holy dips marking purity of soul and for washing away of sins geary 2009 has highlighted the significance of religious and cultural tourism in bodhgaya which has played a significant role in boosting the economy and urban planning in gaya district additionally gaya tourism has upgraded the socio economic conditions of local people due to a large number of pilgrims coming from eastern and north western world srivastava 2010 according to the official website of bihar state tourism development about 56 lakh persons visited gaya city and bodhgaya in gaya district in 2019 out of this over 6 lakh visitors were foreigners and the remaining accounted for the domestic crowd alone the pitri paksha event including vishnu puja and pind daan saw the incoming of over 9 lakhs tourists in the month of september 2019 of which foreigners accounted for 20 000 monthly segregation of data indicated the highest tourist footfall in the months from december to february reaching peak in january this may be due to the onset of kalachakra puja during the month of january bhonsale 2019 the summer months particularly june received the lowest number of visitors 2 2 demography and economy gaya district comprises a large chunk of southern region of bihar state it is fifth most populous district of bihar with specifically high population density towards gaya city from the 2011 census data it is reported that the total population stands at 4 391 418 with 51 76 males and 48 24 females out of the total area of 4976 sq km gaya municipal corporation is distributed in the area of 50 17 sq km dpg 2017 the overall population density is 880 persons per sq km 86 of the population are found to be living in rural areas whereas 14 are limited to urban areas as far as industrial contribution to economy is concerned there is no major industrial configuration present in gaya the economy is primarily dependant on agricultural activities it houses many household and cottage industries including tilkut agarbatti perfume snacks power loom paints etc also significant are some stone and artefacts factories wooden furniture warehouses food processing units oil mills and some sugar mills cdp 2011 gaya provides a major transportation aid by connecting various cities and metros via road rail and airways 2 3 topography and geology the gaya district is a land area comprising of two units gangetic plains in the north and a demarcation in the southern part by a highland area spurting from chhota nagpur plateau substantial area is characterized by deep deposits of alluvial soil however many parts are randomly characterized by hilly and rocky regions with isolated peaks at some spots the gaya city the main study area lies along the ganges river and marks the periphery of gangetic plains with chhotanagpur plateau pletcher 2014 the area is also marked by three groups of rocky hills the gaya city is influenced by the topography of brahmayoni hill and murli and ramsila hills in the northern part katari hill and plateau towards the west and northern west the city is lined by pretsila hills such topography causes the depressions formed in the urban city to be waterlogged during the monsoon periods often the periphery of gaya city near vishnupad and brahmayoni hill has a natural slope which drains the water over a large stretch of lowland area forming small channels before merging into river falgu cdp 2011 as for geology gaya district which belongs to quaternary age has mostly unconsolidated sediments of alluvial and consolidated sediments of satpura range the supra crystals of satpura range are of low grade and exposed in the hills of gaya city and include ferruginous phyllites quartzite and slate few patches belonging to archaeon ages have some of the old rock formations existing predominantly the rock type found is gneiss granites and amphiboles the alluvium near rivers and streams has gradual deposits of medium to fine textured sands gaya is rich in mineral resources like mica sandstone quartzite and sand dsr 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis water samples were collected from eight different directions e ne n nw w sw s se from each pond in polypropylene bottles samples were brought to the laboratory in an icebox and stored at 4 c for further analysis the field parameters like ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were analyzed on site itself with portable digital meters eutech other parameters like dissolved oxygen do total alkalinity total hardness biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and chlorides were analyzed according to the standard procedures apha 2012 turbidity was measured by digital turbidity meter systronics nephlometer sodium and potassium were measured on flame photometer systronics anions like nitrate sulphate and phosphate were estimated with the help of spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 25 3 2 trace metals in water trace metals were analyzed by directly aspiring preserved water sample to thermo scientific atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3000 3 3 digestion of sediment sample and trace metal analysis trace metal analysis in sediments was carried out for all ponds except suryakund pond 0 5 gm of sediment was digested with aqua regia and hydrogen peroxide subsequently and later filtered with 0 45 μm whatman filter paper and diluted to 100 ml behera et al 2013 samples were analyzed on atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo scientific ice3000 3 4 quality control and assurance measures the accuracy and precision of sample collection and handling of water and sediments were based on the international standards of usgs 2018 and usepa 1999 respectively most of the water analyses was undertaken by following certified protocols suggested by iso or and apha 2012 all results were analyzed and kept within the suggested standard confidence limit of 95 all experimental glassware and containers were pre cleaned with lab grade soap pre soaked in 4 hno3 followed by rinsing with deionised water for trace metals analysis sediment samples were processed and digested according to the international standards usepa 1996 varol 2011 quality control was established by including reagent blank run analysis of replicates using standard calibration measures by accurate dilution of the 1000 ppm stock solution for parameters merck 1113550100 icp multi element standard solution iv 3 5 statistical analysis general descriptive statistics coefficient correlation and statistical diagrams were analyzed using microsoft excel ms office 2007 all statistical analyses were carried out at 95 confidence level multivariate analytical tool of minitab 17 software was used for understanding complex data analysis factor analysis was undertaken using a varimax rotation module factor analysis has been frequently used in environmental assessment tanvir rahman et al 2017 in hydrogeochemistry where many variables interplay to govern the water chemistry it is important to come up with a deductive approach to simplify the analysis the basic idea behind applying factor analysis is to reduce the number of variables and identify the underlying factors governing the hydrogeochemistry of water bodies other multivariate analyses namely principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were employed to study the significance of various trace metals in ponds water pca is one of the most important dimensional data reduction techniques which provide considerable insights regarding an important set of variables without loss of much information it also assesses hidden relationships among random variables and groups by acknowledging correlated variables eigen values can be used to ascertain the acceptable amount of variances kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 kowalska et al 2018 hierarchical cluster analysis is useful in identifying the trends and groups of similar observations and variables which it classifies based on clusters and sub clusters shirani et al 2020 it also helps in identifying sources and evolutionary history of variables which might have similar character and significance cluster analysis was applied on euclidean distances and similarity coefficients for classifying data ward linkage method minimum variance was used for cluster analysis lima et al 2019 3 6 drinking and irrigational water quality indices water quality index was calculated to address its potability and level of pollution existing in the ponds of gaya chatterjee 1992 supplementary table 1 for the calculation of wqi the standards of drinking water quality recommended by world health organization who 1997 bureau of indian standards bis 2012 and icmr indian council of medical research were used supplementary table 2 weighted arithmetic index was used for estimating wqi brown et al 1972 apart from this sub index qn was also measured using the following formula q n 100 v n v i o s n v i o where qn quality rating for the nth water parameter vn estimated value of the nth parameter at a given sampling site vio ideal value of nth parameter in pure water sn standard permissible value of the nth parameter unit weight was calculated based on value inversely proportional to the recommended standard value sn of the corresponding parameter wn k sn w n unit weight for the nth parameter k proportionality constant the final wqi was formulated in this way wqi qnwn wn suitability of water for irrigational purposes was assessed based on many hydrogeochemical indices table 2 3 7 source and mechanism of rock water interaction 1 gibbs ratio and plot gibbs 1970 proposed a boomerang diagram to depict the interaction theme between ionic components of water as a function of tds and the underlying rock structure the hydrological processes that can govern the dynamics of water chemistry like precipitation and evaporation are also taken into account gibbs ratio i cl cl hco3 gibbs ratio ii na k na k ca 2 indices base exchange ibe the ionic balance irregularity caused by the effect of environmental and geomorphological factors on water body cannot be controlled but it can be tracked down by assessing the ionic exchange process during mobility or resting phase of water bodies johnson 1979 sastri 1994 this can be done by the use of chlor alkaline indices suggested by schoeller 1977 the values are computed on the principle that na and k are exchanged with ca and mg and vice versa 3 saturation indices si waterbody interacts with underlying mineralogical structures and rock body and maintain reaction equilibrium this equilibrium state can be assessed by computing the saturation index of different mineral species garrels and mackenzie 1971 singh et al 2008 the dissolubility of various cationic and anionic species can reveal a lot about the type of parent rock and other sources if present saturation index si is the ratio of the calculated log value of ion activity product iap and mineral equilibrium constant and was performed using phreeqc mode in aquachem software 3 8 assessment of trace metal pollution in sediment pollution indices were used for assessing the intensity of trace metals contamination in the sediments of gaya ponds contamination factor was used as a single pollution index malsiu et al 2020 it enables in identifying metal pollution load by considering the gap between pre industrial reference and current value it is thus the ratio of various metal concentrations in sediment and the background pre industrial level håkanson 1980 gong et al 2008 pandey et al 2019 cf classes were defined as cf 1 low 1 cf 3 moderate 3 cf 6 considerable cf 6 very high c f metal content in sediment background level of the metal complex pollution index namely pollution load index pli was used pli provides simple comparative values which enable us to understand the overall trace metal pollution status of a component of an area varol 2011 it is defined as the square root of multiplication of the pollution index pi of metals pi identifies the metals which poses the greatest risk to the soil environment kowalska et al 2018 p i c n g b where cn is the concentration of the metal in sample and gb is the geochemical background in this case background value of average crustal abundance value ucc was used for calculation rudnick and gao 2003 islam et al 2015 alahabadi and malvandi 2018 pi classes were interpreted as pi 1 absent 1 pi 2 low 2 pi 3 moderate 3 pi 5 strong pi 5 very strong varol 2011 pollution load index is calculated as p l i p i 1 p i 2 p i 3 p i n 1 n where n the number of analyzed elements and pi is the single pollution index 4 result and discussions 4 1 water quality parameters the ponds were studied based on important water quality parameters and hydrogeochemical facies present in the water bodies the general descriptive statistics like the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation of water quality parameters were calculated table 3 4 1 1 ph ec and temperature moderately high ph was witnessed in all major ponds of gaya 8 1 8 7 moderate ph is essential for the survival of life forms in pond water moderately high ph could have been associated with high evapoconcentration high co2 demand by growing plants and in turn slow diffusion of co2 from the atmosphere mosley and reid 2015 high carbonate content can lead to buffering of ph of pond water and moderation of dissolved minerals almendinger and leete 1998 water also reacts with carbonates and organic carbon in the presence of co2 and buffers the increase in ph thus moderating the overall ph high values for ec was found in all ponds associated with very high variability highest value was for bisar pond 1192 50 μs cm and the lowest for ramsagar pond 537 50 μs cm high range of ph and ec reflects the high level of interaction with soil and mineral substances and high rates of evaporation gerla 2013 high fluctuations in the ec concentration are mostly due to the variability in the total dissolved solids and salinity mosley and reid 2015 as well as anthropogenic interventions which lead to disruption in natural biogeochemical processes including altered ph and ec the temperature of the pond ecosystem plays a major role in defining the biotic structure of the water body rajagopal et al 2010 as observed by welch 1952 shallow pond water s temperature is approximately the same as the surrounding air temperature this study is in line with measured temperature during analysis on site during the monsoon or post monsoon period the temperature of the pond goes down as the warmer water is replaced by cooler incoming waters from upstreams van buren et al 2000 since the sampling was done during november december period the temperature of ponds ranged between 16 and 17 c table 3 4 1 2 do bod and cod dissolved oxygen do is not only an indicator of water quality but also determines the metabolism of all life forms present in the water body do depends on certain factors like the rate of photosynthesis the saturation point of gas in water and temperature at lower temperature do tends to increase and vice versa ganai et al 2014 in this study do ranges between 3 12 mg l dighi pond to 8 16 mg l vaitarni pond biological oxygen demand bod is a tool for measuring the biochemically oxidizable carbonaceous load in the water body gupta et al 2003 high bod results from the high rate of decomposition of organic matter at the higher temperature excess turbidity and stagnant water conditions azumi and bichi 2010 the present study reveals moderately high bod in gaya ponds which ranged between 9 94 mg l suryakund to 19 7 mg l bisar another tool for assessing the organic load in a water body is chemical oxygen demand cod which is always higher than the bod value as it entails complete oxidizable organic load in water body all the ponds have high degree of cod present ranging between 29 24 mg l ramsagar to 72 5 mg l bisar directional variations were seen in the ponds with sd reaching 30 for dighi and vaitarni ponds table 3 both bod and cod reveal that a lot of domestic effluents sewage and other organic debris are entering the ponds sanap et al 2006 iloms et al 2020 4 1 3 total alkalinity total hardness and turbidity alkalinity values in ponds of gaya ranged between 86 mg l vaitarni and 52 5 mg l ramsagar table 3 carbonates in water have the ability to resist any change in the ph when acid is added in water mahananda et al 2010 high alkalinity in ponds is witnessed when carbonates in sediments dissolves and co2 rich water interacts releasing bicarbonates high variability in alkalinity values were seen in the ponds of gaya similar to observations made by jhingram 1991 in tropical ponds another factor which affects alkalinity is the geology of the rocks and substrates lying below lagler 1978 the values of total hardness ranged between 130 62 mg l to 330 62 mg l table 3 hardness is associated with the occurrence of alkaline earth metals like calcium and magnesium also an increase in the hardness can be attributed to evapoconcentration presence of domestic effluents like detergents chlorides sulphates and nitrates etc rajagopal et al 2010 eruola et al 2011 hardness in water has been observed in ponds near temples where people come to have holy baths angadi et al 2005 high turbidity is an objectionable sight in water bodies however the ponds of gaya had turbidity at a threshold level of 5 approximately with the maximum value being 5 9 and the minimum being 1 88 turbidity is the suspended solids in the form of mud silt clay or may also result from inorganic particulates phytoplankton and microscopic organisms welch 1952 it is a variable parameter which changes according to seasons the demography of the pond basin rate of sedimentation etc lakshmanan 1967 4 2 general hydrogeochemistry of ions and its characterization 4 2 1 water chemistry of cations the major ion chemistry is first analyzed through descriptive statistics to account for their general abundance and mapping distribution in water bodies table 4 the bisar pond is found to have sodium na in the range of 98 4 105 6 mg l sodium is a natural constituent of surface waters and is the most abundant cation in freshwater la baugh 1986 sodium results from weathering of rocks domestic wastewater precipitation runoff etc mishra et al 2014 calcium ca was in the range of 54 1 92 1 mg l ca is an important nutrient for all organisms and high concentrations of it does not cause any adverse effect on organisms apart from causing hardness in water system lehr et al 1980 magnesium with the minimum value of 21 64 mg l and the maximum at 53 1 mg l is the third most abundant cation their possible sources might be from rock water interaction and dissolution of magnesium and calcium rich mineral phases and possible anthropogenic factors like domestic sewage potasznik and szymczyk 2015 potassium was least abundant with a range of 21 27 23 54 mg l it being the third most important micronutrient for plants it plays a major role in plant productivity most of the potassium comes from geologic origin but it also results from dead plants animals excreta and then eventually gets absorbed by plant roots thitame and pondhe 2010 the mean concentrations of na ca mg and k were 101 8 2 59 74 1 16 34 25 14 75 and 22 3 0 684 mg l respectively the maximum permissible limit of these cations in irrigational water should be 200 80 35 and 30 mg l for na ca mg and k respectively duncan and carrow 2000 the cationic abundance trend followed in bisar pond was na ca mg k dighi pond followed a cationic abundance trend of na ca k mg with mean concentrations at 91 3 4 60 2 6 4 20 14 4 94 and 31 6 2 69 mg l for na ca mg and k respectively ramsagar pond s overall cationic abundance seemed to be on the lighter side with the trend being ca na k mg the mean and standard deviation for na ca mg and k were 40 8 1 14 47 3 9 45 8 9 4 18 and 28 8 mg l 0 83 respectively suryakund and vaitarni pond followed similar cationic abundance trend as na ca k mg the percentage abundance of cations for each pond has been compared through stacked bar diagrams fig 2 a it is clear from the stacked bar diagrams that all pond waters are marked by heavy percentage distribution of na 40 and ca 34 potassium follows next with about 16 abundance but high variability exists among different water bodies magnesium is found generally in least concentration at almost all sites 11 4 2 2 water chemistry of anions anions also play a major role in hydrogeochemistry as together with cations they form salts and define the water types existing in the water bodies the major anions studied are cl hco3 co3 2 and so4 2 no3 and po4 3 table 4 the maximum permissible limit of hco3 co3 2 cl and so4 2 in irrigation water is 250 15 250 and 180 mg l respectively duncan and carrow 2000 bisar pond has chlorides in major concentration with mean as 136 7 2 67 mg l chlorides are naturally present in surface waters however high concentration denotes the presence of high organic waste from domestic sources thresh et al 1944 eutrophic systems are found to have a higher concentration of chlorides subbamma and ramasarma 1992 bicarbonates are the next most abundant species with a mean concentration of 61 5 5 83 mg l carbonates are found in this pond with a mean concentration of 11 75 mg l 4 83 carbonates in water can resist any change in the ph when acid is added in water as discussed in the alkalinity section before mahananda et al 2010 sulphates stand with a mean concentration of 28 1 0 81 mg l sulphates act as oxidizing agents and act as electron acceptors for microorganisms sulphate is generally seen to be sourced from industrial and domestic sewage water jhingram 1991 suryakund being prominent holy bathing site explains the highest concentration of sulphates in it although it is not heavily loaded by other pollutants the anionic abundance trend follows as cl hco3 so4 co3 similar anionic abundance trend was followed by dighi pond as cl hco3 so4 co3 ramsagar pond showed the highest mean concentration for bicarbonate with 45 15 27 mg l chloride was the second most abundant anion with a mean value of 43 0 58 mg l then followed sulphate and carbonate with mean values of 6 01 0 59 and 7 5 5 53 mg l respectively suryakund reported anionic abundance trend as cl hco3 so4 co3 vaitarni reported anionic abundance trend as hco3 cl so4 co3 it is evident from the stacked diagram fig 2b that percentage distribution of chlorides 49 overtakes other anionic species in four ponds except dighi pond bicarbonates 36 also dominate highly and seem to have a clear niche in forming hydrochemical facies sulphates 11 and carbonates 2 lag far behind and seem to not participate in regulating water chemistry of ponds water of gaya town nitrate concentration ranged between 4 30 mg l ramsagar to 5 33 mg l bisar which was well below the permissible limit given by bis however in large concentrations nitrates can cause serious health hazards to livestock and humans nitrate finds its way into natural waters through many sources like livestock waste agricultural waste waste water treatment systems septic tanks anthropogenic sources of sewage fertilizers and industrial wastes adeyeye and abulude 2004 manahan 1994 similarly phosphates too arise from anthropogenic sources like soaps detergents that causes increased productivity in pond systems phosphate concentration was seen to be slightly greater than the normal values in natural waters 0 29 1 13 mg l moreover post monsoon values are generally higher owing to the accumulation of phosphorus from surrounding run offs particularly domestic effluent and mineralization of solid waste and organic matter saha et al 1971 anshumali ramanathan 2007 4 2 3 trace metals in water trace metals concentration in all ponds were found to be high above the permissible limit who 2017 bis 2012 table 5 all ponds were heavily contaminated with co permissible value 0 05 mg l mn permissible value 0 5 mg l and pb permissible value 0 01 mg l except zinc permissible value 3 mg l the decreasing trend of trace metals in water for bisar dighi and ramsagar was co mn cr pb zn and for suryakund and vaitarni it was co cr mn pb zn these high concentrations might have resulted from increased influx of sewage inorganic and organic wastes derived from adjoining area particularly in monsoon al wesabi et al 2015 however metals might also have leached from the geologic settings underneath or from seasonal effect of weathering heath 1987 also a clear impact of urbanization can be seen and anthropogenic effect on water bodies is indicated onsite observations revealed that the water bodies are located in the heart of gaya city amid factories and are linked to residential and commercial sewer lines at some spots many small factories warehouses and raw materials processing units can also be observed around ponds some of them include paint wholesale stores stone crushing warehouses cement and putty dealers soaps watch making metal pipes and food chicken and meat processing factories apart from these all types of domestic and commercial waste and chemicals released through sewer lines might have added to the metal pollution in the water bodies pca analysis yielded 3 relevant principal components which were used in the interpretation of results table 6 they explained 78 of variance in the data with 35 variance covered by pc1 eigen value 1 75 28 by pc2 eigen value 1 4 and 15 variance supported by pc3 eigen value 0 7 the output was also visually represented though the score plot supplementary fig 1 and biplot fig 3 pc1 shows a high positive correlation for lead and cobalt and a high negative correlation for manganese the biplot also clearly indicates high loading for lead and cobalt signifying their common sources and evolutionary history heavy abundance of trace metal in water can indicate transportation by leaching and precipitation singh and shashtri 2011 values greater than acceptable limits hint towards anthropogenic effects from urbanization alahabadi and malvandi 2018 thus pb and co reflects mutual contribution to the metal abundance possibly from common sources lead and cobalt might have similar anthropogenic sources from lead cobalt based batteries paints and dyeing materials lead and cobalt enriched fertilizers kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 long term historical usage mining and human activities of such trace metals and their progressive accumulation plays a major role in their mobility kowalska et al 2018 duncan et al 2018 heavy load of pb is a significant indicator of pollution from municipal wastewater and precipitation of vehicular discharge harikumar and jisha 2010 nature of parent material paedogenesis and weathering of river sediments also contribute to the trace metals enrichment manganese shows a very high negative correlation with pb and exists independently without having common sources or showing compatibility with other metals a high negative correlation exhibits their contrasting behaviour and character with pb similar observations were made by other researchers e g shiji et al 2015 manganese abundance pattern reveals natural lithogenic contribution to water mostly from weathering which fluctuates under changing ph temperature and do duncan et al 2018 omwene et al 2018 biplot goes on to further substantiate the result where bisar and dighi are found to have lesser lead abundance compared to manganese whereas suryakund ramsagar and some samples of vaitarni pond show high abundance of lead pc2 shows high correlation for zinc and chromium and the loading plot also signifies the same indicating some common processes and sources involved in their distribution zinc and chromium is extensively used in electroplating industries and find common occurrence in urban untreated wastes shiji et al 2015 zinc is an integral part of crystal structure of minerals and weathering may cause their mobility in water carbonate and hydroxide rich minerals mostly release zinc in water systems singh and shashtri 2011 chromium ore is also found in the earth s crust as chromite but their natural sources in gaya city is not confirmed chromium is also used in pesticides and fertilizers and past applications over the decade might have contributed to their enrichment in the system pc3 does not explain a large amount of variance in the data it has very high loading for cobalt which seems to cause high degree metal contamination in the waters of gaya heavy load of cobalt must have resulted from urban waste water runoff and sewer lines from commercial and domestic sources which find its way into the ponds kouchesfehani and azizi 2019 the score plot for various sample observations help in visually interpreting clusters trends and outliers in the first two components it can be seen that pc1 has been successful in demarcating bisar and dighi ponds from suryakund and ramsagar ponds pc2 further differentiates between bisar and dighi and ramsagar and suryakund to some extent however the close association patterns between bisar and dighi and suryakund and ramsagar is clearly visible vaitarni pond shows high variability in trace meal abundance and its samples are grouped with ramsagar and suryakund but also some outliers exist indicating some significant contribution from random or specific in situ sources hierarchical cluster analysis hca provides important insight by placing trace metal variables and sample observations into groups with similar characteristics lima et al 2020 the output obtained was perfectly in sync with the pca performed decena et al 2018 two types of hca was undertaken one being cluster for variables and the other for observations hca performed on variables yielded identical result to pca wherein cr and zn formed cluster 1 with similarity level of 66 5 fig 4 the second cluster included pb and co having similarity index of 63 2 the third cluster had manganese separately which had higher similarity index with cluster 2 48 6 than cluster 1 24 2 but these associations were not remarkably significant hca performed on observations provided with insights into similarities that existed among different ponds six clusters were identified supplementary fig 2 cluster 1 with five samples from mostly bisar had the highest load of trace metal pollution with the sum of means being 5 31 mg l cluster 2 9 samples groups samples of dighi and a few from bisar having a mean sum of 4 67 mg l cluster 3 3 samples groups samples of dighi and 1 sample of vaitarni having less trace metal load 4 13 mg l however the similarity coefficient with cluster 1 and 2 were high signifying similar underlying character and behaviour cluster 4 11 samples and 5 9 samples were very similar with a mean trace metal abundance as 4 40 and 4 36 respectively all samples of suryakund and ramsagar were included in these clusters with samples of vaitarni pond finding its way in cluster 6 exclusively separated 3 samples of vaitarni pond which showed higher variability and high metal load of 5 15 mg l these seem to be outliers in our data as observed in pca analysis thus hca was able to demarcate between samples of bisar cluster 1 and dighi cluster 2 and 3 but had high similarity comparatively with each other than with cluster 4 5 and 6 4 2 4 trace metals assessment in sediments sediments have been more frequently used as environmental indicators for the assessment of metal pollution in water bodies md islam et al 2015 the result shows that all four ponds depicted similar kind of metal pollution with little variability table 7 gaya with a dry weather and rocky terrain may have contributed towards the high trace metal concentration through leaching from its geologic settings apart from untreated sewage direct solid wastes dumping which might have precipitated and complexed with the sediments pendias and pendias 2001 pierzynski et al 2000 trace metals concentration were significantly higher than the permissible limit in all four ponds sampled but comparatively higher in ramsagar pond pb is the only studied metal whose concentrations were below the permissible limit in all four ponds manganese and cobalt showed extreme abundance and concentration significantly higher than the normal values the abundance may be owed to the effect of domestic waste and natural geological rocks senthilkumar et al 2011 manganese and cobalt was shown to have the highest concentration in ramsagar pond with 109 40 mg kg and 189 99 mg kg respectively copper was also found to be higher than the recommended standards ranging from 28 10 mg kg in dighi to 40 62 mg kg in ramsagar the decreasing trend of trace metals in sediments of dighi bisar ramsagar and vaitarni ponds were as follows co mn cu pb trace metal contamination in water bodies is mainly attributed to the increased rate of anthropogenic activities overtime which leads to more rapid accumulation than in natural undisturbed ecosystems d amore et al 2005 subsequently these trace metals can further get incorporated in sediment components and react through ion exchange absorption and precipitation yuan et al 2004 the usage of single pollution indices like contamination factor cf and pollution index pi and integrated pollution index namely pollution load index pli gives an overall view of the risk and metal pollution threat faced by gaya ponds the mean contamination factor for cobalt was very high 17 69 1 79 whereas for metals like manganese lead and copper it ranged from low to moderate level table 7 single pollution index pi generated for pond sediments had the highest mean values for cobalt 5 table 7 indicating great anthropogenically induced pollution risk lead also posed a great threat to the soil environment and biota around with mean pi value of 5 25 other metals like manganese and copper come under the low pollution class with mean values of 1 31 0 18 and 1 21 0 43 respectively pli values calculated for the sediments of gaya ponds were based on pi index of metals and indicated massive deterioration of sediment quality and high progressive accumulation rate of trace metals table 7 the average pli value for sediments was found to be 3 12 0 89 which denotes high progressive deterioration of sediment quality varol 2011 independently all ponds have pli values 3 with a decreasing trend in ramsagar vaitarni bisar dighi the cf and pi both indices show a decreasing trend of risk from trace metals as co pb mn cu the sediments have high susceptibility to absorb adsorb and precipitate trace metals at moderate to high ph as was the case in gaya sediments 4 2 5 mapping of ionic activity quantifying the sum of cations and sum of anions is an important method of assessing the balance in the hydrochemical facies present in the water body major cations and anions were depicted thematically on a radial chart fig 5 signifying the eight directions from where samples were taken these directions are n s e w sw nw se and ne a normal water body has complete ionic balance of cations and anions however surface water bodies in a densely populated region may have an unaccounted source of anionic species like organic anions nitrates fluorides and nutrients which may lead to higher ionic balance hem 1985 bisar pond depicts even distribution of cations and anions in all directions implying water being well mixed and having a common source of transfusion fig 5a however it may be noted that se direction reports maximum values 12 14 meq l and least at ne direction irregularities in anthropogenic discharge may be the cause of such disturbance major anions are also evenly distributed overall with the maximum value being reported from nw 7 09 meq l and least at sw 6 68 meq l dighi pond also overall has even distribution of cations and anions in all directions with se indicating the maximum concentrations for cations and anions at 10 19 meq l and 6 12 meq l respectively fig 5b there might be the dissolution of salts or rock water interaction taking place causing a spurt in overall concentration ramsagar pond shows slight variability in the distribution of some of cations and anions with a drastic decrease of cations at sw 4 34 meq l whereas a decrease of anions in opposite directions at ne 1 88 meq l fig 5c suryakund pond witnesses high cationic activity at nw with the value 9 01 meq l fig 5d anionic activity was even at all premises of the pond vaitarni pond showcases variable distribution of anionic and cationic facies indicating different factors or unknown nutrients at different points causing the disturbance fig 5e 4 3 hydrogeochemical classification and process evaluation most of the samples in bisar pond were of na ca mg cl type 62 5 dighi pond is characterized by the presence of hydrochemical facies of na ca cl 50 and na ca mg cl 37 5 water type ramsagar pond mostly includes water type of ca na mg cl 37 5 with two samples including ca na mg cl hco3 type 25 and others belonging to ca na cl na ca k cl hco3 and ca na cl hco3 analysis of suryakund pond reveals the existence of mixed water type comprising na ca mg cl 12 5 ca na mg cl 62 5 and mg na ca cl type of water 12 5 vaitarni pond has an overall presence of na ca mg cl hco3 62 5 type of water similar water type has been reported by bhattacharya et al 2006 the overall water type mostly seen in the surface water of gaya city was na ca mg cl followed by ca na mg cl and ca na mg cl hco3 from piper 1953 trilinear diagram fig 6 it is very much evident that most of the water types have mixed facies especially cations about 80 of total samples fall into a mixed category type where the alkalis dominate but the water character is of alkaline earth type obeidat et al 2013 dighi samples show exclusive dominance of na cl type water overall 70 of samples are mixed cl type whereas 30 fall in the category of mixed cl hco3 type the first category entails the character of highly mineralized water bisar dighi and suryakund and the latter one implies less loaded waters tlili zrelli et al 2013 the presence of mineral species like calcite dolomite and aragonite explain the dominance of carbonate chemistry and frequent rock water interaction and presence of ca mg silicates thilagavathi et al 2012 to further understand the type of processes occurring in the pond waters durov s plot was formulated durov 1948 it is quite similar to piper s diagram but it is a composite diagram that in addition to two ternary plots quantified as milli equivalents of percentages of facies it also includes parameters such as tds and ph the durov s plot fig 7 indicates reverse cation exchange processes as well as simple dissolution or mixing to be mainly responsible for hydrogeochemistry of sampled ponds of gaya ravikumar et al 2015 it is evident from the piper and durov plot that most of the ponds show no cation no anion dominance indicating evolved water type the mixing of processes evolved from reverse cation exchange mixing and dissolution of rocks and clay structure and cation exchange lose their distinctive character and is an amalgamation of reactions arising out of many origins xu et al 2019 however different ponds do show some distinctive behaviour which has a unique profile for the identification of sources bisar and dighi ponds show high salinity content with high tds values the dominant process indicated by their behaviour is of reverse cation exchange type ziani et al 2017 when na concentration in the system is about 50 it triggers sodium ions to move towards ca mg based rocks and minerals and displace them through reverse cation exchange process zaidi et al 2019 it results when highly saline wastewater comes in contact with raw freshwater which might be the case with bisar and dighi with high anthropogenic wastes entering the pond system e g al khatib and al najar 2011 this causes enrichment of ca ions in water but potential for halite dissolution also increases these two ponds have high dominance of na cl ion which might have resulted from halite albite based minerals singh et al 2017 na cl abundance is also marked by enrichment of evaporates like na cl salts and concentration by evaporation obeidat et al 2013 na cl ratio is another way of determining the source and presence of salinity in water the na cl ratio provides information regarding the balance of these ionic species hinting at the type of dissolution occurring kumari et al 2012 in the case of bisar and dighi the ratio is 1 which means it undergoes mixing of saline waste sources and loss of sodium ions through reverse ion exchange process all ponds have ratios of ca mg hco3 much 0 5 which substantiates the evidence that reverse cation exchange process and mixing are dominant processes zaidi et al 2019 quite variable water types were observed from ramsagar pond few samples aligning near reverse exchange process to few deflecting towards direct ion exchange ramsagar and suryakund both show mixing and dissolution as the dominant process with prevalence of ca na mg cl type waters 80 of samples have na cl ratios equal to one suggesting the prevalence of halite dissolution prevalence and predominance ca mg is indicative of high degree rock water interaction and dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of high ph ziani et al 2017 dissolution of calcites dolomites with halites and anthropogenically loaded wastewaters might have evolved such water type vaitarni pond shows no abundance of particular ionic species it is of mixed na cl hco3 evolved from the process of halite and alumina silicate weathering and dissolution reverse cation exchange and mixing of pollutants though na and k based mineral dissolution occurred as evidence suggests the k ion is hard to leach or participate in the process as it has higher tendency to adsorb on clay particles and thus shows low abundance in water zaidi et al 2019 discharge from domestic wastewater has changed the geochemical character of all the ponds of gaya to a large extent evapoconcentration and enrichment of ionic species has led to the profiling of water from being less loaded to highly mineralized systems i e from ca hco3 to na ca cl end member 4 4 factor analysis factor analysis was preceded as per meeting the minimum criteria to carry forward the analysis three factors have been chosen based on eigen values 1 factor loading has been classified as strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and weak 0 5 unmesh et al 2006 82 2 of the variance in data is accounted for from factor 1 2 and 3 cumulatively table 8 factor 1 has the highest role to play in water chemistry of gaya ponds with 56 factor 2 accounts for 26 of the variation and least impact is shown by factor 3 by accounting 16 of the variation factor 1 has strong loadings for ec tds and cations like na and anion like cl sodium and chloride dominance seem to be anthropogenic coming from highly loaded domestic sewage milliot 1970 and dissolution of halite mineral which is found to be undersaturated in pond waters of gaya evapoconcentration and enrichment of evaporates like na cl salt has a huge role to play in evolving the water type of gaya ponds ec and tds imply total soluble solids play a greater role in ionic chemistry pond waters are found to be corrosive in nature the dominant dissolubility activity explains the above phenomenon moderate loading of ca mg and k reveals lithological source playing an important role in deciding the hydrogeochemistry the calcite and dolomite and k type minerals like feldspar mica and ca and mg silicates might be an important source from weathering through rock water interaction as gaya has a strong granite gneiss and limestone based geological character dsr 2018 singh et al 2005 factor 2 has strong implications derived from variables like alkalinity ph and bicarbonates this justifies the dominance of carbonate chemistry in gaya waters which is oversaturated with carbonate minerals so factor1 and factor 2 can be said to have a common area of leaching bodies from where ca and mg silicates and carbonates might be driving the ionic chemistry of pond waters however ph is the main driver of this process which renders the evident alkaline nature to water the third factor which is least important among three is marked by extreme negative loading of sulphates this goes on to explain non implication of sulphates in rock water interaction and that it does not play a major role in the water chemistry even in the other two factors their background concentration can be attributed to anthropogenic sources and domestic application of pond waters it can thus be concluded that majority of factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry are regulated by constituents derived by rock water interaction and dissolution of na rich minerals however wastewater added from anthropogenic activities also have a role in rendering the overall mixed type hydrological character 4 5 source and mechanism of rock water interaction 4 5 1 gibbs ratio gibbs diagrams fig 8 a and b provide some insight into the on going water chemistry mostly water samples of ponds of gaya town exhibit a transitional activity between rock dominance and evaporation dominance visibly in bisar and dighi ponds high concentration of na cl might have resulted from enrichment by evaporates with is suggested here clearly however water chemistry seems to be influenced primarily by the underlying lithology of the pond systems in all cases dissolution of rocks and cation clay structures has an important implication on the hydrological character of the ponds 4 5 2 indices base exchange ibe positive value reflects the exchange of na and k in water with mg and ca in rocks whereas negative value explains the opposite scenario during this mechanism the lithology is the driving factor regulating ionic exchange nagaraju et al 2014 after analyzing pond water bodies of gaya town it was found that all 100 water samples of bisar and dighi ponds have positive values for ion exchange index this shows reverse ion exchange mechanism plays the dominant role in these two water bodies however ramsagar and suryakund yielded negative values for all its samples hinting at disequilibrium causing dissolution and subsequent mixing of facies vaitarni pond exhibited positive values for all samples in case of chl 1 but 50 samples showed negative values in case of chl 2 thus vaitarni pond shows a little variable character where it transitions between reverse ion exchange process and simple dissolution processes 4 5 3 hydrochemical modelling the si values less than zero indicate the water body being undersaturated with respective mineral species the absolute zero figure hints at neutrality with the water body being at equilibrium with the mineral phase the positive values imply oversaturation of the mineral phase which may result in precipitation of the minerals the si indices were calculated for minerals like anhydrite aragonite calcite dolomite gypsum halite and magnesite supplementary table 3 anhydrite mineral seems to be undersaturated for all the five ponds of gaya the sulphate species seem to be deficient in the mineralogy of these ponds but it is evident that minerals like aragonite calcite and dolomite are supersaturated in these water bodies from the study undertaken by dsr 2018 it has been evident that the presence of limestone and calcite type minerals has been a part of gaya s geological structure the dominance and supersaturation of calcium and carbonate minerals like calcite aragonite and dolomite provides evidence about presence of carbonate based rock minerals below the hydrologic barrier strongly the ionic species of these minerals may be leaching out through dissolution and weathering but external deposition through runoffs cannot be negated singh and shashtri 2011 the mineral like halite is under saturated hinting at their constituents coming from other sources too or existing in other forms singh et al 2008 dissolution of silicate minerals like feldspar amphiboles and pyroxenes may also lead to the enrichment of na in water however the weathering rate of minerals like evaporates and carbonates are 80 and 12 times rapid than silicates owing to the lower equilibrium constants of calcite and dolomite they end up precipitating faster in water bodies this is another reason why minerals like calcite and dolomite precipitate faster the magnesite mineral shows transition between under saturation and oversaturation in most pond waters thus contributing to the magnesium presence 4 6 water quality index wqi the calculation of wqi of five ponds of gaya depicts heavy pollution load in the waters table 9 bisar pond s wqi stands at 248 04 it is exceedingly higher than the normal drinking water index value bisar pond s water is not apt for drinking and fishing purposes wqi value of dighi pond is 208 97 which again is not at all fit for drinking purpose supplementary table 1 similar results were also seen for ramsagar 137 33 suryakund 153 7 and vaitarni 177 15 ponds respectively all five ponds have been recommended to be unfit for drinking purposes as the values are much higher than wqi of 50 the decreasing trend for wqi of five ponds studied are bisar dighi vaitarni suryakund ramsagar 4 7 irrigational water quality surface water has often been the source of various big and small purposes including irrigation the studied ponds of gaya town have been suggested to be unfit for drinking purposes to look into the irrigational suitability of these water bodies several indices are suggested which helps in the evaluation of water quality from the perspective of irrigational use table 2 4 7 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar water promotes healthy and sustainable growth of plants if the availability of micronutrients is balanced or in a good proportion sodium adsorption ratio sar is a well accepted parameter for evaluating irrigational water quality as na in proportion with ca and mg governs the extent of soil permeability and clay structure kumar et al 2009 irregularities in soil processes cause a reduction in crop productivity and leads to stunted growth of plants srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 another parameter ec is an important entity which highlights the presence of dissolved solids compositely called salts irrigational water should hold a balanced quantity of dissolved solids as it can indirectly affect plant growth ussl 1954 developed the classification format for alkali hazard and salinity hazard ec after richards 1954 it can be seen fig 9 that water samples of pond bisar dighi and vaitarni fall under c3s1 category whereas ponds ramsagar and suryakund rest under c2s1 category both the classes show that the water is good and suitable for irrigation purposes on most types of crops 4 7 2 percentage sodium percentage sodium na can provide great insight into the suitability of water for irrigational purposes wilcox 1955 the wilcox diagram fig 10 depicts the values of percentage sodium in association with conductivity to present a larger picture on the classification of samples high na indicates the dominance of alkali through ion exchange and rock water dilution processes it is evident that samples of ramsagar and suryakund exhibit excellent properties for irrigational purposes whereas samples of bisar vaitarni and dighi fall in the category of good to permissible fig 10 4 7 3 permeability index permeability of soil is an important factor that decides the infiltration rate and the structure of soil aggregates and therefore affects the growth of plants major cations and anion hco3 have an important influence on the irrigational quality of water and also permeability srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 when there is a lack of important cations the soil water matrix would be replaced by higher hco3 concentration causing toxic reactions with plants doneen 1964 explained the application of the permeability index in deciding the usability of water for irrigational purpose the doneen s chart fig 11 is divided into classes i ii and iii class i and ii stand for good category of water whereas class iii falls under unsuitable category it was noticed that the water samples of all five ponds of gaya town are suitable for irrigational purposes as they fall under class i category 4 7 4 residual sodium carbonate in water bodies if carbonate and bicarbonate are in excess to cations like calcium and magnesium it leads to precipitation of residual calcium and magnesium and deems the water body to be unfit for irrigational purpose richards 1954 prasanna et al 2011 if an opposite scenario occurs rsc values turn out to be zero raju et al 2011 according to richards 1954 classification rsc value 1 25 is suggested to be safe for irrigation range of 1 25 2 5 is of moderate quality and values 2 5 are deemed unsuitable all the water samples of ponds bisar dighi ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni are highly suitable from this aspect as the values are much below 1 25 supplementary table 4 4 7 5 magnesium hazard paliwal 1972 introduced magnesium hazard in irrigational water by computing magnesium ratio any water body having high magnesium content will cause a disruption in plant growth this is due to the water becoming too alkaline in nature srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 the mr values 50 are considered to be suitable for irrigation whereas values 50 are suggested to be unfit for irrigational purposes almost all water samples of the studies five ponds are considered to be suitable for irrigation only 7 5 of samples from bisar pond were found to be unfit for irrigation supplementary table 4 4 7 6 corrosivity ratio corrosivity ratio helps in evaluating the corrosive properties of water bodies on metallic pipes or materials susceptible to corrosion this ratio was first used by ryzner in 1944 the value 1 is considered to be safe whereas values above 1 are supposed to unsafe and need mitigation in case of corrosive water type pvc pipes or corrosivity resistant materials should be used corrosion of hydraulic carriers also leads to further toxicity of water which can be detected by employing this index as expected water of gaya ponds are highly corrosive in nature supplementary table 4 5 conclusions and future recommendations the study on the major ponds of gaya revealed that it is undergoing rapid deterioration due to discharge of heavy domestic and urban wastewater usage of ponds by numerous pilgrims has exacerbated the problem rendering it unfit for drinking purposes however the water is safe to be used for agricultural purposes all ponds water show oversaturation of carbonate minerals like calcite dolomite and aragonite indicating reverse cation exchange process and na enrichment from halite dissolution and evapoconcentration of na cl based salts anthropogenic mixing of wastewater from domestic sewage channels and urban rain water runoffs flowing into the water bodies also alter the geochemical character of water to a great extent ramsagar suryakund and vaitarni ponds show dominance of ca na cl hco3 and na ca cl hco3 water type in addition reverse cation exchange process dissolution of halite and silicate minerals also govern the hydrogeochemical characteristics of ponds water the study also shows that water and sediments are heavily loaded with trace metals particularly co lead pb although present in high concentration in waters is below the acceptable limit in case of sediments however greater pi values of lead in sediments signify it to be a potential threat to the environment owing to its great susceptibility for leaching high pli values 3 for sediments of gaya ponds indicate progressive deterioration of sediment quality thus a clear impact of urbanization and tourism is evident in the pondswater of gaya city urgent management policies and their proper implementation are required to overcome the

11973,this study aims to investigate the sorption behavior of as iii in presence of fluoride ion in an aqueous solution conventionally the as iii is removed by converting it to as v with certain oxidants followed by sorption or precipitation limited information is available for as iii sorption in presence of fluoride ions the present study deals with single step sorption of as iii in the absence and presence of fluoride ion with rare earth metal oxide as adsorbent the nanoparticles of ceo2 were synthesized by a low temperature chemical precipitation method the ceo2 as adsorbent is tested for sorption of as iii and fluoride in a single system the solution ph has a significant role in the sorption of fluoride ion however negligible effect on as iii sorption in the ph range of 4 8 the adsorbent showed the significant uptake capacity for arsenic and fluoride even in binary ion systems as 81 9 f mg g and 3 3 as iii mg g respectively the spent adsorbent is efficiently reused for

occurring contaminants and affecting the quality of groundwater globally and affecting populations in bangladesh india china canada and the united states carrard et al 2020 sudarshan 2019 low concentration of fluoride 1 mg l although beneficial in preventing dental and skeletal problems however excessive intake of fluoride results in several health complications such as skin bone disorders skin cancers and internal cancers chouhan and flora 2010 arsenic predominantly exists as as iii and as v as iii is the dominant form in an anaerobic condition of groundwater and more toxic as compared to as v as iii is more difficult to remove from groundwater than as v due to lack of electrostatic attraction towards most of the solids groundwater is the primary source of potable water and agricultural uses in many developing countries and resulted in over exploitation and simultaneously the drastic degradation of the quality of water the world health organization who has recommended the limit of drinking water as 1 5 mg l and 0 01 mg l for fluoride and arsenic respectively kumar and puri 2012 zhu et al 2006 shankar et al 2014 the information is available for as iii and fluoride toxicity individually however simultaneous treatment of these pollutants is less explored the available processes for defluoridation of water are adsorption ion exchange electrolysis and precipitation paripurnanda et al 2013 various adsorbent materials have been developed for as v but they are not efficient for as iii sorption therefore oxidation of as iii to as v followed by precipitation adsorption membrane filtration etc is common practice for arsenic removal rathore and mondal 2017 recently rare earth metal oxide has gained significant attention in several water treatment

it has the least toxicity towards humans various rem based adsorptive materials has been reported for effective decontamination of water ahmadi et al 2020 literature is available with several adsorbents which were reported for arsenic removal and fluoride removal but very few have been employed for the removal of fluoride and arsenic iii simultaneously cerium oxide has been widely studied for the decontamination of arsenic and fluoride and showed higher sorption affinity deng and yu 2012 ouyang et al 2009 li et al 2012 it has attracted the attention of as iii sorption without oxidation considering the higher affinity of ceo2 for as iii sorption as well as fluoride sorption in a single system we have proposed the synthesis of hydrous ceo2 nanoparticle for removal of fluoride and as

the isoelectric point phiep of adsorbent 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution with varying solution ph from 2 to 10 taken into the conical flask of 250 ml capacity the ph of the solution was adjusted using 0

the equilibrium sorption experiments were carried at room temperature 25 2 c in a 250 ml beaker with the desired concentration of either fluoride or arsenic or both the concentration of arsenic was analyzed with the icp ms method whereas fluoride concentration was analyzed with a fluoride selective electrode connected to an ion meter m s thermo scientific chelmsford model orion versastar the amount of arsenic or fluoride sorbed onto adsorbent at equilibrium was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c i c e v w whereas q e is ion uptake mg g at equilibrium v is the volume l of the sample w is the weight g of adsorbent c i and c e were initial and equilibrium concentration mg l of ion the ion sorbed onto adsorbent at any time for single as well as the binary system is calculated aseq 2 2 q t c i c t v w the sorption efficiency of the arsenic or fluoride was calculated as eq 3 3 sorption efficiency c 0 i c e i c 0 i 100 single component isotherm for the fluoride and arsenic was studied with varying concentrations from 10 to 100 mg l and 1 5 mg l at ph 5 respectively and the adsorbent dose was kept constant at 2 g l the contact time for isotherm studies was kept as 120 min for kinetic studies the time of contact of adsorbent with ions was varied from 15 min to 120 min each sorption experiments were conducted in triplicate with repeatable results the sorption data were studied using langmuir and freundlich for single component isotherm models 2 6 single component isotherm models langmuir isotherm describes the quantitative sorption of ions onto the surface of the adsorbent at equilibrium state it represents the equilibrium distribution of ions at solid and liquid phases the langmuir isotherm is valid for monolayer adsorption of ions onto a surface with an assumption of a finite number of active sites of uniform energies for adsorption langmuir isotherm is written as the following equation 4 qe q m k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir equation can be written into the linear form

constant mg g n adsorption intensity c e the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l q e the amount of metal adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g linearizing the above equation we have 8 log qe log kf log qe log kf 1 n log ce the constant kf is adsorption capacity while 1 n indicates the strength of adsorption in the adsorption process and n is the intensity of adsorption if the value of 1 n is below 1 it is a normal adsorption process if n 1 then the isotherm is linear which means more sorption at a higher concentration of ions on the other hand if 1 n is higher than 1 it is cooperative adsorption however kf and n are parameters characteristic of the sorbent sorbate system and is determined by data fitting the least squares method and the linearly transformed equations have been applied to correlate sorption data with isotherm models 2 7 multicomponent isotherm models equilibrium adsorption in the binary system was studied using a non modified competitive langmuir model modified competitive langmuir model extended langmuir model and extended freundlich model which are briefly described below rathore and mondal 2017 2 8 non modified competitive langmuir model the model equation for the competitive adsorption models for the ith component in a system having n number of components is written as 9 q e i q 0 i k l i c e i 1 j 1 n k l j c e j where and kl can be estimated from the experimental data by the corresponding individual langmuir isotherm equations 2 9 modified competitive langmuir isotherm model this isotherm an additional term η is introduced to show the competitive effect of the adsorbate species present in the solution and is written as 10 q e i q 0 i k l i c e i n i 1 j 1 n k l j c e j n j where q 0 and kl can be estimated from the experimental data by the corresponding individual langmuir isotherm equations and the value of η can be estimated from the competitive adsorption data 2 10 extended langmuir isotherm this model isotherm equation considered that all the active sites of adsorbent are available for both the ions and both the ions have a non interacting effect the equilibrium adsorption reaction of any species can be written as 11 q e i q m k i c e i 1 j 1 n k i c e j where the values of qm and ki can be calculated from the optimized fitting of eq 11 with the experimental data of components in the binary system 2 11 extended freundlich isotherm fritz and schluender purposed the extension of the freundlich model for binary mixtures and can be written as 12 q e 1 k f 1 c e 1 n 1 x 1 c e 1 x 1 y 1 c e 2 z 1 13 q e 2 k f 2 c e 2 n 2 x 2 c e 2 x 2 y 1 c e 2 z 2 where kf 1 kf 2 n1 and n2 can be estimated from corresponding individual freundlichisotherm equations while x 1 y1 z1 x2 y2 and z2 can be estimated by fitting eqs 12 and 13 for the binary system the accuracy of data fitted for binary adsorption isotherms models was tested by calculating marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd formula using ms excel 2007 the mpsd error function was calculated from eq 14 14 m p s d 100 1 n m n p i 1 n i 1 n q e i e x p i 1 n q e i c a l i 1 n q e i c a l 2 where exp and cal in the subscript denote the experimental and calculated values of specific uptake of the i th component and nm and np are a number of readings and number of parameters in the model respectively 3 kinetic models 3 1 pseudo first order model pseudo first order rate equation or linearized lagergren equation can be written as 15 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts of arsenic or fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively mg g k1 is the rate constant for pseudo first order adsorption 1 sec 3 2 pseudo second order model the linear form of the pseudo second order kinetic model can be represented as 16 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant for pseudo second order adsorption g mg min webber and morris model webber and morris model is used to investigate the intraparticle diffusion and uptake of the adsorbate according to weber and morris s model the transient uptake of the ions varies almost proportionately with the half power of time t1 2 for most adsorption processes the relationship between qt and t1 2 is written as 17 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g sec1 2 and c mg g is a constant that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer i e boundary layer effect is higher for the higher value of c the pore and film diffusion constants were calculated from the following equations 18 t 1 2 0 03 r 2 d p 19 t 1 2 0 23 r δ d f c a d c e where t1 2 is the time required to bring down the concentration of the ions to half of its initial concentration r is the radius of the adsorbent particle cm d is the thickness of water film adhered to the adsorbent particle cm dp and df are the pore and film diffusion coefficients respectively cm2 sec cad mg g and ce mg l are the concentration of the adsorbate arsenic or fluoride on the adsorbent and in the solution at equilibrium respectively the value of t1 2 was calculated as follows 20 t 1 2 l n 0 5 k 1 assuming the value of δ to be 0 001 cm the value of dp and df were calculated from eqs 18 and 19 by putting the value of t1 2 obtained from eq 20 4 desorption and regenerative studies to desorb the ions from the spent adsorbent it was treated with definite strength of naoh and the leached solution was analyzed for arsenic or fluoride concentration for reactivating the adsorbent it was treated with 0 1 m of hydrochloride and dried at 105 c for reuse 5 results and discussion 5 1 characteristics of adsorbent the surface areas of the adsorbent dried at 60 100 and 200 c were 71 789 m2 g 73 50 m2 g and 131 957 m2 g respectively the sem image of the virgin and spent adsorbents is shown in fig 1 and the elemental composition of the virgin and spent adsorbent reported in table 1 the adsorbent particles were granular in shape and fluoride sorbed adsorbent showed some agglomerates on the spent adsorbent surface while arsenic iii treatment made the adsorbent surface rough edx study confirmed the presence of cerium in the virgin adsorbent and fluoride and arsenic along with ceo2 in the spent adsorbent the xrd pattern of the adsorbent calcined at different temperatures is shown in fig 2 the adsorbent dried at less than 200 c was poorly crystalline or amorphous the peaks got narrower at a temperature range of 400 600 c may be due to the crystallization the presence of ceo2 can be anticipated by peaks at 28 33 47 and 56 which corresponds to the 111 200 220 and 311 lawrence et al 2011 planes respectively it was also observed that heating of ceo2 above 200 c resulted in the loss of its property of fluoride and as iii sorption ceo2 dried at a lower temperature 60 c showed higher sorption capacity as compared to drying at 100 c hydrous ceo2 has better sorption for fluoride and arsenic deng and yu 2012 li et al 2012 ftir spectra of virgin and spent adsorbents are shown in fig 3 the broad absorption band at 3435 cm 1 associated with o h stretching vibrations of the residual water and a hydroxyl group the narrow peak at 1400 cm 1 assigned to c o stretching the peak at 2924 2424 cm 1 corresponds to the c h vibrations the peaks at 1635 cm 1 represent the o h vibration in adsorbed water the band located at 1350 1400 cm 1 can be associated with cerium the peaks at 1095 and 670 cm 1 can be assigned to ce o stretching vibrations the changes in the absorption band after fluoride and arsenic treatment was observed the absorbance band at 670 and 1600 cm 1 disappeared due to fluoride sorption while in the case of arsenic sorption the absorbance band at 1400 cm 1 is disappeared and no peak was observed at 874 cm 1 for as iii gomes et al 2007 the tg dta curve of the synthesized cerium dioxide adsorbent is shown in fig 4 there is a weight loss of up to 8 13 indicating the conversion of cerium hydroxide to cerium dioxide the curve shows a multi stage decomposition process the first stage up to 120 c is the loss of free water the second stage from 350 to 500 c maybe because of the crystallization of the cerium dioxide particles after 550 c the curve is almost a straight line indicates that the total mass loss has occurred within 550 c from the dta curve we can conclude that the overall reaction is exothermic 5 2 sportive removal of arsenic iii and fluoride in single ion system 5 2 1 effect of solution ph solution ph has a significant role in the adsorption process of chemistry fig 6 shows the fluoride and arsenic removal efficiency as a function of solution ph it was observed that the fluoride adsorption was maximum at ph 2 and decreases with a rise in solution ph while in the case of arsenic sorption significant removal was achieved in the wide ph range from 3 to 8 the uptake of fluoride was 8 67 mg g at ph 2 and decreased to 1 9 mg g at ph 6 in the case of arsenic sorption the uptake was 3 3 mg g in the ph range from 3 to 8 the isoelectric point phiep for the adsorbent was 6 7 fig 5 at ph less than 6 7 the adsorbent got a positive charge and attracts fluoride ions at higher ph the adsorbent was negatively charged and repel the fluoride ions at higher solution ph the hydroxyl ions compete with the fluoride ions for the available binding sites hf is predominant in the ph range 1 3 5 and its availability decrease with a rise in ph whereas f ions species increase with a further rise in ph and is predominant above ph 5 hence fluoride removal efficiency decreased with an increase in solution ph above phiep in the case of as iii h3aso3 is predominant in the ph range 3 8 while at ph 9 and above some of h3aso3 is converted to h2aso3 hence ph has a negligible effect on sorption performance in ph range 3 8 5 2 2 kinetic studies in single component system the performance of fluoride sorption as a function of time was analyzed in the range of 0 2 h fig 7 it was observed that 90 removal was achieved in the first 10 min and reached equilibrium after 10 min the adsorption rate became almost constant initially all the binding sites of adsorbent were available for the fluoride ions after saturation of binding sites the rate of adsorption was constant due to a lower concentration of ions in the solution in the case of arsenic 80 sorption was achieved in the first 5 min and then reached equilibrium within 20 min initially all the active sites were available for arsenic hence sorption rate is higher and then decreased with time the evaluation of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models for adsorption rate constants as well as experimental and calculated values of qe are given in table 2 the values of r2 table 2 are closer to unity for the pseudo second order kinetic model for both arsenic and fluoride as compared to those for the pseudo first order kinetic model this indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable to explain the adsorption process to get the details of intraparticle diffusion qt vs t1 2 plots have been developed as shown in fig 8 a and b for arsenic and fluoride respectively from these figures each plot can be considered as two linear parts p1 and p2 as the adsorption phenomena take place in more than one step it may be concluded that intraparticle diffusion does not solely control the adsorption of arsenic and fluoride the portion p1 is linear as most of the active sites of adsorbent are available for adsorption in the initial stage the p1 region of ion sorption is also attributed to boundary layer diffusion and external mass transfer effects the values of pore diffusion coefficient dp are obtained as 1 62 10 15 cm2 s and 1 78 10 15 cm2 s for arsenic and fluoride respectively the film diffusion coefficient df is obtained as 2 51 10 12 cm2 s for arsenic and 2 19 10 12 cm2 s for fluoride the pore diffusion may be the rate limiting step if the value of dp lies between 10 11 and 10 13 and for film diffusion to be the rate limiting step the df value should lie between 10 6 and 10 8 for anions the value of obtained dp suggest the pore diffusion is the rate limiting step for the adsorption of both the two ions table 3 5 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the variation in adsorbent dose has a significant effect on the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic fig 9 the removal efficiency of fluoride was 80 with adsorbent of 1 g l and increased to 95 with an increase in dose to 3 g l further increasing the dose has a negligible effect on sorption performance the fluoride uptake capacity was 160 mg g for 1 g l adsorbent dose and decreased to 30 mg g for 5 g l adsorbent dose it was observed that uptake capacity was decreased with increased adsorbent dose in the case of arsenic the removal efficiency was 90 with an adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l and increased 99 removal efficiency with 0 3 g l adsorbent dose further increasing adsorbent dose has a negligible effect on removal efficiency arsenic uptake was decreased from 4 5 mg g to 0 5 mg g with an increase in adsorbent dose from 0 1 g l to 2 g l 5 2 4 effect of calcination the thermal treatment to adsorbent has significant on the crystallinity of adsorbent as well as sorption performance fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic with the dried and calcined adsorbent it was observed that adsorbent dried at 100 c has about 99 removal efficiency for both fluoride and arsenic the adsorbent calcined at 200 c showed lower removal efficiency for both the ions this was because of the crystallization of ceria with an increase in calcination temperature as evident from xrd spectra and adsorption was higher at its amorphous state the higher calcination temperature may degrade functional groups of adsorbent and reduce the active sites for ion binding such as the hydroxyl group hence sorption efficiency was reduced due to less availability of the binding sites 5 2 5 effect of initial ion concentration fig 11 shows the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic with varying the initial concentration and keeping the adsorbent dose constant it was observed that fluoride removal efficiency decreased from 95 to 80 with an increase in fluoride concentration from 10 mg l to 100 mg l while fluoride uptake was increased from 9 5 mg g to 82 mg g this phenomenon was may be due to a higher affinity of fluoride towards the adsorbent or driving force of the concentration gradient in the case of arsenic the removal efficiency was constant as 99 even with an increase in initial arsenic concentration from 0 05 mg l to 3 mg l but uptake was increased 0 05 mg g to 2 9 mg g further increasing the initial arsenic concentration from 4 mg l to 10 mg l the removal efficiency was decreased to 80 and uptake was increased to 8 7 mg g from the above analysis it may conclude that an adsorbent dose of 2 g l is enough to treat 10 mg l fluoride with a removal efficiency of about 95 and adsorbent of 1 g l is enough to treat 2 mg l arsenic with removal efficiency 5 2 6 equilibrium studies the equilibrium sorption data has been used to predict the relationship between adsorbate and sorption capacity the two most isotherm model i e langmuir and freundlich isotherm model were selected and experimental data were fitted the equilibrium sorption constant for models were fitted and reported in table 4 the separation factor rl associated with langmuir is in the range of 6 75 10 4 to 0 118 and 0 037171 to 0 278 for arsenic and fluoride respectively the value of rl for both the ions is in the range 0 rl 1 and the adsorption process is favorable in binary ions mixture the initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l and arsenic concentration up to 5 mg l have a negligible effect on the removal efficiency of arsenic and fluoride with 2 g l of the adsorbent increasing the initial fluoride concentration to 20 mg l the fluoride removal efficiency decreased to 91 5 91 and 90 from 96 5 in presence of arsenic concentration 1 3 and 5 mg l respectively in the case of initial fluoride concentration of 30 mg l in presence of 5 mg l arsenic concentration the fluoride removal efficiency decreased to 81 and arsenic removal efficiency was reduced to 86 the fitted values of binary adsorption models are given in table 3 the non modified competitive langmuir model has the highest values for mpsd which indicates that it poorly characterizes the competitive effects of the ions in the binary solution similarly the modified competitive langmuir model also fails to properly represent the adsorption in the binary system due to high values of mpsd for arsenic and fluoride respectively however for the extended langmuir model the lowest values of mpsd for both arsenic and fluoride are obtained it was observed that the binding constant for arsenic was higher as compared to fluoride and maximum uptake was similar to the langmuir model 5 2 7 mechanism of fluoride and as iii sorption the adsorption mechanism for fluoride and arsenic involved electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange of oh of the adsorbent the characterization of adsorbent showed the presence of oh at its surface the protonation and deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl group oh can be written as follows 21 o c e o h h 2 o o c e o h 2 o h ph phiep 22 o c e o h o c e o h ph phiep 23 o c e o h x x f o c e f x x o h 24 o c e o h x x h 2 a s o 3 o c e h 2 a s o 3 x x o h therefore ceo2 as adsorbent could adsorb the fluoride by the electrostatic interaction which revealed the mechanism of the fluoride adsorption also included the electrostatic interaction the equilibrium reactions and constants of arsenite are shown as following 25 h 3 a s o 3 h 2 a s o 3 h p k a 3 9 2 26 h 2 a s o 2 h a s o 3 2 h p k a 4 12 7 27 h a s o 3 2 a s o 3 3 h p k a 5 13 4 in addition to the above reactions the ph of the aqueous solution also changes the surface charges of the adsorbent the rate of arsenite removal depends on ph h3aso3 is dominant in the studied ph range and responsible for sorption for ph 3 6 5 the adsorbent was positively charged and the oh functional group may attract towards the surface the speciation of fluoride and as iii is shown in fig 12 the fluoride ion and h3aso3 is dominant at ph 4 8 and the sorption of both the ions were observed to further investigate the role of surface hydroxyl group the spent adsorbent was characterized with xps and results are shown in fig 13 the binding energy of 531 ev and 528 ev corresponds to hydrohyl group and oxygen species respectively the binding energy of 881 ev 884 ev and 898 ev corresponds to 3d5 2 of ceo2 the binding energy of 43 ev and 50 ev may corresponds to 3 d of as2o3 which suggest arsenic was in trivalent form on the ceo2 the binding energy of 6884 ev and 688 ev corresponds to 1s of fluoride the xps spectra confirmed the adsorption of fluoride and as iii simultaneously the results of defluoridation and as iii sorption experiments are presented in table 4 it was observed that during simultaneous sorption experiments the as iii and fluoride the sorption efficiency of both the ions were decreased it was due to the competitive sorption of the ions at the functional sites similar studies on simulations sorption of arsenic and fluoride are compared with the present study and presented in table 5 5 3 desorption and regeneration studies the regeneration or reusability of adsorbent is an important parameter for the water treatment process fig 14 shows that fluoride and arsenic removal efficiency with the regenerated adsorbent the effective activation of the regenerated adsorbent was achieved by 0 1 m of hydrochloric acid rather than 0 1 m of nitric acid it was also observed that there was no leaching of cerium during the adsorption process the virgin adsorbent has higher removal efficiency for both fluoride and arsenic the regenerated adsorbent has shown a decrease in removal efficiency after the first regeneration cycle the fluoride removal efficiency was reduced to 80 and arsenic removal efficiency was still 99 similar to virgin adsorbent after the second regeneration cycle removal efficiency of both fluoride and arsenic was decreased after the third regeneration cycle the fluoride removal efficiency was decreased to 69 while arsenic removal efficiency was reduced to 59 the decrease in removal efficiency was due to the inactivation or degradation of active sites of the adsorbent during regeneration there is very limited information is available regarding the toxicity of cerium cerium dioxide has the least solubility and may be used for water treatment for drinking water 6 conclusion the ceo2 as adsorptive material is efficient in the removal of as iii without oxidation and fluoride in a single ion system as well as a binary ion system the maximum fluoride uptake of 81 96 mg g at ph 2 while maximum as iii uptake is 3 39 mg g at a wide ph range 3 8 is observed in a single ion system langmuir isotherm is best fitted for both the ions both the ions follow pseudo second order kinetics for adsorption in a binary system the extended langmuir model is best fitted for as iii and fluoride the adsorbent may be regenerated and reused several times for as iii and fluoride the

11973,this study aims to investigate the sorption behavior of as iii in presence of fluoride ion in an aqueous solution conventionally the as iii is removed by converting it to as v with certain oxidants followed by sorption or precipitation limited information is available for as iii sorption in presence of fluoride ions the present study deals with single step sorption of as iii in the absence and presence of fluoride ion with rare earth metal oxide as adsorbent the nanoparticles of ceo2 were synthesized by a low temperature chemical precipitation method the ceo2 as adsorbent is tested for sorption of as iii and fluoride in a single system the solution ph has a significant role in the sorption of fluoride ion however negligible effect on as iii sorption in the ph range of 4 8

ion sorption after regeneration and activation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride as iii ceo2 langmuir sorption kinetic 1 introduction fluoride and arsenic are the most common naturally occurring contaminants and affecting the quality of groundwater globally and affecting populations in bangladesh india china canada and the united states carrard et al 2020 sudarshan 2019 low concentration of fluoride 1 mg l although beneficial in preventing dental and skeletal problems however excessive intake of fluoride results in several health complications such as skin bone disorders skin cancers and internal cancers chouhan and flora 2010 arsenic predominantly exists as as iii and as v as iii is the dominant form in an anaerobic condition of groundwater and more toxic as compared to as v as iii is more difficult to remove from groundwater than as v due to lack of electrostatic attraction towards most of the solids groundwater is the primary source of potable water and agricultural uses in many developing countries and resulted in over exploitation and simultaneously the drastic degradation of the quality of water the world health organization who has recommended the limit of drinking water as 1 5 mg l and 0 01 mg l for fluoride and arsenic respectively kumar and puri 2012 zhu et al 2006 shankar et al 2014 the information is available for as iii and fluoride toxicity individually however simultaneous treatment of these pollutants is less explored the available processes for defluoridation of water are adsorption ion exchange electrolysis and precipitation paripurnanda et al 2013 various adsorbent materials have been developed for as v but they are not efficient for as iii sorption therefore oxidation of as iii to as v followed by precipitation adsorption membrane filtration etc is common practice for arsenic removal rathore and mondal 2017 recently rare earth metal oxide has gained significant attention in several water treatment

it has the least toxicity towards humans various rem based adsorptive materials has been reported for effective decontamination of water ahmadi et al 2020 literature is available with several adsorbents which were reported for arsenic removal and fluoride removal but very few have been employed for the removal of fluoride and arsenic iii simultaneously cerium oxide has been widely studied for the decontamination of arsenic and fluoride and showed higher sorption affinity deng and yu 2012 ouyang et al 2009 li et al 2012 it has attracted the attention of as iii sorption without oxidation considering the higher affinity of ceo2 for as iii sorption as well as fluoride sorption in a single system we have proposed the synthesis of hydrous ceo2 nanoparticle for removal of fluoride and as

the isoelectric point phiep of adsorbent 50 ml of 0 01 m nacl solution with varying solution ph from 2 to 10 taken into the conical flask of 250 ml capacity the ph of the solution was adjusted using 0

the equilibrium sorption experiments were carried at room temperature 25 2 c in a 250 ml beaker with the desired concentration of either fluoride or arsenic or both the concentration of arsenic was analyzed with the icp ms method whereas fluoride concentration was analyzed with a fluoride selective electrode connected to an ion meter m s thermo scientific chelmsford model orion versastar the amount of arsenic or fluoride sorbed onto adsorbent at equilibrium was calculated using eq 1 1 q e c i c e v w whereas q e is ion uptake mg g at equilibrium v is the volume l of the sample w is the

i c t v w the sorption efficiency of the arsenic or fluoride was calculated as eq 3 3 sorption efficiency c 0 i c e i c 0 i 100 single component isotherm for the fluoride and arsenic was studied with varying concentrations from 10 to 100 mg l and 1 5 mg l at ph 5 respectively and the adsorbent dose was kept constant at 2 g l the contact time for isotherm studies was kept as 120 min for kinetic studies the time of contact of adsorbent with ions was varied from 15 min to 120 min each sorption experiments were conducted in triplicate with repeatable results the sorption data were studied using langmuir and freundlich for single component isotherm models 2 6 single component isotherm models langmuir isotherm describes the quantitative sorption of ions onto the surface of the adsorbent at equilibrium state it represents the equilibrium distribution of ions at solid and liquid phases the langmuir isotherm is valid for monolayer adsorption of ions onto a surface with an assumption of a finite number of active sites of uniform energies for adsorption langmuir isotherm is written as the following equation 4 qe q m k l c e 1 k l c e langmuir equation can be written into the linear form

constant mg g n adsorption intensity c e the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l q e the amount of metal adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent at equilibrium mg g linearizing the above equation we have 8 log qe log kf log qe log kf 1 n log ce the constant kf is adsorption capacity while 1 n indicates the strength of adsorption in the adsorption process and n is the intensity of adsorption if the value of 1 n is below 1 it is a normal adsorption process if n 1 then the isotherm is linear which means more sorption at a higher concentration of ions on the other hand if 1 n is higher than 1 it is cooperative adsorption however kf and n are parameters characteristic of the sorbent sorbate system and is determined by data fitting the least squares method and the linearly transformed equations have been applied to correlate sorption data with isotherm models 2 7 multicomponent isotherm models equilibrium adsorption in the binary system was studied using a non modified competitive langmuir model modified competitive langmuir model extended langmuir model and extended freundlich model which are briefly described below rathore and mondal 2017 2 8 non modified competitive langmuir model the model equation for the competitive adsorption models for the ith component in a system having n number of components is written as 9 q e i q 0 i k l i c e i 1 j 1 n k l j c e j where and kl can be estimated from the experimental data by the corresponding individual langmuir isotherm equations 2 9 modified competitive langmuir isotherm model this isotherm an additional term η is introduced to show the competitive effect of the adsorbate species present in the solution and is written as 10 q e i q 0 i k l i c e i n i 1 j 1 n k l j c e j n j where q 0 and kl can be estimated from the experimental data by the corresponding individual langmuir isotherm equations and the value of η can be estimated from the competitive adsorption data 2 10 extended langmuir isotherm this model isotherm equation considered that all the active sites of adsorbent are available for both the ions and both the ions have a non interacting effect the equilibrium adsorption reaction of any species can be written as 11 q e i q m k i c e i 1 j 1 n k i c e j where the values of qm and ki can be calculated from the optimized fitting of eq 11 with the experimental data of components in the binary system 2 11 extended freundlich isotherm fritz and schluender purposed the extension of the freundlich model for binary mixtures and can be written as 12 q e 1 k f 1 c e 1 n 1 x 1 c e 1 x 1 y 1 c e 2 z 1 13 q e 2 k f 2 c e 2 n 2 x 2 c e 2 x 2 y 1 c e 2 z 2 where kf 1 kf 2 n1 and n2 can be estimated from corresponding individual freundlichisotherm equations while x 1 y1 z1 x2 y2 and z2 can be estimated by fitting eqs 12 and 13 for the binary system the accuracy of data fitted for binary adsorption isotherms models was tested by calculating marquardt s percent standard deviation mpsd formula using ms excel 2007 the mpsd error function was calculated from eq 14 14 m p s d 100 1 n m n p i 1 n i 1 n q e i e x p i 1 n q e i c a l i 1 n q e i c a l 2 where exp and cal in the subscript denote the experimental and calculated values of specific uptake of the i th component and nm and np are a number of readings and number of parameters in the model respectively 3 kinetic models 3 1 pseudo first order model pseudo first order rate equation or linearized lagergren equation can be written as 15 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts of arsenic or fluoride adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively mg g k1 is the rate constant for pseudo first order adsorption 1 sec 3 2 pseudo second order model the linear form of the pseudo second order kinetic model can be represented as 16 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the rate constant for pseudo second order adsorption g mg min webber and morris model webber and morris model is used to investigate the intraparticle diffusion and uptake of the adsorbate according to weber and morris s model the transient uptake of the ions varies almost proportionately with the half power of time t1 2 for most adsorption processes the relationship between qt and t1 2 is written as 17 q t k i d t 1 2 c where kid is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g sec1 2 and c mg g is a constant that gives an idea about the thickness of the boundary layer i e boundary layer effect is higher for the higher value of c the pore and film diffusion constants were calculated from the following equations 18 t 1 2 0 03 r 2 d p 19 t 1 2 0 23 r δ d f c a d c e where t1 2 is the time required to bring down the concentration of the ions to half of its initial concentration r is the radius of the adsorbent particle cm d is the thickness of water film adhered to the adsorbent particle cm dp and df are the pore and film diffusion coefficients respectively cm2 sec cad mg g and ce mg l are the concentration of the adsorbate arsenic or fluoride on the adsorbent and in the solution at equilibrium respectively the value of t1 2 was calculated as follows 20 t 1 2 l n 0 5 k 1 assuming the value of δ to be 0 001 cm the value of dp and df were calculated from eqs 18 and 19 by putting the value of t1 2 obtained from eq 20 4 desorption and regenerative studies to desorb the ions from the spent adsorbent it was treated with definite strength of naoh and the leached solution was analyzed for arsenic or fluoride concentration for reactivating the adsorbent it was treated with 0 1 m of hydrochloride and dried at 105 c for reuse 5 results and discussion 5 1 characteristics of adsorbent the surface areas of the adsorbent dried at 60 100 and 200 c were 71 789 m2 g 73 50 m2 g and 131 957 m2 g respectively the sem image of the virgin and spent adsorbents is shown in fig 1 and the elemental composition of the virgin and spent adsorbent reported in table 1 the adsorbent particles were granular in shape and fluoride sorbed adsorbent showed some agglomerates on the spent adsorbent surface while arsenic iii treatment made the adsorbent surface rough edx study confirmed the presence of cerium in the virgin adsorbent and fluoride and arsenic along with ceo2 in the spent adsorbent the xrd pattern of the adsorbent calcined at different temperatures is shown in fig 2 the adsorbent dried at less than 200 c was poorly crystalline or amorphous the peaks got narrower at a temperature range of 400 600 c may be due to the crystallization the presence of ceo2 can be anticipated by peaks at 28 33 47 and 56 which corresponds to the 111 200 220 and 311 lawrence et al 2011 planes respectively it was also observed that heating of ceo2 above 200 c resulted in the loss of its property of fluoride and as iii sorption ceo2 dried at a lower temperature 60 c showed higher sorption capacity as compared to drying at 100 c hydrous ceo2 has better sorption for fluoride and arsenic deng and yu 2012 li et al 2012 ftir spectra of virgin and spent adsorbents are shown in fig 3 the broad absorption band at 3435 cm 1 associated with o h stretching vibrations of the residual water and a hydroxyl group the narrow peak at 1400 cm 1 assigned to c o stretching the peak at 2924 2424 cm 1 corresponds to the c h vibrations the peaks at 1635 cm 1 represent the o h vibration in adsorbed water the band located at 1350 1400 cm 1 can be associated with cerium the peaks at 1095 and 670 cm 1 can be assigned to ce o stretching vibrations the changes in the absorption band after fluoride and arsenic treatment was observed the absorbance band at 670 and 1600 cm 1 disappeared due to fluoride sorption while in the case of arsenic sorption the absorbance band at 1400 cm 1 is disappeared and no peak was observed at 874 cm 1 for as iii gomes et al 2007 the tg dta curve of the synthesized cerium dioxide adsorbent is shown in fig 4 there is a weight loss of up to 8 13 indicating the conversion of cerium hydroxide to cerium dioxide the curve shows a multi stage decomposition process the first stage up to 120 c is the loss of free water the second stage from 350 to 500 c maybe because of the crystallization of the cerium dioxide particles after 550 c the curve is almost a straight line indicates that the total mass loss has occurred within 550 c from the dta curve we can conclude that the overall reaction is exothermic 5 2 sportive removal of arsenic iii and fluoride in single ion system 5 2 1 effect of solution ph solution ph has a significant role in the adsorption process of chemistry fig 6 shows the fluoride and arsenic removal efficiency as a function of solution ph it was observed that the fluoride adsorption was maximum at ph 2 and decreases with a rise in solution ph while in the case of arsenic sorption significant removal was achieved in the wide ph range from 3 to 8 the uptake of fluoride was 8 67 mg g at ph 2 and decreased to 1 9 mg g at ph 6 in the case of arsenic sorption the uptake was 3 3 mg g in the ph range from 3 to 8 the isoelectric point phiep for the adsorbent was 6 7 fig 5 at ph less than 6 7 the adsorbent got a positive charge and attracts fluoride ions at higher ph the adsorbent was negatively charged and repel the fluoride ions at higher solution ph the hydroxyl ions compete with the fluoride ions for the available binding sites hf is predominant in the ph range 1 3 5 and its availability decrease with a rise in ph whereas f ions species increase with a further rise in ph and is predominant above ph 5 hence fluoride removal efficiency decreased with an increase in solution ph above phiep in the case of as iii h3aso3 is predominant in the ph range 3 8 while at ph 9 and above some of h3aso3 is converted to h2aso3 hence ph has a negligible effect on sorption performance in ph range 3 8 5 2 2 kinetic studies in single component system the performance of fluoride sorption as a function of time was analyzed in the range of 0 2 h fig 7 it was observed that 90 removal was achieved in the first 10 min and reached equilibrium after 10 min the adsorption rate became almost constant initially all the binding sites of adsorbent were available for the fluoride ions after saturation of binding sites the rate of adsorption was constant due to a lower concentration of ions in the solution in the case of arsenic 80 sorption was achieved in the first 5 min and then reached equilibrium within 20 min initially all the active sites were available for arsenic hence sorption rate is higher and then decreased with time the evaluation of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models for adsorption rate constants as well as experimental and calculated values of qe are given in table 2 the values of r2 table 2 are closer to unity for the pseudo second order kinetic model for both arsenic and fluoride as compared to those for the pseudo first order kinetic model this indicates that the pseudo second order kinetic model is more suitable to explain the adsorption process to get the details of intraparticle diffusion qt vs t1 2 plots have been developed as shown in fig 8 a and b for arsenic and fluoride respectively from these figures each plot can be considered as two linear parts p1 and p2 as the adsorption phenomena take place in more than one step it may be concluded that intraparticle diffusion does not solely control the adsorption of arsenic and fluoride the portion p1 is linear as most of the active sites of adsorbent are available for adsorption in the initial stage the p1 region of ion sorption is also attributed to boundary layer diffusion and external mass transfer effects the values of pore diffusion coefficient dp are obtained as 1 62 10 15 cm2 s and 1 78 10 15 cm2 s for arsenic and fluoride respectively the film diffusion coefficient df is obtained as 2 51 10 12 cm2 s for arsenic and 2 19 10 12 cm2 s for fluoride the pore diffusion may be the rate limiting step if the value of dp lies between 10 11 and 10 13 and for film diffusion to be the rate limiting step the df value should lie between 10 6 and 10 8 for anions the value of obtained dp suggest the pore diffusion is the rate limiting step for the adsorption of both the two ions table 3 5 2 3 effect of adsorbent dosage the variation in adsorbent dose has a significant effect on the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic fig 9 the removal efficiency of fluoride was 80 with adsorbent of 1 g l and increased to 95 with an increase in dose to 3 g l further increasing the dose has a negligible effect on sorption performance the fluoride uptake capacity was 160 mg g for 1 g l adsorbent dose and decreased to 30 mg g for 5 g l adsorbent dose it was observed that uptake capacity was decreased with increased adsorbent dose in the case of arsenic the removal efficiency was 90 with an adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l and increased 99 removal efficiency with 0 3 g l adsorbent dose further increasing adsorbent dose has a negligible effect on removal efficiency arsenic uptake was decreased from 4 5 mg g to 0 5 mg g with an increase in adsorbent dose from 0 1 g l to 2 g l 5 2 4 effect of calcination the thermal treatment to adsorbent has significant on the crystallinity of adsorbent as well as sorption performance fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic with the dried and calcined adsorbent it was observed that adsorbent dried at 100 c has about 99 removal efficiency for both fluoride and arsenic the adsorbent calcined at 200 c showed lower removal efficiency for both the ions this was because of the crystallization of ceria with an increase in calcination temperature as evident from xrd spectra and adsorption was higher at its amorphous state the higher calcination temperature may degrade functional groups of adsorbent and reduce the active sites for ion binding such as the hydroxyl group hence sorption efficiency was reduced due to less availability of the binding sites 5 2 5 effect of initial ion concentration fig 11 shows the removal efficiency of fluoride and arsenic with varying the initial concentration and keeping the adsorbent dose constant it was observed that fluoride removal efficiency decreased from 95 to 80 with an increase in fluoride concentration from 10 mg l to 100 mg l while fluoride uptake was increased from 9 5 mg g to 82 mg g this phenomenon was may be due to a higher affinity of fluoride towards the adsorbent or driving force of the concentration gradient in the case of arsenic the removal efficiency was constant as 99 even with an increase in initial arsenic concentration from 0 05 mg l to 3 mg l but uptake was increased 0 05 mg g to 2 9 mg g further increasing the initial arsenic concentration from 4 mg l to 10 mg l the removal efficiency was decreased to 80 and uptake was increased to 8 7 mg g from the above analysis it may conclude that an adsorbent dose of 2 g l is enough to treat 10 mg l fluoride with a removal efficiency of about 95 and adsorbent of 1 g l is enough to treat 2 mg l arsenic with removal efficiency 5 2 6 equilibrium studies the equilibrium sorption data has been used to predict the relationship between adsorbate and sorption capacity the two most isotherm model i e langmuir and freundlich isotherm model were selected and experimental data were fitted the equilibrium sorption constant for models were fitted and reported in table 4 the separation factor rl associated with langmuir is in the range of 6 75 10 4 to 0 118 and 0 037171 to 0 278 for arsenic and fluoride respectively the value of rl for both the ions is in the range 0 rl 1 and the adsorption process is favorable in binary ions mixture the initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l and arsenic concentration up to 5 mg l have a negligible effect on the removal efficiency of arsenic and fluoride with 2 g l of the adsorbent increasing the initial fluoride concentration to 20 mg l the fluoride removal efficiency decreased to 91 5 91 and 90 from 96 5 in presence of arsenic concentration 1 3 and 5 mg l respectively in the case of initial fluoride concentration of 30 mg l in presence of 5 mg l arsenic concentration the fluoride removal efficiency decreased to 81 and arsenic removal efficiency was reduced to 86 the fitted values of binary adsorption models are given in table 3 the non modified competitive langmuir model has the highest values for mpsd which indicates that it poorly characterizes the competitive effects of the ions in the binary solution similarly the modified competitive langmuir model also fails to properly represent the adsorption in the binary system due to high values of mpsd for arsenic and fluoride respectively however for the extended langmuir model the lowest values of mpsd for both arsenic and fluoride are obtained it was observed that the binding constant for arsenic was higher as compared to fluoride and maximum uptake was similar to the langmuir model 5 2 7 mechanism of fluoride and as iii sorption the adsorption mechanism for fluoride and arsenic involved electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange of oh of the adsorbent the characterization of adsorbent showed the presence of oh at its surface the protonation and deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl group oh can be written as follows 21 o c e o h h 2 o o c e o h 2 o h ph phiep 22 o c e o h o c e o h ph phiep 23 o c e o h x x f o c e f x x o h 24 o c e o h x x h 2 a s o 3 o c e h 2 a s o 3 x x o h therefore ceo2 as adsorbent could adsorb the fluoride by the electrostatic interaction which revealed the mechanism of the fluoride adsorption also included the electrostatic interaction the equilibrium reactions and constants of arsenite are shown as following 25 h 3 a s o 3 h 2 a s o 3 h p k a 3 9 2 26 h 2 a s o 2 h a s o 3 2 h p k a 4 12 7 27 h a s o 3 2 a s o 3 3 h p k a 5 13 4 in addition to the above reactions the ph of the aqueous solution also changes the surface charges of the adsorbent the rate of arsenite removal depends on ph h3aso3 is dominant in the studied ph range and responsible for sorption for ph 3 6 5 the adsorbent was positively charged and the oh functional group may attract towards the surface the speciation of fluoride and as iii is shown in fig 12 the fluoride ion and h3aso3 is dominant at ph 4 8 and the sorption of both the ions were observed to further investigate the role of surface hydroxyl group the spent adsorbent was characterized with xps and results are shown in fig 13 the binding energy of 531 ev and 528 ev corresponds to hydrohyl group and oxygen species respectively the binding energy of 881 ev 884 ev and 898 ev corresponds to 3d5 2 of ceo2 the binding energy of 43 ev and 50 ev may corresponds to 3 d of as2o3 which suggest arsenic was in trivalent form on the ceo2 the binding energy of 6884 ev and 688 ev corresponds to 1s of fluoride the xps spectra confirmed the adsorption of fluoride and as iii simultaneously the results of defluoridation and as iii sorption experiments are presented in table 4 it was observed that during simultaneous sorption experiments the as iii and fluoride the sorption efficiency of both the ions were decreased it was due to the competitive sorption of the ions at the functional sites similar studies on simulations sorption of arsenic and fluoride are compared with the present study and presented in table 5 5 3 desorption and regeneration studies the regeneration or reusability of adsorbent is an important parameter for the water treatment process fig 14 shows that fluoride and arsenic removal efficiency with the regenerated adsorbent the effective activation of the regenerated adsorbent was achieved by 0 1 m of hydrochloric acid rather than 0 1 m of nitric acid it was also observed that there was no leaching of cerium during the adsorption process the virgin adsorbent has higher removal efficiency for both fluoride and arsenic the regenerated adsorbent has shown a decrease in removal efficiency after the first regeneration cycle the fluoride removal efficiency was reduced to 80 and arsenic removal efficiency was still 99 similar to virgin adsorbent after the second regeneration cycle removal efficiency of both fluoride and arsenic was decreased after the third regeneration cycle the fluoride removal efficiency was decreased to 69 while arsenic removal efficiency was reduced to 59 the decrease in removal efficiency was due to the inactivation or degradation of active sites of the adsorbent during

transform infrared and x ray diffraction performed at spectro lab new delhi ft ir spectroscopic analysis was performed by nicolet is50 in order to check functional groups on the nanocomposite surface before and after adsorption the crystalline structure of prepared csgon and hrp csgon was determined by xrd analysis using xrd philips expert 1 at 30 kv 30 ma with cukα radiations of wavelength λ 1 5406 å the scan measurements were performed at 2θ range with a scan speed of 4 min in a sampling pitch of 0 02 2 3 preparation of csgon csgon was prepared by adapting the procedure used by cai et al 2017 with minor modifications first 4 0 g chitosan and 0 2 g go were dispersed in 250 ml deionized water separately then the solution of chitosan stirred continuously at 180 rpm 45 c for 4 h and the go suspension was slowly added into it ultrasound exposure for 1 h at room temperature was provided for the completion of amidation reaction and ph 8 10 was maintained during this procedure furthe prepared combination was heated at 60 c for 2 h the csgon powder was once washed with stoddard solvent and distilled water until it attained a ph 7 the csgon were then dried at 40 c and stored 2 4 preparation of hrp csgon many studies reported the immobilization of hrp on different nanocomposites li et al 2020 sarno and iuliano 2019 tavares et al 2020 vilian and chen 2014 however no studies have been found which illustrate the immobilization of hrp on csgon in 2010 zhang and co workers demonstrated go immobilized hrp and its application for phenolic compound removal abdulaal et al 2020 developed sustainable biocatalyst by encapsulation of hrp enzyme onto a magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticle polymethyl methacrylate film via casting the procedure for immobilization of hrp is almost the same for any type of carrier used in order to immobilize hrp on csgon in the present study 2 mg hrp was dissolved in 1 ml sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 solution then 100 mg csgon was slowly added to hrp solition and incubated for 15 min on ice bath with constant stirring after that the prepared solution was filtered and solid hrp csgon and supernatant were collected separately the hrp csgon was washed with the phosphate ph 7 buffer solution to remove unabsorbed hrp the resulting hrp csgon were dried and stored at 4 c before use 2 4 1 enzyme activity analysis spectrophotometry is the most common and often the easiest way of following an enzyme reaction therefore in the present study the activities were determined with the help of pyrogallol and h2o2 as substrates halpin et al 1989 by studying changes in absorbance enzyme activity of the free enzyme was determined by dissolving 10 μl of hrp enzyme in 1 ml of pyrogallol 13 mm in sodium acetate buffer ph 7 and 10 μl of 3 hydrogen peroxide the absorbance value of the prepared solution was checked at 420 nm similarly the activity of hrp csgon was measured mohamed et al 2017 2 4 2 reusability reusability assessment of hrp csgon was carried out according to the procedure used by alshawafi et al 2018 at room temperature after the first adsorption cycle the ofx exhausted hrp csgon and supernatant were carefully separated from the reaction mixture using a 0 45 μm nylon filter the semiliquid ofx exhausted hrp csgon rinsed two times with ultrapure water and 30 ml desorption solvent of methanol and kept in sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 after 1 min of reaction the peroxidase enzyme activity was determined this procedure was used repeatedly for the recovery of hrp csgon 2 5 ultrasonic assisted adsorption a synthetic solution of ofx was prepared using ip 200 mg oral drug tablet zenoflox 200 and the concentration of ofx was determined from the calibration curve at 294 nm fig s1 using eq 1 mentioned in table 2 the batch kinetic experiments were conducted under ambient conditions for the exclusion of ofx using csgon and hrp csgon the schematic diagram of ultrasonic assisted adsorption experiment is shown in fig 1 experiments were performed on 200 ml of synthetic ofx solution at ph 5 6 and 7 and adsorption times 10 30 min the initial concentration of ofx was varied 100 200 mg l in order to study the adsorption isotherm thermodynamics studied at temperature from 25 45 c and the constant dosage of hrp csgon 0 1 g 200 ml in the ofx solution was added in each experiment after each experiment a 5 ml solution has been taken and mixture carefuly separated using a 0 45 μm nylon filter to analyze the residual concentrations of ofx in supernatant solution using eq 1 the ofx removal was calculated by substituting the value of co initial and cf final concentration mg l of ofx in eq 2 further the equilibrium adsorption capacity was determined using eq 3 all experiments were run in triplicates and 1 reproducibility was found 2 6 modeling of data 2 6 1 thermodynamics the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kth was determined using the empirical equation of van t hoff in order to study the thermodynamics of the present system in the present study thermodynamic study performed at 298 314 k using eq 4 2 6 2 equilibrium study equilibrium studies were performed to assess the maximum ofx removal by hrp csgon adsorption isotherm evaluates the theoretical mechanism of adsorption and distribution of adsorbates equilibrium studies using fitting of equilibrium curves are vital for the design and scale up the adsorption process therefore adsorption isotherm such as langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and dubinin radushkevich dubinin 1960 were applied in this study the important linear relations of these models are given in table 2 eq 5 11 these models are purely empirical and based on assumptions details of each model are given below langmuir isotherm generally used for quantification of adsorbent adsorption capacity homogeneous adsorption occurs on active sites of the adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 the langmuir separation factor rl proves the feasibility of the process freundlich isotherm is used to estimate the adsorption intensity of the sorbent towards the adsorbate and it suggests the heterogeneity of the sorbent freundlich 1906 temkin isotherm describes the even distribution of binding energies and positive value of temkin constant checks the nature of adsorption endothermic or exothermic temkin and pyzhev 1940 dubinin radushkevich model assesses the porosity of the adsorbent and the superficial energy of adsorption dubinin 1960 2 6 3 kinetic study the kinetic models used to predict the adsorption principles between adsorbent and adsorbed thus in order to assess the kinetic of ofx adsorption on hrp csgon the experimental data with respect to reaction time was fitted into kinetic models such as zero pseudo first pseudo second order intra particle liquid film diffusion and elovich model using eq 12 18 in table 2 2 7 statistical and error analysis all experiments had been repeated thrice and common values had been used for data analysis further microsoft excel 2010 and origin software version 8 5 originlab corporation usa were used in order to calculate the sum of error square ses and chi square χ2 values 3 results and discussion 3 1 interaction of cs with go go can be used as adsorbent due to its high surface area but go particles are hard to collect from the water after treatment yusuf et al 2015 therefore cs used as a crosslinking agent and cs entice negatively charged go particles via electrostatic interaction banerjee et al 2017 the combination of cs with go can form numerous hydrogen bonds go has suitable oxygen molecules in the form of carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy and those oxygen molecules can bind negatively positively charged complexes through electrostatic force chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 the prepared csgon can be considered as a green adsorbent due to its versatility further csgon has properties like antibacterial biocompatibility and biodegradability because it contains various amino chelating and hydroxyl groups chen et al 2013 3 2 interaction of hrp with csgon hrp was immobilized on csgon by physical interaction sarno and iuliano 2019 during the immobilization the hrp molecules are joint covalently to the surface of csgon due to strong electrostatic force and this force prevented the hrp leaching out from the csgon surface li et al 2020 further csgon enhanced the mechanical strength of hrp and exposed to industrial applications with high reusability potential 3 3 characterization 3 3 1 sem sem image of csgon and hrp csgon are depicted in fig 2 a and b respectively the native chitosan are generally in smooth surface however fig 2 a shows the nonhomogeneous and rough surface which may be due to the attachment of cs with go the shiny morphologies confirmimg the cross linking of cs onto go through hydrogen bond duan et al 2020 further it was observed that go particles were well dispersed on cs that suggested the uniform distribution of cs on go with no aggregation which signifying good interaction between cs and go on the other hand sem image of hrp csgon fig 2 b shows the pore sizes of several micrometers in thin shape and high porosity with wrinkled edges as compared to csgon ai et al 2016 further the roughness of the csgon increases greatly after hrp immobilization fig 2 b which may confirm the attachment of hrp protein on the csgon fig 2 b shows the high compactness and interconnected pores which is vital for the absorption process for diffusion of ofx and these results are in agreement with the reported literature chen et al 2013 3 3 2 xrd the xrd spectra of csgon and hrp csgon are presented in fig 2 c and 2 d respectively in order to determine the crystallinity in fig 2 c the peak of go is disappeared only cs diffraction peaks are appeared in the xrd pattern of csgon which clearly demonstrate the development of fully exfoliated structure of go sheets in the csgon yang et al 2010 however the intensity of the characteristic peaks of cs obviously increases with the loading of hrp in the xrd pattern of hrp csgon fig 2 d there are seven main characteristic peaks occurred at 4 2 22 7 29 1 32 2 33 6 76 4 and 80 7 fig 2 c similarly in fig 2 d after hrp immobilization seven peaks occurred at 4 5 23 3 25 1 30 3 31 6 33 7 and 80 7 the peak at 4 2 and 4 5 indicating the hydrated and crystalline structure the broadened peaks indicates the existence of an amorphous cs structure han et al 2011 3 3 3 ft ir ft ir is a convenient tool to verify the vibrational stretching frequency in the present study ft ir spectra of prepared hrp csgon before and after ofx adsorption onto hrp csgon were performed and the results are shown in fig 2 e and f respectively in fig 2 e and f ft ir spectrum confirmed the presence of o h and n h stretching vibration at 3352 cm 1 and 3360 cm 1 sabzevari et al 2018 the c h and ch2 stretching vibration appeared at 2340 7 cm 1 and 2358 cm 1 the peak 1630 cm 1 to 1643 7 cm 1 were ascribed to the amide i c o stretching vibration and amide ii nh blending vibration that confirming the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of graphene oxide were linked together by amide reaction tang et al 2020 the peak at 1376 cm 1 correspomds to n h bending vibrations of the amide i group tang et al 2020 the peak at 1029 cm 1 and 1019 cm 1 shows c f groups due to c f stretching in hrp vilian and chen 2014 the same position suggest that the hrp holds its natural position after the ofx adsorption and no denaturation of hrp took place because it was stabilized by electrostatic force vilian and chen 2014 after ofx adsorption on hrp csgon fig 2 f a significant shift of those peaks from 3352 cm 1 oh and nh to 3360 cm 1 2340 7 cm 1 c h and ch2 to 2358 cm 1 1630 cm 1 c o and nh to 1643 7 cm 1 and 1376 cm 1 n h to 1314 cm 1 were observed the change in peak indicating that chemical interactions occurred between ofx and the functional groups on hrp csgon in fig 2 f the four new peak observed such as 1554 cm 1 indicated alkyl groups ch3 and ch2 antonelli et al 2020 1406 cm 1 was assigned to ch2 confirming the presence of the methylene group in the benzoxazine ring the peak 1147 cm 1 corresponded to the co symmetric stretching of carboxyl jiang et al 2016 and peak 804 cm 1 shows c h bending alkene aromatics antonelli et al 2020 3 4 comparison of enzyme activity hrp csgon with the free enzyme at different conditions ft ir xrd and sem results confirm the successfully immobilizatione of hrp on synthesized csgon by an interaction between functional groups now it is essential to assess the enzyme activity as compared to free enzyme because enzymes often show different kinetic behavior after immobilization due to carrier support abdulaal et al 2020 sahu et al 2019 enzyme activity of hrp csgon with free hrp in correspondence with ph temperature reaction time self life and reusability is reported below 3 4 1 enzyme activity vs ph the effect of solution ph on the enzyme activity of hrp csgon and free enzymes was studied and the results are presented in fig 3 a as depicted in fig 3 a the optimal ph for both free enzyme and hrp csgon was about 7 these results are in agreement with the reported work by ai et al 2016 at 7 ph the enzyme activity of hrp csgon and free hrp accounted for 95 4 and 93 respectively this result shows that csgon improved the ph stability of hrp li et al 2019 it can be observed from fig 3 a that the enzyme activity of hrp csgon is higher than as compared to the free enzyme in acidic or alkaline condition 3 4 2 enzyme activity vs temperature it is necessary to determine the thermal stability of hrp csgon for industrial application because enzymes structure could be damaged at a high temperature abdulaal et al 2020 ai et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the thermal stability of the hrp csgon and the free enzyme was determined in terms of enzyme activity at a different temperature from 303 to 323 k at ph 7 fig 3 b shows the effects of temperature on enzyme activity hrp csgon and free hrp as the temperature increased from 303 323 k the enzyme activity of free hrp and hrp csgon decreased because hrp is a protein that undergoes a conformational change at elevated temperature however hrp csgon is active on temperature range 303 323 k due to strong attachment of enzyme on to csgon further csgon safeguards the hrp from unsuitable structural damage at high thermal exposure maximum enzyme activity 83 and 78 achieved at 303 k for free hrp and hrp csgon respectively a similar pattern of results was obtained by abdulaal et al 2020 zhang et al 2010 3 4 3 shelf life vs enzyme activity shelf life of hrp csgon and free hrp was also determined in order to reduce the cost of the immobilized enzyme sahu et al 2019 the storage stability of hrp csgon and free enzymes was investigated in terms of enzyme activity by keeping at 4 c in phosphate buffer for 15 days and the results are shown in fig 3 c it can be observed from fig 3 c that the enzyme activity of free hrp and hrp csgon was decreasing throughout the storage time but the enzyme activity of the free hrp decreases high as compared to hrp csgon in the same environment after 15 days the enzyme activity of hrp csgon is 75 while only 41 enzyme activity was obtained for the free enzyme hence hrp csgon shows a longer shelf life as compared to the free enzyme these results representing that the csgon provided a stabilizing effect to hrp csgon these findings are consistent with research showing by ai et al 2016 sahu et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 3 4 4 enzyme activity vs reusability of hrp csgon the reusability of the adsorbent is one of the most essential and vital parameters for industrial uses li et al 2020 therefore the regeneration of hrp csgon from the ofx exhausted solution was conducted by the desorption technique wang et al 2016 an ofx concentration 200 mg l was selected to conduct the hrp csgon regeneration study for the first desorption cycle 0 1 g hrp csgon was mixed in 200 ml of ofx solution concentration 200 mg l at ph 7 and kept in an ultrasonication bath for 10 min reaction after experiment 5 ml solution has taken in 0 45 μm nylon syringe filter to separate the hrp csgon loaded ofx from clear solution after that hrp csgon loaded ofx was softly rinsed by distilled water and dried at 45 c for 12 h wang et al 2016 then 30 ml methanol was mixed into the dried mass and kept the solution for 1 min in sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 solution after that peroxidase enzyme activity was checked the adoption capacity and ofx removal efficiency were calculated using eqs 1 3 tabulated in table 2 similar experiments were performed 5 times with regenerated hrp csgon to check the reusability potential the adsorption cycles versus the ofx removal and final concentration mg l and enzyme activity of the hrp csgon were plotted and presented in fig 3 d there is a clear trend of decreasing enzyme activity and ofx removal efficiency after 3 cycles 55 in the present study 39 6 activity decline on csgon as carrier support in 5 cycles of reuse this decline occurred during the enzymatic reaction by an increase of the reaction products such as polymers at hrp csgon which wrecked the active sites of the enzyme wang et al 2016 further electrostatic interaction between csgon and hrp might be disturbed due to the repeated washings which lead to a gradual decrease in enzyme activity zhang et al 2010 similar findings were reported by chang and tang 2014 for removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol using nh2 modified magnetic particles by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase the reusability results showed that the csgon in combination with hrp could decrease the cost of adsorbent because it can be reused again and again and easily separate from the liquid solution 3 5 batch study batch ultra sonication assisted adsorption study was accomplished in order to evaluate the potential of hrp csgon for ofx removal at different ph concentration reaction time and temperature the removal efficiency of ofx and equilibrium adsorption capacity was determined from initial and final ofx concentration in the supernatant using eq 1 3 3 5 1 effect of ph on ofx removal the effect of solution ph is critical to study because it affects surface charge and ionization wuana et al 2015 fig 4 a illustrates that ofx removal efficiency increased from ph 6 75 to ph 7 98 and then decreased from ph 7 98 to ph 8 85 at ph 6 strong interaction occurred in between the anionic hrp csgon and cationic ofx and leading to high ofx removal and high adsorption capacity crespo alonso et al 2013 while at ph 7 the zwitterion nature of ofx prevalent and contribute to the adsorption of ofx huang et al 2018 wuana et al 2015 further at ph 8 ofx present in the anionic state which reduces the interaction forces and providing repulsion between hrp csgon and ofx molecules hence a reduction in adsorption capacity at higher ph was observed overall optimum ph was noted down at 7 these results match with the earlier studies banerjee et al 2017 wuana et al 2015 3 5 2 effect of ofx concentration on ofx removal effect of the initial ofx concentration on ofx removal efficiency and adsorption capacity was determined at different ofx concentration solution 100 200 mg l at 7 ph and 10 min of ultra sonication time the effect of the initial ofx concentration on removal and adsorption capacity are shown in fig 4 b outcomes showed that an increase in initial ofx concentration ofx adsorption capacity increased due to the concentration gradient banerjee et al 2017 the rise in ofx concentration may lead to a more significant number of ofx moieties around the surface of hrp csgon therefore higher adsorption capacity observed satapathy et al 2015 3 5 3 effect of ultra sonication time on ofx removal the effect of ultra sonication time on ofx removal efficiency was determined at different time intervals from 10 50 min at 200 mg l ofx concentration and 7 ph it was observed that adsorption capacity had enhanced with reaction time fig 4 c the findings are directly in line with previous results banerjee et al 2019 the significant increment in adsorption capacity attained in very less exposure of ultra sonication attributed to the effects of ultrasound irradiation further the enhancement of adsorption capacity may be attributed to intense shock waves during ultra sonication and fast generation of cavitation bubbles on hrp csgon and ofx interface banerjee et al 2017 jamshidi et al 2016 additionally ofx removal efficiency increased with temperature also recommended the endothermic nature of the adsorption 3 5 4 effect of temperature on ofx removal the effect of temperature on ofx removal efficiency using hrp csgon has been carried out at different temperatures from 298 313 k at ph 7 ofx concentration 200 mg l and the hrp csgon dose 0 1 g 200 ml fig 4 d illustrated that the rise in temperature 298 313 k results in a high adsorption capacity 380 397 mg g due to the high rate of dispersal of ofx molecules over the external sites and inner pores of hrp csgon moreover a rise in temperature may have resulted in an increment of porosity and total pore volume of hrp csgon banerjee et al 2015 the overall results infer that the adsorption process is endothermic 3 6 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic analysis was examined at 298 313 k and the values of thermodynamic parameters δg δh and δs were determined from the plot ln kth vs 1 t fig s2 using eq 4 given in table 2 the results obtained from van t hoff plot are summarized in table 3 in table 3 the free energy δg reflects the adsorption spontaneity in the present study the negative δg revealed that the adsorption process of ofx on hrp csgon is spontaneous also the negative value of δg increases with increasing temperature directs that increasing the temperature is beneficial to the reaction process but in the present study the optimum temperature was 313 k at which nearly 99 ofx removed therefore it can be established that a favorable reaction temperature is 314 k and δh indicated that the process is endothermic similarly entropy δs indicates the randomness of hrp csgon with ofx in the adsorption process bao et al 2020 the positive values of the entropy suggests that increasing randomness during the adsorption process pholosi et al 2020 similar results have been reported by medhi et al 2020 and samuel et al 2018 for adsorption of cu ii and cr vi respectively 3 7 equilibrium study in order to investigate the equilibrium adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models were applied using eq 5 11 and the results are given in table 3 and figs s3 s6 the best fit of the appropriate model was checked with the value of r2 χ2 and ses values it can be seen in table 3 that on the basis of r2 the langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit for the present system the value of monolayer adsorption capacity qm 384 mg g and the equilibrium constant kl 1 73 l mg listed in table 3 the value of separation factor rl 0 002 to 0 005 indicates the favorable adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon this results confirm that the adsorption process primarily takes place through chemical interactions with monolayer coverage this finding supports previous research gupta et al 2019 medhi et al 2020 further the positive b 43 45 j mol confirms the endothermic adsorption of ofx the value of qd r 311 mg g and free energy e 6 2 kj mol suggesting physical nature of the adsorption process 3 8 kinetic study the adoption kinetics was studied to understand the ofx adsorption on hrp csgon the kinetic adsorption experiments were performed by adding 0 1 g of hrp csgon in a 200 ml ofx solution 200 mg l concentration the solution kept in an incubator shaker at 150 rpm stirring speed for the different time intervals with 7 ph kinetic behavior of ofx adsorption on hrp csgon was analyzed using eq 12 18 the detailed results are shown in table 3 and figs s7 s11 3 8 1 zero order this model underlined the sovereignty of the adsorption performance on adsorbate and adsorbent concentration medhi et al 2020 the rate constants k0 qe0 cal and t cal were determined from the linear eq 12 the experimental data were fitted to a zero order model by plotting qt versus time fig s7 the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity from zero order kinetics was q0 cal 378 mg g table 3 the calculated equilibrium time te calc determined from the linear relation using eq 13 it was found that the te calc 49 min is quite higher than the te exp 10 min the value of rate constant k0 is 0 424 mg g min and r2 0 99 ratifying the linearity of the experimental values with the zero order model but the χ2 and ses values found very high in the zero order kinetic model therefore the pseudo first order model was examined 3 8 2 pseudo first order the values obtained from experiments were fitted to the pseudo first orde eq 14 and results are shown in fig s8 and table 3 the kinetic parameters were found to be q1 cal 5 mg g and r2 0 95 which revealed that the experimental values fitted to pseudo first order though the low value of q1 calc 5 mg g and k1 0 07 min 1 were obtained in the present study hence the pseudo first order found incompetent to define the order of ofx adsorption onto hrp csgon a similar observation was reported by ho and mckay 1998 kumar et al 2005 3 8 3 pseudo second order further pseudo second order kinetic studied using eq 15 and results are shown in fig s9 and table 3 the rate constant k2 0 003 g mg min determined by intercept and q2 calc 400 mg g obtained from slope furthermore the value of r2 is 0 99 shows linearity with experimental results it suggests that the adsorption is mainly by a chemical reaction in between ofx molecules and the surface functional groups on hrp csgon nethaji et al 2013 therefore pseudo second order considered a best fit model and representing the hrp csgon ofx interactions these findings supported by other findings singh et al 2019 yusuf et al 2015 3 9 validity test the validity of the kinetic models is tested with the ses and chi square χ2 values χ2 and ses values were determined and presented in table 3 it was observed that smaller values were obtained by the pseudo second order model χ2 8 9 10 8 and ses 2 06 10 7 than to zero and pseudo first order kinetic models hence the best fit model for ofx adsorption on hrp csgon in present study was pseudo second order model 3 10 determination of rate controlling step to identify the specific adsorption mechanism in a particular adsorption system it is necessary to know the rate controlling step in the adsorption process the rate controlling step exerts a substantial effect on the overall rate of the reaction and very essential for the design of adsorption systems karthikeyan et al 2010 according to literature adsorption may occur in four steps for considering all aspects of mass transfer i external mass transfer ii diffusion due to film layer iii diffusion due to opening of the adsorbent and iv reaction controlling process a similar adsorption mechanism was also proposed by naicker et al 2020 for the removal of cr vi and singh et al 2017 for the removal of dyes using agriculture waste in the present work step i was neutralized by agitation during the adsorption experiments step ii iii and iv were investigated to determine the specific adsorption kinetic model in the present study liquid film layer intra particle diffusion model and elovich models studied using eq 16 18 3 10 1 adsorption due to intraparticle diffusion the intra particle diffusion model was studied by plotting the experimental data in eq 16 and the plot is given in fig 5 according to weber and morris 1963 intra particle diffusion is the rate limiting step when the plot of qt versus t1 2 start from the origin if the plot is not passing to the origin and intercept is present indicates film diffusion is also taking part in the process the value of the intercept provides the idea of film layer thickness in the present study kid and intercept were calculated from the slope and intercept values from fig 5 and the results are tabulated in table 3 the high kid 53 mg g min1 2 that reflects higher porosity of hrp csgon which match with the sem results further a high value of intercept 88 mg g table 4 which is higher than zero suggesting the adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon could not be elucidated only by intra particle diffusion mechanism it was revealed from fig 5 that the adsorption processes followed three stages the stage i is completed in 10 min by diffusion of ofx ions from the solution to the hrp csgon surface stage ii shows the chemical interaction between the ofx ions and hrp csgon due to liquid film and pore diffusion finally in stage iii a straight line displays adsorbent saturation phase after that no sites are available for adsorption of ofx this finding is in agreement with medhi et al 2020 naicker et al 2020 3 10 2 adsorption due to liquid film diffusion boyd model 1947 was employed in order to investigate the edges in between liquid and solid phases using eq 17 the results are shown in fig s10 and table 3 from table 3 it can be observed that there is an enormous difference in the value of kid 53 and kld 0 03 that indicating a slow rate of ofx ion carriage from solution to the surface of hrp csgon during the adsorption process kumar et al 2005 these findings are confirming that both film and pore diffusion are controlling the adsorption mechanisum of ofx using hrp csgon the intercept values are 88 and 1 9 obtained from pore and liquid film diffusion models respectively when comparing to the intercept value with zero value it suggests that liquid film diffusios have a major role in the kinetics than pore diffusion podder and majumder 2017 3 10 3 elovich model elovich constants β and α were determined using eq 18 and the results are shown in fig s11 and table 3 in table 3 the larger value of α is 1 9 1016 indicates a higher degree of chemisorption and suggesting chemisorption could be one of the rate controlling steps in the present study the lower value of β 0 04 shows indicating fast adsorption and lower activation energy for chemisorption and value of r2 suggesting the rate controlling mechanism in order of intra particle elovich liquid film diffusion ahmad et al 2015 hossain and hossain 2014 3 11 limitation of the present study although the study has successfully demonstrated the potential of hrp csgon in removing ofx from aqueous solution it has certain limitations first csgon prepared by direct mixing of cs and go at ph 7 conditions which is very simple however strong electrostatic interaction between go and cs leads to an increase in the thickness of the solution which is harmful for he mixing therefore it is suggested that for making of homogeneous csgon solution first prepare alkaline go solution and then disperse in cs in alkaline condition carboxyl groups neutralized by oh and as result more negative charges generated on go particles chen et al 2013 secondly avoid the use of hrp csgon in direct contact of strong acid alkaline and very high temperature conditions for the protection of enzyme denaturation 3 12 comparison with existing literature in order to prove that the adsorption capacity of hrp csgon for removal of ofx a literature survey was carried out and tabulated in table 4 when comparing our results to those of older studies given in table 4 it must be pointed out that the maximum ofx uptake by hrp csgon was 378 mg g in this study and 100 removal in only 10 min than the other adsorbents the most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was reusability and eco friendlyness 4 conclusion present investigation leads to the following conclusions 1 characterization results sem xrd and ft ir confirm the successful hrp csgon synthesis and adsorption of ofx on the hrp csgon surface 2 the properties of prepared hrp csgon demonstrated that it has better ph and temperature stability than free enzyme and shows admirable reusability and shelf life 3 in a batch study the effect of ph revealed that at ph 6 to 7 maximum ofx adsorption capacity on hrp csgon was achieved because at ph 6 to 7 the zwitterion was prevalent and high electrostatic interaction between electron donor and acceptor occurred also ofx removal is highly dependent on ofx concentration ultra sonication time and temperature of the reaction the maximum adsorption capacity was found 378 mg g in the present work this is the first report to use hrp csgon as adsorbent and had a large adsorption capacity 4 the thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon is a spontaneous process and endothermic in nature the equilibrium data confirming the monolayer coverage of ofx on hrp csgon particles the kinetics study shows the best fit of pseudo second order reaction the mechanistic study is conveying the complex interaction of ofx on hrp csgon which involved solid to liquid chemical interactions and liquid film diffusion 5 the present study revealed the prospect of using an hrp csgon adsorbent for the treatment of highly contaminated effluent of the pharmaceutical industry which demonstrated much enhanced outcomes in comparison to adsorbent reported earlier 6 the encouraging results of hrp csgon presented its future scope of application for the removal of other contaminants on a big scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data the

lists some of the previous studies on metal and dye removal using graphene and chitosan nano composites banerjee et al 2017 kyzas et al 2014 najafabadi et al 2015 furthermore the activation of chitosan and go with glutaraldehyde can assist in making it reusable as well travlou et al 2013b various researchers have improved the adsorption capacity of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles using enzyme loading and their surface immobilization by horseradish peroxidase various researchers immobilized hrp protein on different carrier supports due to its versatile properties such as high

transform infrared and x ray diffraction performed at spectro lab new delhi ft ir spectroscopic analysis was performed by nicolet is50 in order to check functional groups on the nanocomposite surface before and after adsorption the crystalline structure of prepared csgon and hrp csgon was determined by xrd analysis using xrd philips expert 1 at 30 kv 30 ma with cukα radiations of wavelength λ 1 5406 å the scan measurements were performed at 2θ range with a scan speed of 4 min in a sampling pitch of 0 02 2 3 preparation of csgon csgon was prepared by adapting the procedure used by cai et al 2017 with minor modifications first 4 0 g chitosan and 0 2 g go were dispersed in 250 ml deionized water separately then the solution of chitosan stirred continuously at 180 rpm 45 c for 4 h and the go suspension was slowly added into it ultrasound exposure for 1 h at room temperature was provided for the completion of amidation reaction and ph 8 10 was maintained during this procedure furthe prepared combination was heated at 60 c for 2 h the csgon powder was once washed with stoddard solvent and distilled water until it attained a ph 7 the csgon were then dried at 40 c and stored 2 4 preparation of hrp csgon many studies reported the immobilization of hrp on different nanocomposites li et al 2020 sarno and iuliano 2019 tavares et al 2020 vilian and chen 2014 however no studies have been found which illustrate the immobilization of hrp on csgon in 2010 zhang and co workers demonstrated go immobilized hrp and its application for phenolic compound removal abdulaal et al 2020 developed sustainable biocatalyst by encapsulation of hrp enzyme onto a magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticle polymethyl methacrylate film via casting the procedure for immobilization of hrp is almost the same for any type of carrier used in order to immobilize hrp on csgon in the present study 2 mg hrp was dissolved in 1 ml sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 solution then 100 mg csgon was slowly added to hrp solition and incubated for 15 min on ice bath with constant stirring after that the prepared solution was filtered and solid hrp csgon and supernatant were collected separately the hrp csgon was washed with the phosphate ph 7 buffer solution to remove unabsorbed hrp the resulting hrp csgon were dried and stored at 4 c before use 2 4 1 enzyme activity analysis spectrophotometry is the most common and often the easiest way of following an enzyme reaction therefore in the present study the activities were determined with the help of pyrogallol and h2o2 as substrates halpin et al 1989 by studying changes in absorbance enzyme activity of the free enzyme was determined by dissolving 10 μl of hrp enzyme in 1 ml of pyrogallol 13 mm in sodium acetate buffer ph 7 and 10 μl of 3 hydrogen peroxide the absorbance value of the prepared solution was checked at 420 nm similarly the activity of hrp csgon was measured mohamed et al 2017 2 4 2 reusability reusability assessment of hrp csgon was carried out according to the procedure used by alshawafi et al 2018 at room temperature after the first adsorption cycle the ofx exhausted hrp csgon and supernatant were carefully separated from the reaction mixture using a 0 45 μm nylon filter the semiliquid ofx exhausted hrp csgon rinsed two times with ultrapure water and 30 ml desorption solvent of methanol and kept in sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 after 1 min of reaction the peroxidase enzyme activity was determined this procedure was used repeatedly for the recovery of hrp csgon 2 5 ultrasonic assisted adsorption a synthetic solution of ofx was prepared using ip 200 mg oral drug tablet zenoflox 200 and the concentration of ofx was determined from the calibration curve at 294 nm fig s1 using eq 1 mentioned in table 2 the batch kinetic experiments were conducted under ambient conditions for the exclusion of ofx using csgon and hrp csgon the schematic diagram of ultrasonic assisted adsorption experiment is shown in fig 1 experiments were performed on 200 ml of synthetic ofx solution at ph 5 6 and 7 and adsorption times 10 30 min the initial concentration of ofx was varied 100 200 mg l in order to study the adsorption isotherm thermodynamics studied at temperature from 25 45 c and the constant dosage of hrp csgon 0 1 g 200 ml in the ofx solution was added in each experiment after each experiment a 5 ml solution has been taken and mixture carefuly separated using a 0 45 μm nylon filter to analyze the residual concentrations of ofx in supernatant solution using eq 1 the ofx removal was calculated by substituting the value of co initial and cf final concentration mg l of ofx in eq 2 further the equilibrium adsorption capacity was determined using eq 3 all experiments were run in triplicates and 1 reproducibility was found 2 6 modeling of data 2 6 1 thermodynamics the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kth was determined using the empirical equation of van t hoff in order to study the thermodynamics of the present system in the present study thermodynamic study performed at 298 314 k using eq 4 2 6 2 equilibrium study equilibrium studies were performed to assess the maximum ofx removal by hrp csgon adsorption isotherm evaluates the theoretical mechanism of adsorption and distribution of adsorbates equilibrium studies using fitting of equilibrium curves are vital for the design and scale up the adsorption process therefore adsorption isotherm such as langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 temkin temkin and pyzhev 1940 and dubinin radushkevich dubinin 1960 were applied in this study the important linear relations of these models are given in table 2 eq 5 11 these models are purely empirical and based on assumptions details of each model are given below langmuir isotherm generally used for quantification of adsorbent adsorption capacity homogeneous adsorption occurs on active sites of the adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 the langmuir separation factor rl proves the feasibility of the process freundlich isotherm is used to estimate the adsorption intensity of the sorbent towards the adsorbate and it suggests the heterogeneity of the sorbent freundlich 1906 temkin isotherm describes the even distribution of binding energies and positive value of temkin constant checks the nature of adsorption endothermic or exothermic temkin and pyzhev 1940 dubinin radushkevich model assesses the porosity of the adsorbent and the superficial energy of adsorption dubinin 1960 2 6 3 kinetic study the kinetic models used to predict the adsorption principles between adsorbent and adsorbed thus in order to assess the kinetic of ofx adsorption on hrp csgon the experimental data with respect to reaction time was fitted into kinetic models such as zero pseudo first pseudo second order intra particle liquid film diffusion and elovich model using eq 12 18 in table 2 2 7 statistical and error analysis all experiments had been repeated thrice and common values had been used for data analysis further microsoft excel 2010 and origin software version 8 5 originlab corporation usa were used in order to calculate the sum of error square ses and chi square χ2 values 3 results and discussion 3 1 interaction of cs with go go can be used as adsorbent due to its high surface area but go particles are hard to collect from the water after treatment yusuf et al 2015 therefore cs used as a crosslinking agent and cs entice negatively charged go particles via electrostatic interaction banerjee et al 2017 the combination of cs with go can form numerous hydrogen bonds go has suitable oxygen molecules in the form of carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy and those oxygen molecules can bind negatively positively charged complexes through electrostatic force chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 the prepared csgon can be considered as a green adsorbent due to its versatility further csgon has properties like antibacterial biocompatibility and biodegradability because it contains various amino chelating and hydroxyl groups chen et al 2013 3 2 interaction of hrp with csgon hrp was immobilized on csgon by physical interaction sarno and iuliano 2019 during the immobilization the hrp molecules are joint covalently to the surface of csgon due to strong electrostatic force and this force prevented the hrp leaching out from the csgon surface li et al 2020 further csgon enhanced the mechanical strength of hrp and exposed to industrial applications with high reusability potential 3 3 characterization 3 3 1 sem sem image of csgon and hrp csgon are depicted in fig 2 a and b respectively the native chitosan are generally in smooth surface however fig 2 a shows the nonhomogeneous and rough surface which may be due to the attachment of cs with go the shiny morphologies confirmimg the cross linking of cs onto go through hydrogen bond duan et al 2020 further it was observed that go particles were well dispersed on cs that suggested the uniform distribution of cs on go with no aggregation which signifying good interaction between cs and go on the other hand sem image of hrp csgon fig 2 b shows the pore sizes of several micrometers in thin shape and high porosity with wrinkled edges as compared to csgon ai et al 2016 further the roughness of the csgon increases greatly after hrp immobilization fig 2 b which may confirm the attachment of hrp protein on the csgon fig 2 b shows the high compactness and interconnected pores which is vital for the absorption process for diffusion of ofx and these results are in agreement with the reported literature chen et al 2013 3 3 2 xrd the xrd spectra of csgon and hrp csgon are presented in fig 2 c and 2 d respectively in order to determine the crystallinity in fig 2 c the peak of go is disappeared only cs diffraction peaks are appeared in the xrd pattern of csgon which clearly demonstrate the development of fully exfoliated structure of go sheets in the csgon yang et al 2010 however the intensity of the characteristic peaks of cs obviously increases with the loading of hrp in the xrd pattern of hrp csgon fig 2 d there are seven main characteristic peaks occurred at 4 2 22 7 29 1 32 2 33 6 76 4 and 80 7 fig 2 c similarly in fig 2 d after hrp immobilization seven peaks occurred at 4 5 23 3 25 1 30 3 31 6 33 7 and 80 7 the peak at 4 2 and 4 5 indicating the hydrated and crystalline structure the broadened peaks indicates the existence of an amorphous cs structure han et al 2011 3 3 3 ft ir ft ir is a convenient tool to verify the vibrational stretching frequency in the present study ft ir spectra of prepared hrp csgon before and after ofx adsorption onto hrp csgon were performed and the results are shown in fig 2 e and f respectively in fig 2 e and f ft ir spectrum confirmed the presence of o h and n h stretching vibration at 3352 cm 1 and 3360 cm 1 sabzevari et al 2018 the c h and ch2 stretching vibration appeared at 2340 7 cm 1 and 2358 cm 1 the peak 1630 cm 1 to 1643 7 cm 1 were ascribed to the amide i c o stretching vibration and amide ii nh blending vibration that confirming the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of graphene oxide were linked together by amide reaction tang et al 2020 the peak at 1376 cm 1 correspomds to n h bending vibrations of the amide i group tang et al 2020 the peak at 1029 cm 1 and 1019 cm 1 shows c f groups due to c f stretching in hrp vilian and chen 2014 the same position suggest that the hrp holds its natural position after the ofx adsorption and no denaturation of hrp took place because it was stabilized by electrostatic force vilian and chen 2014 after ofx adsorption on hrp csgon fig 2 f a significant shift of those peaks from 3352 cm 1 oh and nh to 3360 cm 1 2340 7 cm 1 c h and ch2 to 2358 cm 1 1630 cm 1 c o and nh to 1643 7 cm 1 and 1376 cm 1 n h to 1314 cm 1 were observed the change in peak indicating that chemical interactions occurred between ofx and the functional groups on hrp csgon in fig 2 f the four new peak observed such as 1554 cm 1 indicated alkyl groups ch3 and ch2 antonelli et al 2020 1406 cm 1 was assigned to ch2 confirming the presence of the methylene group in the benzoxazine ring the peak 1147 cm 1 corresponded to the co symmetric stretching of carboxyl jiang et al 2016 and peak 804 cm 1 shows c h bending alkene aromatics antonelli et al 2020 3 4 comparison of enzyme activity hrp csgon with the free enzyme at different conditions ft ir xrd and sem results confirm the successfully immobilizatione of hrp on synthesized csgon by an interaction between functional groups now it is essential to assess the enzyme activity as compared to free enzyme because enzymes often show different kinetic behavior after immobilization due to carrier support abdulaal et al 2020 sahu et al 2019 enzyme activity of hrp csgon with free hrp in correspondence with ph temperature reaction time self life and reusability is reported below 3 4 1 enzyme activity vs ph the effect of solution ph on the enzyme activity of hrp csgon and free enzymes was studied and the results are presented in fig 3 a as depicted in fig 3 a the optimal ph for both free enzyme and hrp csgon was about 7 these results are in agreement with the reported work by ai et al 2016 at 7 ph the enzyme activity of hrp csgon and free hrp accounted for 95 4 and 93 respectively this result shows that csgon improved the ph stability of hrp li et al 2019 it can be observed from fig 3 a that the enzyme activity of hrp csgon is higher than as compared to the free enzyme in acidic or alkaline condition 3 4 2 enzyme activity vs temperature it is necessary to determine the thermal stability of hrp csgon for industrial application because enzymes structure could be damaged at a high temperature abdulaal et al 2020 ai et al 2016 li et al 2019 therefore the thermal stability of the hrp csgon and the free enzyme was determined in terms of enzyme activity at a different temperature from 303 to 323 k at ph 7 fig 3 b shows the effects of temperature on enzyme activity hrp csgon and free hrp as the temperature increased from 303 323 k the enzyme activity of free hrp and hrp csgon decreased because hrp is a protein that undergoes a conformational change at elevated temperature however hrp csgon is active on temperature range 303 323 k due to strong attachment of enzyme on to csgon further csgon safeguards the hrp from unsuitable structural damage at high thermal exposure maximum enzyme activity 83 and 78 achieved at 303 k for free hrp and hrp csgon respectively a similar pattern of results was obtained by abdulaal et al 2020 zhang et al 2010 3 4 3 shelf life vs enzyme activity shelf life of hrp csgon and free hrp was also determined in order to reduce the cost of the immobilized enzyme sahu et al 2019 the storage stability of hrp csgon and free enzymes was investigated in terms of enzyme activity by keeping at 4 c in phosphate buffer for 15 days and the results are shown in fig 3 c it can be observed from fig 3 c that the enzyme activity of free hrp and hrp csgon was decreasing throughout the storage time but the enzyme activity of the free hrp decreases high as compared to hrp csgon in the same environment after 15 days the enzyme activity of hrp csgon is 75 while only 41 enzyme activity was obtained for the free enzyme hence hrp csgon shows a longer shelf life as compared to the free enzyme these results representing that the csgon provided a stabilizing effect to hrp csgon these findings are consistent with research showing by ai et al 2016 sahu et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 3 4 4 enzyme activity vs reusability of hrp csgon the reusability of the adsorbent is one of the most essential and vital parameters for industrial uses li et al 2020 therefore the regeneration of hrp csgon from the ofx exhausted solution was conducted by the desorption technique wang et al 2016 an ofx concentration 200 mg l was selected to conduct the hrp csgon regeneration study for the first desorption cycle 0 1 g hrp csgon was mixed in 200 ml of ofx solution concentration 200 mg l at ph 7 and kept in an ultrasonication bath for 10 min reaction after experiment 5 ml solution has taken in 0 45 μm nylon syringe filter to separate the hrp csgon loaded ofx from clear solution after that hrp csgon loaded ofx was softly rinsed by distilled water and dried at 45 c for 12 h wang et al 2016 then 30 ml methanol was mixed into the dried mass and kept the solution for 1 min in sodium acetate buffer 100 mm ph 7 solution after that peroxidase enzyme activity was checked the adoption capacity and ofx removal efficiency were calculated using eqs 1 3 tabulated in table 2 similar experiments were performed 5 times with regenerated hrp csgon to check the reusability potential the adsorption cycles versus the ofx removal and final concentration mg l and enzyme activity of the hrp csgon were plotted and presented in fig 3 d there is a clear trend of decreasing enzyme activity and ofx removal efficiency after 3 cycles 55 in the present study 39 6 activity decline on csgon as carrier support in 5 cycles of reuse this decline occurred during the enzymatic reaction by an increase of the reaction products such as polymers at hrp csgon which wrecked the active sites of the enzyme wang et al 2016 further electrostatic interaction between csgon and hrp might be disturbed due to the repeated washings which lead to a gradual decrease in enzyme activity zhang et al 2010 similar findings were reported by chang and tang 2014 for removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol using nh2 modified magnetic particles by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase the reusability results showed that the csgon in combination with hrp could decrease the cost of adsorbent because it can be reused again and again and easily separate from the liquid solution 3 5 batch study batch ultra sonication assisted adsorption study was accomplished in order to evaluate the potential of hrp csgon for ofx removal at different ph concentration reaction time and temperature the removal efficiency of ofx and equilibrium adsorption capacity was determined from initial and final ofx concentration in the supernatant using eq 1 3 3 5 1 effect of ph on ofx removal the effect of solution ph is critical to study because it affects surface charge and ionization wuana et al 2015 fig 4 a illustrates that ofx removal efficiency increased from ph 6 75 to ph 7 98 and then decreased from ph 7 98 to ph 8 85 at ph 6 strong interaction occurred in between the anionic hrp csgon and cationic ofx and leading to high ofx removal and high adsorption capacity crespo alonso et al 2013 while at ph 7 the zwitterion nature of ofx prevalent and contribute to the adsorption of ofx huang et al 2018 wuana et al 2015 further at ph 8 ofx present in the anionic state which reduces the interaction forces and providing repulsion between hrp csgon and ofx molecules hence a reduction in adsorption capacity at higher ph was observed overall optimum ph was noted down at 7 these results match with the earlier studies banerjee et al 2017 wuana et al 2015 3 5 2 effect of ofx concentration on ofx removal effect of the initial ofx concentration on ofx removal efficiency and adsorption capacity was determined at different ofx concentration solution 100 200 mg l at 7 ph and 10 min of ultra sonication time the effect of the initial ofx concentration on removal and adsorption capacity are shown in fig 4 b outcomes showed that an increase in initial ofx concentration ofx adsorption capacity increased due to the concentration gradient banerjee et al 2017 the rise in ofx concentration may lead to a more significant number of ofx moieties around the surface of hrp csgon therefore higher adsorption capacity observed satapathy et al 2015 3 5 3 effect of ultra sonication time on ofx removal the effect of ultra sonication time on ofx removal efficiency was determined at different time intervals from 10 50 min at 200 mg l ofx concentration and 7 ph it was observed that adsorption capacity had enhanced with reaction time fig 4 c the findings are directly in line with previous results banerjee et al 2019 the significant increment in adsorption capacity attained in very less exposure of ultra sonication attributed to the effects of ultrasound irradiation further the enhancement of adsorption capacity may be attributed to intense shock waves during ultra sonication and fast generation of cavitation bubbles on hrp csgon and ofx interface banerjee et al 2017 jamshidi et al 2016 additionally ofx removal efficiency increased with temperature also recommended the endothermic nature of the adsorption 3 5 4 effect of temperature on ofx removal the effect of temperature on ofx removal efficiency using hrp csgon has been carried out at different temperatures from 298 313 k at ph 7 ofx concentration 200 mg l and the hrp csgon dose 0 1 g 200 ml fig 4 d illustrated that the rise in temperature 298 313 k results in a high adsorption capacity 380 397 mg g due to the high rate of dispersal of ofx molecules over the external sites and inner pores of hrp csgon moreover a rise in temperature may have resulted in an increment of porosity and total pore volume of hrp csgon banerjee et al 2015 the overall results infer that the adsorption process is endothermic 3 6 thermodynamic study the thermodynamic analysis was examined at 298 313 k and the values of thermodynamic parameters δg δh and δs were determined from the plot ln kth vs 1 t fig s2 using eq 4 given in table 2 the results obtained from van t hoff plot are summarized in table 3 in table 3 the free energy δg reflects the adsorption spontaneity in the present study the negative δg revealed that the adsorption process of ofx on hrp csgon is spontaneous also the negative value of δg increases with increasing temperature directs that increasing the temperature is beneficial to the reaction process but in the present study the optimum temperature was 313 k at which nearly 99 ofx removed therefore it can be established that a favorable reaction temperature is 314 k and δh indicated that the process is endothermic similarly entropy δs indicates the randomness of hrp csgon with ofx in the adsorption process bao et al 2020 the positive values of the entropy suggests that increasing randomness during the adsorption process pholosi et al 2020 similar results have been reported by medhi et al 2020 and samuel et al 2018 for adsorption of cu ii and cr vi respectively 3 7 equilibrium study in order to investigate the equilibrium adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models were applied using eq 5 11 and the results are given in table 3 and figs s3 s6 the best fit of the appropriate model was checked with the value of r2 χ2 and ses values it can be seen in table 3 that on the basis of r2 the langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit for the present system the value of monolayer adsorption capacity qm 384 mg g and the equilibrium constant kl 1 73 l mg listed in table 3 the value of separation factor rl 0 002 to 0 005 indicates the favorable adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon this results confirm that the adsorption process primarily takes place through chemical interactions with monolayer coverage this finding supports previous research gupta et al 2019 medhi et al 2020 further the positive b 43 45 j mol confirms the endothermic adsorption of ofx the value of qd r 311 mg g and free energy e 6 2 kj mol suggesting physical nature of the adsorption process 3 8 kinetic study the adoption kinetics was studied to understand the ofx adsorption on hrp csgon the kinetic adsorption experiments were performed by adding 0 1 g of hrp csgon in a 200 ml ofx solution 200 mg l concentration the solution kept in an incubator shaker at 150 rpm stirring speed for the different time intervals with 7 ph kinetic behavior of ofx adsorption on hrp csgon was analyzed using eq 12 18 the detailed results are shown in table 3 and figs s7 s11 3 8 1 zero order this model underlined the sovereignty of the adsorption performance on adsorbate and adsorbent concentration medhi et al 2020 the rate constants k0 qe0 cal and t cal were determined from the linear eq 12 the experimental data were fitted to a zero order model by plotting qt versus time fig s7 the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity from zero order kinetics was q0 cal 378 mg g table 3 the calculated equilibrium time te calc determined from the linear relation using eq 13 it was found that the te calc 49 min is quite higher than the te exp 10 min the value of rate constant k0 is 0 424 mg g min and r2 0 99 ratifying the linearity of the experimental values with the zero order model but the χ2 and ses values found very high in the zero order kinetic model therefore the pseudo first order model was examined 3 8 2 pseudo first order the values obtained from experiments were fitted to the pseudo first orde eq 14 and results are shown in fig s8 and table 3 the kinetic parameters were found to be q1 cal 5 mg g and r2 0 95 which revealed that the experimental values fitted to pseudo first order though the low value of q1 calc 5 mg g and k1 0 07 min 1 were obtained in the present study hence the pseudo first order found incompetent to define the order of ofx adsorption onto hrp csgon a similar observation was reported by ho and mckay 1998 kumar et al 2005 3 8 3 pseudo second order further pseudo second order kinetic studied using eq 15 and results are shown in fig s9 and table 3 the rate constant k2 0 003 g mg min determined by intercept and q2 calc 400 mg g obtained from slope furthermore the value of r2 is 0 99 shows linearity with experimental results it suggests that the adsorption is mainly by a chemical reaction in between ofx molecules and the surface functional groups on hrp csgon nethaji et al 2013 therefore pseudo second order considered a best fit model and representing the hrp csgon ofx interactions these findings supported by other findings singh et al 2019 yusuf et al 2015 3 9 validity test the validity of the kinetic models is tested with the ses and chi square χ2 values χ2 and ses values were determined and presented in table 3 it was observed that smaller values were obtained by the pseudo second order model χ2 8 9 10 8 and ses 2 06 10 7 than to zero and pseudo first order kinetic models hence the best fit model for ofx adsorption on hrp csgon in present study was pseudo second order model 3 10 determination of rate controlling step to identify the specific adsorption mechanism in a particular adsorption system it is necessary to know the rate controlling step in the adsorption process the rate controlling step exerts a substantial effect on the overall rate of the reaction and very essential for the design of adsorption systems karthikeyan et al 2010 according to literature adsorption may occur in four steps for considering all aspects of mass transfer i external mass transfer ii diffusion due to film layer iii diffusion due to opening of the adsorbent and iv reaction controlling process a similar adsorption mechanism was also proposed by naicker et al 2020 for the removal of cr vi and singh et al 2017 for the removal of dyes using agriculture waste in the present work step i was neutralized by agitation during the adsorption experiments step ii iii and iv were investigated to determine the specific adsorption kinetic model in the present study liquid film layer intra particle diffusion model and elovich models studied using eq 16 18 3 10 1 adsorption due to intraparticle diffusion the intra particle diffusion model was studied by plotting the experimental data in eq 16 and the plot is given in fig 5 according to weber and morris 1963 intra particle diffusion is the rate limiting step when the plot of qt versus t1 2 start from the origin if the plot is not passing to the origin and intercept is present indicates film diffusion is also taking part in the process the value of the intercept provides the idea of film layer thickness in the present study kid and intercept were calculated from the slope and intercept values from fig 5 and the results are tabulated in table 3 the high kid 53 mg g min1 2 that reflects higher porosity of hrp csgon which match with the sem results further a high value of intercept 88 mg g table 4 which is higher than zero suggesting the adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon could not be elucidated only by intra particle diffusion mechanism it was revealed from fig 5 that the adsorption processes followed three stages the stage i is completed in 10 min by diffusion of ofx ions from the solution to the hrp csgon surface stage ii shows the chemical interaction between the ofx ions and hrp csgon due to liquid film and pore diffusion finally in stage iii a straight line displays adsorbent saturation phase after that no sites are available for adsorption of ofx this finding is in agreement with medhi et al 2020 naicker et al 2020 3 10 2 adsorption due to liquid film diffusion boyd model 1947 was employed in order to investigate the edges in between liquid and solid phases using eq 17 the results are shown in fig s10 and table 3 from table 3 it can be observed that there is an enormous difference in the value of kid 53 and kld 0 03 that indicating a slow rate of ofx ion carriage from solution to the surface of hrp csgon during the adsorption process kumar et al 2005 these findings are confirming that both film and pore diffusion are controlling the adsorption mechanisum of ofx using hrp csgon the intercept values are 88 and 1 9 obtained from pore and liquid film diffusion models respectively when comparing to the intercept value with zero value it suggests that liquid film diffusios have a major role in the kinetics than pore diffusion podder and majumder 2017 3 10 3 elovich model elovich constants β and α were determined using eq 18 and the results are shown in fig s11 and table 3 in table 3 the larger value of α is 1 9 1016 indicates a higher degree of chemisorption and suggesting chemisorption could be one of the rate controlling steps in the present study the lower value of β 0 04 shows indicating fast adsorption and lower activation energy for chemisorption and value of r2 suggesting the rate controlling mechanism in order of intra particle elovich liquid film diffusion ahmad et al 2015 hossain and hossain 2014 3 11 limitation of the present study although the study has successfully demonstrated the potential of hrp csgon in removing ofx from aqueous solution it has certain limitations first csgon prepared by direct mixing of cs and go at ph 7 conditions which is very simple however strong electrostatic interaction between go and cs leads to an increase in the thickness of the solution which is harmful for he mixing therefore it is suggested that for making of homogeneous csgon solution first prepare alkaline go solution and then disperse in cs in alkaline condition carboxyl groups neutralized by oh and as result more negative charges generated on go particles chen et al 2013 secondly avoid the use of hrp csgon in direct contact of strong acid alkaline and very high temperature conditions for the protection of enzyme denaturation 3 12 comparison with existing literature in order to prove that the adsorption capacity of hrp csgon for removal of ofx a literature survey was carried out and tabulated in table 4 when comparing our results to those of older studies given in table 4 it must be pointed out that the maximum ofx uptake by hrp csgon was 378 mg g in this study and 100 removal in only 10 min than the other adsorbents the most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was reusability and eco friendlyness 4 conclusion present investigation leads to the following conclusions 1 characterization results sem xrd and ft ir confirm the successful hrp csgon synthesis and adsorption of ofx on the hrp csgon surface 2 the properties of prepared hrp csgon demonstrated that it has better ph and temperature stability than free enzyme and shows admirable reusability and shelf life 3 in a batch study the effect of ph revealed that at ph 6 to 7 maximum ofx adsorption capacity on hrp csgon was achieved because at ph 6 to 7 the zwitterion was prevalent and high electrostatic interaction between electron donor and acceptor occurred also ofx removal is highly dependent on ofx concentration ultra sonication time and temperature of the reaction the maximum adsorption capacity was found 378 mg g in the present work this is the first report to use hrp csgon as adsorbent and had a large adsorption capacity 4 the thermodynamic study revealed that the adsorption of ofx on hrp csgon is a spontaneous process and endothermic in nature the equilibrium data confirming the monolayer coverage of ofx on hrp csgon particles the kinetics study shows the best fit of pseudo second order reaction the mechanistic study is conveying the complex interaction of ofx on hrp csgon which involved solid to liquid chemical interactions and liquid film diffusion 5 the present study revealed the prospect of using an hrp csgon adsorbent for the treatment of highly contaminated effluent of the pharmaceutical industry which demonstrated much enhanced outcomes in comparison to adsorbent reported earlier 6 the encouraging results of hrp csgon presented its future scope of application for the removal of other contaminants on a big scale declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data the
