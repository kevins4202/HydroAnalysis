depth continues to increase with a geometric progression of time westrich and kobus 1973 found that the maximum scour depth and scour width show a logarithmic time dependence during the main phase of the scouring process dimensional analysis was used to develop the appropriate parameters to describe the scour hole depth many researchers mih and kabir 1983 aderibigbe and rajaratnam 1996 yeh et al

is the gravitational acceleration δ ρ is the difference between the densities of sand and water ρ is the mass density of the fluid d 50 is the median bed particle sizes d is the jet nozzle diameter it has been found that scouring is affected by inter dependent jet parameters and sediment characteristics as well as scour time the jet parameters include jet diameter jet velocity impingement height and sedimentary characteristics including sediment bed particle diameter and particle density water jet scouring on cohesive sediment beds is more complex than that on non cohesive sediment because cohesive sediment particles are held together by internal cohesive forces mazurek et al 2001 sang et al 2014 wardinski et al 2018 while non cohesive sediment beds are eroded in the form of individual grains cohesive sediment beds are scoured in the form of lumps of particles called chunks or flakes ansari et al 2007 ansari et al 2003 reported that the scour characteristics for cohesive beds differ from those of non cohesive sediment beds under the same jet flow conditions the scour hole profile is typically uneven for cohesive sedimentary beds mazurek et al 2001 moore and masch 1962 hou et al 2016 while it is smooth for non cohesive sedimentary beds mih and kabir 1983 aderibigbe and rajaratnam 1996 yeh et al 2009 haddadchi et al 2018 the parameters influencing the maximum scour depth d se for a submerged vertical water jet impinging on a cohesive sediment beds are given by moore and masch 1962 2 d s e h t μ ρ d 2 ρ u 0 d μ h d σ s ρ d 2 u 2 where d se is the scour hole depth t is the scour duration μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid σ s is the scour resistance property of the cohesive sediment which may be considered the cohesiveness between particles mazurek et al 2001 suggested that the scour hole depth at equilibrium is given by the following function 3 d e h f ρ u 0 2 d h 2 τ c ρ u 0 d μ where τ c is the critical shear stress for the mass erosion of the cohesive soils comparing equation 1 to equation 2 and equation 3 it is found that the cohesive force between sediment particles has a significant effect on the scour depth of cohesive sediment beds and the parameters τ c and σ s may be closely related to the cohesive force moreover the cohesive force of cohesive sediment is related to many factors and the water content between particles is one of the key factors however the cohesive force between particles is greatly affected by the water content of soil as the presence of water influences the properties of submerged cohesive sediments being the liquid bridges that are formed between particles samadani and kudrolli 2001 it was observed that the maximum scour depth on cohesive beds at the equilibrium stage of scouring depends not only on the flow characteristics but also on the water content of the sedimentary bed sang et al 2014 ansari et al 2003 observed that the maximum scour depth increases slightly with an increase in the dimensionless water content w w l where w is the water content of the sediment bed and w l is the liquid limit of the sediment samples the critical shear stress which is an important parameter for determining scour depth matsushi and matsukura 2006 mostafa et al 2008 rahimnejad and phillip 2016 nguyen et al 2017 is also closely related to the water content for cohesive sediments gularte et al 1980 found that the decrease in critical erosional shear stress with increased water content as observed in this research follows from increased interparticle spacing weakening the internal force system at the sediment water interface wan and fell 2004 investigated that the erosion rate index i which can represent the rate of erosion of a soil is influenced strongly by the water content of the soil otsubo and muraoka 1988 investigated that the value of the critical shear stress of cohesive sediment is strongly related to the water content furthermore zhang et al 2017b indicated that not only the particle size but also the yield stress and water content of cohesive sediment significantly influence the critical shear stress of incipient motion and the scour rate of cohesive sediment the cohesiveness between particles would significantly affect the motion of cohesive sediments which is different from the non cohesive sediments thus it can be deduced that the scour characteristics for cohesive beds may be closely related to their water contents the purpose of the present study is to quantitatively explore the effects of the initial water content and excess bed shear stress on scour hole dimensions laboratory experiments were conducted using a submerged vertical water jet impinging on cohesive beds and parameters such as the nozzle diameter jet velocity impingement height scour duration water content and critical shear stress were considered in addition the scour rate was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the laboratory of shanghai jiao tong university fig 1 shows the experimental setup comprising a circular plastic water tank a jet nozzle with pipe centrifugal pump stepper motor flowmeter and a cylindrical bucket diameter of 200 mm and height of 210 mm with cohesive sediment bed the dimensions of the sample bucket are similar to those employed in the study of ngunyen et al 2017 who used a 117 mm high and 101 6 mm diameter mold to fill the sediment samples however the dimensions of the sample mold in the present experiments are bigger than those of the device of nguyen et al 2017 in order to obtain accurate scour hole dimensions the water tank was 0 66 m in diameter and 0 75 m deep the dimensions of the water tank are different from those of the device of hanson and cook 2004 which may affect the distribution of the bed shear stress nguyen et al 2017 the water jet was created by the pump motor through the nozzle of a 0 019 m diameter cylindrical pipe the nozzle was maintained vertically and at 0 1 m mazurek et al 2001 below the water surface during testing to create a stable submerged environment for the jet the impingement height h was measured from the bottom of the nozzle to the sediment bed a 250 w stepper motor was used to raise or hover the impingement height 30 150 mm as required the nozzle diameters d were 3 5 and 7 mm mazurek et al 2001 the length of the nozzle was 19 mm for the different nozzle diameters there is some contraction of the jet before the nozzle exit the jet discharge was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter the jet velocities from the nozzle exit were in range of 8 5 18 5 m s mazurek et al 2001 and the jet nozzle reynolds number was in the range of 40 000 to 75 000 which indicates that the jet effect was independent from the dimensions of the sediment samples and the submerged tank peterson and rajaratnam 1989 2 2 test materials the cohesive sediment samples used in this experimental research were remolded and the original sediments were taken from yangcheng lake china table 1 lists the properties of the tested sediment including the grain particle density dry density mean sediment size d 50 liquid limit w l plastic limit w p and water content w the test sediments mainly comprised clay silt and fine sand with d 50 0 014 mm the particle size distribution is shown in fig 2 the liquid and plastic limits of the test sediments are 53 5 and 22 5 respectively to determine the different water contents of the test sediments the initial water content had to be known in advance a sediment sample weighing approximately 800 g pandey et al 2019 was taken and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the initial water content was evaluated by measuring the water loss after heating the samples in the oven the appropriate amount of water was respectively added to the original sediments to achieve different designed water contents the water sediment mixture was stored in a steel bucket and an electric mixer was used to stir the sample afterwards the well mixed sediment of 10 12 kg was taken to fill the test container to its rim fifteen buckets were filled with the sample sediment for the tests the surface of the sediment bed was leveled and covered using a plastic film to retain the water content then the test sediment was left to stand for 24 h sang et al 2014 the water content of the cohesive sediment samples ranged from 30 to 50 similar to the water content of some nature fields kimiaghalam et al 2016 kamphuis and hall 1983 aberle et al 2004 2 3 test procedure the plastic film over the test sample was removed and the test sample was placed at the center of a test water column tank so that the center of the bed was positioned directly below the jet nozzle tap water was added slowly to the tank until the water level overflowed then the pump was turned on with the flow control valve adjusted to the appropriate jet velocity and the nozzle was gradually lowered using the stepper motor to determine the critical impingement height h c at which scouring was observed the shear stress of the cohesive sediment bed was estimated based on the critical impingement height and the jet velocity the jet nozzle was then lowered further to the designated jet height and the stopwatch was started the jet was stopped after a predetermined scouring period which would not significantly affect the scour depth in the experiments the scour durations were 1 2 3 5 and 10 min respectively the test tank was then drained and the sediment was removed the scour hole dimensions were measured after all water in the sediment tank was drained and the scour hole depth d s e and width w i d were recorded 2 4 critical shear stress estimation according to karamigolbaghi et al 2017 at any time after starting the jet the bed shear stress τ in the jet impingement zone may be expressed as 4 τ c s ρ u 0 2 h d 2 where c s is the shear stress coefficient hanson and cook 2004 assumed c s 0 16 the value of c s was determined based on direct measurements of the shear stress on a smooth surface beneath an impinging jet using the hot film probe by hanson et al 1990 the critical shear stress τ c is then estimated by 5 τ c c s ρ u c 2 h c d 2 where τ c is the critical shear stress for the initial scour of the cohesive sediment bed u c is the critical velocity and h c is the critical impingement height at which the height when mass scouring scouring with masses of over 2 mm thickness is first observed mazurek et al 2001 here the critical shear stress of the cohesive sediments is defined as the condition when obvious mass scouring is observed at the onset of mass scour the impingement height satisfies the rule h d 8 3 and the water velocity of the nozzle exit is high enough to erode the cohesive sediment bed hence the jet in the present experiments was at a large impingement height defined by beltaos and rajaratnam 1977 as h d 8 3 and was fully developed before impinging on the boundary karamigolbaghi et al 2017 ghaneeizad et al 2015 there was a certain amount of subjective judgment involved therefore the experiments were repeated four times for each test and the mean value was used as the final critical impingement height h c the critical shear stresses of the sedimentary beds with 28 water contents were determined through adjusting h or u 0 to obtain the corresponding h c and u c the results of the critical shear stress test were shown in table 2 3 results and analysis 3 1 test results a total of 81 sets of laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the scour hole dimensions of the sedimentary beds and the experimental results are summarized in table 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the scour holes were irregular in shape the scour hole profile was sharper for test no 46 which had a higher jet velocity and blunter for test no 47 which had a lower jet velocity in the latter case the scour rate was low as the energy of the jet was not sufficient to scour the deeper sediment samples and dissipated in the relatively shallow hole for the higher jet velocity value the jet had stronger scouring ability causing a relatively deeper scour hole the results were similar with the strongly deflected scour profiles and weakly deflected scour profiles mazurek et al 2001 fig 4 a shows the influence of the jet impingement height and scour duration on the scouring hole with 42 5 water content 0 5 cm water jet nozzle diameter and 11 1 m s jet velocity the scour depth decreased while the scour width increased with the jet impingement height for the larger h value the maximum shear stress of the jet was lower and had wider distribution causing a relatively wide shallow scour hole when the submerged jet had a higher jet velocity or smaller impingement height the jet energy was more concentrated in the axial direction and the scour hole profile was sharper when the submerged jet had a lower jet velocity or larger impingement height the jet energy was more likely to diffuse and the scour hole profile was more blunt as shown in fig 3 b fig 4 b shows that the scour hole dimensions increased non linearly with the nozzle velocity for the nozzle diameter d 0 5 cm impingement height h 12 5 cm and water contents of cohesive samples w 42 2 43 1 and 44 9 respectively for the larger w value the cohesive sediment bed was more likely to erode causing a relatively large scour hole 3 2 dimensions of scour hole the scour hole depth d se can be considered as a function of the following parameters 6 d s e f t μ d ρ h u 0 τ c w w l according to previous studies on jet scouring these variables can be integrated into three dimensionless terms 1 the dimensionless scour duration ln tμ ρd2 moore and masch 1962 2 the dimensionless water content w w l ansari et al 2003 and 3 the dimensionless excess shear stress τ τ c τ c mazurek and hossain 2007 the relationships between the dimensionless scour depth and these three dimensionless terms are shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively it can be seen from fig 5 a that the dimensionless scour hole depth logarithmically varies with the scour duration ln tμ ρd 2 and the results are similar to those of moore and masch 1962 in fig 5 b the dimensionless scour depth increases quasi linearly with w w l the scour depth is also well correlated with τ τ c τ c as in fig 5 c using a dimensional analysis and selecting u 0 d and h as repeating variables combined with equation 4 equation 6 may be written as 7 d s e h f 1 ln t μ ρ d 2 w w l τ τ c τ c similarly the scour hole width may be expressed as 8 w i d h f 2 ln t μ ρ d 2 w w l τ τ c τ c where the scour hole depth is d s e and the scour width is w id according to a multivariate regression analysis of the present experimental data the depth and width of the scour hole may be written respectively as 9 d s e h 0 27 ln t μ ρ d 2 0 507 w w l 1 993 τ τ c τ c 0 704 10 w i d h 0 617 ln t μ ρ d 2 0 33 w w l 0 387 τ τ c τ c 0 412 the results calculated using equations 9 and 10 were compared with the measured data figs 6 and 7 meanwhile equations 7 and 8 were established based on the experimental data in figs 6 and 7 therefore the results are considered accurate the correlation coefficient values r 2 are 0 95 and 0 86 for these two relationships respectively equations 9 and 10 were verified using the mazurek data mazurek 2001 in mazurek s tests the clayey soil comprised 40 clay 53 silt and 7 fine sand the average water content of the scouring sediment was approximately 26 the undrained shear strength was approximately 20 kpa the liquid limit was 36 the plastic limit was 18 and the dry density was approximately 1540 kg m3 as can be seen in figs 6 and 91 3 of the scour depth data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 fig 7 shows that 87 of the scour width data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 thus equations 9 and 10 show good agreement with mazurek s data terra cotta clay was used to study jet scouring hedges 1990 the water content of the tested bed was approximately 27 1 and the scouring durations were 5 10 and 15 min although the volume loss from scouring was measured rather than the scour hole dimensions the average scour hole depth may be estimated as the cube root of the volume loss moore and masch 1962 fig 6 shows that 83 3 of hedges data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 indicating that equation 9 also agrees well with hedges data 3 3 formula of scour rate at the initial state of scouring process estimating the scour rate at the initial stage of the scouring process where it is not significantly affected by the scour depth is helpful for the jet scouring operations in trenching or dredging because it can be used to determine the forward moving speed of the jet apparatus for scouring using a steady jet in a fixed position it can be observed from the present tests that the scour hole developed quickly during the initial stage and gradually slowed after some time as the depth of the scour hole increased the volume of sediment scoured from the hole decreased further the scour rate varied linearly with the excess bed shear stress and increased with the water content of the beds as shown in fig 8 the mean scour rate of the cohesive sediment induced by a submerged vertical water jet may be expressed as follows 11 e 0 000382 w w l 3 595 τ τ c τ c 0 364 where e is the rate of the scour depth during the initial stage equation 11 was compared to the measured data with r2 of 0 92 eighty seven percent of which fell into a band with a confidence interval of 25 relative error equation 11 was further verified using the experimental data from wardinski et al 2018 fig 9 shows that this equation fits well with the data as 89 of the data fell into a band with a confidence interval of 30 4 discussion the present experimental results show that the scouring depth and width of cohesive sediments increase with water content however there may be an optimum water content for the sediment sample which has the highest erosion resistance mostafa et al 2008 wan and fell 2004 nguyen et al 2017 on the one hand beyond the optimum water content the erosion resistance decreases with the increase of water content on the other hand below the optimum water content there may be an increase in the erosion resistance with the increase of water content in the present experiments the sediments were submerged by the water so that the cohesive sediment was generally beyond the optimum water content and the dimensions of the scour hole positively correlated with the increased water content sometimes such as for river banks and intertidal zones the cohesive beds may be smaller than the optimum water content because of the lack of water in which case the present equations may not be applicable therefore the water content of the sediment bed is a very important factor affecting the scour hole dimensions and the optimum water content requires further studying the present experiments only focused on the evolution and development process of the scour hole dimensions at the initial stage rather than that at the equilibrium stage it is apparent from fig 10 that the scour depth increases rapidly during the initial stage of the scouring process after which the depth increases more slowly there are a series of time points which may be turning points after which the scour depth increases more slowly in fig 10 the pink dashed line represents the trend line of the turning points furthermore the present experiments used a steady submerged water jet at a fixed height above the cohesive sediment beds however the scouring process may be induced by a dynamic water jet zhao 2019 such as a pulsatile or moving jet which would add to the complexity of the scouring process the dynamic jet changes the mean flow field and turbulence characteristics kobus et al 1979 and generates oscillatory shear loads which may fluidize the cohesive sediment bed yang and yu 2018 therefore the scour hole dimension and scour rate equations proposed herein would not be applicable for dynamic water jet scouring in the present experiments only one type of sediments with certain particle size was used however different types of soils may have different behavior under water jet scouring which require further studying for constant water content as the particle size increased the scour rate increased rapidly for the smaller particles reached a maximum and then decreased rapidly for the larger particles roberts et al 1998 in addition the in situ void ratio directly influences the scour hole dimensions and scour rates and a kaolinite soil with a low void ratio value takes longer to reach the state of equilibrium than the same soil with a higher void ratio kuti and yen 1976 moreover it is already known that other significant parameters for the erodibility of cohesive sediments are the mineralogy organic contents and biological properties grabowski et al 2011 in practical engineering applications the diameter of the noncontact jet trencher nozzle is 0 85 m and the velocity is 9 4 m s zhang et al 2017a the primary cause of the scouring of the sedimentary bed is the flow impinging on the bed surface although the diameter of the jet trencher nozzle in the practical engineering application is 12 17 times that in the present experiment the jet velocity in this study was made to be the same as that in zhang et al 2017a moreover the parameters in our equations are dimensionless so that the result will be useful for trenching engineering works as expected the mechanism of scouring by the submerged vertical water jet in the application field is very complex such as jet trenching works accompanied with scouring collapse and sedimentation zhang et al 2017a thus it is necessary to study this further in a true scale field experiment 5 conclusion in this study 81 sets of laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the scour hole induced by submerged water jets impinging vertically on to a cohesive sediment bed the effect of the water content on the scour hole dimensions was explored the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 scour hole development depends not only on the jet velocity scouring time impingement height and jet diameter but also on the water content and critical shear stress of the cohesive sediment the depth and width of the scour hole increase with increasing water content of the cohesive sedimentary bed 2 the dimensionless scour hole depth was proportional to the dimensionless scour duration ln tμ ρd2 dimensionless water content w w l and dimensionless excess shear stress τ τ c τ c based on the dimensional analysis equations for estimating the scour depth and width at the initial stage of the scouring process were proposed the predicted scour hole depths and widths agree well with the presented and reported experimental data of other studies 3 the scour rate in the initial stage of the scouring process varies linearly with excess bed shear stress accordingly an equation for estimating the scour rate at the initial scouring stage was proposed

which may affect the distribution of the bed shear stress nguyen et al 2017 the water jet was created by the pump motor through the nozzle of a 0 019 m diameter cylindrical pipe the nozzle was maintained vertically and at 0 1 m mazurek et al 2001 below the water surface during testing to create a stable submerged environment for the jet the impingement height h was measured from the bottom of the nozzle to the sediment bed a 250 w stepper motor was used to raise or hover the impingement height 30 150 mm as required the nozzle diameters d were 3 5 and 7 mm mazurek et al 2001 the length of the nozzle was 19 mm for the different nozzle diameters there is some contraction of the jet before the nozzle exit the jet discharge was measured using an electromagnetic flowmeter the jet velocities from the nozzle exit were in range of 8 5 18 5 m s mazurek et al 2001 and the jet nozzle reynolds number was in the range of 40 000 to 75 000 which indicates that the jet effect was independent from the dimensions of the sediment samples and the submerged tank peterson and rajaratnam 1989 2 2 test materials the cohesive sediment samples used in this experimental research were remolded and the original sediments were taken from yangcheng lake china table 1 lists the properties of the tested sediment including the grain particle density dry density mean sediment size d 50 liquid limit w l plastic limit w p and water content w the test sediments mainly comprised clay silt and fine sand with d 50 0 014 mm the particle size distribution is shown in fig 2 the liquid and plastic limits of the test sediments are 53 5 and 22 5 respectively to determine the different water contents of the test sediments the initial water content had to be known in advance a sediment sample weighing approximately 800 g pandey et al 2019 was taken and dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the initial water content was evaluated by measuring the water loss after heating the samples in the oven the appropriate amount of water was respectively added to the original sediments to achieve different designed water contents the water sediment mixture was stored in a steel bucket and an electric mixer was used to stir the sample afterwards the well mixed sediment of 10 12 kg was taken to fill the test container to its rim fifteen buckets were filled with the sample sediment for the tests the surface of the sediment bed was leveled and covered using a plastic film to retain the water content then the test sediment was left to stand for 24 h sang et al 2014 the water content of the cohesive sediment samples ranged from 30 to 50 similar to the water content of some nature fields kimiaghalam et al 2016 kamphuis and hall 1983 aberle et al 2004 2 3 test procedure the plastic film over the test sample was removed and the test sample was placed at the center of a test water column tank so that the center of the bed was positioned directly below the jet nozzle tap water was added slowly to the tank until the water level overflowed then the pump was turned on with the flow control valve adjusted to the appropriate jet velocity and the nozzle was gradually lowered using the stepper motor to determine the critical impingement height h c at which scouring was observed the shear stress of the cohesive sediment bed was estimated based on the critical impingement height and the jet velocity the jet nozzle was then lowered further to the designated jet height and the stopwatch was started the jet was stopped after a predetermined scouring period which would not significantly affect the scour depth in the experiments the scour durations were 1 2 3 5 and 10 min respectively the test tank was then drained and the sediment was removed the scour hole dimensions were measured after all water in the sediment tank was drained and the scour hole depth d s e and width w i d were recorded 2 4 critical shear stress estimation according to karamigolbaghi et al 2017 at any time after starting the jet the bed shear stress τ in the jet impingement zone may be expressed as 4 τ c s ρ u 0 2 h d 2 where c s is the shear stress coefficient hanson and cook 2004 assumed c s 0 16 the value of c s was determined based on direct measurements of the shear stress on a smooth surface beneath an impinging jet using the hot film probe by hanson et al 1990 the critical shear stress τ c is then estimated by 5 τ c c s ρ u c 2 h c d 2 where τ c is the critical shear stress for the initial scour of the cohesive sediment bed u c is the critical velocity and h c is the critical impingement height at which the height when mass scouring scouring with masses of over 2 mm thickness is first observed mazurek et al 2001 here the critical shear stress of the cohesive sediments is defined as the condition when obvious mass scouring is observed at the onset of mass scour the impingement height satisfies the rule h d 8 3 and the water velocity of the nozzle exit is high enough to erode the cohesive sediment bed hence the jet in the present experiments was at a large impingement height defined by beltaos and rajaratnam 1977 as h d 8 3 and was fully developed before impinging on the boundary karamigolbaghi et al 2017 ghaneeizad et al 2015 there was a certain amount of subjective judgment involved therefore the experiments were repeated four times for each test and the mean value was used as the final critical impingement height h c the critical shear stresses of the sedimentary beds with 28 water contents were determined through adjusting h or u 0 to obtain the corresponding h c and u c the results of the critical shear stress test were shown in table 2 3 results and analysis 3 1 test results a total of 81 sets of laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the scour hole dimensions of the sedimentary beds and the experimental results are summarized in table 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the scour holes were irregular in shape the scour hole profile was sharper for test no 46 which had a higher jet velocity and blunter for test no 47 which had a lower jet velocity in the latter case the scour rate was low as the energy of the jet was not sufficient to scour the deeper sediment samples and dissipated in the relatively shallow hole for the higher jet velocity value the jet had stronger scouring ability causing a relatively deeper scour hole the results were similar with the strongly deflected scour profiles and weakly deflected scour profiles mazurek et al 2001 fig 4 a shows the influence of the jet impingement height and scour duration on the scouring hole with 42 5 water content 0 5 cm water jet nozzle diameter and 11 1 m s jet velocity the scour depth decreased while the scour width increased with the jet impingement height for the larger h value the maximum shear stress of the jet was lower and had wider distribution causing a relatively wide shallow scour hole when the submerged jet had a higher jet velocity or smaller impingement height the jet energy was more concentrated in the axial direction and the scour hole profile was sharper when the submerged jet had a lower jet velocity or larger impingement height the jet energy was more likely to diffuse and the scour hole profile was more blunt as shown in fig 3 b fig 4 b shows that the scour hole dimensions increased non linearly with the nozzle velocity for the nozzle diameter d 0 5 cm impingement height h 12 5 cm and water contents of cohesive samples w 42 2 43 1 and 44 9 respectively for the larger w value the cohesive sediment bed was more likely to erode causing a relatively large scour hole 3 2 dimensions of scour hole the scour hole depth d se can be considered as a function of the following parameters 6 d s e f t μ d ρ h u 0 τ c w w l according to previous studies on jet scouring these variables can be integrated into three dimensionless terms 1 the dimensionless scour duration ln tμ ρd2 moore and masch 1962 2 the dimensionless water content w w l ansari et al 2003 and 3 the dimensionless excess shear stress τ τ c τ c mazurek and hossain 2007 the relationships between the dimensionless scour depth and these three dimensionless terms are shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively it can be seen from fig 5 a that the dimensionless scour hole depth logarithmically varies with the scour duration ln tμ ρd 2 and the results are similar to those of moore and masch 1962 in fig 5 b the dimensionless scour depth increases quasi linearly with w w l the scour depth is also well correlated with τ τ c τ c as in fig 5 c using a dimensional analysis and selecting u 0 d and h as repeating variables combined with equation 4 equation 6 may be written as 7 d s e h f 1 ln t μ ρ d 2 w w l τ τ c τ c similarly the scour hole width may be expressed as 8 w i d h f 2 ln t μ ρ d 2 w w l τ τ c τ c where the scour hole depth is d s e and the scour width is w id according to a multivariate regression analysis of the present experimental data the depth and width of the scour hole may be written respectively as 9 d s e h 0 27 ln t μ ρ d 2 0 507 w w l 1 993 τ τ c τ c 0 704 10 w i d h 0 617 ln t μ ρ d 2 0 33 w w l 0 387 τ τ c τ c 0 412 the results calculated using equations 9 and 10 were compared with the measured data figs 6 and 7 meanwhile equations 7 and 8 were established based on the experimental data in figs 6 and 7 therefore the results are considered accurate the correlation coefficient values r 2 are 0 95 and 0 86 for these two relationships respectively equations 9 and 10 were verified using the mazurek data mazurek 2001 in mazurek s tests the clayey soil comprised 40 clay 53 silt and 7 fine sand the average water content of the scouring sediment was approximately 26 the undrained shear strength was approximately 20 kpa the liquid limit was 36 the plastic limit was 18 and the dry density was approximately 1540 kg m3 as can be seen in figs 6 and 91 3 of the scour depth data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 fig 7 shows that 87 of the scour width data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 thus equations 9 and 10 show good agreement with mazurek s data terra cotta clay was used to study jet scouring hedges 1990 the water content of the tested bed was approximately 27 1 and the scouring durations were 5 10 and 15 min although the volume loss from scouring was measured rather than the scour hole dimensions the average scour hole depth may be estimated as the cube root of the volume loss moore and masch 1962 fig 6 shows that 83 3 of hedges data points fell within the error range of 35 to 35 indicating that equation 9 also agrees well with hedges data 3 3 formula of scour rate at the initial state of scouring process estimating the scour rate at the initial stage of the scouring process where it is not significantly affected by the scour depth is helpful for the jet scouring operations in trenching or dredging because it can be used to determine the forward moving speed of the jet apparatus for scouring using a steady jet in a fixed position it can be observed from the present tests that the scour hole developed quickly during the initial stage and gradually slowed after some time as the depth of the scour hole increased the volume of sediment scoured from the hole decreased further the scour rate varied linearly with the excess bed shear stress and increased with the water content of the beds as shown in fig 8 the mean scour rate of the cohesive sediment induced by a submerged vertical water jet may be expressed as follows 11 e 0 000382 w w l 3 595 τ τ c τ c 0 364 where e is the rate of the scour depth during the initial stage equation 11 was compared to the measured data with r2 of 0 92 eighty seven percent of which fell into a band with a confidence interval of 25 relative error equation 11 was further verified using the experimental data from wardinski et al 2018 fig 9 shows that this equation fits well with the data as 89 of the data fell into a band with a confidence interval of 30 4 discussion the present experimental results show that the scouring depth and width of cohesive sediments increase with water content however there may be an optimum water content for the sediment sample which has the highest erosion resistance mostafa et al 2008 wan and fell 2004 nguyen et al 2017 on the one hand beyond the optimum water content the erosion resistance decreases with the increase of water content on the other hand below the optimum water content there may be an increase in the erosion resistance with the increase of water content in the present experiments the sediments were submerged by the water so that the cohesive sediment was generally beyond the optimum water content and the dimensions of the scour hole positively correlated with the increased water content sometimes such as for river banks and intertidal zones the cohesive beds may be smaller than the optimum water content because of the lack of water in which case the present equations may not be applicable therefore the water content of the sediment bed is a very important factor affecting the scour hole dimensions and the optimum water content requires further studying the present experiments only focused on the evolution and development process of the scour hole dimensions at the initial stage rather than that at the equilibrium stage it is apparent from fig 10 that the scour depth increases rapidly during the initial stage of the scouring process after which the depth increases more slowly there are a series of time points which may be turning points after which the scour depth increases more slowly in fig 10 the pink dashed line represents the trend line of the turning points furthermore the present experiments used a steady submerged water jet at a fixed height above the cohesive sediment beds however the scouring process may be induced by a dynamic water jet zhao 2019 such as a pulsatile or moving jet which would add to the complexity of the scouring process the dynamic jet changes the mean flow field and turbulence characteristics kobus et al 1979 and generates oscillatory shear loads which may fluidize the cohesive sediment bed yang and yu 2018 therefore the scour hole dimension and scour rate equations proposed herein would not be applicable for dynamic water jet scouring in the present experiments only one type of sediments with certain particle size was used however different types of soils may have different behavior under water jet scouring which require further studying for constant water content as the particle size increased the scour rate increased rapidly for the smaller particles reached a maximum and then decreased rapidly for the larger particles roberts et al 1998 in addition the in situ void ratio directly influences the scour hole dimensions and scour rates and a kaolinite soil with a low void ratio value takes longer to reach the state of equilibrium than the same soil with a higher void ratio kuti and yen 1976 moreover it is already known that other significant parameters for the erodibility of cohesive sediments are the mineralogy organic contents and biological properties grabowski et al 2011 in practical engineering applications the diameter of the noncontact jet trencher nozzle is 0 85 m and the velocity is 9 4 m s zhang et al 2017a the primary cause of the scouring of the sedimentary bed is the flow impinging on the bed surface although the diameter of the jet trencher nozzle in the practical engineering application is 12 17 times that in the present experiment the jet velocity in this study was made to be the same as that in zhang et al 2017a moreover the parameters in our equations are dimensionless so that the result will be useful for trenching engineering works as expected the mechanism of scouring by the submerged vertical water jet in the application field is very complex such as jet trenching works accompanied with scouring collapse and sedimentation zhang et al 2017a thus it is necessary to study this further in a true scale field experiment 5 conclusion in this study 81 sets of laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the scour hole induced by submerged water jets impinging vertically on to a cohesive sediment bed the effect of the water content on the scour hole dimensions was explored the conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 scour hole development depends not only on the jet velocity scouring time impingement height and jet diameter but also on the water content and critical shear stress of the cohesive sediment the depth and width of the scour hole increase with increasing water content of the cohesive sedimentary bed 2 the dimensionless scour hole depth was proportional to the dimensionless scour duration ln tμ ρd2 dimensionless water content w w l and dimensionless excess shear stress τ τ c τ c based on the dimensional analysis equations for estimating the scour depth and width at the initial stage of the scouring process were proposed the predicted scour hole depths and widths agree well with the presented and reported experimental data of other studies 3 the scour rate in the initial stage of the scouring process varies linearly with excess bed shear stress accordingly an equation for estimating the scour rate at the initial scouring stage was proposed

22221,the generation mechanism and characteristics of peak values of tsunami bore vertical force are investigated comprehensively and thoroughly a scaled down two dimensional t girder model whose surface is divided into a series of panels is tested in the cases with fixed initial downstream water depth different incoming wave height and different initial clearance time history of vertical force is divided into four stages in which the impinging stage is further divided into four sub stages then the contribution rates of panels to the vertical force are discussed results show each peak value of vertical force in the impinging stage is composed of at least one peak value of vertical force on bottom panels of the girder the continue increase of vertical force peak value is the result of more and more panels suffering static pressure of entrapped air when the chambers are successively closed by tsunami bore the vertical force peak values on top panels of the chambers are mainly generated by the static pressure peak values of entrapped air the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocity of tsunami bore under already closed chambers resulting the simultaneous occurrences of pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers keywords tsunami force generation mechanism t girder computational fluid dynamics cfd dam break wave entrapped air flow field 1 introduction 498 tsunamis occurred in the 20th century and among which 66 caused catastrophes according to rhodes et al 2006 in the early 21st century there are two impressive tsunamis happened one is the 2004 indian ocean tsunami which caused death of more than 200 000 people and destruction of infrastructures according to unjoh and endoh 2006 more than 186 coastal bridges were washed away or seriously damaged in this disaster another is the 2011 tohoku japan tsunami which caused the death of more than 15 000 people and missing of more than 3400 people as well as destruction of more than 250 coastal bridges kasano et al 2012 salem et al 2014 the catastrophic damage caused by tsunami to infrastructures and human lives in coastal areas has aroused attention in the whole world unjoh and endoh 2006 investigated the damaged bridges in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that a large number of bridge superstructures were directly washed away or had large lateral displacement especially when no lateral constraints were set at the supports of the bridge superstructures these two failure types of costal bridge were proven to be the most common failure types by many post disaster investigation reports and relevant literatures kawashima 2012 maruyama et al 2012 what s worse the damage of bridges directly hinders the transportation required by rapid rescue and later reconstruction in the tsunami attacked area human cannot stop the tsunami but can avoid or minimize tsunami damage to bridges through anti tsunami design therefore it is essential to clarify the nature or the generation mechanism of the tsunami force acting on bridges especially as a vulnerable component of costal bridge superstructure draws wide attentions from researchers tsunami force on superstructure has been investigated specifically by yim 2005 sugimoto and unjoh 2007 mcpherson 2008 lau et al 2011 azadbakht 2013 sarfaraz and pak 2017 etc further the anti tsunami measures have been discussed in detail by pradono et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 nakao et al 2013 abukawa et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 meng 2016 etc based on the incompressible two dimensional two phase flow model zhou and ren 2015 calculated the time history of the horizontal drag force and vertical uplift force of the tsunami on bridge and concluded that the horizontal drag force is the immediate cause of the bridge damage in contrast the vertical force on superstructure has been discussed relatively less by investigating the bridges destroyed in the 2011 tohoku japan tsunami kawashima 2012 proposed two failure mechanisms of the bridge superstructure one is the failure under the action of horizontal force only and the other is the failure under the combined actions of vertical force and horizontal force since most of the bridge superstructures have no special lateral displacement restraint devices at the bearing its horizontal resistance is mainly provided by the transverse friction force generated by the weight of the bridge superstructure at the bearing the uplift force acting on the bridge superstructure reduces the gravity force of superstructure which then reduces the horizontal resistance and makes the superstructure more vulnerable to tsunami waves numerical simulations conducted by bricker et al 2011 with openfoam show that both vertical force and overturning moment may lead to the destruction of the bridge deck therefore the study of vertical lift force on bridge superstructure is as important as horizontal force although it has not been highly focused before sugimoto and unjoh 2007 experimentally studied the relationship between tsunami force and its influence parameters results show that horizontal force increases with wave height while the vertical force increases with initial water depth meanwhile the threshold values of dimensionless coefficients of horizontal and vertical force corresponding to different failure modes of bridge superstructure are suggested lau et al 2011 studied the tsunami surge force on the beam by means of experiment and numerical simulation and pointed out that the vertical force was composed of the vertical upward impact peak and the relatively gentle downward lift force after the beam was submerged araki et al 2011 found that the vertical force on bridge deck under tsunami wave is related to the type of tsunami wave i e the vertical force has two peaks under breaking wave the vertical force has only one peak under non breaking wave and the peak value caused by non breaking wave is smaller than that of breaking wave through physical experiments hoshikuma et al 2013 pointed out that when the tsunami hit the upstream side of the bridge deck the overhanging girder flange plate would lead to a large vertical lift and overturning moment meanwhile they found that the connecting device between the bridge superstructure and the substructure on the offshore side would fail azadbakht 2013 found that the maximum vertical force appeared at the moment when the tsunami water free surface elevation reaches the top of the bridge barrier right before the water overtopping the bridge and starting to flow onto the bridge beck and the maximum horizontal and downward vertical loads are found to occur approximately simultaneously when the tsunami flow reaches the landward side of the bridge cross section and overtops the barrier sarfaraz and pak 2017 used sph numerical simulation method to study the effect of initial submerged depth and the number of girders on the vertical force on t girder the results show that when the bridge deck is completely submerged at the initial stage number of girders has no effect on the upward force however when the bridge deck is elevated girder numbers of two makes the highest positive force the studies by lau et al 2011 mazinani et al 2014 and motley et al 2015 show the vertical force on superstructure is negative when it is completely submerged but the reason why the vertical force is negative and its generation mechanism have not been analyzed comprehensively and thoroughly study by salem et al 2014 shows the entrapped air between deck girders during tsunami had a significant effect on the behavior of the bridge the interaction between entrapped air tsunami bore and deck girder needs further investigation hayatdavoodi et al 2014 studied solitary wave forces on a coastal bridge deck they pointed out that the hydrodynamic force due to the entrapped air pockets appear to be a large portion of the total uplift force and it decreases as the wave amplitude increases also hayatdavoodi et al 2014 thought that the air pocket does not only affect the hydrostatic uplift force but also modify the wave and therefore the wave induced forces which is different from the assumption made by mcpherson 2008 seiffert et al 2015 studied wave loads on a coastal bridge deck and the role of entrapped air and they found that vertical forces could be significantly reduced when air relief openings are added to the structure also their study show an evidence of a slight cushioning effect due to compressibility of entrapped air azadbakht and yim 2015 also studied the effect of trapped air on wave force on coastal bridge superstructure when it suffers waves a novel analysis method which segments the bridge deck surface into panels and analyzes the contribution rate of each panel to the forces on the whole bridge deck has been employed in recent years xu et al 2016 studied the solitary wave force on a typical coastal bridge deck by decomposing the bridge deck into a series of panels and the wave force contribution of these components were discussed wu 2017 studied the tsunami forces on three types of bridge superstructure by means of numerical simulation in which the bridge decks are segmented into many panels and the contribution rate of each panel to horizontal force and vertical force were discussed also simplified calculation formulas of horizontal and vertical forces are presented winter et al 2017 studied the effects of different super elevation angles and girder spacing on the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each part panel of the bridge under the tsunami generally many articles studied the characteristics of horizontal force and vertical force on bridge decks when bridge decks suffer wave or tsunami bore the influencing parameters such as numbers of girder deck super elevation initial water depth wave height entrapped air as well as air venting holes etc are also widely studied note that in published articles the studies on wave force is obvious more than that on tsunami bore force although the tsunami bore is a kind of broken wave the wave field is quite different from tsunami bore field which results in considerable difference in characteristic of forces just as stated by araki et al 2011 among the tsunami bore force studies such as by winter et al 2017 motley et al 2015 etc few of them studied the generation mechanism of vertical force peak values in impinging stage thoroughly and comprehensively this study aims to explore generation mechanism of vertical force peak values thoroughly and comprehensively by decomposing the t girder surface into a series of panels and dividing the vertical force time history into four stages and further dividing the impinging stage into four sub stages in this study the numerical simulation model was built by ansys fluent the flow field was analyzed and the influence of two parameters i e wave height and initial clearance on vertical force was also discussed 2 numerical model and validation two tsunami bore generation methods i e by breaking the solitary wave on a slope at the end of the wave flume or wave tank and by dam break method are ordinarily used in physical experiment and numerical simulation the former method can fully reproduce the propagation and evolution of tsunami wave which was employed by lau et al 2011 chen 2014 meng 2016 etc the latter is to generate the tsunami bore by lifting the reservoir gate in an extremely short time which is simpler and more convenient therefore has been widely employed by researchers such as by ritter 1892 stoker 1957 chanson 2009 oertel and bung 2012 etc in their studies they have clarified that dam break bore can simulate the tsunami bore well further dam break bores have been widely used to study tsunami bore forces on structures such as by wong 2015 motley et al 2015 yang et al 2018 in this study the dam break method was used because this paper mainly focuses on the interaction process between tsunami bore and bridge superstructure but not propagation and evolution process of tsunami bore when approaching to shore 2 1 basic equations the software ansys fluent was chosen to solve the incompressible reynolds averaged form of the navier stokes rans equations in which the mass conservation equation and momentum equation are respectively as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x i x j ρ u i u i x j where u i is the time averaged velocity in which the indices i and j represents the directions of the coordinates x y z note that this index based notation implies the sum over a repeated index in terms involving multiple indices the time averaged velocity can be defined as u i 1 δ t t 0 t 0 δ t u i d t where the flow velocity can be decomposed to u i u i u i u i is the velocity fluctuation p is the time average pressure ρ is the density of water and μ is the dynamic viscosity the computational domain consists of water and air and the volume of fluid vof method is employed to track the free surface between two fluids as the dam break bores will deform and break intensively during their generation and advancing process especially when interacting with structures the reynolds number is expected to be around or larger than 1e5 therefore rng k ε turbulence model is chosen k ε model has already been used in similar studies such as lau et al 2011 motley et al 2015 yang et al 2018 etc the reynolds stress turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε are calculated from the following equations 3 ρ u i u j υ t ρ u i x j u j x i 2 3 κ ρ δ i j 4 κ t k u j x j x j υ υ t σ κ κ x j p κ ρ ε 5 ε t ε u j x j x j υ υ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε κ ρ p κ c ε 2 ε 2 κ in which p κ ρ u i u j u j x i υ t c μ ε 2 κ the constants c ε 1 c ε 2 and c μ are set as default values in ansys fluent i e c μ 1 42 c ε 2 1 68 c μ 0 0845 in the near wall region of structure the solution gradients are much high so the calculations in the near wall regions are critical to the precision of simulation scalable wall function is chosen to treat the boundary layer because it can avoid the deterioration of standard wall function under grid refinement when y is very small here y y μ ρ τ w where y is the distance from the wall to the center of the innermost cell and τ w is the wall shear stress the size of the most inner cell d s is twice of y and y is set as 60 in this study because reynolds number is large when tsunami bores interact with structures i e viscous force does not dominate 2 2 numerical model due to the shallow water effect tsunami wave breaks before attack the coastal bridge and transforms into tsunami bore therefore the tsunami bore cases but not tsunami wave or solitary wave cases are studied according to the research of wilkinson 2005 there are several tsunami bores when tsunami wave arrives at the coast and most of the time the first tsunami bore is not the largest but the second or the third one is namely the bridge piers are ordinarily submerged in water before attacked by the most intensive tsunami bore therefore the initial water depth at the bridge site is set larger than zero in the numerical model ordinarily there are diaphragms between neighboring girders which block the air flow along the longitudinal direction of bridge deck therefore using 2d models will generate ignorable difference compared with 3d models this view has been validated by wu 2017 but the computational efficiency of two dimensional numerical model is significantly higher than that of three dimensional numerical model the two dimensional numerical model shown in fig 1 is adopted in this study the total length of flume is 30 m of which the impoundment length is 12 m and downstream is 18 0 m the height of the flume is 1 m note that the origin of coordinate is set at the left lower corner of the flume the dam break happens at the instant when the gate disappears in numerical simulation the boundary conditions of numerical flume are set as follows the top of the flume is set as pressure outlet condition to allow air flow in or out of the flume the upstream and downstream boundaries and the bottom of flume are set as stationary wall boundary conditions the densities of water and air are 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and the viscosities of water and air are 1 003 10 6 m 2 s and 1 7894 10 5 m 2 s respectively the gravitational acceleration g is set as 9 81 m s 2 both structural grids and un structural grids are generated when meshing the computation domains in detail in core area around the bridge deck the un structural grids with thickness 0 0006 m at innermost and 0 005 m of overall mesh size are generated shown in fig 2 in other area far from bridge deck i e non core area structural grids with size of 0 01 m are generated the interface technique is used to connect the core area and non core area where the grid size begins to change from 0 005 m to 0 01 m with the change ratio 1 2 2 3 validation the precondition of accurate calculation of tsunami force on structure is the correct simulation of flow filed of tsunami bores therefore the flow field of tsunami bore is firstly validated by using the cases without bridge deck the following validating cases are named in the form of m n where m represents the incoming wave height h 2 h 0 and n represents the initial downstream water depth h 0 in h 2 h 0 h 2 represents the free surface height of tsunami bore the impoundment depth h 1 as well as h 2 and h 0 is demonstrated in fig 3 here h 0 is kept unchanged as 20 cm and h 2 h 0 changes from 12 cm to 24 cm with interval 2 cm specifically mass flow rate and free surface height were monitored at the cross sections x 12 m x 18 5 m x 19 0 m x 19 5 m x 20 0m and x 20 5 m then the cross section averaged flow velocity were calculated at these positions the time histories of free surface height at the monitoring positions of the cases 12 20 and 24 20 are shown in fig 4 compared with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 it can be observed that after the dam break bore arrives the free surface height at different monitoring position keeps basically unchanged and well consistent with stoker s theoretical solution no matter for which monitoring position the duration from the arrival of wave front to the arrival of the reflected wave generated by downstream end is larger than 6 5 s which is long enough to observe the whole interaction process between bore and structure therefore the bridge deck model will be placed at x 19 5 m in the numerical flume in the following study comparisons of the nondimensionalized wave height h 2 h 0 h 0 of each case with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 are shown in fig 5 in which h 0 of y axis is nondimensionalized by h 1 fig 5 indicates the present numerical model can predict the wave height very well further wave front velocity w can be calculated out by δ x δ t in which δ x is the distance between two monitoring positions and δ t is the difference between the arrival times of bore front arriving at the two monitoring positions the cross section averaged velocity u is calculated as follows a cross section plane was defined at x 19 5 m basically it is a line in 2d model to monitor the time history of mass flow rate r t and at the cross section plane time history of the free surface height h t were monitored then the cross section averaged velocity u can be estimated by r t h t the nondimensionalized wave front velocity w c 0 and cross section averaged velocity u c 0 in the steady stage are respectively compared with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 shown in fig 6 in which c 0 g h 0 1 2 is the wave propagation velocity fig 6 shows both the wave front velocity and cross section averaged velocity predicted by the present numerical model match the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 considerably well generally the present numerical model can accurately simulate the dam break bores and then the tsunami forces on structures can be further validated with confidence the physical experimental data of tsunami forces on t girder carried out by public works research institute nakao et al 2013 are used to validate the accuracy of the tsunami force on bridge deck by the present numerical model therefore the dimensions of the numerical flume the impoundment length and depth the downstream initial water depth and the bridge deck dimensions are completely the same as that in physical experiment conducted in public works research institute shorted as pwri hereafter meanwhile in order to verify the grid independence three schemes of grid size are tested coarse middle and fine grids which are detailed in table 1 the time history curves of horizontal and vertical forces predicted by the numerical model with three grid schemes are compared with the pwri results shown in fig 7 comparisons show that the curves of middle and fine schemes are both in good agreement with that of pwri implying that the numerical simulation method including turbulence model wall function grid size and boundary conditions etc in the above two cases are correct and could be employed to simulate the tsunami forces however the fine scheme has much lower calculation efficiency consuming more than 3 times of cpu time than the middle scheme shown in table 1 taking both precision and time cost into consideration middle scheme is adopted to mesh the computation domain in the following study 3 introduction of numerical calculation cases the most widely used superstructure of simply supported beam bridges in real practice in china i e t girder with the span of 20 m and width of 12 m is chosen as the prototype in this study the numerical model is a scaled down model with length scale ratio 1 20 shown in fig 8 in order to investigate the vertical force generation mechanism the t girder is decomposed into a series of panels just as xu et al 2016 wu 2017 and winter et al 2017 the panels are named as s1 s28 shown in fig 8 the t girder has five ribs and four chambers named as r1 r5 and b1 b4 respectively in real practice the submerged water depth of piers of coastal bridges is ordinarily about 3 m 5 m and the averaged submerged depth namely the downstream initial water depth is set as 4 m here as the influences of incoming wave height and initial clearance on vertical force will be discussed the incoming wave height is assumed to change from 2 4 m to 4 8 m and the initial clearance is assumed to change from 0 4 m to 1 2 m note that initial clearance is defined as the gap between the downstream initial water level and the bottom of the rib namely z 1 h 0 in fig 3 here 0 4 m means the t girder has been submerged before the attack of the most intensive tsunami bore and the submerged depth is 0 4 m considering the length scale ratio 1 20 all the cases with their detailed information are listed in table 2 in which m n c is adopted to name the cases where m represents the incoming wave height h 2 h 0 n represents the downstream initial water depth h 0 and c represents the initial clearance z 1 h 0 the definitions of the variables in table 2 can be found in fig 3 4 numerical simulation results and analysis 4 1 vertical force characteristics at stages and sub stages the vertical force on t girder changes violently with the time when attacked by tsunami bore note that upward vertical force is defined as positive and downward vertical force is defined as negative as a representative the vertical force time history of the case 20 20 4 is divided into four stages and then the impinging stage was further divided into four sub stages to explore the vertical force characteristics changing with time the vertical force time history between t 2 s and t 20 s is drawn in fig 9 a which can be divided into four stages as i impinging stage in this stage t 3 0 s 3 55 s tsunami bore reaches the t girder then impacts on the front panel of the girder runs up and overtops the upstream railing then impacts the bridge deck and reaches the downstream railing while the chambers are closed by tsunami bore gradually the vertical force is characterized as continuously increasing positive peak values and abrupt negative peak value ii decline stage in this stage t 3 55 s 4 5 s tsunami bore overtops the downstream railing then the bridge deck is gradually submerged by tsunami bore and the flow field around the girder gradually tends to relatively stable the vertical force increases slowly from negative and approaches to zero iii quasi stable stage in this stage t 4 5 s 12 9 s the girder is completely submerged and the flow field around the girder reaches relatively stable the vertical force is relatively but not absolutely stable in this stage the average value of the vertical force is defined as f y a v e s t a for convenience iv reflection stage in this stage t 12 9 s the reflected wave generated by the downstream wall reaches the downstream panels of the girder similar to impinging stage the vertical force is characterized as a series of positive peak values then it gradually decreases however this stage is out of our concern and will not be further analyzed in this study it can be deduced that the violent interaction between tsunami bore and t girder happens in the impinging stage as the vertical force changes sharply therefore it is reasonable to amplify the time axis of fig 9 a to scrutinize the abrupt changes of vertical force at those special instants shown in fig 9 b further the impinging stage t 3 0 s 3 55 s is divided into four sub stages and their characteristics as well as the generation mechanism of these peaks are discussed as follows 1 initial impinging sub stage t 3 0 s 3 05 s at t 3 0 s the tsunami bore arrives and touches upstream surface of the girder the vertical force rises rapidly from zero reaches the positive peak at t 3 03 s then drops rapidly and reaches the trough at t 3 05 s in this stage the peak value of vertical force is defined as the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f 2 runup sub stage t 3 05 s 3 19 s after t 3 05 s a part of tsunami bore runs up in the front of the upstream of the girder and a part of the tsunami bore flows under the girder and gradually closes the chambers the vertical force begins to increase with fluctuations and three positive peaks appear at t 3 09 s 3 13 s and 3 18 s which are respectively defined as the first second and third ascending peak values of vertical force namely f y m a x i m c f f y m a x i m c s and f y m a x i m c t 3 overtopping sub stage t 3 19 s 3 5 s the tsunami bore overtops the upstream railing of t girder at t 3 19 s and overturns towards the bridge deck the vertical force is positive and decrease slowly in the sub stage 4 second impinging stage t 3 5 s 3 55 s the overturning bore impinges onto the bridge deck and the vertical force decreases to the negative peak abruptly here the negative peak value of vertical force on the t girder is defined as the second impinging peak value f y m i n i m p s then the bore rushes to the downstream railing and begins to overtop the downstream railing accordingly the negative vertical force then begins to decrease in magnitude after t 3 55 s the vertical force enters the decline stage 4 2 contributions of panels to vertical force the vertical force on each panel shown in fig 8 was monitored and its contribution to the total vertical force on t girder at several critical instants in the impinging stage including its sub stages decline stage and quasi stable stage will be discussed to explore the vertical force generation mechanism 1 at t 3 03 s in initial impinging sub stage at t 2 96 s wave front of tsunami bore arrives at the lower part of the rib r1 but fails to impact the rib r1 because there is a 4 cm initial clearance under the rib r1 shown in fig 10 therefore the vertical force on the t girder is still zero with the rapid propagation of tsunami bore the wave front begins to impact the panel s5 of rib r1 and the water body over the rib r1 bottom runs up along panel s5 rolls upstream and impacts panel s16 which makes the vertical force on panel s16 increase suddenly shown in fig 11 at the same time part of tsunami bore flows under rib r1 and closes the chamber b1 at t 3 03 s approximately i e the air is entrapped in the chamber r1 and compressed by water at t 3 03 s the compressed air exerts relative larger pressure on panel s17 resulting a larger positive vertical force on s17 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches its initial impinging peak value i e f y m a x i m p f 450 1 n the contribution rate of each panel to the initial impact peak defined as r y m a x i i m p f 100 f y i f y m a x i m p f is shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the contributions of panels s16 s17 and s5 are respectively 95 5 13 0 and 8 7 while the contributions of other panels are almost zero when attacked by tsunami bore the force on the panels is mainly dominated by the pressure of fluid water or air while the shear force on the panels is very small and can be neglected therefore the vertical force on panel is related to the projection area the projection length for the 2d case of the panel on x axis whether the vertical force is positive or negative is up to direction of normal line of panel for example the normal line directions of panels s5 and s16 are respectively oblique upward and downward which results the vertical forces on panels s5 and s16 at t 3 03 s are negative and positive respectively also the dynamic pressure static pressure and total pressure contours are shown in fig 13 note that in ansys fluent the standard atmospheric pressure 1 013 10 5 pa is set as the reference pressure static pressure is defined as ρ g h p dynamic pressure is defined as 1 2 ρ v 2 total pressure is defined as sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure in which h is water depth p is pressure energy of fluid v is velocity of water by comparison it can be observed that the vertical forces on panel s16 s17 and s5 are mainly generated by static pressure 2 at t 3 09 s in runup sub stage as the tsunami bore propagates downstream the wave height as shown in fig 4 and the cross section averaged velocity increase sharply the violent impact of tsunami bore on panel s1 results in water splashing upstream shown in fig 14 but s1 is a vertical panel and the projection area length of s1 on the x axis is zero shown in fig 8 therefore vertical force on s1 is almost zero at the same time tsunami bore flows under the chamber b1 and almost closes the chamber b2 at t 3 09 s similarly the air in chamber b2 is entrapped and compressed at this instant which exerts a positive vertical force on panel s18 at t 3 09 s the vertical force on t girder in the runup sub stage reaches the first ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c f 787 5 n the contribution rate of each panel to the first ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c f 100 f y i f y m a x i m c f is shown in fig 15 the most prominent contribution is made by panel s18 42 7 then followed by the panels s17 s16 s25 and s24 with the contribution rates are 33 7 21 0 9 2 and 5 1 respectively and the contributions of other panels are almost zero also the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 16 it clearly shows that static pressure generated by the compressed air on the panel s18 and s17 and static pressure on panel s16 generated by water are the main source of the vertical force on t girder at this instant 3 at t 3 13 s in runup sub stage as time goes by the runup in the front of panel s1 increases and gradually becomes higher than panel s1 i e higher than the upstream railing of t girder at t 3 13 s part of runup water splashes upstream because of reaction force generated by panel s1 and the downstream side of the runup water almost keeps vertical shown in fig 17 meanwhile tsunami bore flowing around the bottom of the girder almost closes the chamber b3 as shown in fig 17 and the entrapped air in chamber b3 is compressed which generates a positive vertical force on panel s19 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches the second ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c s 966 8 n the contribution rate of each panel to the second ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c s 100 f y i f y m a x i m c s is shown in fig 18 the top four contribution rates are made by panels s19 s18 s17 and s16 whose contribution rates are 40 6 26 1 19 3 and 11 8 respectively and followed by panels s26 s25 and s24 the contributions of other panels are almost zero the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 19 the static pressure on panels s19 s18 and s17 generated by the compressed air in the chambers b3 b2 and b1 respectively and static pressure on panel s16 generated by water dominate the vertical force on t girder at t 3 13 s 4 at t 3 18 s in runup sub stage the runup height in the front of panel s1 continuously increases and the runup water begins to overtop the upstream railing flies and overturns downstream the tsunami bore flows around the bottom of the t girder and closes the chamber b4 at t 3 18 s approximately as shown in fig 20 similarly the entrapped air in chamber b4 is compressed exerting a positive vertical force on panel s20 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches the third ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c t 1457 1 n the contribution rate of each panel to the third ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c t 100 f y i f y m a x i m c t is shown in fig 21 the top five contribution rates are made by panels s20 s19 s18 s17 and s16 whose exact contribution rates are 33 3 22 3 18 4 10 3 and 9 0 respectively then followed by panels s27 s26 s25 and s24 the contributions of other panels are almost zero the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 22 the static pressure generated by the compressed air on panels s20 s19 s18 and s17 in chambers b4 b3 b2 and b1 respectively and the static pressure on panel s16 generated by water is the main source of the vertical force on t girder 5 at t 3 51 s in second impinging sub stage a large amount of bore overtops the upstream railing overturns downstream at a relatively high speed then impacts the bridge deck i e panel s15 at t 3 51 s as shown in fig 23 the impacting produces a negative vertical peak value the second impinging peak value on the t girder i e f y m i n i m p s 1287 0 n the contribution rate of each panel to the second impinging peak value defined as r y m i n i i m p s 100 f y i f y m i n i m p s is shown in fig 24 the top six contribution rates made by panels are s15 s18 s16 s20 s19 and s17 whose contribution rates are 126 0 8 6 6 6 5 8 5 3 and 4 6 respectively shown in fig 24 it indicates that the negative vertical force on the t girder is mainly induced by the negative force on panel s15 and the amplitudes of vertical forces on other panels are much small and are positive which decreases the amplitude of negative vertical force on t girder note that when tsunami bore impacts panel s15 a layer of air shaped in a triangle edged by panel s2 upstream part of panel s15 and bottom boundary of the overturning bore is entrapped and compressed by the impacting of the overturning bore as well as the gravity of overturning bore shown in fig 23 the negative vertical force on panel s15 exerted by the entrapped air is much larger than the direct impacting of tsunami bore as shown in fig 25 c comparing between fig 25 a and b it can be concluded that the negative vertical force on s15 is mainly generated by the static pressure of compressed air because the dynamic pressure intensity at the impacting position in fig 25 a is almost the same as the static pressure intensity generated by entrapped air in fig 25 b however the impacting area of the former is much smaller than the contact area of the entrapped air note that in real practice or in three dimensional model the air might not be captured by the overturning bore because the air can flow along the longitudinal direction or only a small part of air can be captured because of the non uniform impacting of tsunami bore on bridge deck under this condition the negative force on panel s15 may be mainly contributed by static pressure of water but not the entrapped air then the tsunami bore continuously overtops the upstream railing and impacts on the panel s15 but the impacting strength decreases continuously and the trapped air escapes continuously therefore the magnitude of the negative vertical force on panel s15 decreases gradually even if the water dead weight on s15 increases 6 at t 6 0 s in quasi stable stage at the t 6 0 s the air trapped at the top of t girder has completely escaped and the interaction between air and water in the four chambers below bridge deck is basically stable shown in fig 26 therefore the vertical force on t girder almost keeps stable i e the average vertical force f y a v e s t a 113 9 n the contribution rate of each panel to the average vertical force defined as r y a v e i s t a 100 f y i f y a v e s t a is shown in fig 27 the top seven contribution rates are made by panels s15 s20 s19 s16 s18 s17 and s21 their contribution rates are 489 4 103 9 80 0 66 5 61 3 45 3 and 24 5 respectively it can be concluded that the bridge deck panel s15 and bottom of girder panels s16 s21 are the main contributors of the vertical force among which panel s15 contributes the most the contributions of the other panels are almost zero omitted here the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 28 which shows the static pressure exerted by water and compressed air dominates the vertical force on the t girder 4 3 generation mechanism of vertical force peak values the contribution rate of each panel to the vertical force at the above six critical instants shows that the bottom plate s16 s21 are the main contributors of positive vertical force while panel s15 is the main contributor of negative vertical force on t girder this result agrees with study by winter et al 2017 in which bottom deck faces is claimed to be responsible for the vertical force of whole bridge deck also several peaks in vertical force were mentioned but their generation mechanism was not analyzed further time histories of vertical forces on panels s16 s20 in impinging stage are drawn in fig 29 it shows that total vertical force curve has the same fluctuations with vertical force curves of panels s16 s20 i e at an instant when peak value of total vertical force occurs at least one panel among s16 s20 suffers peak value of vertical force at this instant in other words any peak values of total vertical force is composed of at least one peak value of panels among s16 s20 moreover increase of the peak values of total vertical force with time can be observed in the impinging stage in fig 29 and can also be obviously observed in fig 30 in which peak values of resultant force on panels s16 s21 vertical force on s15 and total force on bridge superstructure are compared note that the instants when the peak values occur i e t 3 03 s 3 09 s 3 13 s and 3 18 s are the instants when the chambers are closed by tsunami bore just as stated in section 4 2 the increase of peak value of total vertical force is mainly due to number of panels suffering positive vertical force increases continuously during the impinging stage in which tsunami bore flow under bridge deck and gradually close the chambers once a chamber is closed by tsunami bore the top panel of the chamber begins to suffer vertical positive force and this newly suffered force makes the total vertical force peak value larger than ever before the peak values of vertical forces on the panels s16 s21 are further compared in fig 31 in which it shows when t 3 03 s s16 and s17 suffer positive vertical force when t 3 09 s panel s18 begins to suffer positive vertical force when t 3 13 s panel s19 begins to suffer positive vertical force when t 3 18 s panel s20 begin to suffer positive vertical force also it should be noted that the first peak value on any panel of s16 s18 s20 occurring at the instant when the corresponding chamber is closed by tsunami bore is always the largest peak value compared with its several subsequent peak values for example at t 3 09s when chamber b2 is closed the peak value on s18 is about 320n is larger than 265n at t 3 13 and 275n at t 3 18 s shown in fig 31 as can be observed in figs 14 figs 17 and 20 after the chambers have been closed tsunami bores climb up along the upstream panels of downstream ribs of chambers b1 b2 and b3 i e panels s7 s9 and s11 and splash on the top panels s17 s18 and s19 during the splashing process the entrapped air also exerts pressure on these top panels how the peak values of vertical forces on top panels of the chambers i e s17 s20 are generated still needs deep investigation because a complex interaction process between air and water happens when the chamber is closed by tsunami bore four points named as p1 p4 which will never be inundated by tsunami bore but exposed to entrapped air in the impinging stage were set in the chambers b1 b4 respectively to monitor the static and dynamic pressures of the entrapped air shown in fig 32 results show the dynamic pressure of the entrapped air in chamber is approximately at least 25 times smaller than the static pressure therefore omitted here for brevity the time history of static pressure at the monitoring point shows the entrapped air has similar peaks as the time history of the vertical force on the top panel of the same chamber according to the static pressure at the monitoring point i e p s t the vertical force acting on the top panel induced by entrapped air can be estimated as f p t p s t a in which a is the projection of the area of top panel on horizontal plane then f p t is compared with f y t which is the vertical force of the top panel directly monitored in cfd simulation shown in fig 33 it could be observed is that f p t almost coincides with f y t demonstrating that static pressure of entrapped air dominates the peak values of vertical forces on top panels of chambers the impinging force acting on top panels caused by the splashing water is insignificant for the peak values of the top panels s18 s20 one exception is the vertical force on panel s17 at t 3 09 s at this instant the impinging force is not ignorable as a large amount of water splashing onto the top panel s17 shown in fig 14 which results an obvious difference between f y t and f p t shown in fig 33 another interesting phenomenon is that when a chamber is closed by tsunami bore not only the pressure of entrapped air in this chamber reaches peak but also the pressure of entrapped air in previous enclosed chambers reaches peak for example at t 3 09 s when the chamber b2 is closed both the pressures of entrapped air in chambers b2 and b1 are compressed and reach their peaks shown in fig 33 fig 34 shows velocity vector of tsunami bore at t 3 085 s a little earlier than the time t 3 09 s when the chamber b2 will be closed by the rising bore it could be observed that before closing chamber b2 the bore propagates under the chambers with a certain vertical velocity it could be deduced that once the bore closes chamber b2 the entrapped air will block the bore flowing into the chamber which will reduce the vertical velocity of bore right under the chamber in other words a negative vertical acceleration of bore occurs at the instant of chamber being closed further the blocked bore with the reduced vertical velocity right under the chamber b2 will also reduce the vertical velocity right under previous closed chamber i e b1 although at this moment the vertical velocity right under b1 is relatively smaller namely a gentle negative vertical acceleration of bore occurs right under chamber b1 in order to validate our speculation a monitoring point named p5 right under the chamber b2 shown in fig 32 was set to monitoring the horizontal and vertical velocity changes during the impinging stage the relationship between the velocities under chamber b2 represented by point p5 and total pressure of entrapped air in chamber b2 represented by p2 is shown in fig 35 note that both the velocities and pressure in fig 35 are normalized by their maximum values it can be observed that the peak values of entrapped air in chamber b2 occur at the instants t 1 3 09 s t 2 3 13 s and t 3 3 18 s which are respectively the instants when the chambers b2 b3 and b4 are closed at t 1 3 09 s when chamber b2 is closed the air in chamber b2 is entrapped and compressed the first largest pressure peak value of entrapped air occurs almost at the same time the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocity at p5 sharply from a larger positive value to a negative value i e with a larger negative acceleration shown in fig 35 at t 2 3 13 s when chamber b3 is closed the air in chamber b3 is entrapped and compressed which results the largest vertical force peak on panel s19 or largest pressure peak in chamber b3 shown in fig 33 and the blocked bore right under chamber b3 also reduces the vertical velocity relatively smaller right under b2 with a smaller negative acceleration shown at t 2 instant in fig 35 such a reduction of vertical velocity of tsunami under chamber b2 generates the second smaller pressure peak value of entrapped air in chamber b2 in the next instant t 3 3 18 s when chamber b4 is closed the blocked bore right under b4 reduces the vertical velocity right under b2 with a smaller negative acceleration shown at t 3 instant in fig 35 similarly such a reduction of vertical velocity right under b2 generates the third smaller pressure peak value of entrapped air in chamber b2 generally when one chamber is closed the air in this chamber is entrapped and compressed resulting the occurrence of the largest pressure in this chamber simultaneously the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocities under the already closed chambers resulting the occurrences of smaller pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers that s the reason why pressure peaks of entrapped air or the vertical force peaks on top panels in different chambers occur simultaneously as shown in fig 33 after being closed by water the entrapped air in chamber will continue to be pounded by the rising bore part of the water impacts the rib runs up along the rib and irrupts into the entrapped air take the chamber b1 for example part of water runs up along panel s7 and impacts the top panel s17 shown in fig 14 which exerts obvious dynamic pressure on panel s17 shown in fig 16 a which ultimately makes the positive peak value on panel s17 at t 3 09 s larger than that at t 3 03 s as shown in fig 29 at this instant t 3 09 s the irrupting water occupies the space of the entrapped air compelling a part of the entrapped air to move downward and irrupt into water shown in fig 14 then pushed by the incoming flow under chamber b1 this part of air transforms and moves downstream gradually develops into a bubble which will soon be separated from the main body of the entrapped air shown in fig 17 at the same time the water which impacts panel s17 propagates upstream along panel s17 and then changes to propagate along panel s6 after been blocked by panel s6 finally rushes back into tsunami bore shown in fig 20 in this process the bubble has been separated from the main body of the entrapped air and washed away by tsunami bore the impacting on top panel by the irrupting water as well as the escape of entrapped air happens in every closed chamber shown in fig 20 however the impacting intensity and the volume of the irrupting water are different in different chamber for example the volume of the irrupting water in chamber b1 is obviously larger than that in chambers b2 and b3 which makes the impacting force on panel s17 to be larger than those on panels s18 and s19 this kind of impacting force makes the panel s17 to be an exception namely the largest peak value on panel s17 does not happen at the instant t 3 03 s when the chamber b1 is closed but happens at t 3 09 s shown both in fig 29 and in fig 31 and compared with the vertical force generated by static pressure of entrapped air this impacting force is un ignorable and should be responsible for obvious difference between f p t and f y t at t 3 09 s in fig 33 with the inundation of bridge deck the interaction between air and water in chambers gradually becomes stable and the air escape gradually stops at the same time the averaged velocity under t girder increases which results in decrease of compression to the entrapped air ultimately results in decrease of vertical force on panels s16 s21 shown in fig 31 at t 3 51 s and t 6 0 s further in the quasi stable stage the vertical forces on panels s16 s21 are not equal for example at t 6 0 s shown in fig 31 this is because a vortex generates under the chambers b1 and b2 shown in fig 36 the low pressure in the vortex center lowers the pressure in chambers in different degree namely the smaller distance between the vortex center to chamber the larger lowered degree of pressure shown in fig 28 c therefore at t 6 0 s the order of magnitudes of vertical forces on panels is s17 s18 s19 s20 shown in fig 31 in addition at t 3 51 s the magnitude of negative vertical force on panel s15 is much larger than the sum of the positive vertical force on panels s16 s21 which makes the t girder suffer large negative force shown in fig 30 however at t 6 0 s the entrapped air above s15 has escaped and the impacting intensity has decreased remarkably which makes the magnitude of the negative force on panel s15 decreases remarkably although the self weight of the water on panel s15 increases at t 6 0 s which increases the negative force to a certain degree the increment is relatively smaller therefore the resultant vertical force on t girder is still negative but with smaller magnitude shown in fig 30 4 4 influence of initial clearance on vertical force peak values in order to explore the influence of the initial clearance on the vertical force the cases with the same incoming wave height and same downstream initial water depth but with initial clearance changing from 2 cm 6 cm namely the cases 20 20 2 to 20 20 6 listed in table 2 were conducted and analyzed the comparison of vertical force time histories between the cases with different initial clearance is shown in fig 37 generally the cases with different initial clearance share the same vertical force characteristics but with different occurrence time when the downstream initial water level is higher than or equal to the rib bottom namely the cases 20 20 2 and 20 20 0 respectively the initial impinging peaks of vertical force appear earlier and have smaller difference the reason is that the bore front impacts the rib r1 directly when without initial clearance but flows through the initial clearance in the cases 20 20 2 20 20 6 and the submerged depth of the rib r1 is 2 cm or 0 cm inducing tiny difference in runup time when bore runs up along the panel s5 for the cases with initial clearance the larger initial clearance the later the bore front begins to run up along the panel s5 the later the bore impacts on panel s16 and the later the initial impinging peak happens 4 5 influence of incoming wave height on vertical force peak values the cases with the same downstream initial water depth and initial clearance i e h 0 20 cm z 1 h 0 4 cm respectively but with different incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 12 cm 24 cm listed in table 2 were conducted to discuss the influence of incoming wave height on vertical force fig 38 compares the time histories of vertical force of the cases with different incoming wave height in addition the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f in initial impinging sub stage the maximum peak value in the runup sub stage i e f y m a x i m c m a x f y m a x i m c f f y m a x i m c s f y m a x i m c t and the average value of the vertical force in the quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a t are employed to indicate the changes of vertical force with incoming wave height as shown in fig 39 it can be observed in fig 38 that 1 the larger incoming wave height the earlier impacting force happens because of the faster wave front propagation velocity 2 generally the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f of the cases with smaller incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 12 cm 18 cm is smaller than that of cases with larger incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 20 cm 24 cm this is because for the smaller incoming wave height cases the wave front propagation is smaller too therefore the time of panel s16 impacted by tsunami bore is obvious earlier than that when chamber b1 is closed by tsunami bore but for the larger incoming wave height cases the wave front propagation velocity is larger which results in the impacting on panel s16 and the close of chamber b1 happening almost at the same time in other words when incoming wave height is smaller the initial impinging peak value is contributed by panel s16 alone when incoming wave height is larger the initial impinging peak value is contributed by both panel s16 and panel s17 3 when incoming wave height is smaller the vertical force time history curves have four peaks in the runup sub stage which are correspondingly the impacting force acting on panels s17 s18 s19 and s20 when the chambers b1 b2 b3 and b4 are closed by water respectively when incoming wave height is larger the vertical force time history has only three peaks in the run up sub stage because the close of the chamber b1 happens almost at the same time with the impacting on panel s16 the impacting force on panel s17 is superposed with that on s16 resulting in the reduction of peak value number 4 the average vertical force on bridge deck in quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a is positive when the incoming wave is small for example h 2 h 0 12 cm while f y a v e s t a is negative when the incoming wave is large i e h 2 h 0 14 cm and the magnitude of which increases with the incoming wave height shown in fig 39 this is because a with the increase of incoming wave height the submerged depth of bridge deck increases and the self weight of water above bridge deck increases which causing the magnitude of average vertical force negative on panel s15 to increase shown in fig 40 b with the increase of incoming wave height sum of average vertical forces on panels s16 s21 positive also increases but with a smaller rate of increasing than that of the negative force on s15 shown in fig 37 the smaller rate of increasing could be attributed to two reasons the larger incoming wave height the larger averaged velocity under the t girder and the larger pressure decrease in water under the chambers also the larger incoming wave height the stronger vortex intensity compared in fig 41 and the larger pressure decrease caused by the low pressure in vortex center therefore with the increase of incoming wave height the average vertical force in quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a changes from positive to negative and magnitude of the negative vertical force tends to be larger shown in fig 40 5 conclusions in order to explore the vertical force peak value generation mechanism on t girder under tsunami bore the t girder was divided into a series of panels and the time history of vertical force was divided into four stages and then the impinging stage was further divided into four sub stages the contribution rate of each panel to the vertical force on t girder in stages or sub stages are compared and the vertical force peak value generation mechanism is discussed this study obtained some conclusions similar as previous studies such as the top panel of bridge deck i e the panel s15 is the main negative vertical force contributor and the bottom plate of girder is the main positive vertical force contributor the vertical force on t girder mainly arises from the integral of static pressure induced by water and entrapped air etc in addition this study obtained some new conclusions as 1 each peak value of vertical force in the impinging stage is composed of at least one peak value of vertical force on panels s16 s20 the continue increase of vertical force peak value is the result of more and more panels s16 s20 suffering impacting pressure when the chambers are closed by tsunami bore one by one 2 the vertical force peak value on panel s16 is generated by the direct impacting of tsunami bore the vertical force peak values on panels s17 s20 are mainly generated by the static pressure peak values of entrapped air in chambers b1 b4 respectively 3 at the instant when a chamber is closed by tsunami bore the air in this chamber is entrapped and compressed resulting the generation of larger air pressure in this chamber simultaneously the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocities of tsunami bore under this chamber and already closed chambers resulting the occurrences of smaller pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers that s the reason why pressure peaks of entrapped air or the vertical forces peaks on panels s17 s20 in different chambers occur simultaneously 4 the decrease of vertical force in the quasi stable stage is caused by the decreases of magnitudes of both positive and negative vertical forces on bottom and top panels of bridge deck respectively the escape of entrapped air above bridge deck and attenuation of impacting decrease the negative force and the increasing averaged velocity under girder as well as the influence of vortex under chambers reduces the entrapped air pressure which ultimately reduces the positive vertical force on bottom plate the difference of vertical forces on top panels of the chambers in the quasi stable stage i e s17 s18 s19 s20 is mainly caused by the vortex under the chambers further the influences of the initial clearance and the incoming wave height are discussed and the main conclusions are 1 the cases with different initial clearance share almost the same vertical force characteristics but with different vertical force occurrence time i e the smaller the clearance the earlier the vertical force occurs 2 the impacting on the upstream overhanging flange plate and on the entrapped air in chamber b1 happens almost simultaneously for the larger incoming wave height but happens at different instant for smaller incoming wave height which results in the difference of positive peak numbers in impinging stage 3 with the increase of incoming wave height the negative vertical force on bridge deck increases with a larger increasing rate and the positive vertical force also increases but with a smaller increasing rate which results in the vertical force changing from positive to negative and becoming larger in

22221,the generation mechanism and characteristics of peak values of tsunami bore vertical force are investigated comprehensively and thoroughly a scaled down two dimensional t girder model whose surface is divided into a series of panels is tested in the cases with fixed initial downstream water depth different incoming wave height and different initial clearance time history of vertical force is divided into four stages in which the impinging stage is further divided into four sub stages then the contribution rates of panels to the vertical force are discussed results show each peak value of vertical force in the impinging stage is composed of at least one peak value of vertical force on bottom panels of the girder the continue increase of vertical force peak value is the result of more and more panels suffering static pressure of entrapped air when the chambers are successively closed by tsunami bore the vertical force peak values on top panels of the chambers are mainly generated by the static pressure peak values of entrapped air the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocity of tsunami bore under already closed chambers resulting the simultaneous occurrences of pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers keywords tsunami force generation mechanism t girder computational fluid dynamics cfd dam break wave entrapped air flow field 1 introduction 498 tsunamis occurred in the 20th century and among which 66 caused catastrophes according to rhodes et al 2006 in the early 21st century there are two impressive tsunamis happened one is the 2004 indian ocean tsunami which caused death of more than 200 000 people and destruction of infrastructures according to unjoh and endoh 2006 more than 186 coastal bridges were washed away or seriously damaged in this disaster another is the 2011 tohoku japan tsunami which caused the death of more than 15 000 people and missing of more than 3400 people as well as destruction of more than 250 coastal bridges kasano et al 2012 salem et al 2014 the catastrophic damage caused by tsunami to infrastructures and human lives in coastal areas has aroused attention in the whole world unjoh and endoh 2006 investigated the damaged bridges in the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and found that a large number of bridge superstructures were directly washed away or had large lateral displacement especially when no lateral constraints were set at the supports of the bridge superstructures these two failure types of costal bridge were proven to be the most common failure types by many post disaster investigation reports and relevant literatures kawashima 2012 maruyama et al 2012 what s worse the damage of bridges directly hinders the transportation required by rapid rescue and later reconstruction in the tsunami attacked area human cannot stop the tsunami but can avoid or minimize tsunami damage to bridges through anti tsunami design therefore it is essential to clarify the nature or the generation mechanism of the tsunami force acting on bridges especially as a vulnerable component of costal bridge superstructure draws wide attentions from researchers tsunami force on superstructure has been investigated specifically by yim 2005 sugimoto and unjoh 2007 mcpherson 2008 lau et al 2011 azadbakht 2013 sarfaraz and pak 2017 etc further the anti tsunami measures have been discussed in detail by pradono et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 nakao et al 2013 abukawa et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 meng 2016 etc based on the incompressible two dimensional two phase flow model zhou and ren 2015 calculated the time history of the horizontal drag force and vertical uplift force of the tsunami on bridge and concluded that the horizontal drag force is the immediate cause of the bridge damage in contrast the vertical force on superstructure has been discussed relatively less by investigating the bridges destroyed in the 2011 tohoku japan tsunami kawashima 2012 proposed two failure mechanisms of the bridge superstructure one is the failure under the action of horizontal force only and the other is the failure under the combined actions of vertical force and horizontal force since most of the bridge superstructures have no special lateral displacement restraint devices at the bearing its horizontal resistance is mainly provided by the transverse friction force generated by the weight of the bridge superstructure at the bearing the uplift force acting on the bridge superstructure reduces the gravity force of superstructure which then reduces the horizontal resistance and makes the superstructure more vulnerable to tsunami waves numerical simulations conducted by bricker et al 2011 with openfoam show that both vertical force and overturning moment may lead to the destruction of the bridge deck therefore the study of vertical lift force on bridge superstructure is as important as horizontal force although it has not been highly focused before sugimoto and unjoh 2007 experimentally studied the relationship between tsunami force and its influence parameters results show that horizontal force increases with wave height while the vertical force increases with initial water depth meanwhile the threshold values of dimensionless coefficients of horizontal and vertical force corresponding to different failure modes of bridge superstructure are suggested lau et al 2011 studied the tsunami surge force on the beam by means of experiment and numerical simulation and pointed out that the vertical force was composed of the vertical upward impact peak and the relatively gentle downward lift force after the beam was submerged araki et al 2011 found that the vertical force on bridge deck under tsunami wave is related to the type of tsunami wave i e the vertical force has two peaks under breaking wave the vertical force has only one peak under non breaking wave and the peak value caused by non breaking wave is smaller than that of breaking wave through physical experiments hoshikuma et al 2013 pointed out that when the tsunami hit the upstream side of the bridge deck the overhanging girder flange plate would lead to a large vertical lift and overturning moment meanwhile they found that the connecting device between the bridge superstructure and the substructure on the offshore side would fail azadbakht 2013 found that the maximum vertical force appeared at the moment when the tsunami water free surface elevation reaches the top of the bridge barrier right before the water overtopping the bridge and starting to flow onto the bridge beck and the maximum horizontal and downward vertical loads are found to occur approximately simultaneously when the tsunami flow reaches the landward side of the bridge cross section and overtops the barrier sarfaraz and pak 2017 used sph numerical simulation method to study the effect of initial submerged depth and the number of girders on the vertical force on t girder the results show that when the bridge deck is completely submerged at the initial stage number of girders has no effect on the upward force however when the bridge deck is elevated girder numbers of two makes the highest positive force the studies by lau et al 2011 mazinani et al 2014 and motley et al 2015 show the vertical force on superstructure is negative when it is completely submerged but the reason why the vertical force is negative and its generation mechanism have not been analyzed comprehensively and thoroughly study by salem et al 2014 shows the entrapped air between deck girders during tsunami had a significant effect on the behavior of the bridge the interaction between entrapped air tsunami bore and deck girder needs further investigation hayatdavoodi et al 2014 studied solitary wave forces on a coastal bridge deck they pointed out that the hydrodynamic force due to the entrapped air pockets appear to be a large portion of the total uplift force and it decreases as the wave amplitude increases also hayatdavoodi et al 2014 thought that the air pocket does not only affect the hydrostatic uplift force but also modify the wave and therefore the wave induced forces which is different from the assumption made by mcpherson 2008 seiffert et al 2015 studied wave loads on a coastal bridge deck and the role of entrapped air and they found that vertical forces could be significantly reduced when air relief openings are added to the structure also their study show an evidence of a slight cushioning effect due to compressibility of entrapped air azadbakht and yim 2015 also studied the effect of trapped air on wave force on coastal bridge superstructure when it suffers waves a novel analysis method which segments the bridge deck surface into panels and analyzes the contribution rate of each panel to the forces on the whole bridge deck has been employed in recent years xu et al 2016 studied the solitary wave force on a typical coastal bridge deck by decomposing the bridge deck into a series of panels and the wave force contribution of these components were discussed wu 2017 studied the tsunami forces on three types of bridge superstructure by means of numerical simulation in which the bridge decks are segmented into many panels and the contribution rate of each panel to horizontal force and vertical force were discussed also simplified calculation formulas of horizontal and vertical forces are presented winter et al 2017 studied the effects of different super elevation angles and girder spacing on the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each part panel of the bridge under the tsunami generally many articles studied the characteristics of horizontal force and vertical force on bridge decks when bridge decks suffer wave or tsunami bore the influencing parameters such as numbers of girder deck super elevation initial water depth wave height entrapped air as well as air venting holes etc are also widely studied note that in published articles the studies on wave force is obvious more than that on tsunami bore force although the tsunami bore is a kind of broken wave the wave field is quite different from tsunami bore field which results in considerable difference in characteristic of forces just as stated by araki et al 2011 among the tsunami bore force studies such as by winter et al 2017 motley et al 2015 etc few of them studied the generation mechanism of vertical force peak values in impinging stage thoroughly and comprehensively this study aims to explore generation mechanism of vertical force peak values thoroughly and comprehensively by decomposing the t girder surface into a series of panels and dividing the vertical force time history into four stages and further dividing the impinging stage into four sub stages in this study the numerical simulation model was built by ansys fluent the flow field was analyzed and the influence of two parameters i e wave height and initial clearance on vertical force was also discussed 2 numerical model and validation two tsunami bore generation methods i e by breaking the solitary wave on a slope at the end of the wave flume or wave tank and by dam break method are ordinarily used in physical experiment and numerical simulation the former method can fully reproduce the propagation and evolution of tsunami wave which was employed by lau et al 2011 chen 2014 meng 2016 etc the latter is to generate the tsunami bore by lifting the reservoir gate in an extremely short time which is simpler and more convenient therefore has been widely employed by researchers such as by ritter 1892 stoker 1957 chanson 2009 oertel and bung 2012 etc in their studies they have clarified that dam break bore can simulate the tsunami bore well further dam break bores have been widely used to study tsunami bore forces on structures such as by wong 2015 motley et al 2015 yang et al 2018 in this study the dam break method was used because this paper mainly focuses on the interaction process between tsunami bore and bridge superstructure but not propagation and evolution process of tsunami bore when approaching to shore 2 1 basic equations the software ansys fluent was chosen to solve the incompressible reynolds averaged form of the navier stokes rans equations in which the mass conservation equation and momentum equation are respectively as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i μ 2 u i x i x j ρ u i u i x j where u i is the time averaged velocity in which the indices i and j represents the directions of the coordinates x y z note that this index based notation implies the sum over a repeated index in terms involving multiple indices the time averaged velocity can be defined as u i 1 δ t t 0 t 0 δ t u i d t where the flow velocity can be decomposed to u i u i u i u i is the velocity fluctuation p is the time average pressure ρ is the density of water and μ is the dynamic viscosity the computational domain consists of water and air and the volume of fluid vof method is employed to track the free surface between two fluids as the dam break bores will deform and break intensively during their generation and advancing process especially when interacting with structures the reynolds number is expected to be around or larger than 1e5 therefore rng k ε turbulence model is chosen k ε model has already been used in similar studies such as lau et al 2011 motley et al 2015 yang et al 2018 etc the reynolds stress turbulence kinetic energy k and its rate of dissipation ε are calculated from the following equations 3 ρ u i u j υ t ρ u i x j u j x i 2 3 κ ρ δ i j 4 κ t k u j x j x j υ υ t σ κ κ x j p κ ρ ε 5 ε t ε u j x j x j υ υ t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε κ ρ p κ c ε 2 ε 2 κ in which p κ ρ u i u j u j x i υ t c μ ε 2 κ the constants c ε 1 c ε 2 and c μ are set as default values in ansys fluent i e c μ 1 42 c ε 2 1 68 c μ 0 0845 in the near wall region of structure the solution gradients are much high so the calculations in the near wall regions are critical to the precision of simulation scalable wall function is chosen to treat the boundary layer because it can avoid the deterioration of standard wall function under grid refinement when y is very small here y y μ ρ τ w where y is the distance from the wall to the center of the innermost cell and τ w is the wall shear stress the size of the most inner cell d s is twice of y and y is set as 60 in this study because reynolds number is large when tsunami bores interact with structures i e viscous force does not dominate 2 2 numerical model due to the shallow water effect tsunami wave breaks before attack the coastal bridge and transforms into tsunami bore therefore the tsunami bore cases but not tsunami wave or solitary wave cases are studied according to the research of wilkinson 2005 there are several tsunami bores when tsunami wave arrives at the coast and most of the time the first tsunami bore is not the largest but the second or the third one is namely the bridge piers are ordinarily submerged in water before attacked by the most intensive tsunami bore therefore the initial water depth at the bridge site is set larger than zero in the numerical model ordinarily there are diaphragms between neighboring girders which block the air flow along the longitudinal direction of bridge deck therefore using 2d models will generate ignorable difference compared with 3d models this view has been validated by wu 2017 but the computational efficiency of two dimensional numerical model is significantly higher than that of three dimensional numerical model the two dimensional numerical model shown in fig 1 is adopted in this study the total length of flume is 30 m of which the impoundment length is 12 m and downstream is 18 0 m the height of the flume is 1 m note that the origin of coordinate is set at the left lower corner of the flume the dam break happens at the instant when the gate disappears in numerical simulation the boundary conditions of numerical flume are set as follows the top of the flume is set as pressure outlet condition to allow air flow in or out of the flume the upstream and downstream boundaries and the bottom of flume are set as stationary wall boundary conditions the densities of water and air are 998 2 kg m 3 and 1 225 kg m 3 respectively and the viscosities of water and air are 1 003 10 6 m 2 s and 1 7894 10 5 m 2 s respectively the gravitational acceleration g is set as 9 81 m s 2 both structural grids and un structural grids are generated when meshing the computation domains in detail in core area around the bridge deck the un structural grids with thickness 0 0006 m at innermost and 0 005 m of overall mesh size are generated shown in fig 2 in other area far from bridge deck i e non core area structural grids with size of 0 01 m are generated the interface technique is used to connect the core area and non core area where the grid size begins to change from 0 005 m to 0 01 m with the change ratio 1 2 2 3 validation the precondition of accurate calculation of tsunami force on structure is the correct simulation of flow filed of tsunami bores therefore the flow field of tsunami bore is firstly validated by using the cases without bridge deck the following validating cases are named in the form of m n where m represents the incoming wave height h 2 h 0 and n represents the initial downstream water depth h 0 in h 2 h 0 h 2 represents the free surface height of tsunami bore the impoundment depth h 1 as well as h 2 and h 0 is demonstrated in fig 3 here h 0 is kept unchanged as 20 cm and h 2 h 0 changes from 12 cm to 24 cm with interval 2 cm specifically mass flow rate and free surface height were monitored at the cross sections x 12 m x 18 5 m x 19 0 m x 19 5 m x 20 0m and x 20 5 m then the cross section averaged flow velocity were calculated at these positions the time histories of free surface height at the monitoring positions of the cases 12 20 and 24 20 are shown in fig 4 compared with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 it can be observed that after the dam break bore arrives the free surface height at different monitoring position keeps basically unchanged and well consistent with stoker s theoretical solution no matter for which monitoring position the duration from the arrival of wave front to the arrival of the reflected wave generated by downstream end is larger than 6 5 s which is long enough to observe the whole interaction process between bore and structure therefore the bridge deck model will be placed at x 19 5 m in the numerical flume in the following study comparisons of the nondimensionalized wave height h 2 h 0 h 0 of each case with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 are shown in fig 5 in which h 0 of y axis is nondimensionalized by h 1 fig 5 indicates the present numerical model can predict the wave height very well further wave front velocity w can be calculated out by δ x δ t in which δ x is the distance between two monitoring positions and δ t is the difference between the arrival times of bore front arriving at the two monitoring positions the cross section averaged velocity u is calculated as follows a cross section plane was defined at x 19 5 m basically it is a line in 2d model to monitor the time history of mass flow rate r t and at the cross section plane time history of the free surface height h t were monitored then the cross section averaged velocity u can be estimated by r t h t the nondimensionalized wave front velocity w c 0 and cross section averaged velocity u c 0 in the steady stage are respectively compared with the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 shown in fig 6 in which c 0 g h 0 1 2 is the wave propagation velocity fig 6 shows both the wave front velocity and cross section averaged velocity predicted by the present numerical model match the theoretical solution by stoker 1957 considerably well generally the present numerical model can accurately simulate the dam break bores and then the tsunami forces on structures can be further validated with confidence the physical experimental data of tsunami forces on t girder carried out by public works research institute nakao et al 2013 are used to validate the accuracy of the tsunami force on bridge deck by the present numerical model therefore the dimensions of the numerical flume the impoundment length and depth the downstream initial water depth and the bridge deck dimensions are completely the same as that in physical experiment conducted in public works research institute shorted as pwri hereafter meanwhile in order to verify the grid independence three schemes of grid size are tested coarse middle and fine grids which are detailed in table 1 the time history curves of horizontal and vertical forces predicted by the numerical model with three grid schemes are compared with the pwri results shown in fig 7 comparisons show that the curves of middle and fine schemes are both in good agreement with that of pwri implying that the numerical simulation method including turbulence model wall function grid size and boundary conditions etc in the above two cases are correct and could be employed to simulate the tsunami forces however the fine scheme has much lower calculation efficiency consuming more than 3 times of cpu time than the middle scheme shown in table 1 taking both precision and time cost into consideration middle scheme is adopted to mesh the computation domain in the following study 3 introduction of numerical calculation cases the most widely used superstructure of simply supported beam bridges in real practice in china i e t girder with the span of 20 m and width of 12 m is chosen as the prototype in this study the numerical model is a scaled down model with length scale ratio 1 20 shown in fig 8 in order to investigate the vertical force generation mechanism the t girder is decomposed into a series of panels just as xu et al 2016 wu 2017 and winter et al 2017 the panels are named as s1 s28 shown in fig 8 the t girder has five ribs and four chambers named as r1 r5 and b1 b4 respectively in real practice the submerged water depth of piers of coastal bridges is ordinarily about 3 m 5 m and the averaged submerged depth namely the downstream initial water depth is set as 4 m here as the influences of incoming wave height and initial clearance on vertical force will be discussed the incoming wave height is assumed to change from 2 4 m to 4 8 m and the initial clearance is assumed to change from 0 4 m to 1 2 m note that initial clearance is defined as the gap between the downstream initial water level and the bottom of the rib namely z 1 h 0 in fig 3 here 0 4 m means the t girder has been submerged before the attack of the most intensive tsunami bore and the submerged depth is 0 4 m considering the length scale ratio 1 20 all the cases with their detailed information are listed in table 2 in which m n c is adopted to name the cases where m represents the incoming wave height h 2 h 0 n represents the downstream initial water depth h 0 and c represents the initial clearance z 1 h 0 the definitions of the variables in table 2 can be found in fig 3 4 numerical simulation results and analysis 4 1 vertical force characteristics at stages and sub stages the vertical force on t girder changes violently with the time when attacked by tsunami bore note that upward vertical force is defined as positive and downward vertical force is defined as negative as a representative the vertical force time history of the case 20 20 4 is divided into four stages and then the impinging stage was further divided into four sub stages to explore the vertical force characteristics changing with time the vertical force time history between t 2 s and t 20 s is drawn in fig 9 a which can be divided into four stages as i impinging stage in this stage t 3 0 s 3 55 s tsunami bore reaches the t girder then impacts on the front panel of the girder runs up and overtops the upstream railing then impacts the bridge deck and reaches the downstream railing while the chambers are closed by tsunami bore gradually the vertical force is characterized as continuously increasing positive peak values and abrupt negative peak value ii decline stage in this stage t 3 55 s 4 5 s tsunami bore overtops the downstream railing then the bridge deck is gradually submerged by tsunami bore and the flow field around the girder gradually tends to relatively stable the vertical force increases slowly from negative and approaches to zero iii quasi stable stage in this stage t 4 5 s 12 9 s the girder is completely submerged and the flow field around the girder reaches relatively stable the vertical force is relatively but not absolutely stable in this stage the average value of the vertical force is defined as f y a v e s t a for convenience iv reflection stage in this stage t 12 9 s the reflected wave generated by the downstream wall reaches the downstream panels of the girder similar to impinging stage the vertical force is characterized as a series of positive peak values then it gradually decreases however this stage is out of our concern and will not be further analyzed in this study it can be deduced that the violent interaction between tsunami bore and t girder happens in the impinging stage as the vertical force changes sharply therefore it is reasonable to amplify the time axis of fig 9 a to scrutinize the abrupt changes of vertical force at those special instants shown in fig 9 b further the impinging stage t 3 0 s 3 55 s is divided into four sub stages and their characteristics as well as the generation mechanism of these peaks are discussed as follows 1 initial impinging sub stage t 3 0 s 3 05 s at t 3 0 s the tsunami bore arrives and touches upstream surface of the girder the vertical force rises rapidly from zero reaches the positive peak at t 3 03 s then drops rapidly and reaches the trough at t 3 05 s in this stage the peak value of vertical force is defined as the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f 2 runup sub stage t 3 05 s 3 19 s after t 3 05 s a part of tsunami bore runs up in the front of the upstream of the girder and a part of the tsunami bore flows under the girder and gradually closes the chambers the vertical force begins to increase with fluctuations and three positive peaks appear at t 3 09 s 3 13 s and 3 18 s which are respectively defined as the first second and third ascending peak values of vertical force namely f y m a x i m c f f y m a x i m c s and f y m a x i m c t 3 overtopping sub stage t 3 19 s 3 5 s the tsunami bore overtops the upstream railing of t girder at t 3 19 s and overturns towards the bridge deck the vertical force is positive and decrease slowly in the sub stage 4 second impinging stage t 3 5 s 3 55 s the overturning bore impinges onto the bridge deck and the vertical force decreases to the negative peak abruptly here the negative peak value of vertical force on the t girder is defined as the second impinging peak value f y m i n i m p s then the bore rushes to the downstream railing and begins to overtop the downstream railing accordingly the negative vertical force then begins to decrease in magnitude after t 3 55 s the vertical force enters the decline stage 4 2 contributions of panels to vertical force the vertical force on each panel shown in fig 8 was monitored and its contribution to the total vertical force on t girder at several critical instants in the impinging stage including its sub stages decline stage and quasi stable stage will be discussed to explore the vertical force generation mechanism 1 at t 3 03 s in initial impinging sub stage at t 2 96 s wave front of tsunami bore arrives at the lower part of the rib r1 but fails to impact the rib r1 because there is a 4 cm initial clearance under the rib r1 shown in fig 10 therefore the vertical force on the t girder is still zero with the rapid propagation of tsunami bore the wave front begins to impact the panel s5 of rib r1 and the water body over the rib r1 bottom runs up along panel s5 rolls upstream and impacts panel s16 which makes the vertical force on panel s16 increase suddenly shown in fig 11 at the same time part of tsunami bore flows under rib r1 and closes the chamber b1 at t 3 03 s approximately i e the air is entrapped in the chamber r1 and compressed by water at t 3 03 s the compressed air exerts relative larger pressure on panel s17 resulting a larger positive vertical force on s17 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches its initial impinging peak value i e f y m a x i m p f 450 1 n the contribution rate of each panel to the initial impact peak defined as r y m a x i i m p f 100 f y i f y m a x i m p f is shown in fig 12 it can be observed that the contributions of panels s16 s17 and s5 are respectively 95 5 13 0 and 8 7 while the contributions of other panels are almost zero when attacked by tsunami bore the force on the panels is mainly dominated by the pressure of fluid water or air while the shear force on the panels is very small and can be neglected therefore the vertical force on panel is related to the projection area the projection length for the 2d case of the panel on x axis whether the vertical force is positive or negative is up to direction of normal line of panel for example the normal line directions of panels s5 and s16 are respectively oblique upward and downward which results the vertical forces on panels s5 and s16 at t 3 03 s are negative and positive respectively also the dynamic pressure static pressure and total pressure contours are shown in fig 13 note that in ansys fluent the standard atmospheric pressure 1 013 10 5 pa is set as the reference pressure static pressure is defined as ρ g h p dynamic pressure is defined as 1 2 ρ v 2 total pressure is defined as sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure in which h is water depth p is pressure energy of fluid v is velocity of water by comparison it can be observed that the vertical forces on panel s16 s17 and s5 are mainly generated by static pressure 2 at t 3 09 s in runup sub stage as the tsunami bore propagates downstream the wave height as shown in fig 4 and the cross section averaged velocity increase sharply the violent impact of tsunami bore on panel s1 results in water splashing upstream shown in fig 14 but s1 is a vertical panel and the projection area length of s1 on the x axis is zero shown in fig 8 therefore vertical force on s1 is almost zero at the same time tsunami bore flows under the chamber b1 and almost closes the chamber b2 at t 3 09 s similarly the air in chamber b2 is entrapped and compressed at this instant which exerts a positive vertical force on panel s18 at t 3 09 s the vertical force on t girder in the runup sub stage reaches the first ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c f 787 5 n the contribution rate of each panel to the first ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c f 100 f y i f y m a x i m c f is shown in fig 15 the most prominent contribution is made by panel s18 42 7 then followed by the panels s17 s16 s25 and s24 with the contribution rates are 33 7 21 0 9 2 and 5 1 respectively and the contributions of other panels are almost zero also the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 16 it clearly shows that static pressure generated by the compressed air on the panel s18 and s17 and static pressure on panel s16 generated by water are the main source of the vertical force on t girder at this instant 3 at t 3 13 s in runup sub stage as time goes by the runup in the front of panel s1 increases and gradually becomes higher than panel s1 i e higher than the upstream railing of t girder at t 3 13 s part of runup water splashes upstream because of reaction force generated by panel s1 and the downstream side of the runup water almost keeps vertical shown in fig 17 meanwhile tsunami bore flowing around the bottom of the girder almost closes the chamber b3 as shown in fig 17 and the entrapped air in chamber b3 is compressed which generates a positive vertical force on panel s19 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches the second ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c s 966 8 n the contribution rate of each panel to the second ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c s 100 f y i f y m a x i m c s is shown in fig 18 the top four contribution rates are made by panels s19 s18 s17 and s16 whose contribution rates are 40 6 26 1 19 3 and 11 8 respectively and followed by panels s26 s25 and s24 the contributions of other panels are almost zero the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 19 the static pressure on panels s19 s18 and s17 generated by the compressed air in the chambers b3 b2 and b1 respectively and static pressure on panel s16 generated by water dominate the vertical force on t girder at t 3 13 s 4 at t 3 18 s in runup sub stage the runup height in the front of panel s1 continuously increases and the runup water begins to overtop the upstream railing flies and overturns downstream the tsunami bore flows around the bottom of the t girder and closes the chamber b4 at t 3 18 s approximately as shown in fig 20 similarly the entrapped air in chamber b4 is compressed exerting a positive vertical force on panel s20 at this instant the vertical force on t girder reaches the third ascending peak value i e f y m a x i m c t 1457 1 n the contribution rate of each panel to the third ascending peak value defined as r y m a x i i m c t 100 f y i f y m a x i m c t is shown in fig 21 the top five contribution rates are made by panels s20 s19 s18 s17 and s16 whose exact contribution rates are 33 3 22 3 18 4 10 3 and 9 0 respectively then followed by panels s27 s26 s25 and s24 the contributions of other panels are almost zero the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 22 the static pressure generated by the compressed air on panels s20 s19 s18 and s17 in chambers b4 b3 b2 and b1 respectively and the static pressure on panel s16 generated by water is the main source of the vertical force on t girder 5 at t 3 51 s in second impinging sub stage a large amount of bore overtops the upstream railing overturns downstream at a relatively high speed then impacts the bridge deck i e panel s15 at t 3 51 s as shown in fig 23 the impacting produces a negative vertical peak value the second impinging peak value on the t girder i e f y m i n i m p s 1287 0 n the contribution rate of each panel to the second impinging peak value defined as r y m i n i i m p s 100 f y i f y m i n i m p s is shown in fig 24 the top six contribution rates made by panels are s15 s18 s16 s20 s19 and s17 whose contribution rates are 126 0 8 6 6 6 5 8 5 3 and 4 6 respectively shown in fig 24 it indicates that the negative vertical force on the t girder is mainly induced by the negative force on panel s15 and the amplitudes of vertical forces on other panels are much small and are positive which decreases the amplitude of negative vertical force on t girder note that when tsunami bore impacts panel s15 a layer of air shaped in a triangle edged by panel s2 upstream part of panel s15 and bottom boundary of the overturning bore is entrapped and compressed by the impacting of the overturning bore as well as the gravity of overturning bore shown in fig 23 the negative vertical force on panel s15 exerted by the entrapped air is much larger than the direct impacting of tsunami bore as shown in fig 25 c comparing between fig 25 a and b it can be concluded that the negative vertical force on s15 is mainly generated by the static pressure of compressed air because the dynamic pressure intensity at the impacting position in fig 25 a is almost the same as the static pressure intensity generated by entrapped air in fig 25 b however the impacting area of the former is much smaller than the contact area of the entrapped air note that in real practice or in three dimensional model the air might not be captured by the overturning bore because the air can flow along the longitudinal direction or only a small part of air can be captured because of the non uniform impacting of tsunami bore on bridge deck under this condition the negative force on panel s15 may be mainly contributed by static pressure of water but not the entrapped air then the tsunami bore continuously overtops the upstream railing and impacts on the panel s15 but the impacting strength decreases continuously and the trapped air escapes continuously therefore the magnitude of the negative vertical force on panel s15 decreases gradually even if the water dead weight on s15 increases 6 at t 6 0 s in quasi stable stage at the t 6 0 s the air trapped at the top of t girder has completely escaped and the interaction between air and water in the four chambers below bridge deck is basically stable shown in fig 26 therefore the vertical force on t girder almost keeps stable i e the average vertical force f y a v e s t a 113 9 n the contribution rate of each panel to the average vertical force defined as r y a v e i s t a 100 f y i f y a v e s t a is shown in fig 27 the top seven contribution rates are made by panels s15 s20 s19 s16 s18 s17 and s21 their contribution rates are 489 4 103 9 80 0 66 5 61 3 45 3 and 24 5 respectively it can be concluded that the bridge deck panel s15 and bottom of girder panels s16 s21 are the main contributors of the vertical force among which panel s15 contributes the most the contributions of the other panels are almost zero omitted here the dynamic pressure contour static pressure contour and total pressure contour are shown in fig 28 which shows the static pressure exerted by water and compressed air dominates the vertical force on the t girder 4 3 generation mechanism of vertical force peak values the contribution rate of each panel to the vertical force at the above six critical instants shows that the bottom plate s16 s21 are the main contributors of positive vertical force while panel s15 is the main contributor of negative vertical force on t girder this result agrees with study by winter et al 2017 in which bottom deck faces is claimed to be responsible for the vertical force of whole bridge deck also several peaks in vertical force were mentioned but their generation mechanism was not analyzed further time histories of vertical forces on panels s16 s20 in impinging stage are drawn in fig 29 it shows that total vertical force curve has the same fluctuations with vertical force curves of panels s16 s20 i e at an instant when peak value of total vertical force occurs at least one panel among s16 s20 suffers peak value of vertical force at this instant in other words any peak values of total vertical force is composed of at least one peak value of panels among s16 s20 moreover increase of the peak values of total vertical force with time can be observed in the impinging stage in fig 29 and can also be obviously observed in fig 30 in which peak values of resultant force on panels s16 s21 vertical force on s15 and total force on bridge superstructure are compared note that the instants when the peak values occur i e t 3 03 s 3 09 s 3 13 s and 3 18 s are the instants when the chambers are closed by tsunami bore just as stated in section 4 2 the increase of peak value of total vertical force is mainly due to number of panels suffering positive vertical force increases continuously during the impinging stage in which tsunami bore flow under bridge deck and gradually close the chambers once a chamber is closed by tsunami bore the top panel of the chamber begins to suffer vertical positive force and this newly suffered force makes the total vertical force peak value larger than ever before the peak values of vertical forces on the panels s16 s21 are further compared in fig 31 in which it shows when t 3 03 s s16 and s17 suffer positive vertical force when t 3 09 s panel s18 begins to suffer positive vertical force when t 3 13 s panel s19 begins to suffer positive vertical force when t 3 18 s panel s20 begin to suffer positive vertical force also it should be noted that the first peak value on any panel of s16 s18 s20 occurring at the instant when the corresponding chamber is closed by tsunami bore is always the largest peak value compared with its several subsequent peak values for example at t 3 09s when chamber b2 is closed the peak value on s18 is about 320n is larger than 265n at t 3 13 and 275n at t 3 18 s shown in fig 31 as can be observed in figs 14 figs 17 and 20 after the chambers have been closed tsunami bores climb up along the upstream panels of downstream ribs of chambers b1 b2 and b3 i e panels s7 s9 and s11 and splash on the top panels s17 s18 and s19 during the splashing process the entrapped air also exerts pressure on these top panels how the peak values of vertical forces on top panels of the chambers i e s17 s20 are generated still needs deep investigation because a complex interaction process between air and water happens when the chamber is closed by tsunami bore four points named as p1 p4 which will never be inundated by tsunami bore but exposed to entrapped air in the impinging stage were set in the chambers b1 b4 respectively to monitor the static and dynamic pressures of the entrapped air shown in fig 32 results show the dynamic pressure of the entrapped air in chamber is approximately at least 25 times smaller than the static pressure therefore omitted here for brevity the time history of static pressure at the monitoring point shows the entrapped air has similar peaks as the time history of the vertical force on the top panel of the same chamber according to the static pressure at the monitoring point i e p s t the vertical force acting on the top panel induced by entrapped air can be estimated as f p t p s t a in which a is the projection of the area of top panel on horizontal plane then f p t is compared with f y t which is the vertical force of the top panel directly monitored in cfd simulation shown in fig 33 it could be observed is that f p t almost coincides with f y t demonstrating that static pressure of entrapped air dominates the peak values of vertical forces on top panels of chambers the impinging force acting on top panels caused by the splashing water is insignificant for the peak values of the top panels s18 s20 one exception is the vertical force on panel s17 at t 3 09 s at this instant the impinging force is not ignorable as a large amount of water splashing onto the top panel s17 shown in fig 14 which results an obvious difference between f y t and f p t shown in fig 33 another interesting phenomenon is that when a chamber is closed by tsunami bore not only the pressure of entrapped air in this chamber reaches peak but also the pressure of entrapped air in previous enclosed chambers reaches peak for example at t 3 09 s when the chamber b2 is closed both the pressures of entrapped air in chambers b2 and b1 are compressed and reach their peaks shown in fig 33 fig 34 shows velocity vector of tsunami bore at t 3 085 s a little earlier than the time t 3 09 s when the chamber b2 will be closed by the rising bore it could be observed that before closing chamber b2 the bore propagates under the chambers with a certain vertical velocity it could be deduced that once the bore closes chamber b2 the entrapped air will block the bore flowing into the chamber which will reduce the vertical velocity of bore right under the chamber in other words a negative vertical acceleration of bore occurs at the instant of chamber being closed further the blocked bore with the reduced vertical velocity right under the chamber b2 will also reduce the vertical velocity right under previous closed chamber i e b1 although at this moment the vertical velocity right under b1 is relatively smaller namely a gentle negative vertical acceleration of bore occurs right under chamber b1 in order to validate our speculation a monitoring point named p5 right under the chamber b2 shown in fig 32 was set to monitoring the horizontal and vertical velocity changes during the impinging stage the relationship between the velocities under chamber b2 represented by point p5 and total pressure of entrapped air in chamber b2 represented by p2 is shown in fig 35 note that both the velocities and pressure in fig 35 are normalized by their maximum values it can be observed that the peak values of entrapped air in chamber b2 occur at the instants t 1 3 09 s t 2 3 13 s and t 3 3 18 s which are respectively the instants when the chambers b2 b3 and b4 are closed at t 1 3 09 s when chamber b2 is closed the air in chamber b2 is entrapped and compressed the first largest pressure peak value of entrapped air occurs almost at the same time the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocity at p5 sharply from a larger positive value to a negative value i e with a larger negative acceleration shown in fig 35 at t 2 3 13 s when chamber b3 is closed the air in chamber b3 is entrapped and compressed which results the largest vertical force peak on panel s19 or largest pressure peak in chamber b3 shown in fig 33 and the blocked bore right under chamber b3 also reduces the vertical velocity relatively smaller right under b2 with a smaller negative acceleration shown at t 2 instant in fig 35 such a reduction of vertical velocity of tsunami under chamber b2 generates the second smaller pressure peak value of entrapped air in chamber b2 in the next instant t 3 3 18 s when chamber b4 is closed the blocked bore right under b4 reduces the vertical velocity right under b2 with a smaller negative acceleration shown at t 3 instant in fig 35 similarly such a reduction of vertical velocity right under b2 generates the third smaller pressure peak value of entrapped air in chamber b2 generally when one chamber is closed the air in this chamber is entrapped and compressed resulting the occurrence of the largest pressure in this chamber simultaneously the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocities under the already closed chambers resulting the occurrences of smaller pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers that s the reason why pressure peaks of entrapped air or the vertical force peaks on top panels in different chambers occur simultaneously as shown in fig 33 after being closed by water the entrapped air in chamber will continue to be pounded by the rising bore part of the water impacts the rib runs up along the rib and irrupts into the entrapped air take the chamber b1 for example part of water runs up along panel s7 and impacts the top panel s17 shown in fig 14 which exerts obvious dynamic pressure on panel s17 shown in fig 16 a which ultimately makes the positive peak value on panel s17 at t 3 09 s larger than that at t 3 03 s as shown in fig 29 at this instant t 3 09 s the irrupting water occupies the space of the entrapped air compelling a part of the entrapped air to move downward and irrupt into water shown in fig 14 then pushed by the incoming flow under chamber b1 this part of air transforms and moves downstream gradually develops into a bubble which will soon be separated from the main body of the entrapped air shown in fig 17 at the same time the water which impacts panel s17 propagates upstream along panel s17 and then changes to propagate along panel s6 after been blocked by panel s6 finally rushes back into tsunami bore shown in fig 20 in this process the bubble has been separated from the main body of the entrapped air and washed away by tsunami bore the impacting on top panel by the irrupting water as well as the escape of entrapped air happens in every closed chamber shown in fig 20 however the impacting intensity and the volume of the irrupting water are different in different chamber for example the volume of the irrupting water in chamber b1 is obviously larger than that in chambers b2 and b3 which makes the impacting force on panel s17 to be larger than those on panels s18 and s19 this kind of impacting force makes the panel s17 to be an exception namely the largest peak value on panel s17 does not happen at the instant t 3 03 s when the chamber b1 is closed but happens at t 3 09 s shown both in fig 29 and in fig 31 and compared with the vertical force generated by static pressure of entrapped air this impacting force is un ignorable and should be responsible for obvious difference between f p t and f y t at t 3 09 s in fig 33 with the inundation of bridge deck the interaction between air and water in chambers gradually becomes stable and the air escape gradually stops at the same time the averaged velocity under t girder increases which results in decrease of compression to the entrapped air ultimately results in decrease of vertical force on panels s16 s21 shown in fig 31 at t 3 51 s and t 6 0 s further in the quasi stable stage the vertical forces on panels s16 s21 are not equal for example at t 6 0 s shown in fig 31 this is because a vortex generates under the chambers b1 and b2 shown in fig 36 the low pressure in the vortex center lowers the pressure in chambers in different degree namely the smaller distance between the vortex center to chamber the larger lowered degree of pressure shown in fig 28 c therefore at t 6 0 s the order of magnitudes of vertical forces on panels is s17 s18 s19 s20 shown in fig 31 in addition at t 3 51 s the magnitude of negative vertical force on panel s15 is much larger than the sum of the positive vertical force on panels s16 s21 which makes the t girder suffer large negative force shown in fig 30 however at t 6 0 s the entrapped air above s15 has escaped and the impacting intensity has decreased remarkably which makes the magnitude of the negative force on panel s15 decreases remarkably although the self weight of the water on panel s15 increases at t 6 0 s which increases the negative force to a certain degree the increment is relatively smaller therefore the resultant vertical force on t girder is still negative but with smaller magnitude shown in fig 30 4 4 influence of initial clearance on vertical force peak values in order to explore the influence of the initial clearance on the vertical force the cases with the same incoming wave height and same downstream initial water depth but with initial clearance changing from 2 cm 6 cm namely the cases 20 20 2 to 20 20 6 listed in table 2 were conducted and analyzed the comparison of vertical force time histories between the cases with different initial clearance is shown in fig 37 generally the cases with different initial clearance share the same vertical force characteristics but with different occurrence time when the downstream initial water level is higher than or equal to the rib bottom namely the cases 20 20 2 and 20 20 0 respectively the initial impinging peaks of vertical force appear earlier and have smaller difference the reason is that the bore front impacts the rib r1 directly when without initial clearance but flows through the initial clearance in the cases 20 20 2 20 20 6 and the submerged depth of the rib r1 is 2 cm or 0 cm inducing tiny difference in runup time when bore runs up along the panel s5 for the cases with initial clearance the larger initial clearance the later the bore front begins to run up along the panel s5 the later the bore impacts on panel s16 and the later the initial impinging peak happens 4 5 influence of incoming wave height on vertical force peak values the cases with the same downstream initial water depth and initial clearance i e h 0 20 cm z 1 h 0 4 cm respectively but with different incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 12 cm 24 cm listed in table 2 were conducted to discuss the influence of incoming wave height on vertical force fig 38 compares the time histories of vertical force of the cases with different incoming wave height in addition the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f in initial impinging sub stage the maximum peak value in the runup sub stage i e f y m a x i m c m a x f y m a x i m c f f y m a x i m c s f y m a x i m c t and the average value of the vertical force in the quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a t are employed to indicate the changes of vertical force with incoming wave height as shown in fig 39 it can be observed in fig 38 that 1 the larger incoming wave height the earlier impacting force happens because of the faster wave front propagation velocity 2 generally the initial impinging peak value f y m a x i m p f of the cases with smaller incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 12 cm 18 cm is smaller than that of cases with larger incoming wave height i e h 2 h 0 20 cm 24 cm this is because for the smaller incoming wave height cases the wave front propagation is smaller too therefore the time of panel s16 impacted by tsunami bore is obvious earlier than that when chamber b1 is closed by tsunami bore but for the larger incoming wave height cases the wave front propagation velocity is larger which results in the impacting on panel s16 and the close of chamber b1 happening almost at the same time in other words when incoming wave height is smaller the initial impinging peak value is contributed by panel s16 alone when incoming wave height is larger the initial impinging peak value is contributed by both panel s16 and panel s17 3 when incoming wave height is smaller the vertical force time history curves have four peaks in the runup sub stage which are correspondingly the impacting force acting on panels s17 s18 s19 and s20 when the chambers b1 b2 b3 and b4 are closed by water respectively when incoming wave height is larger the vertical force time history has only three peaks in the run up sub stage because the close of the chamber b1 happens almost at the same time with the impacting on panel s16 the impacting force on panel s17 is superposed with that on s16 resulting in the reduction of peak value number 4 the average vertical force on bridge deck in quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a is positive when the incoming wave is small for example h 2 h 0 12 cm while f y a v e s t a is negative when the incoming wave is large i e h 2 h 0 14 cm and the magnitude of which increases with the incoming wave height shown in fig 39 this is because a with the increase of incoming wave height the submerged depth of bridge deck increases and the self weight of water above bridge deck increases which causing the magnitude of average vertical force negative on panel s15 to increase shown in fig 40 b with the increase of incoming wave height sum of average vertical forces on panels s16 s21 positive also increases but with a smaller rate of increasing than that of the negative force on s15 shown in fig 37 the smaller rate of increasing could be attributed to two reasons the larger incoming wave height the larger averaged velocity under the t girder and the larger pressure decrease in water under the chambers also the larger incoming wave height the stronger vortex intensity compared in fig 41 and the larger pressure decrease caused by the low pressure in vortex center therefore with the increase of incoming wave height the average vertical force in quasi stable stage f y a v e s t a changes from positive to negative and magnitude of the negative vertical force tends to be larger shown in fig 40 5 conclusions in order to explore the vertical force peak value generation mechanism on t girder under tsunami bore the t girder was divided into a series of panels and the time history of vertical force was divided into four stages and then the impinging stage was further divided into four sub stages the contribution rate of each panel to the vertical force on t girder in stages or sub stages are compared and the vertical force peak value generation mechanism is discussed this study obtained some conclusions similar as previous studies such as the top panel of bridge deck i e the panel s15 is the main negative vertical force contributor and the bottom plate of girder is the main positive vertical force contributor the vertical force on t girder mainly arises from the integral of static pressure induced by water and entrapped air etc in addition this study obtained some new conclusions as 1 each peak value of vertical force in the impinging stage is composed of at least one peak value of vertical force on panels s16 s20 the continue increase of vertical force peak value is the result of more and more panels s16 s20 suffering impacting pressure when the chambers are closed by tsunami bore one by one 2 the vertical force peak value on panel s16 is generated by the direct impacting of tsunami bore the vertical force peak values on panels s17 s20 are mainly generated by the static pressure peak values of entrapped air in chambers b1 b4 respectively 3 at the instant when a chamber is closed by tsunami bore the air in this chamber is entrapped and compressed resulting the generation of larger air pressure in this chamber simultaneously the entrapped air decreases the vertical velocities of tsunami bore under this chamber and already closed chambers resulting the occurrences of smaller pressure peaks of entrapped air in previous closed chambers that s the reason why pressure peaks of entrapped air or the vertical forces peaks on panels s17 s20 in different chambers occur simultaneously 4 the decrease of vertical force in the quasi stable stage is caused by the decreases of magnitudes of both positive and negative vertical forces on bottom and top panels of bridge deck respectively the escape of entrapped air above bridge deck and attenuation of impacting decrease the negative force and the increasing averaged velocity under girder as well as the influence of vortex under chambers reduces the entrapped air pressure which ultimately reduces the positive vertical force on bottom plate the difference of vertical forces on top panels of the chambers in the quasi stable stage i e s17 s18 s19 s20 is mainly caused by the vortex under the chambers further the influences of the initial clearance and the incoming wave height are discussed and the main conclusions are 1 the cases with different initial clearance share almost the same vertical force characteristics but with different vertical force occurrence time i e the smaller the clearance the earlier the vertical force occurs 2 the impacting on the upstream overhanging flange plate and on the entrapped air in chamber b1 happens almost simultaneously for the larger incoming wave height but happens at different instant for smaller incoming wave height which results in the difference of positive peak numbers in impinging stage 3 with the increase of incoming wave height the negative vertical force on bridge deck increases with a larger increasing rate and the positive vertical force also increases but with a smaller increasing rate which results in the vertical force changing from positive to negative and becoming larger in

the meteorological data input in wrf arw database wang et al 2017 used a new wind field correction in storm surge modeling to improve the numerical results in addition the numerical studies show that bathymetry change wang et al 2018 and effect of coupling with wave torres et al 2018 feng et al 2018 could affect the storm surge hazard the impact of climate change including sea level rise and increasing of typhoon intensity could induce more serious storm surge hazard yin et al 2017 typhoon intensification has a greater impact on storm surge while sea level rise could greatly affect the wave height in the estuary the increasing of sea surface temperatures could strengthen the wind speed wang et al 2018 investigated the effects of sea level rise land subsidence and bathymetry change on storm surge and found that the compound scenario of these three factors would generate more severe flood than the single factor in addition the sea level rise and land subsidence are the major factors to coastal flood prevention for long term scenarios passeri et al 2018 indicated that the sea level rise could increase surge heights and cause overwash to occur at more locations and for longer durations in recent years many human projects have been implemented in the yangtze estuary the yangtze estuary deepwater channel regulation project yedcrp began in 1998 and finished in 2011 as shown in fig 1 a the deepwater navigation channel with a depth of 12 5 m has been extended to taicang jiangsu province the total length of dikes and dams for various renovation buildings is about 170 km the volume of dredging works exceeds 300 million cubic meters besides yedcrp includes north south port branch project and dredging of the south channel moreover the other projects include bridge

incorporate eleven tidal constituents including four constituents q1 o1 p1 k1 four semidiurnal constituents n2 m2 s2 k2 and three shallow water constituents m4 ms4 m6 the runoff of the numerical model includes the yangtze river qiantang river and huangpu river the runoff volume of the qiantang river and huangpu river has a small impact on the tide of the computational domain therefore the average annual discharge of the huangpu river and hangzhou bay adopt 318 m3 s and 1400 m3 s respectively the runoff of the yangtze river has a significant impact on the yangtze estuary before human projects the average flux at datong station during the typhoon winnie is 45800 m3 s after the projects the flux at datong station is 40000 m3 s in july and august and is 23900 m3 s during the typhoon period in september the roughness coefficient is 0 011 0 016 in the main channel with deep water depth and the outer sea and it is 0 020 0 028 in the coastal beach the sub grid scale turbulence model proposed by smagorinsky 1963 is adopted in the numerical model in this study the holland 1980 model is adopted for the typhoon wind field which was validated by many researchers willoughby and rahn 2004 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 typhoon wind field if a typhoon meets with a spring tide a super strong storm surge could be generated typhoon winnie in 1997 no 9711 a very strong one historically impacted the yangtze estuary greatly is of this kind selected for the simulation of storm surge it made 248 death more than 5000 people injured and direct economic loss 43 of billion rmb which is stated as one of the most expensive natural disasters in china fig 2 presents the track of typhoon winnie and the wind level is represented by different colors the storm originated from a tropical disturbance over the western pacific on august 8 1997 and it moved northwestward steadily after its generation and strengthened gradually in the evening of august 18th the typhoon landed at wenling zhejiang province china whose central pressure was about 960 hpa with maximum surface wind speed of 40 m s the tidal elevations of the yangtze estuary and the huangpu river exceeded the historical highest record in history the huangpu river reached a rare high water level of a 300 year return period and the tide in huangpu park reached the elevation of a 500 year return period the typhoon winnie is generated in the sea east of guam on 10 august 1997 the center of wind speed reached 60 m s which is twice as the normal typhoons its central pressure was 920 hpa the huge pressure difference with the surrounding area intensified the typhoon s wind speed after its generation it traveled at an average speed of 400 km d to the west northwest the time and location of the typhoon landfall are wenling zhejiang province and 21 30 18 august 1997 at this time the maximum wind speed in the center still reached 40 m s and the central pressure is still 960 hpa fig 3 shows the distribution of wind field and pressure of typhoon winnie 9711 at 6 h before landfall landfall moment and 6 h after landfall the maximum wind speed reached 38 m s with 965 hpa in the typhoon center at 6 h before landfall at the moment of landfall the maximum wind speed decreased to be 36 m s with 981 hpa in the typhoon center even at 6 h after landfall the maximum wind speed was still 32 m s including the 986 hpa in the typhoon center to validate the numerical results of the typhoon wind field the measurements at three locations have been used to compare with the computational results the three locations named shipu dachen and kanmen are shown in fig 4 a the comparisons between the computational results and measured data are plotted in fig 4 b c and d the measurements are plotted by black circles and the numerical results are represented by black line generally the computational wind speed could match with the measurements at shipu dachen and kanmen therefore the wind field could be adopted to model the storm surge the wind speed increased from 12 00 august 17th and reached the maximum speed as the typhoon approached the coast the maximum wind speed at dachen and shipu reached 35 m s while the maximum speed at kanmen is 25 m s 3 2 computational domain and grid the computational domain is from 117 30 e to 123 30 e and from 29 33 to 32 15 as shown in figs 5 and 6 it includes the huangpu river yangzhou bay and zhoushan island the length from the east to the west is around 550 km and is 340 km from the south to the north the unstructured grid is adopted in the numerical model as shown in fig 6 the unstructured grids can accurately fit the complex and changeable land water boundary and islands and can partially refine the key research areas it can effectively improve the computational efficiency of the model on the basis of guaranteeing the computational accuracy the computational domain has been divided by 147018 unstructured triangular mesh cells with 75449 grid nodes 3 3 model setup in the numerical model the time step is between 0 5 s and 3 s to make the cfl number is less than 0 8 the smagorinsky model is adopted in the turbulence model while the constant is 0 28 m2 s the roughness coefficient of the model varies gradually from the outer sea to the yangtze estuary the roughness of the deep main channel and the outer sea is 0 011 0 016 while that of the shoaly land is 0 020 0 028 the wet dry boundary method is used to handle the boundary if the water depth is less than 0 005 m the grid node is dry if the water depth is deeper than 0 005 and less than 0 05 m the current speed is 0 the grid node has only been used in the continuity equation if the flow depth is larger than 0 1 m the surge could inundation on the land the wind stress parameters are c a 0 0015 c b 0 003 w a 10 m s and w b 20 m s 3 4 validation of the astronomical tide 3 4 1 before human projects the typhoon winnie is generated on august 10 1997 and landed on zhejiang province on august 18 1997 according to the tidal data obtained from the stations in the yangtze estuary hangzhou bay and zhejiang coastal region the tidal level was not affected by typhoons from august 4 to august 14 before the typhoon winnie this astronomical tidal data during this period can be used to validate the model the comparisons of time series of the tidal level at zhongjun wusong hengsha and changxing are plotted in fig 7 the measured tidal level is denoted by dots and the numerical results are plotted by solid line the computational astronomical tide could match well with simulated results fig 8 reveals the correlation analysis of astronomical tide between the measurements and numerical results the errors between calculated and measured tidal levels at each tidal level station are limited table 1 has summarized the correlation analysis and error analysis of which the mae and rmse denote mean absolute error and root mean square error respectively the linear correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 96 representing high correlation this indicates that the post recurrence numerical model could produce accuracy calculation of astronomical tides in the yangtze river estuary during the non typhoon period 3 4 2 after human projects the astronomical tide in the current bathymetry after the human projects also have been validated the duration for astronomical tide validation is from july 15th to july 31st 2013 the computational data also match well with the measured tide as shown in fig 9 the correlation analysis and error analysis are shown in fig 10 and table 2 linearly correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 98 indicating that the numerical model could produce accuracy calculation of astronomical tides in the yangtze river estuary during the non typhoon period using bathymetry after human projects 3 5 validation of the storm surge 3 5 1 tide of storm surge the time series of the tidal level of numerical results and measured data at gauges are presented in fig 11 the computed results could match well the measurements indicating the numerical model could reproduce the storm surge the intense typhoon made the water level of gauges reach or exceed 4 m during the typhoon the correlation analysis and error analysis are shown in fig 12 and table 3 the linear correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 96 3 5 2 setup of storm surge the astronomical tide without typhoon is calculated firstly then the water level of storm surge is used to minus the astronomical tide to derive the setup induced by the storm surge the time series of setup induced by the storm surge are plotted in fig 13 the water setup duration of each station in the yangtze river estuary is around 1 day and the time series possess one or double peak the station at the mouth of the yangtze river at wusong station and nanmen station is a single peak type stations near the mouth of the yangtze river such as zhongli station and hengsha station have double peaks and the two peaks are closer when the typhoon was far away from the gauge station the water level was slowly rising as the typhoon approached the water level rised sharply and forms a distinct peak the water level decreased faster after the peak and then there is a small amplitude oscillation 3 6 effects of human projects 3 6 1 tide of storm surge during the recent 20 years the human projects including yedcrp and other projects have significantly modified the topography and coastal line in this study we mainly focus on how the human projects impact storm surge hazard in the previous subsection the numerical simulation of the storm surge using the bathymetry of this time is presented and the measurement could match well with the numerical results to assess the effect of the human projects on storm surge the bathymetry after the projects in 2013 is used the tidal constituents and runoff are the same as the previous case the comparison of the time series of tide induced by the storm surge is plotted in fig 14 it is found that the trend of the tidal level after human projects is basically consistent with the results before human projects the change of the topography of the yangtze river estuary is not enough to change the evolution of the storm surge but has a significant impact on the highest water level in the storm surge process except luchaogang located in the hangzhou bay the tidal level of other gauges using bathymetry after projects are less than the tide before the projects fig 15 illustrates the distribution of the maximum water level before and after the projects generally the water level before the projects is larger than the water level after the projects in the upstream of yedcrp the water level reaches 4 5 m and 4 m in the north branch and south branch respectively before the projects while it is 4 m and 3 5 m after the projects in the upstream of the yangtze delta the maximum water level reaches 5 5 m before the projects while it is 5 m after the projects in particular the adjacent area of the yangtze river estuary and hangzhou bay the water level after the projects is slightly larger than the water level before the projects to analyze the impact of human projects on the maximum tide level distribution fig 16 shows the difference of the maximum tide level before and after human projects the yedcrp and nanhui silting project have significant impacts on the tide level through the projects interventions the maximum tide level around the yedcrp during the storm is reduced by 0 2 0 5 m than that without the project in addition the yangtze river bridge project has relatively small impact on the tide level while the spur dike makes the tide level to be smaller the maximum difference could reach 0 8 m around the spur dike 3 6 2 setup of storm surge fig 17 presents the comparison of the time series of setup induced by the storm surge before and after human projects at some gauges the human projects have a minor impact on the setup of storm surge such as wusong changxing baozhen and nanmen they are located in the inside of the estuary and the human projects do not affect the bathymetry the hengsha and zhongjun have been affected a little by the human projects which are closer to yedcrp and other projects the change of the bathymetry leads to the difference of storm surge the other gauges in the outside of the estuary or close to the projects have been strongly influenced by the human projects table 4 summarizes the maximum water level and setup induced by the storm surge before and after human projects generally the human projects would make the hazard of the storm surge in the yangtze estuary a little gentler the maximum setup and water level induced by the storm surge before human projects is generally larger than the ones after human projects the maximum tide level difference and the maximum setup difference are in the range of 0 09 0 52 m and 0 06 0 63 m respectively for example the maximum tide level and maximum setup at nancao before projects are 0 43 m and 0 63 m larger than the values after this is because the reclamation and spur dike of yedcrp could stop tide water of storm surge however the differences at wusong hengsha changxing and nanmen are not obvious relatively the reason is their locations are far from the projects which has relatively small impact the peak of the setup generally does not overlap with the peak of the storm surge most of the peaks of the setup in the internal station of the yangtze river mouth appear after the peak of the storm surge and only the peak of the setup in the station near the outer sea appears before the peak of the storm surge 3 7 impact of sea level rise on inundation with the bathymetry data after the human projects and the elevation of sea dike the extreme storm surge inundation risk of pudong new district has been analyzed by considering the overlay effect of the worst typhoon path and sea level rise the inundation model doesn t consider the processes of wave overtopping and sea dike breaking the computational grids are refined to be around 100 m in pudong new district the numerically simulated scenarios include the relative sea level rise rslr 0 m 0 3 m by 2050 and 0 7 m by 2100 the rslr includes the subsidence of ground and sea dike and sea level rise herein the influences of the storm waves on the inundation are not considered in the study tajima 2017 fig 18 illustrates the flood inundation maps around pudong international airport with rslr 0 0 m a 0 3 m b 0 7 m c the numerical results show that the inundation depth at most flooding region behind the sea dike is less than 0 5 m and the potential inundation risk of shanghai pudong airport is still very small under the extreme storm surge conditions the rslr 0 7 m with the worst typhoon path could cause the largest inundation area behind the sea dike but the inundation area is not significantly larger than the rslr 0 0 m scenario the main reason is that the duration of the tide level exceeded the elevation of the sea dike is limited which limits the total water amount across the sea dike 4 conclusions in this study the impact of human projects on storm surge hazard is investigated numerically the numerical model is based on the 2d shallow water equations and the turbulence effect and bottom friction are included in the model the open boundary condition is specified by tidal level and runoff of yangtze river qiantang river and huangpu river the holland model is adopted to generate the typhoon wind field and pressure field and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface is taken in the model by the action of wind stress the storm surge induced by super typhoon winnie 9711 is studied in this paper the comparison with measured wind data at three gauges indicates a good simulation of wind speed and pressure the storm surge is modeled by the original bathymetry before the human projects firstly the numerical results in terms of time series of tide could match well with the measurements except for hengsha station the water level could exceed 4 0 m the superposition of high tide and storm surge has aggravated the hazard the maximum setup of zhongjun wusong hengsha and nanmen reached or exceeded 1 0 m to study the effect of the human projects on the storm surge due to the changes of the bathymetry and coastal line of yangtze estuary the storm surge using bathymetry data after the human projects is simulated the numerical results show that the human projects would make the storm surge hazard in the yangtze estuary a little gentler the maximum setup and water level induced by the storm surge before the human projects are generally larger than the ones after the human projects except the luchaogang which is located at the outside of the yangtze estuary the maximum tide level difference and the maximum setup difference are in the range of 0 09 0 52 m and 0 06 0 63 m respectively the main reason is the reclamation and spur dike of yedcrp obstruct the propagation of storm surge in addition thought the flood inundation maps including of rslr 0 0 m 0 3 m and 0 7 m using bathymetry and sea dike data after the human projects the extreme storm surge inundation risk around pudong international airport is presented the numerical results show that the inundation depth at most flooding region behind the sea dike is less than 0 5 m and the potential inundation risk of shanghai pudong airport is still very small under the extreme storm surge conditions although the human projects could make the storm surge smaller it is still hard to say the human projects strengthen the resilience of shanghai firstly the storm surge may cause larger economic losses in the reclamation district it also could cause the damage to the human projects secondly the impacts of the human projects on hydrodynamic environment and storm waves need in depth

22222,the impact of human projects on storm surge hazard in the yangtze estuary is studied numerically the numerical model is based on the shallow water equations which includes the turbulence effect bottom friction and runoff of rivers the holland model is used to generate the wind field and pressure field of the typhoon winnie 9711 which has caused huge hazards to the yangtze estuary a good comparison of typhoon speed and storm surge with measured data indicates the numerical model is acceptable the water level induced by the typhoon could be up to 4 0 m the superposition of high tide and storm surge has aggravated the hazard the maximum setup could reach or exceed 1 5 m to analyze the impact of human projects the origin bathymetry and that with several human projects are used to implement the simulation respectively the numerical results show that the human projects have gentle impact on the effects of the storm surge on coastal regions in terms of tide and setup the extreme storm surge inundation risk around pudong international airport are presented including of relative sea level rise 0 m 0 3 m and 0 7 m keywords storm surge typhoon human project yangtze estuary numerical simulation 1 introduction the storm surge is triggered by the extratropical or tropical cyclones particularly due to hurricanes and typhoons the unusual rise of sea level and relevant inundation could cause hazard and damage to coastal regions china is the region most affected by the storm surge in the world the typhoons generated in the pacific ocean could bring massive disaster to coasts li and nie 2017 the yangtze river delta area is the largest economic zone of china including shanghai zhejiang province and jiangsu province the yangtze estuary is alluvial plain which forms due to the sand carried by the river from upstream 6000 7000 years ago the mouth of the yangtze river is a submerged valley estuary and the top of the bay located in zhenjiang and yangzhou the width of the mouth has been narrowed from 180 km to 90 km according to the measurement of datong station the maximum minimum and average annual flow rate are 92600 m3 s 4620 m3 s and 29300 m3 s respectively the total annual runoff is 924 billion cubic meters tides are regular half diurnal outside the estuary and irregular half diurnal inside the mouth of the estuary the annual average tidal difference near the mouth is 2 66 m and the maximum tidal difference is 4 62 m as the estuary of the largest river in asia the yangtze estuary has complex hydrodynamic characteristics it is not only affected by the interaction between upstream floods and outer sea tidal currents but also by many factors such as storm surges huge waves and rising sea level during 1949 2003 the yangtze estuary and its neighboring areas were attacked by 2 3 typhoon storm surges every year in addition the huge projects in the yangtze estuary have modified the bathymetry and coastal line it is necessary to investigate how the human projects impact the storm surge hazard using numerical simulation cao et al 2019 the numerical technique has been adopted to forecast of storm surge with the advancement of computer science weisberg and zheng 2008 reported that the accuracy of the 3d storm surge model for tidal level is only slightly higher than that of the 2d model considering that the calculation speed of the 2d model is much faster the 2d model is more widely used in the storm surge forecasting model yu and yu 2011 most numerical models adopt structured grid for its stability however it can t better fit

bathymetry change wang et al 2018 and effect of coupling with wave torres et al 2018 feng et al 2018 could affect the storm surge hazard the impact of climate change including sea level rise and increasing of typhoon intensity could induce more serious storm surge hazard yin et al 2017 typhoon intensification has a greater impact on storm surge while sea level rise could greatly affect the wave height in the estuary the increasing of sea surface temperatures could strengthen the wind speed wang et al 2018 investigated the effects of sea level rise land subsidence and bathymetry change on storm surge and found that the compound scenario of these three factors would generate more severe flood than the single factor in addition the sea level rise and land subsidence are the major factors to coastal flood prevention for long term scenarios passeri et al 2018 indicated that the sea level rise could increase surge heights and cause overwash to occur at more locations and for longer durations in recent years many human projects have been implemented in the yangtze estuary the yangtze estuary deepwater channel regulation project yedcrp began in 1998 and finished in 2011 as

historically impacted the yangtze estuary greatly is of this kind selected for the simulation of storm surge it made 248 death more than 5000 people injured and direct economic loss 43 of billion rmb which is stated as one of the most expensive natural disasters in china fig 2 presents the track of typhoon winnie and the wind level is represented by different colors the storm originated from a tropical disturbance over the western pacific on august 8 1997 and it moved northwestward steadily after its generation and strengthened gradually in the evening of august 18th the typhoon landed at wenling zhejiang province china whose central pressure was about 960 hpa with maximum surface wind speed of 40 m s the tidal elevations of the yangtze estuary and the huangpu river exceeded the historical highest record in history the huangpu river reached a rare high water level of a 300 year return period and the tide in huangpu park reached the elevation of a 500 year return period the

6 h before landfall at the moment of landfall the maximum wind speed decreased to be 36 m s with 981 hpa in the typhoon center even at 6 h after landfall the maximum wind speed was still 32 m s including the 986 hpa in the typhoon center to validate the numerical results of the typhoon wind field the measurements at three locations have been used to compare with the computational results the three locations named shipu dachen and kanmen are shown in fig 4 a the comparisons between the computational results and measured data are plotted in fig 4 b c and d the measurements are plotted by black circles and the numerical results are represented by black line generally the computational wind speed could match with the measurements at shipu dachen and kanmen therefore the wind field could be adopted to model the storm surge the wind speed increased from 12 00 august 17th and reached the maximum speed as the typhoon approached the coast the maximum wind speed at dachen and shipu reached 35 m s while the maximum speed at kanmen is 25 m s 3 2 computational domain and grid the computational domain is from 117 30 e to 123 30 e and from 29 33 to 32 15 as shown in figs 5 and 6 it includes the huangpu river yangzhou bay and zhoushan island the length from the east to the west is around 550 km and is 340 km from the south to the north the unstructured grid is adopted in the numerical model as shown in fig 6 the unstructured grids can accurately fit the complex and changeable land water boundary and islands and can partially refine the key research areas it can effectively improve the computational efficiency of the model on the basis of guaranteeing the computational accuracy the computational domain has been divided by 147018 unstructured triangular mesh cells with 75449 grid nodes 3 3 model setup in the numerical model the time step is between 0 5 s and 3 s to make the cfl number is less than 0 8 the smagorinsky model is adopted in the turbulence model while the constant is 0 28 m2 s the roughness coefficient of the model varies gradually from the outer sea to the yangtze estuary the roughness of the deep main channel and the outer sea is 0 011 0 016 while that of the shoaly land is 0 020 0 028 the wet dry boundary method is used to handle the boundary if the water depth is less than 0 005 m the grid node is dry if the water depth is deeper than 0 005 and less than 0 05 m the current speed is 0 the grid node has only been used in the continuity equation if the flow depth is larger than 0 1 m the surge could inundation on the land the wind stress parameters are c a 0 0015 c b 0 003 w a 10 m s and w b 20 m s 3 4 validation of the astronomical tide 3 4 1 before human projects the typhoon winnie is generated on august 10 1997 and landed on zhejiang province on august 18 1997 according to the tidal data obtained from the stations in the yangtze estuary hangzhou bay and zhejiang coastal region the tidal level was not affected by typhoons from august 4 to august 14 before the typhoon winnie this astronomical tidal data during this period can be used to validate the model the comparisons of time series of the tidal level at zhongjun wusong hengsha and changxing are plotted in fig 7 the measured tidal level is denoted by dots and the numerical results are plotted by solid line the computational astronomical tide could match well with simulated results fig 8 reveals the correlation analysis of astronomical tide between the measurements and numerical results the errors between calculated and measured tidal levels at each tidal level station are limited table 1 has summarized the correlation analysis and error analysis of which the mae and rmse denote mean absolute error and root mean square error respectively the linear correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 96 representing high correlation this indicates that the post recurrence numerical model could produce accuracy calculation of astronomical tides in the yangtze river estuary during the non typhoon period 3 4 2 after human projects the astronomical tide in the current bathymetry after the human projects also have been validated the duration for astronomical tide validation is from july 15th to july 31st 2013 the computational data also match well with the measured tide as shown in fig 9 the correlation analysis and error analysis are shown in fig 10 and table 2 linearly correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 98 indicating that the numerical model could produce accuracy calculation of astronomical tides in the yangtze river estuary during the non typhoon period using bathymetry after human projects 3 5 validation of the storm surge 3 5 1 tide of storm surge the time series of the tidal level of numerical results and measured data at gauges are presented in fig 11 the computed results could match well the measurements indicating the numerical model could reproduce the storm surge the intense typhoon made the water level of gauges reach or exceed 4 m during the typhoon the correlation analysis and error analysis are shown in fig 12 and table 3 the linear correlation coefficient cc are all larger than 0 96 3 5 2 setup of storm surge the astronomical tide without typhoon is calculated firstly then the water level of storm surge is used to minus the astronomical tide to derive the setup induced by the storm surge the time series of setup induced by the storm surge are plotted in fig 13 the water setup duration of each station in the yangtze river estuary is around 1 day and the time series possess one or double peak the station at the mouth of the yangtze river at wusong station and nanmen station is a single peak type stations near the mouth of the yangtze river such as zhongli station and hengsha station have double peaks and the two peaks are closer when the typhoon was far away from the gauge station the water level was slowly rising as the typhoon approached the water level rised sharply and forms a distinct peak the water level decreased faster after the peak and then there is a small amplitude oscillation 3 6 effects of human projects 3 6 1 tide of storm surge during the recent 20 years the human projects including yedcrp and other projects have significantly modified the topography and coastal line in this study we mainly focus on how the human projects impact storm surge hazard in the previous subsection the numerical simulation of the storm surge using the bathymetry of this time is presented and the measurement could match well with the numerical results to assess the effect of the human projects on storm surge the bathymetry after the projects in 2013 is used the tidal constituents and runoff are the same as the previous case the comparison of the time series of tide induced by the storm surge is plotted in fig 14 it is found that the trend of the tidal level after human projects is basically consistent with the results before human projects the change of the topography of the yangtze river estuary is not enough to change the evolution of the storm surge but has a significant impact on the highest water level in the storm surge process except luchaogang located in the hangzhou bay the tidal level of other gauges using bathymetry after projects are less than the tide before the projects fig 15 illustrates the distribution of the maximum water level before and after the projects generally the water level before the projects is larger than the water level after the projects in the upstream of yedcrp the water level reaches 4 5 m and 4 m in the north branch and south branch respectively before the projects while it is 4 m and 3 5 m after the projects in the upstream of the yangtze delta the maximum water level reaches 5 5 m before the projects while it is 5 m after the projects in particular the adjacent area of the yangtze river estuary and hangzhou bay the water level after the projects is slightly larger than the water level before the projects to analyze the impact of human projects on the maximum tide level distribution fig 16 shows the difference of the maximum tide level before and after human projects the yedcrp and nanhui silting project have significant impacts on the tide level through the projects interventions the maximum tide level around the yedcrp during the storm is reduced by 0 2 0 5 m than that without the project in addition the yangtze river bridge project has relatively small impact on the tide level while the spur dike makes the tide level to be smaller the maximum difference could reach 0 8 m around the spur dike 3 6 2 setup of storm surge fig 17 presents the comparison of the time series of setup induced by the storm surge before and after human projects at some gauges the human projects have a minor impact on the setup of storm surge such as wusong changxing baozhen and nanmen they are located in the inside of the estuary and the human projects do not affect the bathymetry the hengsha and zhongjun have been affected a little by the human projects which are closer to yedcrp and other projects the change of the bathymetry leads to the difference of storm surge the other gauges in the outside of the estuary or close to the projects have been strongly influenced by the human projects table 4 summarizes the maximum water level and setup induced by the storm surge before and after human projects generally the human projects would make the hazard of the storm surge in the yangtze estuary a little gentler the maximum setup and water level induced by the storm surge before human projects is generally larger than the ones after human projects the maximum tide level difference and the maximum setup difference are in the range of 0 09 0 52 m and 0 06 0 63 m respectively for example the maximum tide level and maximum setup at nancao before projects are 0 43 m and 0 63 m larger than the values after this is because the reclamation and spur dike of yedcrp could stop tide water of storm surge however the differences at wusong hengsha changxing and nanmen are not obvious relatively the reason is their locations are far from the projects which has relatively small impact the peak of the setup generally does not overlap with the peak of the storm surge most of the peaks of the setup in the internal station of the yangtze river mouth appear after the peak of the storm surge and only the peak of the setup in the station near the outer sea appears before the peak of the storm surge 3 7 impact of sea level rise on inundation with the bathymetry data after the human projects and the elevation of sea dike the extreme storm surge inundation risk of pudong new district has been analyzed by considering the overlay effect of the worst typhoon path and sea level rise the inundation model doesn t consider the processes of wave overtopping and sea dike breaking the computational grids are refined to be around 100 m in pudong new district the numerically simulated scenarios include the relative sea level rise rslr 0 m 0 3 m by 2050 and 0 7 m by 2100 the rslr includes the subsidence of ground and sea dike and sea level rise herein the influences of the storm waves on the inundation are not considered in the study tajima 2017 fig 18 illustrates the flood inundation maps around pudong international airport with rslr 0 0 m a 0 3 m b 0 7 m c the numerical results show that the inundation depth at most flooding region behind the sea dike is less than 0 5 m and the potential inundation risk of shanghai pudong airport is still very small under the extreme storm surge conditions the rslr 0 7 m with the worst typhoon path could cause the largest inundation area behind the sea dike but the inundation area is not significantly larger than the rslr 0 0 m scenario the main reason is that the duration of the tide level exceeded the elevation of the sea dike is limited which limits the total water amount across the sea dike 4 conclusions in this study the impact of human projects on storm surge hazard is investigated numerically the numerical model is based on the 2d shallow water equations and the turbulence effect and bottom friction are included in the model the open boundary condition is specified by tidal level and runoff of yangtze river qiantang river and huangpu river the holland model is adopted to generate the typhoon wind field and pressure field and wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface is taken in the model by the action of wind stress the storm surge induced by super typhoon winnie 9711 is studied in this paper the comparison with measured wind data at three gauges indicates a good simulation of wind speed and pressure the storm surge is modeled by the original bathymetry before the human projects firstly the numerical results in terms of time series of tide could match well with the measurements except for hengsha station the water level could exceed 4 0 m the superposition of high tide and storm surge has aggravated the hazard the maximum setup of zhongjun wusong hengsha and nanmen reached or exceeded 1 0 m to study the effect of the human projects on the storm surge due to the changes of the bathymetry and coastal line of yangtze estuary the storm surge using bathymetry data after the human projects is simulated the numerical results show that the human projects would make the storm surge hazard in the yangtze estuary a little gentler the maximum setup and water level induced by the storm surge before the human projects are generally larger than the ones after the human projects except the luchaogang which is located at the outside of the yangtze estuary the maximum tide level difference and the maximum setup difference are in the range of 0 09 0 52 m and 0 06 0 63 m respectively the main reason is the reclamation and spur dike of yedcrp obstruct the propagation of storm surge in addition thought the flood inundation maps including of rslr 0 0 m 0 3 m and 0 7 m using bathymetry and sea dike data after the human projects the extreme storm surge inundation risk around pudong international airport is presented the numerical results show that the inundation depth at most flooding region behind the sea dike is less than 0 5 m and the potential inundation risk of shanghai pudong airport is still very small under the extreme storm surge conditions although the human projects could make the storm surge smaller it is still hard to say the human projects strengthen the resilience of shanghai firstly the storm surge may cause larger economic losses in the reclamation district it also could cause the damage to the human projects secondly the impacts of the human projects on hydrodynamic environment and storm waves need in depth

22223,two dimensional laminar flow around three side by side rectangular prisms placed between two parallel walls is numerically investigated at a reynolds number re 100 the cross sectional aspect ratio of each prism is b h 3 where b and h are the prism width and height respectively the gap spacing g between the two adjacent prisms and between the wall and the outer prism is varied from g g h 0

fluctuating lift coefficient and d time mean drag coefficient image 1 keywords wall effect flow structure forces strouhal number 1 introduction the problem of fluid flow around slender structures is of interest among the researchers and scientists for their enormous applications in the fields of aerodynamics e g wind flow around high rise buildings chimney stacks overhead power line bundles offshore engineering e g flow past bridge piers offshore platform drilling rigs and riser system and subsea engineering e g flow around sub sea cables and pipelines these structures very often appear in a group making the flow physics more complicated than a single structure for the closely spaced structures the complicated flow arises due to the mutual interaction between shear layers and between wake vortices because of everything getting compact in the modern engineering applications of flow around multiple structures in wall proximity get broader such as the flow around prisms cylinders in a channel to enhance flow mixing and heat transfer the flow around drive bays in cpus etc it is therefore essential to assimilate the complicated flow around closely spaced multiple structures with a view to their practical applications due to the geometric simplicity the structures are mostly found in circular square or rectangular shapes a comprehensive review of the wakes behind different bluff body shapes including square circular and triangular cylinders is can be found in derakhshandeh and alam 2019 flow around multiple cylindrical structures of circular or square shape have been extensively investigated in the literature through experiments e g okajima 1982 legal et al 1990 sumner et al 1999 alam and sakamoto 2005 alam et al 2003 alam and zhou 2007 alam 2014 bai and alam 2018

one of the key features of the flow around a circular cylinder is that the flow separation point oscillates following the vortex shedding and also depends on the reynolds number on the other hand for the flow around sharp edge bodies like square rectangular prisms the flow separation point is fixed at the corners and less sensitive to reynolds number the effect of gap spacing between the two side by side square prisms on the wake formation and vortex shedding was reported in the literature e g agrawal et al 2006 alam and zhou 2013 ma et al 2017 agrawal et al 2006 studied the vortex shedding and wake at a low reynolds number re 73 for the gap spacing g g h 0 7 and 2 5 where g is the gap distance between the prisms and h is the height of prisms they identified flip flop and synchronized flow regimes for g 0 7 and 2 5 respectively in the flip flop flow the gap flow was biased flip flopping from a side to the other on the other hand in synchronized flow the gap flow was symmetric vortex shedding from the two prims occurring either an inphase or antiphase fashion alam and zhou 2013 experimentally analyzed the features of wakes for g 0 4 0 at re 300 they distinguished four different flow regimes i single bluff body regime g 0 2 ii narrow and wide street regime 0 2 g 1 1 iii transition regime 1 1 g 1 4 and iv coupled street regime g 1 4 ma et al 2017 at re 16 200 identified nine distinct flow patterns for g 0 10 the nomenclatures of nine patterns are i steady state wake ii symmetric single vortex street iii asymmetric single vortex street iv irregular vortex shedding v synchronized in phase vortex shedding vi synchronized anti phase vortex shedding vii synchronized inphase dominated vortex shedding with low frequency modulation viii synchronized antiphase dominated vortex shedding with low frequency modulation and ix asymmetric synchronized anti phase vortex shedding mode recently there is a surge of investigation on the flow across more than two square prisms sewatkar et al 2009 numerically examined the flow over nine square prisms in side by side arrangements for re 30 140 and 1 g 4 at small g the secondary frequency caused by wake interaction accompanied the primary vortex shedding frequency for large g 3 0 and 4 0 the interaction among the wakes behind the cylinders was weak the primary frequency thus dominated the flow for five side by side square prisms at re 150 chatterjee et al 2010 observed flip flopping g 1 2 inphase and antiphase synchronized g 3 and non synchronized g 4 flow structures recently zheng and alam 2017 numerically investigated the flow physics for three side by side square prisms at re 150 and g 0 1 8 0 they identified five distinct flow structures i base bleed flow ii flip flopping flow iii symmetrically biased beat flow iv non biased beat flow and v weak interaction flow the detailed physical mechanism of the existence of the secondary frequency was clarified all the above mentioned studies on the multiple prisms are for the unconfined flow that is the side wall effect is negligible on the flow investigations on the fluid flow around confined rectangular prism s are very scarce davis et al 1984 examined the effect of confining walls on the flow around a rectangular prism the emphasis was given to understand the effect of g 1 5 and 2 5 b h 0 6 1 0 and 1 7 and re 100 1850 on the flow physics the strouhal number and average drag coefficient were increased when the side walls were brought close to the prisms they observed that the average drag coefficient increases when re is increased or b h is decreased zhang et al 2017 investigated confined flow around two tandem rectangular prisms at re 100 with a blockage ratio of 25 they varied b h from 1 to 4 and the gap spacing ratio between the prisms from 1 to 8 regardless of b h two flow regimes were observed namely steady flow regime for gap spacing ratio 3 0 and unsteady flow regime for gap spacing ratio 4 0 in many practical applications rectangular structures appear in side by side under wall confinement such as multiple prisms in a channel flow to enhance heat transfer series of hard disks in cpus etc recently in a cpu having nine hard disks in a x y z 1 3 3 configuration x direction representing the flow direction it is identified that some hard disks became out of order when the cooling fan driven air flow reached a certain level it is believed that flow induced oscillations of the disks are the main issue behind the hard disks not working naturally investigations are direly needed on the flow induced forces and flow around confined hard disks the aim of this work to assimilate the dynamics of the flow around confined hard disks confined flow around three side by side x y z 1 3 1 prisms having an aspect ratio of b h 3 0 is investigated at re 100 the focus is given on the effect of g 0 8 3 4 on flow structures strouhal number st fluctuating lift coefficient cʹ l mean lift coefficient c l and mean drag coefficient c d generally a prism with b h 2 8 is considered as a short prism where the shear layers from the leading edges roll up behind the prism without reattaching on the side surfaces okajima et al 1980 takai and sakamoto 2006 on the other hand a prism with b h 2 8 is considered as a long prism where the shear layers separating from the leading edge reattach on the side surfaces of the prism presently b h 3 0 is chosen as a representative of the elongated prisms 2 problem statement we considered two dimensional incompressible viscous flow around three side by side identical rectangular prisms p1 p2 and p3 placed between two parallel walls as shown in fig 1 the aspect ratio b h of each rectangular prism is the same b h 3 while the reynolds number re ρu h μ 100 where u ρ and μ are the uniform inlet velocity density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid the gap spacings g between two adjacent prisms and between the confining walls and outer prisms are equal numerical simulations are performed for g g h 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 5 2 8 3 0 3 2 and 3 4 respectively the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y is considered such that the origin is at the centre of the middle prism p2 the x axis is positive along the streamwise direction and the y axis is perpendicular to the streamwise direction directed upward the inlet and outlet boundaries are assumed at a distance x u 14 5h and x d 30 5h from the front and rear faces of the prisms respectively furthermore the distance between the lateral boundary walls is denoted by y l 3 computational details 3 1 governing equations boundary conditions and numerical method an unsteady viscous laminar incompressible and newtonian fluid flow is governed by the continuity and navier stokes equations that in non dimensional form can be written as 1 u x v y 0 2a u t u u x v u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2b v t u v x v v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 the non dimensional form of the cartesian coordinate velocity components pressure and time are x x h y y h u u u v v u p p ρu 2 and t tu h respectively where u and v are the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively p is the static pressure and t is the time in the computational domain the boundary conditions are prescribed as follows in engineering fields and in nature there are many applications of confined flow where the approaching flow is either uniform or parabolic suzuki et al 1993 chakraborty et al 2004 sharma and eswaran 2005 at the inlet boundary x u 14 5h a uniform velocity profile is considered u 1 v 0 no slip boundary condition u 0 v 0 is adopted on the prism surfaces and on the two side walls at the outlet x d 30 5h zero stress vectors are specified u x 0 v x u y 0 utilizing the above boundary conditions the governing equations 1 and 2 are solved numerically using finite volume method base commercial solver ansys fluent 15 0 to solve the equations the computational domain is meshed as a combination of uniform and non uniform quadrangular meshes using ansys icem cfd the coupling between the pressure and velocity is accessed using the scheme pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso convective terms are discretized using the second order upwind scheme and second order implicit discretization is adopted for time marching 3 2 study of convergence and validation 3 2 1 mesh independent test before proceeding to extensive simulations on confined fluid flow around the three side by side rectangular prisms the grid adequacy test is conducted for the unconfined flow around a square prism at re 100 with symmetry boundary conditions i e v 0 u y 0 for lateral boundaries blockage ratio 5 with x u 14 5h and x d 30 5h the computational domain consists of an o grid system surrounding the prism and a quadrangular grid system away from the prism fig 2 grid points on the surface of the square prism are uniformly spaced with the first grid point lying 0 005h away from the prism surface the grid spacing is increased with an expansion rate of 1 03 at the far downstream field x 14 5h a uniform grid spacing is considered three different meshes m1 m2 and m3 are tested consisting of the number of meshes 45 714 71 610 and 130 863 respectively to check the adequacy of the grid resolution the integral parameters strouhal number st fluctuating lift coefficient cʹ l time mean drag coefficient c d and fluctuating drag coefficient cˊ d for three different mesh distributions are tabulated in table 1 here the st and lift c l and drag c d coefficients are computed as 3 s t f h u c l 2 f l ρ h u 2 and c d 2 f d ρ h u 2 where f f l and f d are vortex shedding frequency lift force and drag force respectively the results in table 1 exhibits that the values of integral parameters have a maximum deviation of 3 77 for cˊ d between meshes m1 and m2 on the other hand meshes m2 and m3 render a negligible difference 0 33 in the results mesh m2 is thus assumed enough for the unconfined flow the results obtained from the mesh distribution m2 are further compared with those in the literature in table 2 the present results have a good agreement with those in the literature applying mesh distribution m2 to three rectangular prisms between two parallel walls the mesh and time independence tests are done again as shown in table 3 as the lateral boundaries acting as confined walls are now not free slip a fine mesh is considered near the side walls such that the first grid point from a side wall is again 0 005h away again the grid space is increased with a geometric progression ratio of 1 03 the mesh distributions near the rectangular prism and side walls are shown in fig 2 b c space and time independent tests are done for g 1 0 1 5 and 2 8 as presented in table 3 where st cʹ l c d and cʹ d are compared for different grids and time steps for each value of g two different mesh distributions are considered where the mesh density in case 2 is double of that in case 1 where case 1 has the similar mesh density of m2 as validated for single isolated prism before since the values of the parameters for outer prisms p1 and p3 are equal the results of p1 only are presented considering all three values of g it is observed that the deviations in st cʹ l c d and cʹ d are less than 0 77 2 13 0 34 and 1 85 respectively the mesh density and time step of case 1 is thus adopted 4 wake structures and forces identification of flow regimes is of interest among the researchers and engineers in many applications depending on the flow structures and shedding frequency three different regimes are identified namely regime a single vortex street 0 8 g 1 1 regime b twin vortex streets 1 1 g 2 1 and regime c triple vortex streets 2 1 g 3 4 the separation point between the two regimes is chosen as the midpoint of two consecutive simulations that show two different flow patterns each of the flow regimes is discussed in details in the subsequent subsections 4 1 regime a single vortex street 0 8 g 1 1 for small g 1 1 a single body like flow appears fig 3 shows instantaneous vorticity contours for g 0 8 the snapshots are given at different time instants in about 1 5 vortex shedding periods showing the evolution of vortices in the wake note that there are a total of four gaps two between the prisms and two between the walls and prisms two shear layers form in each gap spawning two counter rotating vortices respectively a total of eight vortices are thus shed from the shear layers in one period of nominal vortex shedding the growth and shedding of the vortices from the prisms occurs in an inphase fashion an amalgamation and amputation process of the shed vortices leads to the evolution of the eight vortices in two vortices a single wake consisting of two rows of vortices thus forms for x 6 as marked in the snapshot in fig 3a eight vortices u 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 l 1 l 2 w 1 and w 2 are linked to the eight shear layers respectively with the time elapsed vortices u 1 m 1 and l 1 are first pinched off and amalgamated forming u 1 m 1 l 1 vortex fig 3d vortex w 1 lifting up approaches the combined vortex u 1 m 1 l 1 fig 3d f eventually the four same sign positive vortices merge together forming u 1 m 1 l 1 w 1 vortex similarly four negative sign vortices form one united vortex u 2 m 2 l 2 w 2 downstream fig 3f interestingly three same sign vortices from the prisms come close to each other and then the same sign vortex from the corresponding wall joins them eventually a single vortex street consisting of positive and negative vortices forms in a similar fashion to a karman vortex street however while a karman vortex street is generally characterized by positive vortices on the lower side y 0 and negative vortices on the upper side y 0 here the vortex arrangement is opposite i e negative and positive vortices appearing on the lower and upper sides of the symmetry line y 0 respectively see the vortex arrangement at x 9 0 that is the merging and reversion process of the vortices results in the formation of a reverse karman vortex street downstream fig 4 shows the time histories of lift and drag coefficients of three prisms along with the power spectra of lift coefficients the lift and drag coefficients of the middle prism are periodic and sinusoidal whereas those of outer prisms are periodic but not sinusoidal in nature the lift signals fig 4a imply that the sheddings of the positive from the lower side vortices from prisms 1 and 2 are inphase figs 3a and 4a as are those of the negative from the upper side vortices from prisms 2 and 3 figs 3f and 4a the lift amplitude measured from minimum to maximum and time mean drag coefficient are the same for the outer prisms while those are larger for the middle prism than for the outer prisms the value of the time mean lift coefficient is 0 41 0 and 0 41 for prisms 1 2 and 3 respectively indicating attractive lift force for the outer prisms the power spectra fig 4c show that the shedding frequency is the same for the three prisms the second and third harmonics of vortex shedding frequency are observed the harmonics emerge owing to the interaction among the vortices immediately behind the prisms the second harmonic peak is quite strong for the outer prisms but absent for the middle prism this is because the middle prism lying on the symmetric line experiences symmetric atmosphere on either side an outer prism has an asymmetric atmosphere one side surface facing the middle prism and the other side facing the wall 4 2 regime b twin vortex streets 1 1 g 2 1 twin vortex streets are observed for 1 1 g 2 1 fig 5 shows the instantaneous flow structures the vortices from the prisms gap stretch in the transverse direction each getting pinched off at the middle forms two small vortices for example m 2 vortex in fig 5a splits into m 2 and m 2 vortices fig 5b and c the same happens for the positive vortex from the upper prism u 2 vortex splitting into u 2 and u 2 fig 5a c while split vortices m 2 and m 2 from the middle prism are almost equal to each other split vortex u 2 is much weaker than u 2 that goes to the wall side and dies out fig 5c the split of the negative vortex from the upper side from the upper prism does not take place neither does the positive vortex from the lower prism now the same signed vortices u 2 m 2 and l 2 come close to each other and form a combined vortex u 2 m 2 l 2 lying on the lower side of y 0 the vortex m 2 stays on the upper side and snatches vorticity from the wall keeping alive fig 5d the evolution and interactions of the vortices reveal that a positive vortex on the lower vortex street x 8 is composed of two split positive vortices u 2 m 2 from the middle and upper prisms and one intact positive vortex l 2 from the lower prism fig 5f on the other hand a positive vortex on the upper vortex street consists of a split positive vortex from the middle prism along with vorticity from the upper wall in a similar fashion two rows of negative vortices come into being in the wake two vortex streets thus feature the wake the appearance of vortices in each street is again in a fashion of reverse karman vortex street time histories of lift and drag coefficients and their power spectra are presented in fig 6 similar to regime a the three prisms shed vortices at the same frequency st 0 2792 fig 6c unlike regime a the second or third harmonic frequency in the power spectra is absent this is because the complex interaction between the vortices largely occurs in x 6 for regime a and in x 6 9 for regime b the lift signals of the three prisms indicates that the phase lag between the vortex sheddings from the outer prisms is zero and that between the middle and outer prisms is 15 5 time mean lift coefficient is positive 0 35 for prism 1 and negative 0 35 for prism 3 while zero for prism 2 this implies that the outer prisms undergo repulsive lift forces fluctuation in drag is smaller for the middle prism than for the outer prisms the middle prism undergoes a larger time mean drag than the outer prisms 4 3 regime c triple vortex streets 2 1 g 3 4 now the gap between the prisms and between walls and prism is large enough allowing each prism to shed vortices like an isolated prism fig 7 triple vortex streets thus feature the wake like regimes a and b the vortex shedding frequencies of three prisms are the same which can also be observed from the power spectra of lift signal of three prisms fig 8 c still repulsive lift forces appear for the outer prisms while amplitudes of the lift forces of the three prisms are approximately the same fig 8a the outer prisms have the same time mean drag coefficient and the same fluctuating drag the value of time mean drag is smaller for outer prisms than for the middle prism while the fluctuation in drag is greater for outer prisms than the middle prism fig 8b 5 effect of g on forces and strouhal number fig 9 illustrates the dependence of st c d cʹ l and c l on g at the top of the figure the span of each flow regime is marked the st of each prism was estimated from spectral analyses of the fluctuating lift force acting on the prism as shown before all the three prisms have identical st the only one data set is therefore plotted in the figure with increasing g the st declines from 0 39 at g 0 8 to 0 18 at g 3 4 fig 9a a curve fit equation of st as a function of g using the least square method is obtained as 4 s t 0 1258 0 2189 g s t 0 0 2189 g where st 0 0 1258 is the strouhal number of a single rectangular b h 3 prism in an unconfined domain which was obtained from the present simulations the difference between estimated data and eq 4 plotted in fig 9a is less than 3 2 the c l 0 for the middle prism fig 9b for a particular g the outer prisms c l are equal in magnitude but opposite in signs interestingly the variations in c l of the two outer prisms explicitly characterize the flow classifications made above in regime a the c l is negative and positive for the upper and lower prisms respectively indicating attractive lift forces on the other hand an opposite scenario prevails for regime b positive and negative c l complementing the upper and lower prisms respectively the lift forces on the two outer prisms are now repulsive in regime b with increasing g the c l grows for the upper prism and declines for the lower prism reaching maximum and minimum at the border between regimes b and c a gentle decrease in c l magnitude with g occurs for the outer prisms in regime c the cʹ l and c d variations depicts that both outer prisms exhibit the same value fig 9c and d in regimes a and b the cʹ l is greater for the middle prism than for the outer prisms on the contrary an outer prism experiences a higher cʹ l than the middle prism in regime c the cʹ l can be represented by a polynomial function of g the variations in cʹ l1 prism 1 and cʹ l2 prism 2 with g can respectively be expressed as 5a c l 1 0 05 0 34 α 1 0 88 α 1 2 c l 0 0 34 α 1 0 88 α 1 2 and 5b c l 2 0 05 0 62 α 1 1 33 α 1 2 c l 0 0 62 α 1 1 33 α 1 2 where α 1 g 0 53 and cʹ l0 0 05 is the fluctuating lift coefficient of a single rectangular prism b h 3 0 in an unconfined domain fig 9c shows that eq 5 has a good fit with the computed data with cʹ l1 and cʹ l2 both approaching the single prism value 0 05 as g the c d of the middle prism is always greater than that of the outer prisms the difference in c d between the middle prism and outer prisms is large in regimes a and b while small in regime c the c d1 prism 1 and c d2 prism 2 can be represented as a function of g which are of the forms 6a c d 1 1 28 0 67 β 1 5 17 β 1 2 and 6b c d 2 1 28 0 87 β 1 5 77 β 1 2 where β 1 g 0 88 respectively eqs 6 a b are also presented in fig 9d showing less than 0 67 prisms 1 3 and 1 59 prism 2 errors between fit curves and computed values variation in c d exhibits the same nature as that in st at a lower g the blockage ratio is large enhancing c d and st an increase in g yields a smaller blockage ratio c d cʹ l and st all thus decrease with g a summary of the flow features of different flow regimes are summarized in table 4 6 flow in the gap as explained before there are two gaps between the prisms and two between the prisms and wall the time mean streamwise velocity u is computed at the center x 0 y g 1 2 3 g 1 2 of each gap the values of u were equal in the two gaps between the prisms as were in the two gaps between the prisms and wall therefore only two sets of data one u w 1 in the gap between the wall and prism 1 and the other u 1 2 between the prisms 1 and 2 are presented in fig 10 obviously u 1 2 u w 1 the difference between them being small with increasing g the reason behind u 1 2 u w 1 is that the wall develops a boundary layer next to it while u 1 2 gets high because of shear layer developments by the prisms again u w 1 and u 1 2 both rapidly decay with g and obey the following relations 7a u w 1 1 0 1 41 g 0 94 and 7b u 1 2 1 0 1 47 g 0 94 eqs 7a b presented as the lines fit well with our computed results fig 10 comparing figs 9 d and 10 it is observed that both c d and u decrease in a similar fashion with the increase of g so it is of interest to find out a relation between the c d and u it is expected that c d of a prism will be dictated by u on the two sides gaps of the prism that is u w 1 and u 1 2 both are associated with prism 1 and u 1 2 being the same on the two sides is associated with prism 2 an average velocity ζ1 u w 1 u 1 2 2 is thus considered for prism 1 and ζ2 u 1 2 u 1 2 2 for prism 2 the correlation between ζ1 and c d1 prism 1 is found as c d1 0 86 0 44 ζ1 3 while that for prism 2 is c d2 0 86 0 46 ζ2 3 the above stated relations have a good fit with computed results with a maximum deviation of less than 4 32 one expects ζ1 and ζ2 1 0 when g the corresponding c d1 1 3 and c d2 1 32 which have deviations of 1 56 and 3 12 respectively from c d1 c d2 1 28 that is the value of c d of a prism b h 3 0 in an unbounded domain furthermore figs 9 a and 10 depict that st and u decline with g therefore a relation between st and u is expected since all the prisms have the same st we get the average of u at four gaps i e ζ 2 u w 1 2 u 1 2 4 the st and ζ satisfy the relation st 0 0445 0 1612 ζ it is observed that the curve fit has a maximum deviation of 2 55 with the computed st expecting ζ 1 0 for g we obtain st 0 1167 which has a deviation 7 2 with st 0 0 1258 7 conclusions numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the flow around three side by side rectangular prisms in the presence of two confining walls at a re 100 the dependence on gap spacing ratio g 0 8 3 4 of c d c l cʹ l st and flow structures are examined based on the vortex structures fluid forces and shedding frequency the flow structures are classified into three distinct regimes a single vortex street b twin vortex streets and c triple vortex streets in regime a 0 8 g 1 1 each prism spawns vortices alternately as do the two side walls in one period of vortex shedding six vortices from the prisms and two vortices from the two side walls are shed they undergo splitting amputation and amalgamation processes and eventually a single vortex street two rows of vortices forms downstream in the fashion of reverse karman vortex street the wake in regime b 1 1 g 2 1 is characterized by two vortex streets the appearance of vortices in each street is again in a fashion of reverse karman vortex street in regime c 2 1 g 3 4 each prism forms a vortex street that resembles a single isolated prism karman street three streets thus feature the wake the dependence on g of c l and cʹ l explicitly distinguishes the flow regimes in regime a the c l of the upper and lower prisms are negative and positive respectively c l magnitudes of both prisms waning with g the two outer prisms undergo an attractive lift force the signs of the c l get reversed in regimes b and c positive for the upper prism and negative for the lower prism leading to a repulsive lift force between the prisms the c l magnitude grows in regime b but declines in regime c the cʹ l in regimes a and b is greater for the middle prism than the outer prisms while the scenario is opposite in the regime c the c d and st both decreases with increasing g while all three prisms have identical st at a given g the outer prisms have smaller c d than the middle prism the smaller c d is attributed to the smaller velocity in the gaps between the outer prisms and wall than in the gaps between the prisms this is because the former gaps are characterized by a boundary layer on the wall side and a shear layer on the prism side while the latter gaps are characterized by shear layers on both sides the gap flow velocity rapidly declines in either gaps as g increases which explains why c d and st diminish with g variations

22223,two dimensional laminar flow around three side by side rectangular prisms placed between two parallel walls is numerically investigated at a reynolds number re 100 the cross sectional aspect ratio of each prism is b h 3 where b and h are the prism width and height respectively the gap spacing g between the two adjacent prisms and between the wall and the outer prism is varied from g g h 0

fluctuating lift coefficient and d time mean drag coefficient image 1 keywords wall effect flow structure forces strouhal number 1 introduction the problem of fluid flow around slender structures is of interest among the researchers and scientists for their enormous applications in the fields of aerodynamics e g wind flow around high rise buildings chimney stacks overhead power line bundles offshore engineering e g flow past bridge piers offshore platform drilling rigs and riser system and subsea engineering e g flow around sub sea cables and pipelines these structures very often appear in a group making the flow physics more complicated than a single structure for the closely spaced structures the complicated flow arises due to the mutual interaction between shear layers and between wake vortices because of everything getting compact in the modern engineering applications of flow around multiple structures in wall proximity get broader such as the flow around prisms cylinders in a channel to enhance flow mixing and heat transfer the flow around drive bays in cpus etc it is therefore essential to assimilate the complicated flow around closely spaced multiple structures with a view to their practical applications due to the geometric simplicity the structures are mostly found in circular square or rectangular shapes a comprehensive review of the wakes behind different bluff body shapes including square circular and triangular cylinders is can be found in derakhshandeh and alam 2019 flow around multiple cylindrical structures of circular or square shape have been extensively investigated in the literature through experiments e g okajima 1982 legal et al 1990 sumner et al 1999 alam and sakamoto 2005 alam et al 2003 alam and zhou 2007 alam 2014 bai and alam 2018

one of the key features of the flow around a circular cylinder is that the flow separation point oscillates following the vortex shedding and also depends on the reynolds number on the other hand for the flow around sharp edge bodies like square rectangular prisms the flow separation point is fixed at the corners and less sensitive to reynolds number the effect of gap spacing between the two side by side square prisms on the wake formation and vortex shedding was reported in the literature e g agrawal et al 2006 alam and zhou 2013 ma et al 2017 agrawal et al 2006 studied the vortex shedding and wake at a low reynolds number re 73 for the gap spacing g g h 0 7 and 2 5 where g is the gap distance between the prisms and h is the height of prisms they identified flip flop and synchronized flow regimes for g 0 7 and 2 5 respectively in the flip flop flow the gap flow was biased flip flopping from a side to the other on the other hand in synchronized flow the gap flow was symmetric vortex shedding from the two prims occurring either an inphase or antiphase fashion alam and zhou 2013 experimentally analyzed the features of wakes for g 0 4 0 at re 300 they distinguished four different flow regimes i single bluff body regime g 0 2 ii narrow and wide street regime 0 2 g 1 1 iii transition regime 1 1 g 1 4 and iv coupled street regime g 1 4 ma et al 2017 at re 16 200 identified nine distinct flow patterns for g 0 10 the nomenclatures of nine patterns are i steady state wake ii symmetric single vortex street iii asymmetric single vortex street iv irregular vortex shedding v synchronized in phase vortex shedding vi synchronized anti phase vortex shedding vii synchronized inphase dominated vortex shedding with low frequency modulation viii synchronized antiphase dominated vortex shedding with low frequency modulation and ix asymmetric synchronized anti phase vortex shedding mode recently there is a surge of investigation on the flow across more than two square prisms sewatkar et al 2009 numerically examined the flow over nine square prisms in side by side arrangements for re 30 140 and 1 g 4 at small g the secondary frequency caused by wake interaction accompanied the primary vortex shedding frequency for large g 3 0 and 4 0 the interaction among the wakes behind the cylinders was weak the primary frequency thus dominated the flow for five side by side square prisms at re 150 chatterjee et al 2010 observed flip flopping g 1 2 inphase and antiphase synchronized g 3 and non synchronized g 4 flow structures recently zheng and alam 2017 numerically investigated the flow physics for three side by side square prisms at re 150 and g 0 1 8 0 they identified five distinct flow structures i base bleed flow ii flip flopping flow iii symmetrically biased beat flow iv non biased beat flow and v weak interaction flow the detailed physical mechanism of the existence of the secondary frequency was clarified all the above mentioned studies on the multiple prisms are for the unconfined flow that is the side wall effect is negligible on the flow investigations on the fluid flow around confined rectangular prism s are very scarce davis et al 1984 examined the effect of confining walls on the flow around a rectangular prism the emphasis was given to understand the effect of g 1 5 and 2 5 b h 0 6 1 0 and 1 7 and re 100 1850 on the flow physics the strouhal number and average drag coefficient were increased when the side walls were brought close to the prisms they observed that the average drag coefficient increases when re is increased or b h is decreased zhang et al 2017 investigated confined flow around two tandem rectangular prisms at re 100 with a blockage ratio of 25 they varied b h from 1 to 4 and the gap spacing ratio between the prisms from 1 to 8 regardless of b h two flow regimes were observed namely steady flow regime for gap spacing ratio 3 0 and unsteady flow regime for gap spacing ratio 4 0 in many practical applications rectangular structures appear in side by side under wall confinement such as multiple prisms in a channel flow to enhance heat transfer series of hard disks in cpus etc recently in a cpu having nine hard disks in a x y z 1 3 3 configuration x direction representing the flow direction it is identified that some hard disks became out of order when the cooling fan driven air flow reached a certain level it is believed that flow induced oscillations of the disks are the main issue behind the hard disks not working naturally investigations are direly needed on the flow induced forces and flow around confined hard disks the aim of this work to assimilate the dynamics of the flow around confined hard disks confined flow around three side by side x y z 1 3 1 prisms having an aspect ratio of b h 3 0 is investigated at re 100 the focus is given on the effect of g 0 8 3 4 on flow structures strouhal number st fluctuating lift coefficient cʹ l mean lift coefficient c l and mean drag coefficient c d generally a prism with b h 2 8 is considered as a short prism where the shear layers from the leading edges roll up behind the prism without reattaching on the side surfaces okajima et al 1980 takai and sakamoto 2006 on the other hand a prism with b h 2 8 is considered as a long prism where the shear layers separating from the leading edge reattach on the side surfaces of the prism presently b h 3 0 is chosen as a representative of the elongated prisms 2 problem statement we considered two dimensional incompressible viscous flow around three side by side identical rectangular prisms p1 p2 and p3 placed between two parallel walls as shown in fig 1 the aspect ratio b h of each rectangular prism is the same b h 3 while the reynolds number re ρu h μ 100 where u ρ and μ are the uniform inlet velocity density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid the gap spacings g between two adjacent prisms and between the confining walls and outer prisms are equal numerical simulations are performed for g g h 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 5 2 8 3 0 3 2 and 3 4 respectively the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y is considered such that the origin is at the centre of the middle prism p2 the x axis is positive along the streamwise direction and the y axis is perpendicular to the streamwise direction directed upward the inlet and outlet boundaries are assumed at a distance x u 14 5h and x d 30 5h from the front and rear faces of the prisms respectively furthermore the distance between the lateral boundary walls is denoted by y l 3 computational details 3 1 governing equations boundary conditions and numerical method an unsteady viscous laminar incompressible and newtonian fluid flow is governed by the continuity and navier stokes equations that in non dimensional form can be written as 1 u x v y 0 2a u t u u x v u y p x 1 r e 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2b v t u v x v v y p y 1 r e 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 the non dimensional form of the cartesian coordinate velocity components pressure and time are x x h y y h u u u v v u p p ρu 2 and t tu h respectively where u and v are the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively p is the static pressure and t is the time in the computational domain the boundary conditions are prescribed as follows in engineering fields and in nature there are many applications of confined flow where the approaching flow is either uniform or parabolic suzuki et al 1993 chakraborty et al 2004 sharma and eswaran 2005 at the inlet boundary x u 14 5h a uniform velocity profile is considered u 1 v 0 no slip boundary condition u 0 v 0 is adopted on the prism surfaces and on the two side walls at the outlet x d 30 5h zero stress vectors are specified u x 0 v x u y 0 utilizing the above boundary conditions the governing equations 1 and 2 are solved numerically using finite volume method base commercial solver ansys fluent 15 0 to solve the equations the computational domain is meshed as a combination of uniform and non uniform quadrangular meshes using ansys icem cfd the coupling between the pressure and velocity is accessed using the scheme pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso convective terms are discretized using the second order upwind scheme and second order implicit discretization is adopted for time marching 3 2 study of convergence and validation 3 2 1 mesh independent test before proceeding to extensive simulations on confined fluid flow around the three side by side rectangular prisms the grid adequacy test is conducted for the unconfined flow around a square prism at re 100 with symmetry boundary conditions i e v 0 u y 0 for lateral boundaries blockage ratio 5 with x u 14 5h and x d 30 5h the computational domain consists of an o grid system surrounding the prism and a quadrangular grid system away from the prism fig 2 grid points on the surface of the square prism are uniformly spaced with the first grid point lying 0 005h away from the prism surface the grid spacing is increased with an expansion rate of 1 03 at the far downstream field x 14 5h a uniform grid spacing is considered three different meshes m1 m2 and m3 are tested consisting of the number of meshes 45 714 71 610 and 130 863 respectively to check the adequacy of the grid resolution the integral parameters strouhal number st fluctuating lift coefficient cʹ l time mean drag coefficient c d and fluctuating drag coefficient cˊ d for three different mesh distributions are tabulated in table 1 here the st and lift c l and drag c d coefficients are computed as 3 s t f h u c l 2 f l ρ h u 2 and c d 2 f d ρ h u 2 where f f l and f d are vortex shedding frequency lift force and drag force respectively the results in table 1 exhibits that the values of integral parameters have a maximum deviation of 3 77 for cˊ d between meshes m1 and m2 on the other hand meshes m2 and m3 render a negligible difference 0 33 in the results mesh m2 is thus assumed enough for the unconfined flow the results obtained from the mesh distribution m2 are further compared with those in the literature in table 2 the present results have a good agreement with those in the literature applying mesh distribution m2 to three rectangular prisms between two parallel walls the mesh and time independence tests are done again as shown in table 3 as the lateral boundaries acting as confined walls are now not free slip a fine mesh is considered near the side walls such that the first grid point from a side wall is again 0 005h away again the grid space is increased with a geometric progression ratio of 1 03 the mesh distributions near the rectangular prism and side walls are shown in fig 2 b c space and time independent tests are done for g 1 0 1 5 and 2 8 as presented in table 3 where st cʹ l c d and cʹ d are compared for different grids and time steps for each value of g two different mesh distributions are considered where the mesh density in case 2 is double of that in case 1 where case 1 has the similar mesh density of m2 as validated for single isolated prism before since the values of the parameters for outer prisms p1 and p3 are equal the results of p1 only are presented considering all three values of g it is observed that the deviations in st cʹ l c d and cʹ d are less than 0 77 2 13 0 34 and 1 85 respectively the mesh density and time step of case 1 is thus adopted 4 wake structures and forces identification of flow regimes is of interest among the researchers and engineers in many applications depending on the flow structures and shedding frequency three different regimes are identified namely regime a single vortex street 0 8 g 1 1 regime b twin vortex streets 1 1 g 2 1 and regime c triple vortex streets 2 1 g 3 4 the separation point between the two regimes is chosen as the midpoint of two consecutive simulations that show two different flow patterns each of the flow regimes is discussed in details in the subsequent subsections 4 1 regime a single vortex street 0 8 g 1 1 for small g 1 1 a single body like flow appears fig 3 shows instantaneous vorticity contours for g 0 8 the snapshots are given at different time instants in about 1 5 vortex shedding periods showing the evolution of vortices in the wake note that there are a total of four gaps two between the prisms and two between the walls and prisms two shear layers form in each gap spawning two counter rotating vortices respectively a total of eight vortices are thus shed from the shear layers in one period of nominal vortex shedding the growth and shedding of the vortices from the prisms occurs in an inphase fashion an amalgamation and amputation process of the shed vortices leads to the evolution of the eight vortices in two vortices a single wake consisting of two rows of vortices thus forms for x 6 as marked in the snapshot in fig 3a eight vortices u 1 u 2 m 1 m 2 l 1 l 2 w 1 and w 2 are linked to the eight shear layers respectively with the time elapsed vortices u 1 m 1 and l 1 are first pinched off and amalgamated forming u 1 m 1 l 1 vortex fig 3d vortex w 1 lifting up approaches the combined vortex u 1 m 1 l 1 fig 3d f eventually the four same sign positive vortices merge together forming u 1 m 1 l 1 w 1 vortex similarly four negative sign vortices form one united vortex u 2 m 2 l 2 w 2 downstream fig 3f interestingly three same sign vortices from the prisms come close to each other and then the same sign vortex from the corresponding wall joins them eventually a single vortex street consisting of positive and negative vortices forms in a similar fashion to a karman vortex street however while a karman vortex street is generally characterized by positive vortices on the lower side y 0 and negative vortices on the upper side y 0 here the vortex arrangement is opposite i e negative and positive vortices appearing on the lower and upper sides of the symmetry line y 0 respectively see the vortex arrangement at x 9 0 that is the merging and reversion process of the vortices results in the formation of a reverse karman vortex street downstream fig 4 shows the time histories of lift and drag coefficients of three prisms along with the power spectra of lift coefficients the lift and drag coefficients of the middle prism are periodic and sinusoidal whereas those of outer prisms are periodic but not sinusoidal in nature the lift signals fig 4a imply that the sheddings of the positive from the lower side vortices from prisms 1 and 2 are inphase figs 3a and 4a as are those of the negative from the upper side vortices from prisms 2 and 3 figs 3f and 4a the lift amplitude measured from minimum to maximum and time mean drag coefficient are the same for the outer prisms while those are larger for the middle prism than for the outer prisms the value of the time mean lift coefficient is 0 41 0 and 0 41 for prisms 1 2 and 3 respectively indicating attractive lift force for the outer prisms the power spectra fig 4c show that the shedding frequency is the same for the three prisms the second and third harmonics of vortex shedding frequency are observed the harmonics emerge owing to the interaction among the vortices immediately behind the prisms the second harmonic peak is quite strong for the outer prisms but absent for the middle prism this is because the middle prism lying on the symmetric line experiences symmetric atmosphere on either side an outer prism has an asymmetric atmosphere one side surface facing the middle prism and the other side facing the wall 4 2 regime b twin vortex streets 1 1 g 2 1 twin vortex streets are observed for 1 1 g 2 1 fig 5 shows the instantaneous flow structures the vortices from the prisms gap stretch in the transverse direction each getting pinched off at the middle forms two small vortices for example m 2 vortex in fig 5a splits into m 2 and m 2 vortices fig 5b and c the same happens for the positive vortex from the upper prism u 2 vortex splitting into u 2 and u 2 fig 5a c while split vortices m 2 and m 2 from the middle prism are almost equal to each other split vortex u 2 is much weaker than u 2 that goes to the wall side and dies out fig 5c the split of the negative vortex from the upper side from the upper prism does not take place neither does the positive vortex from the lower prism now the same signed vortices u 2 m 2 and l 2 come close to each other and form a combined vortex u 2 m 2 l 2 lying on the lower side of y 0 the vortex m 2 stays on the upper side and snatches vorticity from the wall keeping alive fig 5d the evolution and interactions of the vortices reveal that a positive vortex on the lower vortex street x 8 is composed of two split positive vortices u 2 m 2 from the middle and upper prisms and one intact positive vortex l 2 from the lower prism fig 5f on the other hand a positive vortex on the upper vortex street consists of a split positive vortex from the middle prism along with vorticity from the upper wall in a similar fashion two rows of negative vortices come into being in the wake two vortex streets thus feature the wake the appearance of vortices in each street is again in a fashion of reverse karman vortex street time histories of lift and drag coefficients and their power spectra are presented in fig 6 similar to regime a the three prisms shed vortices at the same frequency st 0 2792 fig 6c unlike regime a the second or third harmonic frequency in the power spectra is absent this is because the complex interaction between the vortices largely occurs in x 6 for regime a and in x 6 9 for regime b the lift signals of the three prisms indicates that the phase lag between the vortex sheddings from the outer prisms is zero and that between the middle and outer prisms is 15 5 time mean lift coefficient is positive 0 35 for prism 1 and negative 0 35 for prism 3 while zero for prism 2 this implies that the outer prisms undergo repulsive lift forces fluctuation in drag is smaller for the middle prism than for the outer prisms the middle prism undergoes a larger time mean drag than the outer prisms 4 3 regime c triple vortex streets 2 1 g 3 4 now the gap between the prisms and between walls and prism is large enough allowing each prism to shed vortices like an isolated prism fig 7 triple vortex streets thus feature the wake like regimes a and b the vortex shedding frequencies of three prisms are the same which can also be observed from the power spectra of lift signal of three prisms fig 8 c still repulsive lift forces appear for the outer prisms while amplitudes of the lift forces of the three prisms are approximately the same fig 8a the outer prisms have the same time mean drag coefficient and the same fluctuating drag the value of time mean drag is smaller for outer prisms than for the middle prism while the fluctuation in drag is greater for outer prisms than the middle prism fig 8b 5 effect of g on forces and strouhal number fig 9 illustrates the dependence of st c d cʹ l and c l on g at the top of the figure the span of each flow regime is marked the st of each prism was estimated from spectral analyses of the fluctuating lift force acting on the prism as shown before all the three prisms have identical st the only one data set is therefore plotted in the figure with increasing g the st declines from 0 39 at g 0 8 to 0 18 at g 3 4 fig 9a a curve fit equation of st as a function of g using the least square method is obtained as 4 s t 0 1258 0 2189 g s t 0 0 2189 g where st 0 0 1258 is the strouhal number of a single rectangular b h 3 prism in an unconfined domain which was obtained from the present simulations the difference between estimated data and eq 4 plotted in fig 9a is less than 3 2 the c l 0 for the middle prism fig 9b for a particular g the outer prisms c l are equal in magnitude but opposite in signs interestingly the variations in c l of the two outer prisms explicitly characterize the flow classifications made above in regime a the c l is negative and positive for the upper and lower prisms respectively indicating attractive lift forces on the other hand an opposite scenario prevails for regime b positive and negative c l complementing the upper and lower prisms respectively the lift forces on the two outer prisms are now repulsive in regime b with increasing g the c l grows for the upper prism and declines for the lower prism reaching maximum and minimum at the border between regimes b and c a gentle decrease in c l magnitude with g occurs for the outer prisms in regime c the cʹ l and c d variations depicts that both outer prisms exhibit the same value fig 9c and d in regimes a and b the cʹ l is greater for the middle prism than for the outer prisms on the contrary an outer prism experiences a higher cʹ l than the middle prism in regime c the cʹ l can be represented by a polynomial function of g the variations in cʹ l1 prism 1 and cʹ l2 prism 2 with g can respectively be expressed as 5a c l 1 0 05 0 34 α 1 0 88 α 1 2 c l 0 0 34 α 1 0 88 α 1 2 and 5b c l 2 0 05 0 62 α 1 1 33 α 1 2 c l 0 0 62 α 1 1 33 α 1 2 where α 1 g 0 53 and cʹ l0 0 05 is the fluctuating lift coefficient of a single rectangular prism b h 3 0 in an unconfined domain fig 9c shows that eq 5 has a good fit with the computed data with cʹ l1 and cʹ l2 both approaching the single prism value 0 05 as g the c d of the middle prism is always greater than that of the outer prisms the difference in c d between the middle prism and outer prisms is large in regimes a and b while small in regime c the c d1 prism 1 and c d2 prism 2 can be represented as a function of g which are of the forms 6a c d 1 1 28 0 67 β 1 5 17 β 1 2 and 6b c d 2 1 28 0 87 β 1 5 77 β 1 2 where β 1 g 0 88 respectively eqs 6 a b are also presented in fig 9d showing less than 0 67 prisms 1 3 and 1 59 prism 2 errors between fit curves and computed values variation in c d exhibits the same nature as that in st at a lower g the blockage ratio is large enhancing c d and st an increase in g yields a smaller blockage ratio c d cʹ l and st all thus decrease with g a summary of the flow features of different flow regimes are summarized in table 4 6 flow in the gap as explained before there are two gaps between the prisms and two between the prisms and wall the time mean streamwise velocity u is computed at the center x 0 y g 1 2 3 g 1 2 of each gap the values of u were equal in the two gaps between the prisms as were in the two gaps between the prisms and wall therefore only two sets of data one u w 1 in the gap between the wall and prism 1 and the other u 1 2 between the prisms 1 and 2 are presented in fig 10 obviously u 1 2 u w 1 the difference between them being small with increasing g the reason behind u 1 2 u w 1 is that the wall develops a boundary layer next to it while u 1 2 gets high because of shear layer developments by the prisms again u w 1 and u 1 2 both rapidly decay with g and obey the following relations 7a u w 1 1 0 1 41 g 0 94 and 7b u 1 2 1 0 1 47 g 0 94 eqs 7a b presented as the lines fit well with our computed results fig 10 comparing figs 9 d and 10 it is observed that both c d and u decrease in a similar fashion with the increase of g so it is of interest to find out a relation between the c d and u it is expected that c d of a prism will be dictated by u on the two sides gaps of the prism that is u w 1 and u 1 2 both are associated with prism 1 and u 1 2 being the same on the two sides is associated with prism 2 an average velocity ζ1 u w 1 u 1 2 2 is thus considered for prism 1 and ζ2 u 1 2 u 1 2 2 for prism 2 the correlation between ζ1 and c d1 prism 1 is found as c d1 0 86 0 44 ζ1 3 while that for prism 2 is c d2 0 86 0 46 ζ2 3 the above stated relations have a good fit with computed results with a maximum deviation of less than 4 32 one expects ζ1 and ζ2 1 0 when g the corresponding c d1 1 3 and c d2 1 32 which have deviations of 1 56 and 3 12 respectively from c d1 c d2 1 28 that is the value of c d of a prism b h 3 0 in an unbounded domain furthermore figs 9 a and 10 depict that st and u decline with g therefore a relation between st and u is expected since all the prisms have the same st we get the average of u at four gaps i e ζ 2 u w 1 2 u 1 2 4 the st and ζ satisfy the relation st 0 0445 0 1612 ζ it is observed that the curve fit has a maximum deviation of 2 55 with the computed st expecting ζ 1 0 for g we obtain st 0 1167 which has a deviation 7 2 with st 0 0 1258 7 conclusions numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the flow around three side by side rectangular prisms in the presence of two confining walls at a re 100 the dependence on gap spacing ratio g 0 8 3 4 of c d c l cʹ l st and flow structures are examined based on the vortex structures fluid forces and shedding frequency the flow structures are classified into three distinct regimes a single vortex street b twin vortex streets and c triple vortex streets in regime a 0 8 g 1 1 each prism spawns vortices alternately as do the two side walls in one period of vortex shedding six vortices from the prisms and two vortices from the two side walls are shed they undergo splitting amputation and amalgamation processes and eventually a single vortex street two rows of vortices forms downstream in the fashion of reverse karman vortex street the wake in regime b 1 1 g 2 1 is characterized by two vortex streets the appearance of vortices in each street is again in a fashion of reverse karman vortex street in regime c 2 1 g 3 4 each prism forms a vortex street that resembles a single isolated prism karman street three streets thus feature the wake the dependence on g of c l and cʹ l explicitly distinguishes the flow regimes in regime a the c l of the upper and lower prisms are negative and positive respectively c l magnitudes of both prisms waning with g the two outer prisms undergo an attractive lift force the signs of the c l get reversed in regimes b and c positive for the upper prism and negative for the lower prism leading to a repulsive lift force between the prisms the c l magnitude grows in regime b but declines in regime c the cʹ l in regimes a and b is greater for the middle prism than the outer prisms while the scenario is opposite in the regime c the c d and st both decreases with increasing g while all three prisms have identical st at a given g the outer prisms have smaller c d than the middle prism the smaller c d is attributed to the smaller velocity in the gaps between the outer prisms and wall than in the gaps between the prisms this is because the former gaps are characterized by a boundary layer on the wall side and a shear layer on the prism side while the latter gaps are characterized by shear layers on both sides the gap flow velocity rapidly declines in either gaps as g increases which explains why c d and st diminish with g variations in st c d cʹ l and u with g are expressed in empirical relations author contribution statement ramnarayan mondal computing data analysis figure preparation and original draft preparation md mahbub

to estimate roll damping and hydrodynamic pressure on a 2 d rectangular structure free roll decay test was simulated by experiment in 2 d wave tank with particle image velocimetry piv measurement and by numerical simulations using cfd based on an unsteady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion and the roll damping coefficients

compared with them from cfd to validate the numerical methods applied in the study the piv based pressure estimation method was applied to predict pressures on the structure and results were compared with them from cfd to assess the feasibility of the piv based estimation approach the overall agreement between experimental and cfd results was good for roll damping coefficient velocity and vorticity fields and pressure considering the complexity of fluid physics in the roll motion it was found that the piv based pressure estimation method would be alternative technique to estimate the pressure and loads on the structure keywords roll motion roll damping coefficient rectangular structure cfd particle image velocimetry pressure estimation 1 introduction accurate estimation of the roll motion for floating structures is crucial to the hull design connection of the risers topside structures and process plants on board ultimately to ensure the comfortability of crews the dynamic stability and operability of the structures unlike the other degrees of dynamic motions in response to the environmental loads the roll motion is highly nonlinear and sensitive to the hull shape of the structures due to the fluid viscosity it is a difficult task to estimate the roll damping because of the complexity to quantify the viscous effect which is known to have significant influence on the roll motion of a blunt shaped floating structure there have been many researches to solve the roll motion issues efficiently using empirical numerical and experimental methods the early works to predict the roll damping and motion were done using semi empirical formulae derived from experiments and hydrodynamic theory empirically ikeda et al 1977 proposed a formula in which the eddy making component of the roll damping force for a 2 d body is proportional to the square of the frequency they deduced the amplitude of the roll motion from the semi experimental technique based on theoretical and experimental results chakrabarti 2001 examined the roll damping components and their empirical contributions from a series of model experiments he decomposed the components for a ship hull form to the skin friction of the hull eddy shedding from the hull free surface waves lift effect damping and bilge keel damping including the consideration of scale effects numerically potential flow theories are still widely used to assess the hydrodynamic performance of ships and offshore structures even though potential based methods cannot predict the roll motion issues efficiently due to the negligence of fluid viscosity and rotation salvesen et al 1970 presented that potential flow methods overestimated roll amplitude responses of rectangular structures in beam seas compared to results from experiments empirical factors are commonly introduced to predict the roll damping coefficient taking into account the viscous effects due to flow separation and generation of vortices downie 1987 recently computational fluid dynamic cfd methods have been increasingly applied to study the roll damping considering the viscous effects and to investigate the vortex induced phenomena such as vortex shedding chen et al 2001 employed a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with a chimera domain decomposition approach to simulate large roll motions wilson et al 2006 demonstrated the viscous phenomenon of roll decay motion of a surface combatant using the rans cfd code cfdship iowa chen et al 2016 computed the roll motion of a 2 d rectangular structure in regular waves and compared the velocity and vorticity fields in the vicinity of the structure using an extended openfoam open source cfd package model however it has been reported that there is still a shortage in cfd simulations and more computational results are needed to establish a general approach to estimate the roll motion and viscous effects more accurately irkal et al 2016 gokce and kinaci 2018 experimentally there have been technical advances in the recent years especially for fluid measurement particle image velocimetry piv has been used as a reliable and versatile technique to measure fluid fields and to examine the fluid physics especially for the structures of vortices ruling the dynamics of systems in an efficient and non intrusive manner yeung et al 1996 measured the vorticity fields generated by a plate undergoing a forced harmonic roll motion at free surface using the piv technique they also conducted a numerical simulation to reproduce the observed flow pattern of the rolling rectangular cylinder using the random vortex method with the presence of free surface yeung et al 1998 images were taken from the velocity field around the barge to capture the behavior of the fluid and to understand the roll damping dong et al 1997 conducted piv measurements to study the vorticity structure near the bow of a ship model due to surface waves jung et al 2006 obtained flow maps using the piv in a 2 d wave tank to elucidate the vertical flow characteristics in vicinity of a rectangular barge aloisio and felice 2006 investigated the vorticity field evolution around the bilge keels of a ship model in free roll decay motion to understand the interaction between the vortices and the hull oliveira and fernandes 2014 studied nonlinear damping behavior of the floating production storage and offloading fpso with bilge keels and vortex patterns for the interaction between the vortices created during the roll motions regarding the prediction of pressure distributions and overall forces on offshore structures designers generally use velocities obtained from model experiments however the estimation of hydrodynamic pressure and loading on the structures is a major scientific and engineering challenge and still open question due to a very high pressure and a short duration ariyarathne et al 2012 the evaluation of the hydrodynamic loading is currently relying on the direct measurement of the pressure using pressure gauges mounted on the structures but it is difficult to install the gauges and limited to local measurements in aerodynamic practice the piv based pressure estimation approach has been applied as an attractive and feasible method to examine the pressure and loads using flow field information from piv measurement van oudheusden 2013 even when model instrumentation is problematic e g icing on airfoils de gregorio 2006 the observation of freely flying birds or insects spedding and hedenström 2009 in the research of the ocean engineering jakobsen et al 1997 used piv to determine acceleration and pressure in wave phenomena panciroli and porfiri 2013 applied the pressure gradient integration using the piv data for a rigid wedge entering a water surface and verified the estimated pressure with wagner s solution based on potential flow theory their findings demonstrated the accuracy of the reconstruction of pressure field over the entire impact duration in this paper experimental and numerical studies were performed to investigate the roll damping and estimate pressure on a 2 d floating rectangular structure for the roll free decay in roll and heave free condition firstly the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion were investigated to predict the roll damping coefficients by experiment in 2 d wave tank and numerical simulations based on an unsteady incompressible rans method for the cfd grid convergence test for the cfd was conducted to capture the wave propagation from the structure properly secondly the velocity and vorticity fields were examined to understand the fluid fields in the vicinity of the structure in the roll motion and the experimental and numerical results were compared especially to validate the numerical methods applied in the study thirdly estimation results of the pressure and forces on the structure using velocity field information from piv measurement were presented with explanation of the piv based pressure estimation approach finally pressure and forces on the structure from experiment and cfd were compared to validate both the piv based pressure estimation and cfd methods 2 experimental setup the experiment was carried out for the roll free decay test of a rectangular structure in a 2 d wave tank with a piston type wave maker driven by a synchronous servo motor controlled by a computer the tank is 25 m long 1 m wide and 1 1 m deep glass walled flume with a permeable wave absorbing beach of 2 5 m length and 1 1 m height at the end of tank to minimize reflection as depicted in fig 1 a rectangular acrylic structure with the dimensions of 0 20 m wide 0 99 m long and 0 15 m high was located at 14 5 m from the right end of the tank the water depth of the tank was 0 85 m throughout the experiments the structure was mounted to the tank with bars and a pair of hinges adjusted to the axis aligned with the calm water level as displayed in fig 2 the draft d and center of gravity cg of the structure are 0 07 m and 0 06 m from the keel respectively the hinges of the motion gage allowed the structure to roll and heave motions and aligned with water level but restrained it from surge and sway motions the sampling rate was set at 100 hz and test results of motions were analyzed without any filtering technique the error analysis for the measurement using the motion gage was conducted before measuring the motions in the experiment the errors of linearity hysteresis and repeatability are 0 971 0 891 and 0 642 respectively and the total error is 1 466 piv technique was used to measure 2 d velocity field in the vicinity of the structure the piv system was synchronized by the camera computer and motion gage housing data acquisition boards as schematically illustrated in fig 2 the digital high speed ccd camera mounted with a 105 mm f 2 8 micro focal lens was used to obtain piv images it had 2352 1728 pixels i e 7 μm 7 μm pixel size with 8 bit dynamic range a pair of images were obtained by double frame single pulsed method the time difference between successive frames was set at 0 005s which was determined by the maximum displacement to be less than a third of the width of the interrogation window size the field of view fov was used to obtain velocity and vorticity maps at the right lower corner of the structure the fov size were 270 200 mm2 corresponding to the spatial resolution of 3 75 mm between every velocity vectors in the interrogation area of 64 64 pixels with 50 overlap the water was seeded with small particles that have a mean diameter of 57 μm and a specific gravity of 1 02 the images were analyzed to compute piv velocity vectors using the dynamicstudio which is the commercial software developed by dantec dynamics the adaptive correlation between the two interrogation windows from a pair of images was used for the piv velocity vector analysis 3 mathematical background 3 1 computational fluid dynamics an unsteady incompressible rans reynolds averaged navier stokes approach was applied to calculate the roll amplitude and obtain numerical velocity and vorticity maps in roll free decay test using a commercial cfd software star ccm cd adapco 2015 for incompressible flows if there are no external forces the averaged continuity and momentum equations are given in tensor form in the cartesian coordinate system by eq 1 and eq 2 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j where u i is the relative averaged velocity vector of flow between the fluid and the control volume u i u j is the reynolds stresses and p is the mean pressure for newtonian fluid under incompressible flow the mean shear stress tensor τ i j is expressed as eq 3 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is dynamic viscosity the finite volume method fvm and the volume of fluid vof method were applied to the spatial discretization and free surface capturing respectively the flow equations were solved in a segregated manner using a predictor corrector approach convection and diffusion terms in the rans equations were discretized by a second order upwind scheme and a central difference scheme the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm was used to resolve the pressure velocity coupling and a k ω shear stress transport sst model was applied as the turbulence model for all calculations a second order temporal scheme was used for discretization of the unsteady term in rans equations to improve accuracy of wave propagation from the structure in order to consider motions of the structure a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi scheme was applied with the vessel free to move in roll and heave directions overset grids were used to simulate the floating structure in large amplitude motions without deforming meshes especially around free surface and the structure to make the grid quality remain the same in all simulation time one grid is adapted to the background such as free surface reflection waves etc while overlapping grids are attached to the structure and move with it without deformation a forcing zone was introduced to reduce the domain size and to minimize reflection waves from the boundaries enger et al 2014 in the zone the disturbed flows from the structure are absorbed by actively adjusting the momentum mass and volume fraction source the coupled zone with flat vof waves was implemented to eliminate disturbed flows which were reflected from the boundaries around the structure in the study in this study the forcing zone of 2 m was applied to both inlet and outlet boundaries which were set as pressure outlet condition fig 3 shows the grid refined locally in overset region around the structure and free surface to investigate the viscous effect more accurately in the vicinity of the structure the prism layer was applied around the structure the calculation domain is 6 m x 6 m 0 85 m z 0 55 m where the mid plane and draught of the structure are located at x 0 and z 0 respectively 3 2 piv based pressure estimation the euler equations were used to directly compute the pressure gradient components from piv velocity data by eq 4 and eq 5 4 p x ρ u t u u x w u z 5 p z ρ w t u w x w w z ρ g where u and w denote the horizontal and vertical velocity components obtained from piv technique on the axes x and z of a cartesian coordinate system the viscous terms in the momentum equation was discarded taking into account that they cannot be properly resolved from the velocity field measurements unless a sufficiently high resolution can be achieved for which the friction contribution was located in a thin boundary layer of the structure jakobsen et al 1997 van oudheusden 2008 the central finite difference approximation was adopted to calculate the spatial and temporal derivatives of the velocity components as expressed by eq 6 and eq 7 6 u x x z t u x h z t u x h z t 2 h 7 u t x z t u x z t δ t u x z t δ t 2 δ t where h is the grid spacing and δ t is the time difference between two successive velocity fields in the study h is equal to δ x and δ z as the spatial resolution of 3 75 mm in the piv measurement δ t was determined as 6 times i e 0 03s of the time difference between the piv frames considering the accuracy and error accumulation of the pressure computation because increasing the time separation increases the truncation error but reduces the effect of the velocity error on the acceleration determination jakobsen et al 1997 van oudheusden 2013 the forward or backward differences were employed depending on the location to calculate the spatial derivative of points at the boundary by eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 8 u x x z t u x h z t u x z t h 9 u x x z t u x z t u x h z t h regarding the calculation of the pressure inside the fluid domain the pressure gradient is spatially integrated from a boundary condition set at the free surface fig 4 depicts the main steps of the integration procedure forward integration was used along vertical line l1 starting from point a initially selected at the free surface where the pressure is set to zero a point b on line l1 was selected to estimate all pressure along horizontal line l2 by performing forward and backward integration from the known pressure on lines l1 and l2 the space marching integration method proposed by baur and köngeter 1999 was applied to compute the unknown pressure over the rest of the fluid domain the same procedure was performed for different points of a and b in fluid domain the final pressure field was obtained by taking the average of all the resulting pressure fields points p1 and p2 were set at 2 cm away from the corner on the right and bottom wall of the structure respectively to analyze and compare pressure obtained from the piv based estimation and cfd methods 4 discussion of experiment and numerical results 4 1 grid convergence test prior to the investigation on the roll damping and pressure on the structure grid convergence tests for the cfd method were performed to capture the wave propagation from the structure properly in the roll free decay test 0 044 m of wave height h was assumed as about 4 times 2 times of z position of the free surface when the structure is rotated for 22 of the initial roll angle 1 56 m of the wave length was applied considering the roll natural period of t n 1 0 s kim et al 2019 for all test cases of grid convergence more than 80 cells per wave length was applied based on the guidelines for ship cfd applications from ittc 2011 a minimum of 20 cells per wave height were taken into account enger et al 2014 the coarse and fine mesh systems were derived by reducing and increasing cell numbers using a factor of 2 bøckmann et al 2014 the time step of the simulation was set to be proportional to the grid size as shown in table 1 the results of the grid convergence tests with three different mesh systems are presented in fig 5 where the results using medium and fine mesh are almost identical in time domain the grid uncertainty analysis was conducted for both the roll natural frequency and roll peak angles in 7 cycles of the roll motion using grid triplets g 1 g 2 and g 3 with a uniform parameter ratio r g chosen as 2 for the free surface refinement kim et al 2017 s 1 s 2 and s 3 are corresponding solutions using the fine medium and coarse mesh and r f and r p are the convergence ratios for the roll natural frequency and roll peak angle respectively as given in eq 10 10 r f p ε f p 21 ε f p 32 where ε f p 21 s f p 2 s f p 1 and ε f p 32 s f p 3 s f p 2 are the differences between medium fine and coarse medium solutions of the roll natural frequency and roll peak angle the grid uncertainty studies showed monotonic convergences for the roll natural frequency with r f 0 047 and for the roll peak angle with r p 0 183 therefore the medium mesh system was chosen for the cfd simulations in the study 4 2 roll motion characteristics for 2 d rectangular structure the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion of the 2 d rectangular structure were investigated before examining the roll damping and pressure on the structure from piv measurement and numerical study fig 6 shows the gz curve of the rectangular structure which was estimated to find if the rolling has as a linear or nonlinear characteristic with the initial angle of 22 based on the gz curve in fig 6 the roll period is considered as a constant in this paper because of the small differences between the righting arm and the slope tangential at zero deg in this study free roll decay tests in calm water were conducted to obtain the natural roll frequency ω n and the damping coefficient b experimentally and numerically note that the roll and heave motion were allowed in the present study to investigate the roll motion characteristics accurately kim et al 2019 the equation of roll motion in free roll decay can be expressed based on the gz curve fig 6 as below 11 d 2 ϕ d t 2 2 ζ ω n d ϕ d t ω n 2 ϕ 0 where ζ damping factor 2 ζ ω n b i ω n 2 δ g m i the roll motion decayed after each rolling cycle due to the damping effect as shown in fig 7 the natural roll frequencies ω n obtained from the experiment and cfd through the spectrum analysis were almost identical as 6 264 rad s or natural roll period t n 1 003s and 6 274 rad s or t n 1 001s respectively fig 8 shows the decrease of inclination for each single roll plotted against the mean angle of roll ϕ m which is called the curve of roll extinction the formula was applied to obtain the roll damping coefficient b following bhattacharyya 1978 as below 12 b k 1 t n δ g m π 2 where k 1 is the slope of the curve of extinction we obtained b 0 161 and 0 155 from the slopes k 1 0 515 and 0 499 of experiment and cfd respectively it was found that the roll damping coefficient can be estimated accurately by the numerical method having 3 7 difference with experiment in the study 4 3 estimation of velocity and vorticity fields especially to investigate the viscous effect on the roll motion in the roll free decay test the velocity and vortex fields obtained from the piv in the experiment and numerical simulations were analyzed and compared as shown in figs 9 12 the vorticity ω at a point i j was obtained based on the circulation calculated using its eight neighboring points i e ω i j γ i j 4 δxδz with the circulation γ and δx and δz with the distance between adjacent velocity vectors jung et al 2005 figs 9 and 10 show the comparison of velocity and vorticity maps for the first negative roll angle 0 25s 0 75s which present from the zero down crossing to maximum negative roll angle in fig 7 and from the maximum negative roll angle to zero up crossing in fig 10 respectively the figures are presented when the actual roll angles are the same for accurate comparison on the velocity and vortex characteristic in vicinity of the rectangular structure the overall agreement for the direction magnitude and even extent of the vortex between experimental and cfd results was very good considering the complexity of the velocity and vorticity fields in the vicinity of the structure when the structure was in the clockwise cw roll motion from t 0 25s 0 40s as presented in fig 9 the strong positive vortex was seen clearly at the corner of the structure due to the cw roll motion after the maximum negative roll angle fig 10 it was observed that the positive vortex changed into the coupled vortex with a negative vortex developed at the bottom of the structure and moved together away from the structure velocity and vorticity maps from the experiment and cfd were also compared for the first positive roll angle 0 79s 1 25s as shown in figs 11 and 12 including the maximum positive roll figs 11 and 12 are presented at the roll angles in the ccw and cw respectively when the structure was in ccw roll motion from 0 79s to 0 90s the coupled vortex was seen clearly at the bottom of the structure and the negative vortex detached from the main vortex as presented in fig 11 the detached vortex was developed into a different coupled vortex at the corner of the structure in the cw roll motion as shown in fig 12 the results from the cfd were also generally in good agreement with them from the piv measurement however it was observed that the vortex calculated from cfd still remained strongly while the vortex obtained in experiments was getting weaker dissipated with separation into small vortexes the different behavior in vortex around the structure might cause the gap of the roll angle between the experimental and cfd results especially after the two periods passed 4 4 estimation of pressure on the structure in addition to the velocity and vorticity fields produced by the piv technique the pressure on the structure was obtained by computing the pressure gradients components from the flow field information for the validation of the piv based estimation method results of the unsteady total pressure at p1 on the right wall and p2 on the bottom of the structure as defined in fig 4 were compared with the results from the cfd simulation as shown in fig 13 the results from the piv based estimation method were in good agreement with them from the cfd simulation as expected because the static pressure was dominant comparing with the dynamic pressure in the total pressure as confirmed in fig 15 it was observed that the total pressure estimated at both p1 and p2 oscillated at the natural roll period as shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows the comparison of the total force on the right wall of the structure using the predicted total pressure on the right wall unfortunately the total force on the bottom was not obtained because velocity fields were measured in only certain area on the bottom and changed with the roll motion of the structure in the fixed fov as illustrated in fig 2 it was also observed that the total force from the piv based estimation method also oscillates at the natural roll period and shows good agreement with that from the cfd recently there have been numerous efforts to predict the structural loads and characteristics especially for green water on offshore structures but it is still challenging because the high non linear characteristics of fluid structure interaction and violent multi phase flow ariyarathne et al 2012 lee et al 2016 from the comparison of pressure between cfd and experimental results the piv based pressure estimation method in the study will be alternative approach to the challenging problems with measurement using pressure gauges especially the dynamic pressure obtained from the piv based estimation and cfd methods were analyzed and compared with static pressure to validate the methods as shown in fig 15 the dynamic pressure was obtained by subtracting the static pressure which is determined as water depth of p1 and p2 from the total pressure the results of the dynamic pressure from the piv based estimation were in general agreement with them from the cfd even though the dynamic pressure estimated from the velocity profiles taken by piv scattered in large roll motions it was observed that the dynamic pressure oscillated in different way from the static pressure and especially at the point p2 on the bottom of the structure in opposite way to the static pressure even if the dynamic pressure on the bottom had the similar frequency compared to the natural roll frequency it should be noted that the dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure decrease the amplitude of the total pressure e g static pressure is positive at all times but dynamic pressure is negative and positive at 0 5s and 1 0s respectively therefore it was found that the dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure could play an important role in the roll damping phenomena it was also studied to find the vortex effect on the pressure by examining the correlation between the vortex information in the vicinity of the structure and dynamic pressure on the wall it was deduced that the positive vortex on the bottom in figs 11 and 12 i e 0 79s 1 25s could have an effect on the positive dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure as presented in fig 15 p2 however it is thought that the correlation between flow information and pressure on offshore structures should be investigated further in future studies considering viscous effect influenced by hydrodynamic characteristics in a viscous shear layer region of the structures which can be achieved by a high resolution piv system focusing on the region 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the roll motion of 2 d rectangular structure and pressure on the structure in the free roll decay test the experiment was performed in a 2 d wave tank with a piv measurement to obtain velocity and vorticity maps in the vicinity of the structure an unsteady rans method was applied for the cfd simulations using overset grids and a forcing method to simulate the large amplitude roll motion and to minimize reflection waves from the domain boundaries respectively in addition to the velocity and vorticity fields obtained from the piv technique the piv based pressure estimation method was applied to predict the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure by computing the pressure gradients from the piv velocity data based on the euler equations all results of the roll damping coefficient velocity and vorticity fields and pressure and force on the structure from the experiment and cfd were compared to validate experimental and numerical approaches applied in the studies the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion were investigated to predict the roll damping coefficient the results of the roll motion from the experiment and cfd were well agreed and the natural roll frequencies from the experiment and cfd were almost identical as 6 264 rad s or natural roll period t n 1 003s and 6 274 rad s or t n 1 001s respectively the difference of the roll damping coefficients between the experiment b 0 161 and the cfd b 0 155 was 3 7 considering the total error of 1 466 and sampling rate of 100 hz in the measurement of motions the natural roll frequency and damping coefficient can be estimated accurately by the numerical method applied in the study the velocity and vorticity maps were analyzed to investigate the fluid fields in the roll motion in the roll free decay test the results from the experiment and cfd were in very good agreement for the direction magnitude and even extent of the vortex considering complexity of the fluid fields in the vicinity of the structure the negative and positive vortex were seen clearly at the corner of the structure due to the counterclockwise and clockwise roll motions respectively it is found that the cfd methods applied for the numerical simulations can be employed to estimate the roll motion and viscous effect on the motion the pressure and loads on the structure were obtained using the piv based estimation method for the experiment was compared with them from the cfd to validate the numerical approach applied in the study the total and dynamic pressure and loads from the piv based estimation method were in reasonable agreement with them from the numerical simulations the total pressure estimated at the points p1 on the right wall and p2 on the bottom of the structure oscillated at the natural roll period however it was observed that the dynamic pressure oscillated in different way from the static pressure and even at the p2 in opposite way to the static pressure and the dynamic pressure on the bottom decreased the amplitude of the total pressure it was found that the dynamic pressure could make a major contribution to the roll damping phenomena overall it is found that the cfd methods in the study can accurately estimate the roll motion with roll damping coefficient and flow fields in the vicinity of the structure in the free roll decay problem through the comparison with the experimental results the conducted verification study of the piv based pressure estimation approach by comparison with the results from the cfd demonstrates the feasibility of the pressure estimation as a non intrusive manner and the additional capabilities of the piv to make it an interesting alternative technique to provide similar information in a different way it is also expected that the piv based estimation method would be an attractive approach to high quality validation for cfd simulations and other scientific and engineering challenges such as green water impact on offshore structures hydrodynamic loads for slamming on the water surface and even problems dealing with situations when model instrumentation is problematic or impossible finally the correlation between flow characteristics and pressure on offshore structures would be investigated further

pressure and loads on the structure keywords roll motion roll damping coefficient rectangular structure cfd particle image velocimetry pressure estimation 1 introduction accurate estimation of the roll motion for floating structures is crucial to the hull design connection of the risers topside structures and process plants on board ultimately to ensure the comfortability of crews the dynamic stability and operability of the structures unlike the other degrees of dynamic motions in response to the environmental loads the roll motion is highly nonlinear and sensitive to the hull shape of the structures due to the fluid viscosity it is a difficult task to estimate the roll damping because of the complexity to quantify the viscous effect which is known to have significant influence on the roll motion of a blunt shaped floating structure there have been many researches to solve the roll motion issues efficiently using empirical numerical and experimental methods the early works to predict the roll damping and motion were done using semi empirical formulae derived from experiments and hydrodynamic theory empirically ikeda et al 1977 proposed a formula in which the eddy making component of the roll damping force for a 2 d body is proportional to the square of the frequency they deduced the amplitude of the roll motion from the semi experimental technique based on theoretical and experimental results chakrabarti 2001 examined the roll damping components and their empirical contributions from a series of model experiments he decomposed the components for a ship hull form to the skin friction of the hull eddy shedding from the hull free surface waves lift effect damping and bilge keel damping including the consideration of scale effects numerically potential flow theories are still widely used to assess the hydrodynamic performance of ships and offshore structures even though potential based methods cannot predict the roll motion issues efficiently due to the negligence of fluid viscosity and rotation salvesen et al 1970 presented that potential flow methods overestimated roll amplitude responses of rectangular structures in beam seas compared to results from experiments empirical factors are commonly introduced to predict the roll damping coefficient taking into account the viscous effects due to flow separation and generation of vortices downie 1987 recently computational fluid dynamic cfd methods have been increasingly applied to study the roll damping considering the viscous effects and to investigate the vortex induced phenomena such as vortex shedding chen et al 2001 employed a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with a chimera domain decomposition approach to simulate large roll motions wilson et al 2006 demonstrated the viscous phenomenon of roll decay motion of a surface combatant using the rans cfd code cfdship iowa chen et al 2016 computed the roll motion of a 2 d rectangular structure in regular waves and compared the velocity and vorticity fields in the vicinity of the structure using an extended openfoam open source cfd package model however it has been reported that there is still a shortage in cfd simulations and more computational results are needed to establish a general approach to estimate the roll motion and viscous effects more accurately irkal et al 2016 gokce and kinaci 2018 experimentally there have been technical advances in the recent years especially for fluid measurement particle image velocimetry piv has been used as a reliable and versatile technique to measure fluid fields and to examine the fluid physics especially for the structures of vortices ruling the dynamics of systems in an efficient and non intrusive manner yeung et al 1996 measured the vorticity fields generated by a plate undergoing a forced harmonic roll motion at free surface using the piv technique they also conducted a numerical simulation to reproduce the observed flow pattern of the rolling rectangular cylinder using the random vortex method with the presence of free surface yeung et al 1998 images were taken from the velocity field around the barge to capture the behavior of the fluid and to understand the roll damping dong et al 1997 conducted piv measurements to study the vorticity structure near the bow of a ship model due to surface waves jung et al 2006 obtained flow maps using the piv in a 2 d wave tank to elucidate the vertical flow characteristics in vicinity of a rectangular barge aloisio and felice 2006 investigated the vorticity field evolution around the bilge keels of a ship model in free roll decay motion to understand the interaction between the vortices and the hull oliveira and fernandes 2014 studied nonlinear damping behavior of the floating production storage and offloading fpso with bilge keels and vortex patterns for the interaction between the vortices created during the roll motions regarding the prediction of pressure distributions and overall forces on offshore structures designers generally use velocities obtained from model experiments however the estimation of hydrodynamic pressure and loading on the structures is a major scientific and engineering challenge and still open question due to a very high pressure and a short duration ariyarathne et al 2012 the evaluation of the hydrodynamic loading is currently relying on the direct measurement of the pressure using pressure gauges mounted on the structures but it is difficult to install the gauges and limited to local measurements in aerodynamic practice the piv based pressure estimation approach has been applied as an attractive and feasible method to examine the pressure and loads using flow field information from piv measurement van oudheusden 2013 even when model instrumentation is problematic e g icing on airfoils de gregorio 2006 the observation of freely flying birds or insects spedding and hedenström 2009 in the research of the ocean engineering jakobsen et al 1997 used piv to determine acceleration and pressure in wave phenomena panciroli and porfiri 2013 applied the pressure gradient integration using the piv data for a rigid wedge entering a water surface and verified the estimated pressure with wagner s solution based on potential flow theory their findings demonstrated the accuracy of the reconstruction of pressure field over the entire impact duration in this paper experimental and numerical studies were performed to investigate the roll damping and estimate pressure on a 2 d floating rectangular structure for the roll free decay in roll and heave free condition firstly the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion were investigated to predict the roll damping coefficients by experiment in 2 d wave tank and numerical simulations based on an unsteady incompressible rans method for the cfd grid convergence test for the cfd was conducted to capture the wave propagation from the structure properly secondly the velocity and vorticity fields were examined to understand the fluid fields in the vicinity of the structure in the roll motion and the experimental and numerical results were compared especially to validate the numerical methods applied in the study thirdly estimation results of the pressure and forces on the structure using velocity field information from piv measurement were presented with explanation of the piv based pressure estimation approach finally pressure and forces on the structure from experiment and cfd were compared to validate both the piv based pressure estimation and cfd methods 2 experimental setup the experiment was carried out for the roll free decay test of a rectangular structure in a 2 d wave tank with a piston type wave maker driven by a synchronous servo motor controlled by a computer the tank is 25 m long 1 m wide and 1 1 m deep glass walled flume with a permeable wave absorbing beach of 2 5 m length and 1 1 m height at the end of tank to minimize reflection as depicted in fig 1 a rectangular acrylic structure with the dimensions of 0 20 m wide 0 99 m long and 0 15 m high was located at 14 5 m from the right end of the tank the water depth of the tank was 0 85 m throughout the experiments the structure was mounted to the tank with bars and a pair of hinges adjusted to the axis aligned with the calm water level as displayed in fig 2 the draft d and center of gravity cg of the structure are 0 07 m and 0 06 m from the keel respectively the hinges of the motion gage allowed the structure to roll and heave motions and aligned with water level but restrained it from surge and sway motions the sampling rate was set at 100 hz and test results of motions were analyzed without any filtering technique the error analysis for the measurement using the motion gage was conducted before measuring the motions in the experiment the errors of linearity hysteresis and repeatability are 0 971 0 891 and 0 642 respectively and the total error is 1 466 piv technique was used to measure 2 d velocity field in the vicinity of the structure the piv system was synchronized by the camera computer and motion gage housing data acquisition boards as schematically illustrated in fig 2 the digital high speed ccd camera mounted with a 105 mm f 2 8 micro focal lens was used to obtain piv images it had 2352 1728 pixels i e 7 μm 7 μm pixel size with 8 bit dynamic range a pair of images were obtained by double frame single pulsed method the time difference between successive frames was set at 0 005s which was determined by the maximum displacement to be less than a third of the width of the interrogation window size the field of view fov was used to obtain velocity and vorticity maps at the right lower corner of the structure the fov size were 270 200 mm2 corresponding to the spatial resolution of 3 75 mm between every velocity vectors in the interrogation area of 64 64 pixels with 50 overlap the water was seeded with small particles that have a mean diameter of 57 μm and a specific gravity of 1 02 the images were analyzed to compute piv velocity vectors using the dynamicstudio which is the commercial software developed by dantec dynamics the adaptive correlation between the two interrogation windows from a pair of images was used for the piv velocity vector analysis 3 mathematical background 3 1 computational fluid dynamics an unsteady incompressible rans reynolds averaged navier stokes approach was applied to calculate the roll amplitude and obtain numerical velocity and vorticity maps in roll free decay test using a commercial cfd software star ccm cd adapco 2015 for incompressible flows if there are no external forces the averaged continuity and momentum equations are given in tensor form in the cartesian coordinate system by eq 1 and eq 2 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i τ i j x j where u i is the relative averaged velocity vector of flow between the fluid and the control volume u i u j is the reynolds stresses and p is the mean pressure for newtonian fluid under incompressible flow the mean shear stress tensor τ i j is expressed as eq 3 3 τ i j μ u i x j u j x i where μ is dynamic viscosity the finite volume method fvm and the volume of fluid vof method were applied to the spatial discretization and free surface capturing respectively the flow equations were solved in a segregated manner using a predictor corrector approach convection and diffusion terms in the rans equations were discretized by a second order upwind scheme and a central difference scheme the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm was used to resolve the pressure velocity coupling and a k ω shear stress transport sst model was applied as the turbulence model for all calculations a second order temporal scheme was used for discretization of the unsteady term in rans equations to improve accuracy of wave propagation from the structure in order to consider motions of the structure a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi scheme was applied with the vessel free to move in roll and heave directions overset grids were used to simulate the floating structure in large amplitude motions without deforming meshes especially around free surface and the structure to make the grid quality remain the same in all simulation time one grid is adapted to the background such as free surface reflection waves etc while overlapping grids are attached to the structure and move with it without deformation a forcing zone was introduced to reduce the domain size and to minimize reflection waves from the boundaries enger et al 2014 in the zone the disturbed flows from the structure are absorbed by actively adjusting the momentum mass and volume fraction source the coupled zone with flat vof waves was implemented to eliminate disturbed flows which were reflected from the boundaries around the structure in the study in this study the forcing zone of 2 m was applied to both inlet and outlet boundaries which were set as pressure outlet condition fig 3 shows the grid refined locally in overset region around the structure and free surface to investigate the viscous effect more accurately in the vicinity of the structure the prism layer was applied around the structure the calculation domain is 6 m x 6 m 0 85 m z 0 55 m where the mid plane and draught of the structure are located at x 0 and z 0 respectively 3 2 piv based pressure estimation the euler equations were used to directly compute the pressure gradient components from piv velocity data by eq 4 and eq 5 4 p x ρ u t u u x w u z 5 p z ρ w t u w x w w z ρ g where u and w denote the horizontal and vertical velocity components obtained from piv technique on the axes x and z of a cartesian coordinate system the viscous terms in the momentum equation was discarded taking into account that they cannot be properly resolved from the velocity field measurements unless a sufficiently high resolution can be achieved for which the friction contribution was located in a thin boundary layer of the structure jakobsen et al 1997 van oudheusden 2008 the central finite difference approximation was adopted to calculate the spatial and temporal derivatives of the velocity components as expressed by eq 6 and eq 7 6 u x x z t u x h z t u x h z t 2 h 7 u t x z t u x z t δ t u x z t δ t 2 δ t where h is the grid spacing and δ t is the time difference between two successive velocity fields in the study h is equal to δ x and δ z as the spatial resolution of 3 75 mm in the piv measurement δ t was determined as 6 times i e 0 03s of the time difference between the piv frames considering the accuracy and error accumulation of the pressure computation because increasing the time separation increases the truncation error but reduces the effect of the velocity error on the acceleration determination jakobsen et al 1997 van oudheusden 2013 the forward or backward differences were employed depending on the location to calculate the spatial derivative of points at the boundary by eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 8 u x x z t u x h z t u x z t h 9 u x x z t u x z t u x h z t h regarding the calculation of the pressure inside the fluid domain the pressure gradient is spatially integrated from a boundary condition set at the free surface fig 4 depicts the main steps of the integration procedure forward integration was used along vertical line l1 starting from point a initially selected at the free surface where the pressure is set to zero a point b on line l1 was selected to estimate all pressure along horizontal line l2 by performing forward and backward integration from the known pressure on lines l1 and l2 the space marching integration method proposed by baur and köngeter 1999 was applied to compute the unknown pressure over the rest of the fluid domain the same procedure was performed for different points of a and b in fluid domain the final pressure field was obtained by taking the average of all the resulting pressure fields points p1 and p2 were set at 2 cm away from the corner on the right and bottom wall of the structure respectively to analyze and compare pressure obtained from the piv based estimation and cfd methods 4 discussion of experiment and numerical results 4 1 grid convergence test prior to the investigation on the roll damping and pressure on the structure grid convergence tests for the cfd method were performed to capture the wave propagation from the structure properly in the roll free decay test 0 044 m of wave height h was assumed as about 4 times 2 times of z position of the free surface when the structure is rotated for 22 of the initial roll angle 1 56 m of the wave length was applied considering the roll natural period of t n 1 0 s kim et al 2019 for all test cases of grid convergence more than 80 cells per wave length was applied based on the guidelines for ship cfd applications from ittc 2011 a minimum of 20 cells per wave height were taken into account enger et al 2014 the coarse and fine mesh systems were derived by reducing and increasing cell numbers using a factor of 2 bøckmann et al 2014 the time step of the simulation was set to be proportional to the grid size as shown in table 1 the results of the grid convergence tests with three different mesh systems are presented in fig 5 where the results using medium and fine mesh are almost identical in time domain the grid uncertainty analysis was conducted for both the roll natural frequency and roll peak angles in 7 cycles of the roll motion using grid triplets g 1 g 2 and g 3 with a uniform parameter ratio r g chosen as 2 for the free surface refinement kim et al 2017 s 1 s 2 and s 3 are corresponding solutions using the fine medium and coarse mesh and r f and r p are the convergence ratios for the roll natural frequency and roll peak angle respectively as given in eq 10 10 r f p ε f p 21 ε f p 32 where ε f p 21 s f p 2 s f p 1 and ε f p 32 s f p 3 s f p 2 are the differences between medium fine and coarse medium solutions of the roll natural frequency and roll peak angle the grid uncertainty studies showed monotonic convergences for the roll natural frequency with r f 0 047 and for the roll peak angle with r p 0 183 therefore the medium mesh system was chosen for the cfd simulations in the study 4 2 roll motion characteristics for 2 d rectangular structure the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion of the 2 d rectangular structure were investigated before examining the roll damping and pressure on the structure from piv measurement and numerical study fig 6 shows the gz curve of the rectangular structure which was estimated to find if the rolling has as a linear or nonlinear characteristic with the initial angle of 22 based on the gz curve in fig 6 the roll period is considered as a constant in this paper because of the small differences between the righting arm and the slope tangential at zero deg in this study free roll decay tests in calm water were conducted to obtain the natural roll frequency ω n and the damping coefficient b experimentally and numerically note that the roll and heave motion were allowed in the present study to investigate the roll motion characteristics accurately kim et al 2019 the equation of roll motion in free roll decay can be expressed based on the gz curve fig 6 as below 11 d 2 ϕ d t 2 2 ζ ω n d ϕ d t ω n 2 ϕ 0 where ζ damping factor 2 ζ ω n b i ω n 2 δ g m i the roll motion decayed after each rolling cycle due to the damping effect as shown in fig 7 the natural roll frequencies ω n obtained from the experiment and cfd through the spectrum analysis were almost identical as 6 264 rad s or natural roll period t n 1 003s and 6 274 rad s or t n 1 001s respectively fig 8 shows the decrease of inclination for each single roll plotted against the mean angle of roll ϕ m which is called the curve of roll extinction the formula was applied to obtain the roll damping coefficient b following bhattacharyya 1978 as below 12 b k 1 t n δ g m π 2 where k 1 is the slope of the curve of extinction we obtained b 0 161 and 0 155 from the slopes k 1 0 515 and 0 499 of experiment and cfd respectively it was found that the roll damping coefficient can be estimated accurately by the numerical method having 3 7 difference with experiment in the study 4 3 estimation of velocity and vorticity fields especially to investigate the viscous effect on the roll motion in the roll free decay test the velocity and vortex fields obtained from the piv in the experiment and numerical simulations were analyzed and compared as shown in figs 9 12 the vorticity ω at a point i j was obtained based on the circulation calculated using its eight neighboring points i e ω i j γ i j 4 δxδz with the circulation γ and δx and δz with the distance between adjacent velocity vectors jung et al 2005 figs 9 and 10 show the comparison of velocity and vorticity maps for the first negative roll angle 0 25s 0 75s which present from the zero down crossing to maximum negative roll angle in fig 7 and from the maximum negative roll angle to zero up crossing in fig 10 respectively the figures are presented when the actual roll angles are the same for accurate comparison on the velocity and vortex characteristic in vicinity of the rectangular structure the overall agreement for the direction magnitude and even extent of the vortex between experimental and cfd results was very good considering the complexity of the velocity and vorticity fields in the vicinity of the structure when the structure was in the clockwise cw roll motion from t 0 25s 0 40s as presented in fig 9 the strong positive vortex was seen clearly at the corner of the structure due to the cw roll motion after the maximum negative roll angle fig 10 it was observed that the positive vortex changed into the coupled vortex with a negative vortex developed at the bottom of the structure and moved together away from the structure velocity and vorticity maps from the experiment and cfd were also compared for the first positive roll angle 0 79s 1 25s as shown in figs 11 and 12 including the maximum positive roll figs 11 and 12 are presented at the roll angles in the ccw and cw respectively when the structure was in ccw roll motion from 0 79s to 0 90s the coupled vortex was seen clearly at the bottom of the structure and the negative vortex detached from the main vortex as presented in fig 11 the detached vortex was developed into a different coupled vortex at the corner of the structure in the cw roll motion as shown in fig 12 the results from the cfd were also generally in good agreement with them from the piv measurement however it was observed that the vortex calculated from cfd still remained strongly while the vortex obtained in experiments was getting weaker dissipated with separation into small vortexes the different behavior in vortex around the structure might cause the gap of the roll angle between the experimental and cfd results especially after the two periods passed 4 4 estimation of pressure on the structure in addition to the velocity and vorticity fields produced by the piv technique the pressure on the structure was obtained by computing the pressure gradients components from the flow field information for the validation of the piv based estimation method results of the unsteady total pressure at p1 on the right wall and p2 on the bottom of the structure as defined in fig 4 were compared with the results from the cfd simulation as shown in fig 13 the results from the piv based estimation method were in good agreement with them from the cfd simulation as expected because the static pressure was dominant comparing with the dynamic pressure in the total pressure as confirmed in fig 15 it was observed that the total pressure estimated at both p1 and p2 oscillated at the natural roll period as shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows the comparison of the total force on the right wall of the structure using the predicted total pressure on the right wall unfortunately the total force on the bottom was not obtained because velocity fields were measured in only certain area on the bottom and changed with the roll motion of the structure in the fixed fov as illustrated in fig 2 it was also observed that the total force from the piv based estimation method also oscillates at the natural roll period and shows good agreement with that from the cfd recently there have been numerous efforts to predict the structural loads and characteristics especially for green water on offshore structures but it is still challenging because the high non linear characteristics of fluid structure interaction and violent multi phase flow ariyarathne et al 2012 lee et al 2016 from the comparison of pressure between cfd and experimental results the piv based pressure estimation method in the study will be alternative approach to the challenging problems with measurement using pressure gauges especially the dynamic pressure obtained from the piv based estimation and cfd methods were analyzed and compared with static pressure to validate the methods as shown in fig 15 the dynamic pressure was obtained by subtracting the static pressure which is determined as water depth of p1 and p2 from the total pressure the results of the dynamic pressure from the piv based estimation were in general agreement with them from the cfd even though the dynamic pressure estimated from the velocity profiles taken by piv scattered in large roll motions it was observed that the dynamic pressure oscillated in different way from the static pressure and especially at the point p2 on the bottom of the structure in opposite way to the static pressure even if the dynamic pressure on the bottom had the similar frequency compared to the natural roll frequency it should be noted that the dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure decrease the amplitude of the total pressure e g static pressure is positive at all times but dynamic pressure is negative and positive at 0 5s and 1 0s respectively therefore it was found that the dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure could play an important role in the roll damping phenomena it was also studied to find the vortex effect on the pressure by examining the correlation between the vortex information in the vicinity of the structure and dynamic pressure on the wall it was deduced that the positive vortex on the bottom in figs 11 and 12 i e 0 79s 1 25s could have an effect on the positive dynamic pressure on the bottom of the structure as presented in fig 15 p2 however it is thought that the correlation between flow information and pressure on offshore structures should be investigated further in future studies considering viscous effect influenced by hydrodynamic characteristics in a viscous shear layer region of the structures which can be achieved by a high resolution piv system focusing on the region 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the roll motion of 2 d rectangular structure and pressure on the structure in the free roll decay test the experiment was performed in a 2 d wave tank with a piv measurement to obtain velocity and vorticity maps in the vicinity of the structure an unsteady rans method was applied for the cfd simulations using overset grids and a forcing method to simulate the large amplitude roll motion and to minimize reflection waves from the domain boundaries respectively in addition to the velocity and vorticity fields obtained from the piv technique the piv based pressure estimation method was applied to predict the hydrodynamic pressure on the structure by computing the pressure gradients from the piv velocity data based on the euler equations all results of the roll damping coefficient velocity and vorticity fields and pressure and force on the structure from the experiment and cfd were compared to validate experimental and numerical approaches applied in the studies the dynamic characteristics of the roll motion were investigated to predict the roll damping coefficient the results of the roll motion from the experiment and cfd were well agreed and the natural roll frequencies from the experiment and cfd were almost identical as 6 264 rad s or natural roll period t n 1 003s and 6 274 rad s or t n 1 001s respectively the difference of the roll damping coefficients between the experiment b 0 161 and the cfd b 0 155 was 3 7 considering the total error of 1 466 and sampling rate of 100 hz in the measurement of motions the natural roll frequency and damping coefficient can be estimated accurately by the numerical method applied in the study the velocity and vorticity maps were analyzed to investigate the fluid fields in the roll motion in the roll free decay test the results from the experiment and cfd were in very good agreement for the direction magnitude and even extent of the vortex considering complexity of the fluid fields in the vicinity of the structure the negative and positive vortex were seen clearly at the corner of the structure due to the counterclockwise and clockwise roll motions respectively it is found that the cfd methods applied for the numerical simulations can be employed to estimate the roll motion and viscous effect on the motion the pressure and loads on the structure were obtained using the piv based estimation method for the experiment was compared with them from the cfd to validate the numerical approach applied in the study the total and dynamic pressure and loads from the piv based estimation method were in reasonable agreement with them from the numerical simulations the total pressure estimated at the points p1 on the right wall and p2 on the bottom of the structure oscillated at the natural roll period however it was observed that the dynamic pressure oscillated in different way from the static pressure and even at the p2 in opposite way to the static pressure and the dynamic pressure on the bottom decreased the amplitude of the total pressure it was found that the dynamic pressure could make a major contribution to the roll damping phenomena overall it is found that the cfd methods in the study can accurately estimate the roll motion with roll damping coefficient and flow fields in the vicinity of the structure in the free roll decay problem through the comparison with the experimental results the conducted verification study of the piv based pressure estimation approach by comparison with the results from the cfd demonstrates the feasibility of the pressure estimation as a non intrusive manner and the additional capabilities of the piv to make it an interesting alternative technique to provide similar information in a different way it is also expected that the piv based estimation method would be an attractive approach to high quality validation for cfd simulations and other scientific and engineering challenges such as green water impact on offshore structures hydrodynamic loads for slamming on the water surface and even problems dealing with situations when model instrumentation is problematic or impossible finally the correlation between flow characteristics and pressure on offshore structures would be investigated further
