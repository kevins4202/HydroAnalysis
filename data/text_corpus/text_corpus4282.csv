mirror symmetry method to deal with keywords ship motion short term prediction support vector regression empirical mode decomposition boundary effect 1 introduction ships may be swayed by several factors affecting their safety while operating some particular processed at sea like carrier based aircraft landing khan et al 2005 in particular in harsh climates winds waves and currents may result in ship swaying and deck moving for many offshore operations short term prediction of ship motion is of great importance it can improve the performance of shipborne weapons and ship motion control systems riola et al 2011 zhao et al 2004 several predictive models proposed as a short term prediction of ship motion has drawn considerable attention classically short term prediction models of ship motion can be divided into three types hydrodynamic based models classical time series models and nonlinear and intelligent learning models huang et al 2014 the early methods of ship motion prediction were often too complex and difficult to be applied in practice in the 1970s modern control theory began to be used in the ship motion prediction kalman filter provides a powerful way to realize real time online prediction leading the work to enter the stage of a feasibility study since the 1980s with the development of time series analysis artificial intelligence fuzzy logic chaos theory artificial neural network and statistical learning theory new methods have been applied in ship motion prediction peng et al 2001 the performance of some classic time series prediction models including autoregressive model ar model and autoregressive moving average model arma model fail to satisfy expectations due to the ship motion process complexity with nonlinearity and uncertainty in harsh climates duan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 support vector machine svm a novel type of machine learning algorithm has a strong capacity for processing nonlinear data based on svm the support vector regression model svr model is an effective method in solving regression problems compared to the neural network model the svr model needs less training data bo s bo and aiguo 2013 research further confirms the applicability of the svr model in ship motion prediction the svr model can transform a nonlinear problem into a linear one in high dimensional space with the use of kernel function it is a very effective method to replace the complex calculation in high dimensional space scholkopf et al 1995 burges 1998 vapnik 1995 even though svr is an effective prediction method non stationary time series have a great impact on its prediction accuracy fan et al 2016 empirical mode decomposition emd proposed by huang huang et al 1998 exhibits a strong generality in dealing with non stationary data this method can reflect the physical characteristics of the original time series signal without preset basis function huang et al 1998 duan et al 2016a al musaylh et al 2018 huang huang et al 2015 verifies that emd as an effective method to deal with non stationary time series in ship motion data in huang s research non stationary data is decomposed into a couple of intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residue by emd each component is predicted individually by the ar model and then the final forecast is obtained by adding the predicted results of each component even though emd can deal with non stationary data effectively the emd boundary effect decrease the prediction accuracy de et al 2016 cao and zhang 2013 qi et al 2007 in order to deal with the emd boundary effect zhao zhao and huang 2001 proposes a mirror extending method to meet the needs of the emd procedure however the series extended by this method is often quite different from the actual series some other methods apply prediction algorithms including autoregressive moving average han et al 2014 autoregressive duan et al 2015 and neural network chu et al 2014 liu et al 2015 algorithms to extend the original data boundary however their accuracy decreases with the increased length of the extended dataset in this research by studying the different methods of dealing with the emd boundary effect a method combining mirror symmetry with the svr algorithm is proposed further this model s effectiveness in decreasing the influence of the emd boundary effect in the predictive model is confirmed the rolling and pitching data analyzed in experiments are derived from a real ship sailing at sea the results of experiments confirm that the msemd svr model applying mirror symmetry and svr algorithm to deal with the emd boundary effect is an effective model for short term prediction of ship motion 2 methodology 2 1 formulations of svr algorithm support vector machine svm is an approximate implementation of structural risk minimization being able to balance learning and generalization capability based on narrow sample information in regression it is termed support vector regression svr the particular deduction procedure of the svr algorithm is provided in ma ma et al 2003 and zhou 2016 svr is a regression method that using a kernel function detects the optimal regression hyperplane in high dimensional feature space the present research applies the most popular ε svr algorithm that locates the hyperplane with a so called ε insensitive loss function kazem et al 2013 smola and schölkopf 2004 prior to predicting the svr model is trained by training data x i y i i 1 2 m where x i r n y i r is the target value for each input vector x i and m is the number of training samples the svr function is presented as 1 f x ω t ϕ x b where ω denotes a vector of weight coefficients and b denotes a bias constant ϕ x denotes the feature vector mapping x to a high dimensional feature space the ε svr algorithm enables a maximum deviation ε between f x and y i ε insensitive loss function l ε ξ is presented as 2 l ε ξ 0 if ξ ε ξ ε otherwise by minimizing the following optimization problem ω and b can be estimated 3 min imze 1 2 ω 2 subject to y i ω ϕ x i b ε i 1 2 m slack variables ξ i and ξ i are introduced to make the method more robust to cope with infeasible constraints of the above optimization problem 4 min imze 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m ξ i ξ i subject to y i ω ϕ x i b ε ξ i ω ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 i 1 2 m where c represents the regularization constant that defines the trade off between the fitting errors and model complexity ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables that define the lower and upper excess deviation and measure the deviation of training data outside ε insensitive loss function zone typically kernel functions are employed to solve the nonlinearity feature space mapping in the svr algorithm the radial basis function rbf kernel is the most extensively applied kernel function due to its high computational efficiency further the rbf kernel may map each sample point to an infinite dimension feature space that makes the linearly inseparable data linearly separable cao and tay 2003 abo khalil and lee 2008 in this study the rbf kernel is applied to construct the svr model an rbf kernel is as follows 5 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 where γ 0 is the kernel parameter the model s fitting accuracy and generalization performance are affected by ε ξ i ξ i and c in this study a grid search method on the basis of cross validation was applied to select the suitable parameters of the svr algorithm the samples were distributed into five groups while searching for the best parameters each group of subsets was considered as a testing set once and at that time the other four groups were regarded as training sets the mean square error of the five groups of test results was considered as the final error of the parameters as a final point a set of parameters with the least error was chosen this is a straightforward and feasible method duan et al 2003 2 2 raw data six degrees of the motion data rolling pitching yawing swaying surging and heaving collected from a ship moving at a speed of 20 knots with the condition of sea state 4 was analyzed in this study the length width and draft of the ship are about 175 m 25 m and 8 m respectively fig 1 shows the scene of raw data acquisition for ease in the demonstration this research principally presented the research results of rolling and pitching the non stationarity of ship motion data was discussed by duan duan et al 2015 in duan s research the quantitative methods of consecutive statistics the mean and covariance functions were applied to analyze the stationarity of ship motion data augmented dickey fuller adf test was used to analyze the data collected in this study the adf test suggested by dickey and fuller 1979 is a common method to test the stationarity of time series the test results indicated the existence of non stationarity in the experimental data the thorough principle of the adf test is given in dickey dickey and fuller 1979 and furuoka 2017 fig 2 illustrates partial raw rolling and pitching data 250 s the raw data frequency is 2 hz 2 3 emd algorithm and emd svr model empirical mode decomposition emd was first proposed by huang huang et al 1998 this method can reflect the physical characteristics of the original time series signal without setting the basis function beforehand the basic idea of empirical mode decomposition is that any set of signals consists of a limited number of intrinsic mode functions according to the time scale characteristics of the data itself the time series are decomposed step by step to extract intrinsic mode function imf with different characteristic scales each imf represents an intrinsic characteristic vibration form of the signal the imf needs to satisfy the following two basic conditions the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings should be equal or differ by one the average value of the upper envelope formed by the local maxima and the lower envelope formed by the local minima point should be zero the empirical mode decomposition steps are as following 1 find all the maximum and minimum points of original data sequence x t and fit all the maximum points with a cubic spline function this curve is the upper envelope of data all minimum points similarly are fitted with a cubic spline function to fit the lower envelope of data m 1 is the mean of the upper and the lower envelopes by subtracting the mean value m 1 of the upper and lower envelopes from the x t a new data sequence h 1 t is achieved 6 h 1 t x t m 1 if h 1 t does not satisfy the two basic requirements of imf the work above should be repeated several times with h 1 t as the original data until h n t meets the two requirements at this time h n t is i m f 1 t 2 a new data sequence x 2 t is achieved by subtracting i m f 1 t from the original data 7 x 2 t x 1 t i m f 1 3 repeat the above steps n times until the last data sequence x n 1 t cannot be decomposed into imf this data sequence x n 1 t is named the residue r t of the original data the emd procedure may be formulated as follows 8 x t i 1 n i m f i t r t in the prediction of non stationary time series emd processing is very beneficial duan et al 2016a given the rolling data in fig 2 a as an instance fig 3 illustrates the emd result emd processes partial raw rolling data 250 s into four groups of imf components and one group of residue component the emd svr model is an effective model for predicting non stationary time series fig 4 shows the schematic flow diagram of the emd svr model fan et al 2016 duan et al 2016b the steps are as the following 1 raw ship motion time series extracted from raw data is decomposed into several imfs and a residue by emd 2 each decomposed component is predicted by the svr model individually 3 each result of the predictions is aggregated to attain the final predicted value considering rolling data in fig 3 as an instance fig 5 illustrates the predicted results of svr for decomposed components and the final predicted results of the emd svr model 2 4 performance metrics in this research by calculating the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the prediction results of each model are assessed yaseen et al 2018 9 r t 1 n h t h m h t h m t 1 n h t h m 2 t 1 n h t h m 2 10 r m s e 1 n t 1 n h t h t 2 11 n s e 1 t 1 n h t h t 2 t 1 n h t h m 2 where h t t 1 2 n represents the prediction result predicted data h m represents the mean of h t h t t 1 2 n denotes the measured ship motion data actual data h m represents the mean of h t and n denotes the prediction length to assess the degree of correlation between forecast and actual values the index of the correlation coefficient r is applied its value is between 1 and 1 the closer it approaches 1 or 1 the better the correlation between two sets of data indicating the better forecasting results another index is the root mean square error rmse being used to assess the ensemble error of the forecasting results nse reflects the fitting precision of the fit between the actual and predicted data a high value of nse up to one shows high model efficiency bowden et al 2012 danandeh et al 2018 in the current study the scatter plots of the prediction results further are drawn showing the prediction effect intuitively duan et al 2016b 3 emd boundary effect in the emd procedure to envelop the maximum and minimum points of the signal cubic spline interpolation is applied however the initial and final parts of the signal are restricted by the endpoints lacking corresponding extreme points that result in the uncertainty of the interpolation points and severe distortion of a boundary de et al 2016 the mirror symmetry extending method has been shown to be efficient in dealing with the emd boundary effect thus it is extensively applied this method at both ends of the data extends extreme points by mirror symmetry to meet the needs of the emd process as illustrated in fig 6 the thorough principle of the emd boundary effect is provided in zhao and huang 2001 however this method needs to find an appropriate place to put the mirror and the result of extending the boundary of time series by non prediction methods is not satisfactory since always significant differences appear between the extended and real extrema making it problematic to be applied in the predictive models duan et al 2016b in the current work a method of combining mirror symmetry with the svr algorithm was offered to deal with the emd boundary effect as demonstrated in fig 7 the first extreme point was extended at the boundary of the original series by the svr algorithm and then other extreme points were achieved symmetrically by a mirror to avoid the increase of error caused by using svr alone a flowchart of the emd svr model applying mirror symmetry and the svr algorithm to deal with the boundary effect is shown in fig 8 this model improves the prediction precision by decreasing the influence of emd boundary effect as compared to the classical emd svr model 4 prediction and comparison results to confirm the performance of combining mirror symmetry with svr method for the emd svr model the present work use 500 s 1000 points sliding data window as the training set to predict 5 s 10 points data after four models respectively the training set window moves backward for 5 s 10 points after every prediction the total forecasting length is 50 s 100 points and ten separate groups of experiments with data in various periods are conducted in this research the models of emd svr memd svr and msemd svr for convenience are applied to represent the emd svr model that does not deal with the emd boundary effect it applies mirror symmetry method to deal with boundary effect and mirror symmetry and svr algorithm to deal with boundary effect the specific experimental steps are as follows 1 500 s 1000 points rolling and pitching data from original data is extracted as training set 2 different models emd svr model memd svr model and msemd svr model are used to predict 501 505s data 3 6 505 s data from original data is extracted as training set to predict 506 510 s data and so on until total forecasting length is up to 50 s considering the experimental results of group 1 as an instance figs 9 and 10 illustrate predicted and actual data of rolling and pitching in group 1 the predicted data of the emd svr model show the lowest level of agreement with measured rolling data as observed in the fig 9 the prediction trend of the emd svr model in some intervals is opposite to the actual situation all three models match well with the actual data in amplitude and phase tracking when predicting pitching data as shown in fig 10 as seen in figs 9 and 10 the msemd svr model using mirror symmetry and the svr algorithm to deal with boundary effect is the closest to the actual data at the crest and trough followed by the memd svr model using mirror symmetry method to deal with boundary effect while the emd svr model has large errors in some periods particularly in predicting rolling data the reliability of the prediction results may be reflected by a scatter plot the scatter plots of the predicted results of rolling and pitching are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 the msemd svr model as observed in the figures with the slope of the fitting line being closer to 1 and fewer points deviating from the fitting line is more stable and superior in the prediction of rolling and pitching data followed by the memd svr model in the prediction results of the emd svr model there are several points with large errors the rmse r and nse of predicted rolling data in various groups are presented in table 1 the smallest prediction error belongs to the msemd svr model followed by the memd svr and emd svr models the rmse of the memd svr model is smaller than that of the emd svr model and the r and nse are higher closer to one showing that the mirror symmetry method may efficiently deal with the emd boundary effect when involving with rolling data among the three the performance of the msemd svr model is the best the lowest rmse and the highest r and nse in the msemd svr model indicate the best prediction accuracy and the highest model reliability the rmse r and nse of predicted pitching data in various groups are presented in table 2 the predicted results of the memd svr model were better than those of the emd svr model except for group 6 and group 7 the experimental results of the group 6 and group 7 show that the memd svr model is not always stable in all 10 groups the prediction results of the msemd svr model are better than that of the emd svr model it indicates that msemd svr model is more stable than the memd svr model when the extended series of mirror symmetry method differs greatly from the actual sequence the memd svr model will lead to larger errors in the group 1 the r of the msemd svr model 0 9447 is smaller than the memd svr model 0 9489 but the rmse is smaller and the nse is higher in the other nine groups the performance of the msemd svr model is obviously better than the memd svr model 5 conclusion in this paper a hybrid msemd svr model has been developed for short term prediction of ship motions in this model the svr algorithm and mirror symmetry method are combined to reduce the influence of emd boundary effect many researches have proved that emd is an effective method in dealing with the non stationary data however the boundary effect will greatly affect the performance of emd for time series prediction without dealing with the boundary effect of emd the performance of the classical emd svr model is not satisfactory this research validated the feasibility of the emd svr model applying mirror symmetry method to deal with emd boundary effect for short term prediction of ship motion the mirror symmetry is an effective method but it is not stable it can lead to large errors in some time periods based on the mirror symmetry method in this research the combination of mirror symmetry and the svr method was used to deal with the emd boundary effect the result of experiments illustrated that this method can overcome the instability of the mirror symmetry method and effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the emd svr model the proposed msemd svr model in this research has less prediction error rmse is smaller and higher efficiency r and nse are closer to 1 than the emd svr and memd svr model credit authorship contribution statement zhihong nie

curve is the upper envelope of data all minimum points similarly are fitted with a cubic spline function to fit the lower envelope of data m 1 is the mean of the upper and the lower envelopes by subtracting the mean value m 1 of the upper and lower envelopes from the x t a new data sequence h 1 t is achieved 6 h 1 t x t m 1 if h 1 t does not satisfy the two basic requirements of imf the work

al 2018 in the current study the scatter plots of the prediction results further are drawn showing the prediction effect intuitively duan et al 2016b 3 emd boundary effect in the emd procedure to envelop the maximum and minimum points of the signal cubic spline interpolation is applied however the initial and final parts of the signal are restricted by the endpoints lacking corresponding extreme points that result in the uncertainty of the interpolation points and severe distortion of a boundary de et al 2016 the mirror symmetry extending method has been shown to be efficient in dealing with the emd boundary effect thus it is extensively applied this method at both ends of the data extends extreme points by mirror symmetry to meet the needs of the emd process as illustrated in fig 6 the thorough principle of the emd boundary effect is provided in zhao and huang 2001 however this method needs to find an appropriate place to put the mirror and the result of extending the boundary of time series by non prediction methods is not satisfactory since always significant differences appear between the extended and real extrema making it problematic to be applied in the predictive models duan et al 2016b in the current work a method of combining mirror symmetry with the svr algorithm was offered to deal with the emd boundary effect as demonstrated in fig 7 the first extreme point was extended at the boundary of the original series by the svr algorithm and then other extreme points were achieved symmetrically by a mirror to avoid the increase of error caused by using svr alone a flowchart of the emd svr model applying mirror symmetry and the svr algorithm to deal with the boundary effect is shown in fig 8 this model improves the prediction precision by decreasing the influence of emd boundary effect as compared to the classical emd svr model 4 prediction and comparison results to confirm the performance of combining mirror symmetry with svr method for the emd svr model the present work use 500 s 1000 points sliding data window as the training set to predict 5 s 10 points data after four models respectively the training set window moves backward for 5 s 10 points after every prediction the total forecasting length is 50 s 100 points and ten separate groups of experiments with data in various periods are conducted in this research the models of emd svr memd svr and msemd svr for convenience are applied to represent the emd svr model that does not deal with the emd boundary effect it applies mirror symmetry method to deal with boundary effect and mirror symmetry and svr algorithm to deal with boundary effect the specific experimental steps are as follows 1 500 s 1000 points rolling and pitching data from original data is extracted as training set 2 different models emd svr model memd svr model and msemd svr model are used to predict 501 505s data 3 6 505 s data from original data is extracted as training set to predict 506 510 s data and so on until total forecasting length is up to 50 s considering the experimental results of group 1 as an instance figs 9 and 10 illustrate predicted and actual data of rolling and pitching in group 1 the predicted data of the emd svr model show the lowest level of agreement with measured rolling data as observed in the fig 9 the prediction trend of the emd svr model in some intervals is opposite to the actual situation all three models match well with the actual data in amplitude and phase tracking when predicting pitching data as shown in fig 10 as seen in figs 9 and 10 the msemd svr model using mirror symmetry and the svr algorithm to deal with boundary effect is the closest to the actual data at the crest and trough followed by the memd svr model using mirror symmetry method to deal with boundary effect while the emd svr model has large errors in some periods particularly in predicting rolling data the reliability of the prediction results may be reflected by a scatter plot the scatter plots of the predicted results of rolling and pitching are illustrated in figs 11 and 12 the msemd svr model as observed in the figures with the slope of the fitting line being closer to 1 and fewer points deviating from the fitting line is more stable and superior in the prediction of rolling and pitching data followed by the memd svr model in the prediction results of the emd svr model there are several points with large errors the rmse r and nse of predicted rolling data in various groups are presented in table 1 the smallest prediction error belongs to the msemd svr model followed by the memd svr and emd svr models the rmse of the memd svr model is smaller than that of the emd svr model and the r and nse are higher closer to one showing that the mirror symmetry method may efficiently deal with the emd boundary effect when involving with rolling data among the three the performance of the msemd svr model is the best the lowest rmse and the highest r and nse in the msemd svr model indicate the best prediction accuracy and the highest model reliability the rmse r and nse of predicted pitching data in various groups are presented in table 2 the predicted results of the memd svr model were better than those of the emd svr model except for group 6 and group 7 the experimental results of the group 6 and group 7 show that the memd svr model is not always stable in all 10 groups the prediction results of the msemd svr model are better than that of the emd svr model it indicates that msemd svr model is more stable than the memd svr model when the extended series of mirror symmetry method differs greatly from the actual sequence the memd svr model will lead to larger errors in the group 1 the r of the msemd svr model 0 9447 is smaller than the memd svr model 0 9489 but the rmse is smaller and the nse is higher in the other nine groups the performance of the msemd svr model is obviously better than the memd svr model 5 conclusion in this paper a hybrid msemd svr model has been developed for short term prediction of ship motions in this model the svr algorithm and mirror symmetry method are combined to reduce the influence of emd boundary effect many researches have proved that emd is an effective method in dealing with the non stationary data however the boundary effect will greatly affect the performance of emd for time series prediction without dealing with the boundary effect of emd the performance of the classical emd svr model is not satisfactory this research validated the feasibility of the emd svr model applying mirror symmetry method to deal with emd boundary effect for short term prediction of ship motion the mirror symmetry is an effective method but it is not stable it can lead to large errors in some time periods based on the mirror symmetry method in this research the combination of mirror symmetry and the svr method was used to deal with the emd boundary effect the result of experiments illustrated that this method can overcome the instability of the mirror symmetry method and effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the emd svr model the proposed msemd svr model in this research has less prediction error rmse is smaller and higher efficiency r and nse are closer to 1 than the emd svr and memd svr model credit authorship contribution statement zhihong nie

21411,in this paper a type of pile breakwater is studied in a configuration that can provide an effective shore protection structure while the rubble mound breakwaters are the most common type but they suffer from a number of shortcomings including the interruption of water that may lead to deterioration of water quality and corresponding environmental problems the breakwater of this study with rows of piles can be used against sea waves as an alternative its hydraulic performance including wave reflection and transmission shear stresses pressure measurements drag and inertia coefficients are investigated in the first step the hydrodynamics around the mono piles with square cross sections are inspected the parametric equations are developed to measure the optimal orientation of the piles as evidenced in the literature relatively limited works have been carried out on this kind of piles also the performance of the considered pile breakwaters are evaluated to do this the numerical results are calibrated and validated by experimentation it is observed that the group piles with the square cross section in optimum conditions could have a higher value of reflection almost between 7 even to almost 30 percent than other considered conditions with mild and short waves it can be related to the effect of the square piles edges on the separation process of the flow keywords pile breakwater square cross section pile environmentally friendly wave generating system numerical model 1 introduction coasts are constantly exposed to wave attacks and reflected energies that lead to scour and coastline changes over time therefore the construction of structures and facilities in the coastal areas without any protective considerations would be practically impossible breakwaters are structures constructed on coasts as part of the coastal defense to protect the coasts from the effects of wave attack one of the most common types of breakwater is the rubble mound breakwater such wave breakers are able to protect the coastal areas completely however in many cases in order to protect the facilities built on the coast it may be required to not fully but rather partially dissipate the waves hitting the coast thus the construction of such breakwater structures is not always necessary to protect the coast construction of rubble mound breakwaters by interrupting flow and movement of water in addition to high construction costs pose environmental problems for this purpose slot breakwaters such as pile breakwaters with one or more rows of piles can be used against the sea waves in the near shore zone there are particular applications in which pile breakwaters are preferable over rubble mound breakwaters the pile breakwater is a more recent development and the important advantages of this type include lower maintenance costs ease of construction greater stability against sliding and an enhanced appearance today such breakwaters exist in different areas across the world they allow the free passage of sediments that leads to reduced shoreline erosion in this case it can be considered as the most suitable option for poor soils and conditions that lack a rocky bottom several cases worldwide have clearly demonstrated this phenomenon among similar breakwaters constructed all over the world the steel pile breakwater at the port of osaka the concrete pile breakwater at pass christian bay the steel pile breakwater at pelangi beach resort langkawi the curtain wall pile breakwater at the port of yeoho and the pile supported breakwaters at hanstholm can be mentioned liu et al 2011 this kind of breakwater can dissipate a major portion of the incident wave energy when the wave hits the breakwater a part of the wave is reflected while other parts are transmitted and propagated towards the coastline in addition these breakwaters reduce some aspects of pollution in the shore area by allowing water exchange roy et al 2019 consequently it is necessary to study the interaction between the incoming waves and the type of breakwater in order to evaluate the performance of the considered breakwaters in various environmental situations to improve their performance lamanto et al 2017a the field of study covering the hydrodynamic loading on a structure may be considered as a classic topic of fluid dynamics chakrabarti 1994 but the obtained results show that when more than one row array of piles is used the phenomenon becomes complicated since industries have rapidly expanded the research regarding hydrodynamics has attracted considerable attention from various civil engineering fields sumer and fredsøe 2006 briaud et al 2004 for example the river flow around the piers of a bridge which forms scours at bridges built in soil is an important parameter however the related phenomenon is not yet completely understood during the 1970 s significant interest was shown in studying the interactions between waves and breakwater structures hayashi and kano 1966 studied the hydraulic characteristics of a row of cylindrical closely spaced piles as a breakwater both theoretically and experimentally they concluded that the performance of the breakwater decreases with the increase of gaps between the piles later grüne and kohlhase 1974 investigated the wave transmission coefficient for vertical slotted walls as a function of porosity shape of the wall and incident wave direction abdul khader and rai 1981 studied hydraulic aspects of closely spaced piles of diameters 37 8 and 25 1 mm as breakwaters considering parameters such as the gap widths of the piles steepness of waves and relative water depth subba et al 1999 studied the transmission of waves through two rows of perforated hollow piles to investigate the effect of water depth wave steepness the gap between piles and the distance between rows by considering the overlap effect of the piles park et al 2000 developed an analytical model to predict the scattering of irregular waves in interaction with breakwaters including a set of vertical cylinders sundar and subbarao 2003 studied the hydraulic performance of a pile breakwater under laboratory conditions and in the wave flume under regular and irregular wave attacks they reported the wave reflection and transmission coefficients results as a function of the scattering parameter yagci et al 2006 organized an experimental study on a physical model of a pile breakwater consisting of nine piles in two rows under regular and irregular waves koterayama and hu 1995 studied the wave forces on a horizontal cylinder with circular and rectangular cross sections in regular waves and reported that the phenomenon for a rectangular structure are much more complex than the structure with circular cross section venugopal et al 2006 discussed the wave force coefficients for rectangular piles and reported the wave force results measured on a cross section of rectangular piles their work provided a detailed view of the background research as the more important aspect the water flow imposes forces on the structures constructed by civil projects in the fields of hydraulic and coastal engineering lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 for a given rectangular pile both the pile shape confronted with the flow and the width of the pile projection will change with the attack angle as the width of the pile projection changes the effect from the water depth will change the wake region is wider for members with rectangular cross sections compared to cylindrical piles and vortex shedding appears even at very low kc numbers therefore the drag coefficients are larger than those of the cylindrical piles under the same conditions and the force coefficients for this type of structure are much more complicated than those for cylindrical piles because of flow separation on the other hand members with rectangular cross sections are less sensitive to reynolds numbers in steady flows the vortex formation process is relatively uninfluenced by the large reynolds number thus the strouhal number may not undergo large changes with an increasing reynolds number which is in contrast to what occurs for cylindrical piles the precise estimation of structural responses mainly depends on the accuracy of the estimation of hydrodynamic loading and one way to do this is to perform controlled experimental and numerical studies huang and chen 2020 on the other hand it is also expected that these force coefficients in irregular waves will depend on the shape of the spectrum hence for these reasons it will be more appropriate to estimate force coefficients directly from random wave force measurements suh et al 2006 2007 conducted research on the hydrodynamic characteristics of pile supported vertical wall breakwaters with piles with circular and square cross sections under wave impacts in addition the experimental results were compared with the results of a numerical model using the mathematical model zhu 2011 studied the performance of one row of piles against regular waves by using an analytical method and compared the obtained results with the experimental data nejadkazem and gharabaghi 2012 developed a mathematical model to study the performance of vertical cylindrical piles against waves zhu 2013 studied the wave interaction with a vertical row of piles with rectangular cross section utilizing full wave theory the hydraulic performance of a permeable breakwater with two vertical slotted walls against regular waves with different frequencies has been investigated by ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 elbisy et al 2016 and alsaydalani et al 2017 examined the hydrodynamic characteristics of double and triple vertical slotted wall breakwaters both studies show that the proposed mathematical model based on eigen function is capable of predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of double and triple vertical slotted wall breakwaters in their research the authors studied breakwater performance using semi analytical and numerical software yao et al 2018 utilized a three dimensional model based on the vof method to evaluate the hydrodynamic response of two rows of vertical slotted piles subjected to solitary waves lamanto et al 2017b proposed a methodology based on an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm to design of a vertical cellular breakwater consisting of prefabricated rectangular cells with two vertical permeable walls supported by two rows of vertical circular piles the results showed an effective approach for the optimal design of a vertical cellular breakwater vijay et al 2019 developed the numerical and physical model to assess the efficiency of a breakwater system array of slotted vertical barriers by varying environment parameter as wave height and water depth and geometry parameter as porosity and number of slotted barriers jiang et al 2019 used a 3d numerical wave tank based on cfd tools to investigate a row of vertical slotted piles on a sloping beach interaction with a tsunami like solitary wave yao et al 2020 developed the 3d numerical tank and a row of pile to evaluate the effect of wave height water depth piles space on the performance of pile breakwater the piles were loaded under the tsunami like solitary wave various research studies have been conducted to evaluate the hydraulic performance of breakwaters including kakuno and liu 1993 isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim 2011 huang et al 2011 zhu and xie 2015 liu and li 2011 paul and de 2018 lamanto et al 2018 and koley 2019 nevertheless if the same wave is applied to a square or rectangular pile then one would realize the significance and necessity of the tests to be conducted in waves and there have not been many test data available for these piles in wave flow in this research the hydraulic performance including wave reflection energy dissipation transmission and pressure measurements shear stresses flow velocity in line forces and the drag and inertia coefficients of a closely spaced pile breakwater is investigated considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater consists of nine piles in two rows in a configuration to provide effective shore protection as an environmentally friendly coastal structure the considered assumption is based on the fact that spaced pile breakwaters are more capable of maintaining long term coastal balance in addition they are more environmentally friendly than the rubble mound breakwaters the interaction between the incoming waves and the considered breakwaters are studied in order to evaluate and improve the related performance to do this the numerical results are calibrated and validated by experimentation to achieve the best hydraulic design the parameters including the geometry cross sectional shapes as well as the orientation of each pile are investigated in the first step the hydrodynamics around the mono piles with circular and square cross sections are investigated under different states and the results are compared in various conditions the literature indicates that the pressure development over time for bodies with sharp edged cross sections such as the square cross sections of mono piles in this study is much more complex than that for circular cross section piles because of flow separation hence the hydrodynamics around the mono pile with the square cross section is determined in order to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves the parametric equations were estimated to measure the related wave coefficients subsequently the performance of the group piles with different shapes is evaluated by considering the observed consequences with respect to the studied mono piles for this purpose the cases of the piles with square cross sections are considered with measured optimum angles the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity were also considered identical for both circular and square cross sections furthermore the shear stresses around the piles that could relate to the local and global scour around the individual structural elements and beneath the pile breakwater as a full structure are also investigated finally breakwaters with square and circular cross sections are compared in different scenarios and the obtained results are analyzed in the upcoming sections 2 methodology 2 1 model specification instrumentation and experimental setup mono pile with a square cross section a wave flume was constructed in the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz to provide for the generation of any type of regular or irregular sea state the part of the required data for the study of the mono pile with a square cross section was obtained by the tests carried out in this flume for 0 5 and 0 6 m still water depth values this two dimensional flume has been equipped with a hinged flapper type wave maker system its sidewalls have been fabricated using plexiglas sheets for transparency and to ensure smooth surfaces the experimental setup was prepared in a manner to prevent the influence of the pile on the wave as suggested by the available literature hughes 1993 chakrabarti 1994 tafarojnoruz et al 2012 robertson 2016 the middle part of the flume the region of placement of the physical model was made with wide screen pyrex glass to facilitate better visualization the dimensions of the flume are approximately 14 5 m long 1 m deep and 1 2 m wide a sketch of the wave flume including the dimensions is given in fig 1 the wave maker system can generate waves with a wave height starting from 0 02 m and periods ranging from 0 5 to 3 s in a maximum water depth of 0 7 m in the experiment reported in this section the irregular wave train is based on the jonswap spectrum with the peak wave period and significant wave height of 1 66 s and 0 08 m respectively on the other hand physical model testing of wave impact on coastal structures is usually hampered by wave reflection from the opposite end of the flume as the reflected waves return to the wave maker end and also to the in place model they are re reflected which results in an uncontrollable and undesirable nonlinear distortion of the desired waves impinging on the model therefore a mechanism of wave absorption is required and must work in conjunction with the wave maker to eliminate the problem of the re reflection to address the problem a beach composed of a steel frame steel screen a sheet of thick felt and fiber textures almost 3 m long with a slope of approximately 1 10 was constructed at the end of the flume as a wave absorbing beach furthermore a gap of almost 0 4 m was left between the ends of the beach and flume to act as a stilling basin to increase the energy dissipation for the model test to be successful proper attention must be given to the design of the wave absorption system for this purpose the different waves to be used in testing should be generated in the absence of the model and then its performance must be properly evaluated before the model is placed in the flume in this study the method of mansard and funke 1980 was employed to calculate the related reflection coefficient for the mentioned long wave absorbing beach a typical value of 0 06 was measured for its reflection coefficient for the test duration of 180 s fig 2 shows the various parts of the wave absorption system the principle of the wave maker is to measure the waves via wave probes integrated in the paddle front the measured waves are compared online with the specified desired waves the flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz has been equipped with two different kinds of wave gauges both of them are designed and calibrated separately during each experimental scenario to help decide the best testing facility and ensure accuracy of the collected data based on the test repetition and comparison of the gathered data the first type of water meter system is composed of the wave gauge and wave amplifier these probes are able to record the wave height data with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and a resolution accuracy of less than a millimeter the details of the mentioned wave meters and the positioning above the flume are shown in fig 3 the second type of water meter system is the ultrasonic sensor series p47 made by ultraschall sensorik pil co as depicted in fig 4 the specifications of this product are as follows resolution of approximately 0 5 mm response time 120 msec and maximum and minimum sensing distances are 1500 mm and 200 mm respectively the sampling frequency is dependent on where these values lie between the allowed ranges for this study 5 wave probes were placed over the flume to measure the wave profile phase angles and wave reflection and transmission performance before the model was tested the flume was filled with fresh water to the required depth and calibrated to produce the required incident waves the wave probes must be calibrated at the beginning and end of the test runs a general view of the flume and the layout of the instrumentation are shown in fig 5 only the 4 gauges that were used to measured reflection coefficients are sketched in this figure the wave conditions should be assumed the same for each test scenario before placement of the model the generated waves were calibrated in the following manner in this work the wave maker flume was ran for at least 10 min in this regard it is necessary to handle 2 issues of the gathered time series in association with the starting and the end regions of the time series at the beginning of the experiments the expected disturbances would be represented at the recorded time series due to the discordant performance of the electro mechanical facilities at their starting steps hereof the related data was eliminated for first 5 min furthermore some distortions in recorded time series were observed after some while due to harmful effects of the different noises such as the reflected waves which led to instability of the desired wave states consequently the end parts of the data were omitted after observation of the mentioned undesirable records therefore the surface elevation was gathered for 180 s by the wave gauges and the wave data were gathered with a sampling frequency of 20 hz in this regard the comparison of the ratio between the measured wave height and the analyzed wave height with the ratio of the height obtained from the rayleigh distribution were considered as the criteria to show that the sea conditions for the present study were appropriately simulated goda 1985 dean and dalrymple 1991 the sectional dimensions of the physical model of the square cross section pile d were chosen to make the model much smaller than the wave length l to avoid the diffraction effect d l 0 2 in this case the presence of the pile does not influence the wave isaacson 1979 the sufficient small value of the model and flume breadth ratio is the other important consideration in view of elimination of the sidewall effects in our case we considered the keulegan carpenter number as the parameter to judge the effect of wall proximity on flow regime blockage effect based on the results in the related literature sumer and fredsøe 2006 for the conditions of our tests the values of the kc number were estimated somewhere between 2 and 7 in which the value of 0 2 1 22 for the ratio d b the width of the flume is 1 22 m could satisfy the blockage criteria based on these purposes the mono pile was constructed with cross section dimension of 0 2 m the walls of the model were fabricated of 4 mm thick steel plates to impart them with rigidity against the wave impact forces they were sanded to make their surface perfectly smooth the supporting system was designed to allow rotation of the pile around its axis the effect of the angle between the direction of the model and the direction of the waves on the hydrodynamic parameters was examined the same wave condition was repeated for each rotation angle of the pile the position of the in place pile in the flume is shown in fig 6 twelve pressure transducers were mounted rigidly to measure the pressures for this purpose three pressure transducers were fixed on each side of the pile with a center to center spacing of 5 cm for all of the different test scenarios they were mounted near the water surface and also at the level that did not remain out of the water during the passing of the trough in the progressive wave at 0 35 m from the flume bed level the locations of the transducers around the pile are also shown in fig 7 the water pressure acquired using the pressure transmitter model bct 22 series made by atek sensor technologies inc some specifications of this product are as follows measurement range of 0 100 mbar output signal between 4 and 20 m a response time 1 msec and the body composed of stainless steel the transducers were connected to a separate computer via a data logger and the time series of the pressure fluctuations were recorded on this pc system each pressure transducer was assigned a number and the sides of the cylinder were named based on the incident wave direction the instrumentation and related processing software were tuned for the sampling frequency of 20 hz throughout the experiments as the pressure distribution around the model was examined the mean of the highest pressure was found to correspond to p1 20 therefore it was considered to be the representative value the dynamic wave force distribution was calculated for each test by first subtracting the static pressures from the recorded time series of the pressure measured by the transducers then the pressure distribution was calculated by multiplying the pressure recorded around the model with the cosine of the inclination angles of the transducers from the normal axis along the wave direction the value of the dynamic pressure at each point was assumed to be constant over the considered area for the purpose of calculating wave forces the trapezoidal method was used to measure the resultant pressure distribution around the pile yagci et al 2006 the in line dynamic pressure was evaluated for the specific depth and in the partial length of the pile beneath the water surface in spite of the fact that the incident waves were not in breaking form the quantity of dynamic pressure could be measured by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure from the total pressure in the relevant depth the pressure profile around the pile is shown in fig 8 and the in line dynamic pressure on the partial longitudinal is obtained from eq 1 where ɵr is the dynamic pressure angle with the normal axis on the pile according to fig 8 the imposed force on the pile in the partial longitudinal is equal to the summation of the in line components of dynamic wave pressures eq 2 therefore the trapezoidal approximation rule is used to calculate the area below the surface of the in line components of the dynamic wave pressure as shown in fig 8 1 p d x cos θ r p d also vertically distributed in line force along the pile is given by 2 f x z d z π 4 π 4 p d x θ d θ it is necessary to mention here that marine structures must be designed to consider the maximum wave loads that may appear during their lifetime in this context determination of the wave forces that will act on the piles under storm conditions is an important issue for a wave screen the studied breakwater in this work can also be considered a partially immersed caisson supported on a pile system this type of structure consists of two different main parts the bottom portion consists of closely spaced piles and the top portion consists of a caisson face on the seaside which couples the advantages of these two parts huang and chen 2020 an important advantage of this type of structure is that it can be successfully employed for low and moderate wave energy applications for the improvement of performance in the case of storms the functional performance of the caisson at the top part of the breakwater can be consider as the main and efficient part for storm situations of course in this research the performance of the rows of piles is studied for this purpose measurements were taken of the in line dynamic pressure distribution along the piles tilted along the principal wave direction the dynamic pressure distribution around the piles the wave forces acting on the inclined piles using measured dynamic wave pressures and the performance of the piles in terms of wave attenuation therefore to develop the scope of work the efficiency of a caisson being supported on the rows of piles must be studied in the case of storm this practical problem has remained unsolved in this study and must be considered as a topic of future research and the method must be improved through consideration of the caisson part 2 2 theories and numerical analysis of the hydrodynamics around the considered models 2 2 1 governing equations of fluid dynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd simulates flow patterns in an approach in which the standard fluid motion equations are discretized and solved for each computational cell flow science inc 2012 in the present study a general commercial cfd package is used to simulate the wave and pile interactions flow 3d is a powerful cfd based code developed by flow science inc and solves three dimensional navier stokes equations and the continuity equation concurrently this code is adequate for solving a wide range of fluid flow patterns vanneste 2012 which is provided based on the finite differences method in this model finite differences method is used to discretize the governing equations in a cartesian coordinate system the general continuity equation in the tensor notation is in the form of eq 3 3 u i x i 0 where ui is the ith component of the velocity the equation of motion for the incompressible fluids such as water in which ρ is assumed to be constant is expressed as eq 4 4 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j f i where p ρ and υ are fluid pressure density and viscosity respectively fi is a vector representing external forces volume of fluid vof method is applied for modeling the fluid interfaces and free surfaces problems a vof function f represents fluid configurations hirt and nichols 1981 this function represents the volume of fluid per unit volume that shows part of the cell filled by the fluid and satisfies the following equation 5 f t 1 v f x f a x u y f a y v z f a z w f d i f f s o r in cartesian coordinates fdif in eq 5 is defined by eq 6 6 f d i f 1 v f x v f a x f x x v f a y f y z v f a z f z where vf is the fractional volume open to flow ax ay and az are the fractional areas open to flow in the x y and z direction respectively vf cf ν is the diffusion coefficient where cf is a constant coefficient whose reciprocal is referred to as a turbulent schmidt number fsor corresponds to the mass source flow science inc 2012 in the free surface level not all the cells are filled with fluid and the number of cells on the surface of flow is not completely full f varies between zero and unity therefore the computational cell for problems which consider only one fluid is full of fluid if f 1 and is out of fluid if f 0 2 2 2 numerical setup hydrodynamics around mono pile with a square cross section in irregular wave the mono pile with a square cross section was numerically modeled according to the studied physical model with characteristics as mentioned in section 2 1 the density of the elements plays an important role during the numerical analysis process fig 9 compares the water level and total pressure in the same location for the computational domain of numerical wave flume with different grid sizes the results do not show any noticeable changes in the results for the number of cells more than 348480 therefore for this case the numerical results are independent of the mesh size and the rest of the simulations are carried out using 348 480 as a number of cells the rng turbulence model was used to model the turbulence flow the rng model uses equations similar to the k ε model the equation constants are derived explicitly for the rng model while they are found experimentally for the standard k ε model however the rng model includes wider applications than the k ε model moreover previous studies of the hydrodynamics models of the near shore zone and the wave structure interactions show that utilizing the rng turbulence model obtains better predicted results bakhtyar et al 2010 dentale et al 2014 in addition the upstream and downstream boundary conditions were defined as wave and outflow respectively to decrease the effects of the wave reflection through the boundaries the wall boundary and symmetry boundary conditions were determined for the sides bottom and upper surface of the water respectively the defined boundary conditions are shown in fig 10 each experimental procedure was assessed for 180 s and thus the numerical models run for an extended time duration of 190 s considering the time delay of wave propagation between the upstream boundary and location of the pile moreover the surface relative roughness was not considered and the surface condition was modeled as a smooth surface the jonswap spectrum concept was used to produce irregular waves in the unsteady numerical models the time series of the generated waves shown in fig 11 a and b compare the wave spectrums of both numerical and experimental conditions the main hydrodynamic quantities of flow around the piles depend on the reynolds number in the case of oscillatory flows an additional parameter known as keulegan carpenter appears which is defined as eq 7 7 k c 2 σ u t z d where tz is the mean zero up crossing period of the random motion σu is the root mean square value of the velocity u and d is the dimension of the pile normal to the wave crest chakrabarti 1987 the morison s equation for a vertical pile includes the drag and the inertia components of the force as defined in eq 8 8 f t 1 2 ρ c d a d u t u t ρ c m a i u t t in the above equation f is the force per unit length of the vertical pile cd and cm are the drag and inertia coefficient respectively ad is the pile section ai is the cross sectional area of the pile and u is the horizontal particle fluid velocity in this study a method known as the least square method is used to obtain the inertia force coefficient based on eq

measured for different values of the kc number of course most of the past research into hydrodynamic loading on ocean structures has concentrated on circular cross section members the notable research investigations carried out on circular square flat plate sections are by bearman et al 1979 1984 tanaka et al 1982 ikeda et al 1988a b arai 1993 1995 chaplin and retzler 1992 and koterayama and hu 1995 ikeda et al 1988a carried out experiments on circular flat plate square and diamond sections horizontally submerged in regular waves at low kc numbers and found that for a flat plate cd and cm measured in waves were lower than those measured in oscillatory flow by tanaka et al 1982 table 1 illustrates the results of the kc number drag and inertia coefficients for the numerical and experimental procedures the numerical and laboratory results are determined in both 0 50 and 0 60 m water depth while the rotating angle of the pile around the y axial is zero ζ ψ 0 the observed results show a reasonable agreement among the analyses despite the above mentioned facts about the piles with rectangular cross sections the relations between force coefficients and kc number can be in the relative same order for both circular and rectangular piles with comparable dimensions a comparison between the reported values of the cases from various references e g sumer and fredsøe 2006 and the ones in table 1 shows an acceptable range for the measured values of this study 2 2 3 numerical setup hydrodynamics around nine pile breakwater in regular and irregular waves the hydrodynamic performance of a closely spaced pile breakwater is investigated considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater is composed of nine piles as shown in fig 12 the parameters including the cross sectional shape are investigated in a pile group using the numerical models for this purpose the hydrodynamics around the mono piles is investigated for the circular and square cross sections the results of the study by yagci et al 2006 are used to calibrate and validate the prepared numerical model of the breakwater with circular cross sections these results are considered for this study because of the accuracy and completeness of the data which were measured by various instruments such as the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv finally the performance of the group piles with different cross sectional shapes will be evaluated by the validated model in the next sections based on the fact that the topology and geometric characteristics can be considered as one of the most significant parameters for the dissipated wave energy by the breakwater it is reasonable to generalize the results for the mono pile cases in most optimum cross sectional shapes and the orientation to investigate the best performance of the pile breakwater the rng turbulence model and the same boundary conditions were used to model the flow such as the considerations of the studied mono pile in section 2 2 3 as mentioned the scope of this work focuses on 2 successive steps including firstly the investigation of hydrodynamic performance of the solitary pile and secondly a pile breakwater as a full structure in this regard the numerical models are validated based on the experimental results gained in 2 different wave maker flumes in the first step for the study of the hydrodynamics around the mono pile the part of the required data was gathered by the tests that were carried out in the wave flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz in which the waves can be generated by the wave spectra appropriate for the jonswap and pierson and moskowitz pm spectrum here the jownswap spectrum was determined to be more appropriate to recognize the considered performance of the mono pile because of its pronounced peak for the second step the results were considered based on an implemented test in the hydraulics laboratory of istanbul technical university yagci et al 2006 where they evaluated the prepared numerical model of the breakwater in the related flume the waves were generated by a computer controlled wave maker which is capable of generating irregular waves displaying the pm wave spectrum furthermore the pm spectrum could be considered the more suitable case for water waves travelling in a limited region and shallower water therefore here the concept of pm spectrum is applied to produce irregular waves the defined boundary conditions are shown in fig 13 b in addition it can be inferred from fig 13 a that the numerical results are independent of mesh size for 324000 cells to obtain the best hydraulic design the different cross sectional shapes were investigated under different wave conditions and the results in each case were compared to those of other cases for this purpose the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity ratio of the gap between the piles to their equal diameters were considered the same for both circular and square cross sections as 0 175 the characteristics of the considered generated waves are shown in table 2 3 results and discussion protection of the coastal environment from the disturbances due to incoming waves is a basic requirement for engineering applications in certain circumstances it may not be possible to apply rubble mound breakwaters in shore protection due to technical economic and environmental limitations in such cases pile breakwaters may be used as an alternative a sharp edged structure with square or rectangular cross sections is a common shape that is used to make some of the structural members of hydraulic and marine structures however most of the past research has concentrated on members with circular cross sections and relatively limited work has been carried out on such cross sections an accurate estimation of the hydrodynamic forces is required to determine the best pile geometries lotfollahi yaghin et al 2012 in the present study an investigation on a model of a pile type breakwater is carried out the different hydrodynamic characteristics exerted on the model are reported detailed program was carried out to measure the transmission characteristics of the breakwater model it is observed that the energy of the waves is dissipated more effectively if the configuration of the piles between the rows would be designed in an optimum location an illustrated discussion of the related results is given in the following sections 3 1 validation and evaluation of numerical model of a nine pile breakwater using the experimental results the prepared numerical model of the nine pile breakwater was validated using the experimental data collected by yagci et al 2006 in fig 14 the results of the water particle velocities are compared for both the numerical and empirical conditions the related experimental data were obtained for the breakwater model in a regular wave with a height of 0 166 m and a period of 1 2 s the results were measured at a level of 0 45 m distance from the bottom of the flume along the x coordinate the direction of the wave propagation and the z coordinate the direction of the water level fluctuations fig 14 illustrates a reasonable agreement between the experimental and numerical results fig 15 depicts the velocity profiles in different water depths for both the numerical and experimental procedures fig 15 a shows the results for the incident wave at the front of the breakwater the results shown as velocity were measured by taking the average of the 30 percent of the highest values of fluid particle velocities fig 15 b presents the same results for the transmission wave although it shows some scatter in the experimental results overall there is a reasonable agreement between the experiments and the numerical modeling meanwhile a comparison among the velocities close to the bed seaward and landward of the breakwater structures indicates that the structure of breakwaters has the least interference on the bed this can be used to construct environmentally friendly structures considering the subsequent minimal effects on the seabed creatures the mean error value using rmse formula between the numerical and experimental results of the water particle velocities along x and z coordinates are 0 09 and 0 06 respectively in addition the errors in fig 15 a and b are 0 15 and 0 1 respectively fig 16 shows the variation of the wave transmission coefficient parameter related to the regular wave the comparison between the numerical and experimental results shows 7 percent scatter among the results furthermore it can be concluded that the performance of the breakwater will increase with the decrease of the wave period fig 17 shows a comparison between the numerical and experimental results of the vertical allocation for the in line dynamic pressures caused by irregular waves the results of the in line dynamic pressures were measured by averaging among 5 percent of the highest values of dynamic pressure at different moments the irregular waves were generated based on the pm spectrum with the peak wave period and significant wave height of 1 67 s and 0 12 m respectively the rmse between the numerical and experimental results is 0 33 despite a noticeable difference between the observed results for the depth of 0 02 m the numerical outputs generally have a satisfactory agreement with the laboratory results 3 2 evaluation of the performance of the mono piles the performance of the mono piles with square and circular cross sections was investigated under the irregular waves the characteristics of the incident waves were considered using the details mentioned in table 2 the method of mansard and funk 1980 was employed to calculate the reflection coefficients table 3 compares the results for the piles with square and circular cross sections table 3 implies that the reflection coefficient for the square cross section pile is higher than the cylindrical one by approximately 2 5 percent on the other hand it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in incident wave spectrum energy increases of wave height 3 3 effect of the orientation of the square cross section pile against the incident waves the shear stresses around the piles with respect to the local and global scour the inline wave force and wave force coefficient and wave reflection coefficient were investigated to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves to achieve this aim the angles of piles around the y and z coordinates are nominated as ζ and ψ respectively fig 18 3 3 1 evaluation of the bed shear stress and the wave conditions fig 19 shows the bed shear stress distribution adjacent to the mono pile with square cross section in the considered irregular wave condition in the related figures the x and y axes were considered along the incoming waves and in the width direction of the flume respectively the shear stresses are shown in the form of the amplification factor τ τ along the width of the flume here τ is the mean bed shear stress in the presence of the pile and τ is the maximum value of the undisturbed mean bed shear stress as shown in fig 19 bed shear stress decreases by increasing the angle of ζ in each case furthermore the peaks of the related curves shift from the middle part of the pile toward its one side by changing the angle of ψ the maximum bed shear stresses around the mono pile were also measured under certain regular wave conditions as a function of the kc numbers the considered periods and wave heights ranged between 1 2 and 2 5 s and 0 10 0 20 m respectively and the related measured kc numbers are shown in the x axis of fig 20 it can be observed from the results that the maximum shear amplification factor gradually increases as the kc number is increased and attains a value of about 3 at kc 4 5 from this kc number throughout the considered range it remains practically almost constant at a factor of 3 namely at a value of 3 times more than the undisturbed bed shear stress for low kc numbers it is clear that because of the interference of the flows around individual pile members the resulting scour picture in the case of pile groups may differ significantly from that occurring around a single pile sumer and fredsøe 2002 therefore in the case of scouring the results obtained for the solitary piles are not in a simple and proportional relation with the ones from a group of piles in a way that cannot be generalized to the pile breakwater as a structure 3 3 2 evaluation of the force coefficients and the wave conditions the characteristics of drag and inertia coefficients for the vertical pile with square cross section in regular waves are illustrated in fig 21 for the various angles of attack ψ 0 to ψ 45 in general the drag coefficients decrease with an increase in kc the results show that the larger values of drag coefficient occur at lower kc numbers and decreases with an increase in kc numbers furthermore the values of cm are slightly larger for low kc numbers indeed the inertia coefficient does not change significantly when kc 5 moreover the results show that the pile with a zero angle of attack generally had the highest drag and inertia coefficient especially compared to the models with a 45 attack angle furthermore the wave load action on the piles was investigated for the mono pile wave forces are due to the wave induced dynamic pressure which is scaled by γa where γ is the specific weight of water and a is wave amplitude the wave in line force per unit length of pile f is normalized in each depth by 0 5γdehs where de is the equivalent diameter of the pile considering various angles of attack fig 22 shows the dimensionless in line wave force changes along the pile as shown in fig 22 dimensionless in line wave force is inversely proportional to z d where z is the position of force measurement and d is the still water depth moreover the dimensionless in line wave force decreases by increasing the ψ meanwhile by comparing dimensionless in line wave force results in various ζ it could be concluded that ζ does not have much effect on the wave force although the wave forces increase slightly by increasing the ζ 3 3 3 development of the equations for the pile based on the orientation against the incident waves the parametric models and equations can be used to investigating the random uncertainties for marine structures mojtahedi et al 2018 in this study the wave reflection coefficients for the mono pile with the square cross section were determined using the validated numerical model the corresponding results are presented in table 4 the numerical model was run for almost 50 conditions and the obtained numerical results were used for estimation of eqs 10 and 11 which obtained by non linear fitting on the measured values to evaluate the wave reflection coefficient of considered piles during the post processing of the required data for the fitting procedure the numerical measured sparse data which was considerably out of the observed linear average were discard to gain more accurate equation to predict the coefficients the marked houses in table 4 are related to the omitted data which were not bring to the table eqs 10 and 11 are valid for the range of 0 ζ 10 and ζ 10 respectively the ζ and ψ in the eqs 10 and 11 are in radian unit these equations were obtained using the coefficient of determinations 0 92 and 0 94 respectively fig 23 illustrates the scattering graph of the results for both the numerical and statistical models finally the measured statistical equations were used to estimate the optimal conditions 10 k r 1 0 012 sin 6 755 ψ ζ 2 843 0 001 ψ ζ 0 028 ζ ψ 0 202 eq 10 is measured for the range of 0 ζ 10 0 rad ζ 0 1745 rad 11 k r 2 0 357 cos 0 885 ψ ζ 0 957 0 013 sin 5 711 ψ ζ 1 6 0 274 ψ ζ eq 11 is measured for ζ 10 ζ 0 1745 rad values of 12 ψ 17 and ζ 15 can be considered as the optimum angles for the performance of piles under study of course it is necessary to mention that the equations are fitted on the results obtained by a deterministic model and not the probabilistic one while in view of the unexpected aspects arising from the marine environment there are numerous uncertainty parameters which can influence the accuracy of the methods which employ the deterministic model concepts these uncertainties have a great effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of the structures and many practical problems caused by various types of uncertainty make it a complicated issue however in situations where we can trust that a numerical model can give reliable results with engineering accuracy it can be the tool of choice of course numerical modeling should be calibrated through experimental work but after that it can provide more insight into the subject in this regard we report the values via the statistical equations achieving almost 90 percent reliability which can be considered acceptable for engineering purposes and the remained 10 percent can be allocated to unavoidable uncertainties 3 4 performance of the nine pile breakwater with different shapes of piles the nine pile breakwater mentioned in section 2 2 3 was modeled in regular and irregular wave states to investigate the best performance of the breakwater with consideration of different pile shapes to do this the piles with square cross sections were considered with measured optimum angles the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity ratio of the gap between the piles to their equal diameters were considered the same for both circular and square cross sections as 0 175 the results of pile breakwater performance are presented as follows 3 4 1 evaluation of the bed shear stress and the wave conditions around the middle pile fig 24 depicts the behavior of the bed shear stress amplification around the middle pile of the studied pile breakwater along the x axis the results are measured in 4 different conditions of irregular waves as defined in table 2 and in 4 scenarios including 1 piles with a circular cross section ζ 11 2 piles with a square cross section ζ 11 and ψ 0 3 piles with a square cross section and optimum angle of reflection ζ 10 and ψ 12 and 4 piles with a square cross section and optimum angle of reflection ζ 15 and ψ 17 fig 24 shows the increases in bed shear stress amplification in proximity to the pile it is also implied that the bed shear stresses are slightly higher for the piles with square cross sections than ones with circular cross sections it is necessary to mention that there is a considerable difference between the observed results of this study and the results in the related literature regarding the physical models with similar geometric scale but located at the steady current such as sumer et al 1995 while in the wave conditions of this study the maximum amplification factor increases only to somewhere between 2 and 3 but this value may even increase to a value of 12 in steady current this result could be related to differences between steady and surface fluctuating flow the experimental tests of this study were carried out in a flume equipped with a hinged flapper type wave maker system in this case the particle orbit geometries of the propagated waves are approximately in a circular form throughout the water column and decrease in diameter with increasing distance below the water surface and almost die out over the bottom and the orbits do not affect the bottom therefore the effects of bottom shear stress can be expected to be less efficient based on the mentioned concepts 3 4 2 evaluation of the force coefficients and the wave conditions around the middle pile fig 25 shows the force coefficient related to the middle pile of the pile breakwater mentioned above there are 4 scenarios of pile shapes and in regular and irregular waves as shown in fig 25 the force coefficients of piles with a circular cross section are less than piles with a square cross section moreover the force coefficients for piles with a square cross section and optimum angle in reflection are generally less than piles with a square cross section ζ 11 and ψ 0 fig 26 compares the dimensionless in line wave force changes along the middle pile of the breakwaters in the above mentioned 4 scenarios the results indicate that dimensionless in line wave force for the breakwater with piles with a circular cross section is less than the breakwater with piles with a square cross section however the dimensionless in line wave force of the square cross section is slightly higher than the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles furthermore results show that by increasing the energy of incoming wave spectrum the dimensionless in line wave force increases 3 4 3 evaluation of the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients against the incident waves fig 27 compares the obtained results of wave reflection transmission and energy loss coefficient for the breakwaters with square and circular cross sections in the 4 different scenarios energy dissipation of the breakwater is investigated using the following equation isaacson et al 1998 12 k e 1 k r 2 k t 2 where kt is the transmission coefficient kr is the reflection coefficient and ke is the energy loss coefficient based on the description of the energy dissipation in eq 12 this parameter should not be considered as a comparable factor for the hydraulic performance of considered breakwaters in this study the characteristics of the considered generated waves were also similar to the parameters shown in table 2 that were used to generate them as shown in fig 27 the reflection coefficients decrease and transmission coefficients increase with the increase of the wave spectrum energy however the energy dissipation coefficient does not change noticeably with the increase of the spectrum energy the reflection coefficients decrease with the increase of the spectrum energy of the incident waves as shown in fig 27 considering all 4 mentioned scenarios the wave reflection coefficient is maximum for breakwater in the wave with the spectrum number 1 as shown in table 2 and the wave reflection coefficient is minimum for the wave with the spectrum number 4 furthermore the wave reflection coefficients decrease in a similar trend for all scenarios and therefore the trends are independent of the shapes by comparing all cases of the piles with square cross sections the reflection coefficient was found to be larger for the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles furthermore the shape of the pile can be considered to be another challenge because it can strongly affect the flow pattern around its structure the attack angle of the flow can be considered as an important factor for a pile with square or rectangular cross sections and in this case the problem becomes more complicated however sharp edged pile structures have long been considered a common shape and used to make some of the structural members used in hydraulic and marine engineering in this regard an accurate estimation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on these piles is required to determine the best geometries for the case of practical engineering the benefits of these kinds of piles can be used by locating a breakwater at an optimum angle according to the estimated dominant wave direction furthermore as most of the past research has focused on the members with circular cross sections and not members with square or rectangular cross sections this manuscript can be considered an attempt to investigate the idea of using this kind of pile in construction of the pile breakwater studies regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using them would be useful and can be considered as another possible subject for future research 4 conclusions this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance of a type of closely spaced pile breakwater considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater consists of nine piles in 2 rows in a configuration to provide effective shore protection as an environmentally friendly coastal structure the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the performance of the mono pile with square and circular cross sections was compared under irregular waves and the reflection coefficients were calculated the results imply that in this case the reflection coefficient for the square cross section pile is higher than the cylindrical one in addition it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases with the increase of incident wave spectrum energy but the wave reflection coefficients decrease following a similar trend for all scenarios and are independent of the shapes 2 meanwhile the wave reflection coefficients for the mono pile with the square cross section were determined in order to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves the parametric equations were estimated by non linear fitting on the measured values to measure the wave reflection coefficient values of 12 ψ 17 and ζ 15 are assessed as the optimum angles for the performance of the considered pile where ζ and ψ are angles of the piles around the defined y and z coordinates respectively 3 the bed shear stress distributions were also evaluated adjacent to the mono piles in considered irregular wave conditions they were estimated in the form of the amplification factors results show that bed shear stress decreases with increasing the angle of ζ in each case the peaks of the related curves shift from the middle part of the pile toward its one side by changing the angle of ψ 4 the maximum bed shear stresses around the mono pile were measured as a function of the kc numbers it is observed that the maximum shear amplification factor gradually increases as the kc number is increased and attains a value of about 3 at kc 4 5 from this kc number throughout the considered range it remains practically almost constant at a factor of 3 5 the characteristics of drag and inertia coefficients for the pile with square cross sections in regular waves were investigated for various angles of attack ψ 0 to ψ 45 the results demonstrate that the inertia coefficient does not change significantly for the considered range of the kc number the results show that the pile with a zero angle of attack generally had the highest drag and inertia coefficient especially compared to the models with 45 attack angle 6 the nine pile breakwater was considered to investigate the best performance of the breakwater with respect to different pile shapes to do this piles with square cross sections were considered with measured optimum angles the behavior of the bed shear stress amplification around the middle pile of the studied pile breakwater was also investigated results show the increases in the bed shear stress amplification in proximity to the pile they also imply that the bed shear stresses are slightly higher for the piles with square cross sections than ones with circular cross sections 7 a considerable difference was observed between the obtained results of this study and the results in the related literature with respect to the physical models with similar geometric scale but located in steady current while in the wave condition of this study the maximum amplification factor increases only to somewhere between 2 and 3 this value even may increase to a value of 12 in steady current this result could be related to differences between steady and surface fluctuating flow in the second case the particle orbit geometries of the propagated waves are approximately in a circular form throughout the water column and decrease in diameter with increasing distance below the water surface and almost die out over the bottom and the orbits do not affect the bottom 8 by comparison of all cases with square cross section piles it is observed that the reflection coefficient is higher for the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles the obtained results demonstrate that the piles with the square cross section in optimum conditions have at least 7 percent even to a maximum of 30 percent higher reflections than other considered conditions with mild and short waves it can be related to the effect of the piles edges on the separation process of the flow credit authorship contribution statement

21411,in this paper a type of pile breakwater is studied in a configuration that can provide an effective shore protection structure while the rubble mound breakwaters are the most common type but they suffer from a number of shortcomings including the interruption of water that may lead to deterioration of water quality and corresponding environmental problems the breakwater of this study with rows of piles can be used against sea waves as an alternative its hydraulic performance including wave reflection and transmission shear stresses pressure measurements drag and inertia coefficients are investigated in the first step the hydrodynamics around the mono piles with square cross sections are inspected the parametric equations are developed to measure the optimal orientation of the piles as evidenced in the literature relatively limited works have been carried out on this kind of piles also the performance of the considered pile breakwaters are evaluated to do this the numerical results are calibrated and validated by experimentation it is observed that the group piles with the square cross section in optimum conditions could have a higher value of reflection almost between 7 even to almost 30 percent than other considered conditions with mild and short waves it can be related to the effect of the square piles edges on the separation process of the flow keywords pile breakwater square cross section pile environmentally friendly wave generating system numerical model 1 introduction coasts are constantly exposed to wave attacks and reflected energies that lead to scour and coastline changes over time therefore the construction of structures and facilities in the coastal areas without any protective considerations would be practically impossible breakwaters are structures constructed on coasts as part of the coastal defense to protect the coasts from the effects of wave attack one of the most common types of breakwater is the rubble mound breakwater such wave breakers are able to protect the coastal areas completely however in many cases in order to protect the facilities built on the coast it may be required to not fully but rather partially dissipate the waves hitting the coast thus the construction of such breakwater structures is not always necessary to protect the coast construction of rubble mound breakwaters by interrupting flow and movement of water in addition to high construction costs pose environmental problems for this purpose slot breakwaters such as pile breakwaters with one or more rows of piles can be used against the sea waves in the near shore zone there are particular applications in which pile breakwaters are preferable over rubble mound breakwaters the pile breakwater is a more recent development and the important advantages of this type include lower maintenance costs ease of construction greater stability against sliding and an enhanced appearance today such breakwaters exist in different areas across the world they allow the free passage of sediments that leads to reduced shoreline erosion in this case it can be considered as the most suitable option for poor soils and conditions that lack a rocky bottom several cases worldwide have clearly demonstrated this phenomenon among similar breakwaters constructed all over the world the steel pile breakwater at the port of osaka the concrete pile breakwater at pass christian bay the steel pile breakwater at pelangi beach resort langkawi the curtain wall pile breakwater at the port of yeoho and the pile supported breakwaters at hanstholm can be mentioned liu et al 2011 this kind of breakwater can dissipate a major portion of the incident wave energy when the wave hits the breakwater a part of the wave is reflected while other parts are transmitted and propagated towards the coastline in addition these breakwaters reduce some aspects of pollution in the shore area by allowing water exchange roy et al 2019 consequently it is necessary to study the interaction between the incoming waves and the type of breakwater in order to evaluate the performance of the considered breakwaters in various environmental situations to improve their performance lamanto et al 2017a the field of study covering the hydrodynamic loading on a structure may be considered as a classic topic of fluid dynamics chakrabarti 1994 but the obtained results show that when more than one row array of piles is used the phenomenon becomes complicated since industries have rapidly expanded the research regarding hydrodynamics has attracted considerable attention from various civil engineering fields sumer and fredsøe 2006 briaud et al 2004 for example the river flow around the piers of a bridge which forms scours at bridges built in soil is an important parameter however the related phenomenon is not yet completely understood during the 1970 s significant interest was shown in studying the interactions between waves and breakwater structures hayashi and kano 1966 studied the hydraulic characteristics of a row of cylindrical closely spaced piles as a breakwater both theoretically and experimentally they concluded that the performance of the breakwater decreases with the increase of gaps between the piles later grüne and kohlhase 1974 investigated the wave transmission coefficient for vertical slotted walls as a function of porosity shape of the wall and incident wave direction abdul khader and rai 1981 studied hydraulic aspects of closely spaced piles of diameters 37 8 and 25 1 mm as breakwaters considering parameters such as the gap widths of the piles steepness of waves and relative water depth subba et al 1999 studied the transmission of waves through two rows of perforated hollow piles to investigate the effect of water depth wave steepness the gap between piles and the distance between rows by considering the overlap effect of the piles park et al 2000 developed an analytical model to predict the scattering of irregular waves in interaction with breakwaters including a set of vertical cylinders sundar and subbarao 2003 studied the hydraulic performance of a pile breakwater under laboratory conditions and in the wave flume under regular and irregular wave attacks they reported the wave reflection and transmission coefficients results as a function of the scattering parameter yagci et al 2006 organized an experimental study on a physical model of a pile breakwater consisting of nine piles in two rows under regular and irregular waves koterayama and hu 1995 studied the wave forces on a horizontal cylinder with circular and rectangular cross sections in regular waves and reported that the phenomenon for a rectangular structure are much more complex than the structure with circular cross section venugopal et al 2006 discussed the wave force coefficients for rectangular piles and reported the wave force results measured on a cross section of rectangular piles their work provided a detailed view of the background research as the more important aspect the water flow imposes forces on the structures constructed by civil projects in the fields of hydraulic and coastal engineering lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 for a given rectangular pile both the pile shape confronted with the flow and the width of the pile projection will change with the attack angle as the width of the pile projection changes the effect from the water depth will change the wake region is wider for members with rectangular cross sections compared to cylindrical piles and vortex shedding appears even at very low kc numbers therefore the drag coefficients are larger than those of the cylindrical piles under the same conditions and the force coefficients for this type of structure are much more complicated than those for cylindrical piles because of flow separation on the other hand members with rectangular cross sections are less sensitive to reynolds numbers in steady flows the vortex formation process is relatively uninfluenced by the large reynolds number thus the strouhal number may not undergo large changes with an increasing reynolds number which is in contrast to what occurs for cylindrical piles the precise estimation of structural responses mainly depends on the accuracy of the estimation of hydrodynamic loading and one way to do this is to perform controlled experimental and numerical studies huang and chen 2020 on the other hand it is also expected that these force coefficients in irregular waves will depend on the shape of the spectrum hence for these reasons it will be more appropriate to estimate force coefficients directly from random wave force measurements suh et al 2006 2007 conducted research on the hydrodynamic characteristics of pile supported vertical wall breakwaters with piles with circular and square cross sections under wave impacts in addition the experimental results were compared with the results of a numerical model using the mathematical model zhu 2011 studied the performance of one row of piles against regular waves by using an analytical method and compared the obtained results with the experimental data nejadkazem and gharabaghi 2012 developed a mathematical model to study the performance of vertical cylindrical piles against waves zhu 2013 studied the wave interaction with a vertical row of piles with rectangular cross section utilizing full wave theory the hydraulic performance of a permeable breakwater with two vertical slotted walls against regular waves with different frequencies has been investigated by ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 elbisy et al 2016 and alsaydalani et al 2017 examined the hydrodynamic characteristics of double and triple vertical slotted wall breakwaters both studies show that the proposed mathematical model based on eigen function is capable of predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of double and triple vertical slotted wall breakwaters in their research the authors studied breakwater performance using semi analytical and numerical software yao et al 2018 utilized a three dimensional model based on the vof method to evaluate the hydrodynamic response of two rows of vertical slotted piles subjected to solitary waves lamanto et al 2017b proposed a methodology based on an optimization tool based on genetic algorithm to design of a vertical cellular breakwater consisting of prefabricated rectangular cells with two vertical permeable walls supported by two rows of vertical circular piles the results showed an effective approach for the optimal design of a vertical cellular breakwater vijay et al 2019 developed the numerical and physical model to assess the efficiency of a breakwater system array of slotted vertical barriers by varying environment parameter as wave height and water depth and geometry parameter as porosity and number of slotted barriers jiang et al 2019 used a 3d numerical wave tank based on cfd tools to investigate a row of vertical slotted piles on a sloping beach interaction with a tsunami like solitary wave yao et al 2020 developed the 3d numerical tank and a row of pile to evaluate the effect of wave height water depth piles space on the performance of pile breakwater the piles were loaded under the tsunami like solitary wave various research studies have been conducted to evaluate the hydraulic performance of breakwaters including kakuno and liu 1993 isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim 2011 huang et al 2011 zhu and xie 2015 liu and li 2011 paul and de 2018 lamanto et al 2018 and koley 2019 nevertheless if the same wave is applied to a square or rectangular pile then one would realize the significance and necessity of the tests to be conducted in waves and there have not been many test data available for these piles in wave flow in this research the hydraulic performance including wave reflection energy dissipation transmission and pressure measurements shear stresses flow velocity in line forces and the drag and inertia coefficients of a closely spaced pile breakwater is investigated considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater consists of nine piles in two rows in a configuration to provide effective shore protection as an environmentally friendly coastal structure the considered assumption is based on the fact that spaced pile breakwaters are more capable of maintaining long term coastal balance in addition they are more environmentally friendly than the rubble mound breakwaters the interaction between the incoming waves and the considered breakwaters are studied in order to evaluate and improve the related performance to do this the numerical results are calibrated and validated by experimentation to achieve the best hydraulic design the parameters including the geometry cross sectional shapes as well as the orientation of each pile are investigated in the first step the hydrodynamics around the mono piles with circular and square cross sections are investigated under different states and the results are compared in various conditions the literature indicates that the pressure development over time for bodies with sharp edged cross sections such as the square cross sections of mono piles in this study is much more complex than that for circular cross section piles because of flow separation hence the hydrodynamics around the mono pile with the square cross section is determined in order to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves the parametric equations were estimated to measure the related wave coefficients subsequently the performance of the group piles with different shapes is evaluated by considering the observed consequences with respect to the studied mono piles for this purpose the cases of the piles with square cross sections are considered with measured optimum angles the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity were also considered identical for both circular and square cross sections furthermore the shear stresses around the piles that could relate to the local and global scour around the individual structural elements and beneath the pile breakwater as a full structure are also investigated finally breakwaters with square and circular cross sections are compared in different scenarios and the obtained results are analyzed in the upcoming sections 2 methodology 2 1 model specification instrumentation and experimental setup mono pile with a square cross section a wave flume was constructed in the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz to provide for the generation of any type of regular or irregular sea state the part of the required data for the study of the mono pile with a square cross section was obtained by the tests carried out in this flume for 0 5 and 0 6 m still water depth values this two dimensional flume has been equipped with a hinged flapper type wave maker system its sidewalls have been fabricated using plexiglas sheets for transparency and to ensure smooth surfaces the experimental setup was prepared in a manner to prevent the influence of the pile on the wave as suggested by the available literature hughes 1993 chakrabarti 1994 tafarojnoruz et al 2012 robertson 2016 the middle part of the flume the region of placement of the physical model was made with wide screen pyrex glass to facilitate better visualization the dimensions of the flume are approximately 14 5 m long 1 m deep and 1 2 m wide a sketch of the wave flume including the dimensions is given in fig 1 the wave maker system can generate waves with a wave height starting from 0 02 m and periods ranging from 0 5 to 3 s in a maximum water depth of 0 7 m in the experiment reported in this section the irregular wave train is based on the jonswap spectrum with the peak wave period and significant wave height of 1 66 s and 0 08 m respectively on the other hand physical model testing of wave impact on coastal structures is usually hampered by wave reflection from the opposite end of the flume as the reflected waves return to the wave maker end and also to the in place model they are re reflected which results in an uncontrollable and undesirable nonlinear distortion of the desired waves impinging on the model therefore a mechanism of wave absorption is required and must work in conjunction with the wave maker to eliminate the problem of the re reflection to address the problem a beach composed of a steel frame steel screen a sheet of thick felt and fiber textures almost 3 m long with a slope of approximately 1 10 was constructed at the end of the flume as a wave absorbing beach furthermore a gap of almost 0 4 m was left between the ends of the beach and flume to act as a stilling basin to increase the energy dissipation for the model test to be successful proper attention must be given to the design of the wave absorption system for this purpose the different waves to be used in testing should be generated in the absence of the model and then its performance must be properly evaluated before the model is placed in the flume in this study the method of mansard and funke 1980 was employed to calculate the related reflection coefficient for the mentioned long wave absorbing beach a typical value of 0 06 was measured for its reflection coefficient for the test duration of 180 s fig 2 shows the various parts of the wave absorption system the principle of the wave maker is to measure the waves via wave probes integrated in the paddle front the measured waves are compared online with the specified desired waves the flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz has been equipped with two different kinds of wave gauges both of them are designed and calibrated separately during each experimental scenario to help decide the best testing facility and ensure accuracy of the collected data based on the test repetition and comparison of the gathered data the first type of water meter system is composed of the wave gauge and wave amplifier these probes are able to record the wave height data with a sampling frequency of 20 hz and a resolution accuracy of less than a millimeter the details of the mentioned wave meters and the positioning above the flume are shown in fig 3 the second type of water meter system is the ultrasonic sensor series p47 made by ultraschall sensorik pil co as depicted in fig 4 the specifications of this product are as follows resolution of approximately 0 5 mm response time 120 msec and maximum and minimum sensing distances are 1500 mm and 200 mm respectively the sampling frequency is dependent on where these values lie between the allowed ranges for this study 5 wave probes were placed over the flume to measure the wave profile phase angles and wave reflection and transmission performance before the model was tested the flume was filled with fresh water to the required depth and calibrated to produce the required incident waves the wave probes must be calibrated at the beginning and end of the test runs a general view of the flume and the layout of the instrumentation are shown in fig 5 only the 4 gauges that were used to measured reflection coefficients are sketched in this figure the wave conditions should be assumed the same for each test scenario before placement of the model the generated waves were calibrated in the following manner in this work the wave maker flume was ran for at least 10 min in this regard it is necessary to handle 2 issues of the gathered time series in association with the starting and the end regions of the time series at the beginning of the experiments the expected disturbances would be represented at the recorded time series due to the discordant performance of the electro mechanical facilities at their starting steps hereof the related data was eliminated for first 5 min furthermore some distortions in recorded time series were observed after some while due to harmful effects of the different noises such as the reflected waves which led to instability of the desired wave states consequently the end parts of the data were omitted after observation of the mentioned undesirable records therefore the surface elevation was gathered for 180 s by the wave gauges and the wave data were gathered with a sampling frequency of 20 hz in this regard the comparison of the ratio between the measured wave height and the analyzed wave height with the ratio of the height obtained from the rayleigh distribution were considered as the criteria to show that the sea conditions for the present study were appropriately simulated goda 1985 dean and dalrymple 1991 the sectional dimensions of the physical model of the square cross section pile d were chosen to make the model much smaller than the wave length l to avoid the diffraction effect d l 0 2 in this case the presence of the pile does not influence the wave isaacson 1979 the sufficient small value of the model and flume breadth ratio is the other important consideration in view of elimination of the sidewall effects in our case we considered the keulegan carpenter number as the parameter to judge the effect of wall proximity on flow regime blockage effect based on the results in the related literature sumer and fredsøe 2006 for the conditions of our tests the values of the kc number were estimated somewhere between 2 and 7 in which the value of 0 2 1 22 for the ratio d b the width of the flume is 1 22 m could satisfy the blockage criteria based on these purposes the mono pile was constructed with cross section dimension of 0 2 m the walls of the model were fabricated of 4 mm thick steel plates to impart them with rigidity against the wave impact forces they were sanded to make their surface perfectly smooth the supporting system was designed to allow rotation of the pile around its axis the effect of the angle between the direction of the model and the direction of the waves on the hydrodynamic parameters was examined the same wave condition was repeated for each rotation angle of the pile the position of the in place pile in the flume is shown in fig 6 twelve pressure transducers were mounted rigidly to measure the pressures for this purpose three pressure transducers were fixed on each side of the pile with a center to center spacing of 5 cm for all of the different test scenarios they were mounted near the water surface and also at the level that did not remain out of the water during the passing of the trough in the progressive wave at 0 35 m from the flume bed level the locations of the transducers around the pile are also shown in fig 7 the water pressure acquired using the pressure transmitter model bct 22 series made by atek sensor technologies inc some specifications of this product are as follows measurement range of 0 100 mbar output signal between 4 and 20 m a response time 1 msec and the body composed of stainless steel the transducers were connected to a separate computer via a data logger and the time series of the pressure fluctuations were recorded on this pc system each pressure transducer was assigned a number and the sides of the cylinder were named based on the incident wave direction the instrumentation and related processing software were tuned for the sampling frequency of 20 hz throughout the experiments as the pressure distribution around the model was examined the mean of the highest pressure was found to correspond to p1 20 therefore it was considered to be the representative value the dynamic wave force distribution was calculated for each test by first subtracting the static pressures from the recorded time series of the pressure measured by the transducers then the pressure distribution was calculated by multiplying the pressure recorded around the model with the cosine of the inclination angles of the transducers from the normal axis along the wave direction the value of the dynamic pressure at each point was assumed to be constant over the considered area for the purpose of calculating wave forces the trapezoidal method was used to measure the resultant pressure distribution around the pile yagci et al 2006 the in line dynamic pressure was evaluated for the specific depth and in the partial length of the pile beneath the water surface in spite of the fact that the incident waves were not in breaking form the quantity of dynamic pressure could be measured by subtracting the hydrostatic pressure from the total pressure in the relevant depth the pressure profile around the pile is shown in fig 8 and the in line dynamic pressure on the partial longitudinal is obtained from eq 1 where ɵr is the dynamic pressure angle with the normal axis on the pile according to fig 8 the imposed force on the pile in the partial longitudinal is equal to the summation of the in line components of dynamic wave pressures eq 2 therefore the trapezoidal approximation rule is used to calculate the area below the surface of the in line components of the dynamic wave pressure as shown in fig 8 1 p d x cos θ r p d also vertically distributed in line force along the pile is given by 2 f x z d z π 4 π 4 p d x θ d θ it is necessary to mention here that marine structures must be designed to consider the maximum wave loads that may appear during their lifetime in this context determination of the wave forces that will act on the piles under storm conditions is an important issue for a wave screen the studied breakwater in this work can also be considered a partially immersed caisson supported on a pile system this type of structure consists of two different main parts the bottom portion consists of closely spaced piles and the top portion consists of a caisson face on the seaside which couples the advantages of these two parts huang and chen 2020 an important advantage of this type of structure is that it can be successfully employed for low and moderate wave energy applications for the improvement of performance in the case of storms the functional performance of the caisson at the top part of the breakwater can be consider as the main and efficient part for storm situations of course in this research the performance of the rows of piles is studied for this purpose measurements were taken of the in line dynamic pressure distribution along the piles tilted along the principal wave direction the dynamic pressure distribution around the piles the wave forces acting on the inclined piles using measured dynamic wave pressures and the performance of the piles in terms of wave attenuation therefore to develop the scope of work the efficiency of a caisson being supported on the rows of piles must be studied in the case of storm this practical problem has remained unsolved in this study and must be considered as a topic of future research and the method must be improved through consideration of the caisson part 2 2 theories and numerical analysis of the hydrodynamics around the considered models 2 2 1 governing equations of fluid dynamics computational fluid dynamics cfd simulates flow patterns in an approach in which the standard fluid motion equations are discretized and solved for each computational cell flow science inc 2012 in the present study a general commercial cfd package is used to simulate the wave and pile interactions flow 3d is a powerful cfd based code developed by flow science inc and solves three dimensional navier stokes equations and the continuity equation concurrently this code is adequate for solving a wide range of fluid flow patterns vanneste 2012 which is provided based on the finite differences method in this model finite differences method is used to discretize the governing equations in a cartesian coordinate system the general continuity equation in the tensor notation is in the form of eq 3 3 u i x i 0 where ui is the ith component of the velocity the equation of motion for the incompressible fluids such as water in which ρ is assumed to be constant is expressed as eq 4 4 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j f i where p ρ and υ are fluid pressure density and viscosity respectively fi is a vector representing external forces volume of fluid vof method is applied for modeling the fluid interfaces and free surfaces problems a vof function f represents fluid

as a turbulent schmidt number fsor corresponds to the mass source flow science inc 2012 in the free surface level not all the cells are filled with fluid and the number of cells on the surface of flow

setup hydrodynamics around mono pile with a square cross section in irregular wave the mono pile with a square cross section was numerically modeled according to the studied physical model with characteristics as mentioned in section 2 1 the density of the elements plays an important role during the numerical analysis process fig 9 compares the water level and total pressure in the same location for the computational domain of numerical wave flume with different grid sizes the results do not show any noticeable changes in the results for the number of cells more than 348480 therefore for this case the numerical results are independent of the mesh size and the rest of the simulations are carried out using 348 480 as a number of cells the rng turbulence model was used to model the turbulence flow the rng model uses equations similar to the k ε model the equation constants are derived explicitly for the rng model while they are found experimentally for the standard k ε model however the rng model includes wider applications than the k ε model moreover previous studies of the hydrodynamics models of the near shore zone and the wave structure interactions show that utilizing the rng turbulence model obtains better predicted results bakhtyar et al 2010 dentale et al 2014 in addition the upstream and downstream boundary conditions were defined as wave and outflow respectively to decrease the effects of the wave reflection through the boundaries the wall boundary and symmetry boundary conditions were determined for the sides bottom and upper surface of the water respectively the defined boundary conditions are shown in fig 10 each experimental procedure was assessed for 180 s and thus the numerical models run for an extended time duration of 190 s considering the time delay of wave propagation between the upstream boundary and location of the pile moreover the surface relative roughness was not considered and the surface condition was modeled as a smooth surface the jonswap spectrum concept was used to produce irregular waves in the unsteady numerical models the time series of the generated waves shown in fig 11 a and b compare the wave spectrums of both numerical and experimental conditions the main hydrodynamic quantities of flow around the piles depend on the reynolds number in the case of oscillatory flows an additional parameter known as keulegan carpenter appears which is defined as eq 7 7 k c 2 σ u t z d where tz is the mean zero up crossing period of the random motion σu is the root mean square value of the velocity u and d is the dimension of the pile normal to the wave crest chakrabarti 1987 the morison s equation for a vertical pile includes the drag and the inertia components of the force as defined in eq 8 8 f t 1 2 ρ c d a d u t u t ρ c m a i u t t in the above equation f is the force per unit length of the vertical pile cd and cm are the drag and inertia coefficient respectively ad is the pile section ai is the cross sectional area of the pile and u is the horizontal particle fluid velocity in this study a method known as the least square method is used to obtain the inertia force coefficient based on eq

measured for different values of the kc number of course most of the past research into hydrodynamic loading on ocean structures has concentrated on circular cross section members the notable research investigations carried out on circular square flat plate sections are by bearman et al 1979 1984 tanaka et al 1982 ikeda et al 1988a b arai 1993 1995 chaplin and retzler 1992 and koterayama and hu 1995 ikeda et al 1988a carried out experiments on circular flat plate square and diamond sections horizontally submerged in regular waves at low kc numbers and found that for a flat plate cd and cm measured in waves were lower than those measured in oscillatory flow by tanaka et al 1982 table 1 illustrates the results of the kc number drag and inertia coefficients for the numerical and experimental procedures the numerical and laboratory results are determined in both 0 50 and 0 60 m water depth while the rotating angle of the pile around the y axial is zero ζ ψ 0 the observed results show a reasonable agreement among the analyses despite the above mentioned facts about the piles with rectangular cross sections the relations between force coefficients and kc number can be in the relative same order for both circular and rectangular piles with comparable dimensions a comparison between the reported values of the cases from various references e g sumer and fredsøe 2006 and the ones in table 1 shows an acceptable range for the measured values of this study 2 2 3 numerical setup hydrodynamics around nine pile breakwater in regular and irregular waves the hydrodynamic performance of a closely spaced pile breakwater is investigated considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater is composed of nine piles as shown in fig 12 the parameters including the cross sectional shape are investigated in a pile group using the numerical models for this purpose the hydrodynamics around the mono piles is investigated for the circular and square cross sections the results of the study by yagci et al 2006 are used to calibrate and validate the prepared numerical model of the breakwater with circular cross sections these results are considered for this study because of the accuracy and completeness of the data which were measured by various instruments such as the acoustic doppler velocimeter adv finally the performance of the group piles with different cross sectional shapes will be evaluated by the validated model in the next sections based on the fact that the topology and geometric characteristics can be considered as one of the most significant parameters for the dissipated wave energy by the breakwater it is reasonable to generalize the results for the mono pile cases in most optimum cross sectional shapes and the orientation to investigate the best performance of the pile breakwater the rng turbulence model and the same boundary conditions were used to model the flow such as the considerations of the studied mono pile in section 2 2 3 as mentioned the scope of this work focuses on 2 successive steps including firstly the investigation of hydrodynamic performance of the solitary pile and secondly a pile breakwater as a full structure in this regard the numerical models are validated based on the experimental results gained in 2 different wave maker flumes in the first step for the study of the hydrodynamics around the mono pile the part of the required data was gathered by the tests that were carried out in the wave flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of tabriz in which the waves can be generated by the wave spectra appropriate for the jonswap and pierson and moskowitz pm spectrum here the jownswap spectrum was determined to be more appropriate to recognize the considered performance of the mono pile because of its pronounced peak for the second step the results were considered based on an implemented test in the hydraulics laboratory of istanbul technical university yagci et al 2006 where they evaluated the prepared numerical model of the breakwater in the related flume the waves were generated by a computer controlled wave maker which is capable of generating irregular waves displaying the pm wave spectrum furthermore the pm spectrum could be considered the more suitable case for water waves travelling in a limited region and shallower water therefore here the concept of pm spectrum is applied to produce irregular waves the defined boundary conditions are shown in fig 13 b in addition it can be inferred from fig 13 a that the numerical results are independent of mesh size for 324000 cells to obtain the best hydraulic design the different cross sectional shapes were investigated under different wave conditions and the results in each case were compared to those of other cases for this purpose the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity ratio of the gap between the piles to their equal diameters were considered the same for both circular and square cross sections as 0 175 the characteristics of the considered generated waves are shown in table 2 3 results and discussion protection of the coastal environment from the disturbances due to incoming waves is a basic requirement for engineering applications in certain circumstances it may not be possible to apply rubble mound breakwaters in shore protection due to technical economic and environmental limitations in such cases pile breakwaters may be used as an alternative a sharp edged structure with square or rectangular cross sections is a common shape that is used to make some of the structural members of hydraulic and marine structures however most of the past research has concentrated on members with circular cross sections and relatively limited work has been carried out on such cross sections an accurate estimation of the hydrodynamic forces is required to determine the best pile geometries lotfollahi yaghin et al 2012 in the present study an investigation on a model of a pile type breakwater is carried out the different hydrodynamic characteristics exerted on the model are reported detailed program was carried out to measure the transmission characteristics of the breakwater model it is observed that the energy of the waves is dissipated more effectively if the configuration of the piles between the rows would be designed in an optimum location an illustrated discussion of the related results is given in the following sections 3 1 validation and evaluation of numerical model of a nine pile breakwater using the experimental results the prepared numerical model of the nine pile breakwater was validated using the experimental data collected by yagci et al 2006 in fig 14 the results of the water particle velocities are compared for both the numerical and empirical conditions the related experimental data were obtained for the breakwater model in a regular wave with a height of 0 166 m and a period of 1 2 s the results were measured at a level of 0 45 m distance from the bottom of the flume along the x coordinate the direction of the wave propagation and the z coordinate the direction of the water level fluctuations fig 14 illustrates a reasonable agreement between the experimental and numerical results fig 15 depicts the velocity profiles in different water depths for both the numerical and experimental procedures fig 15 a shows the results for the incident wave at the front of the breakwater the results shown as velocity were measured by taking the average of the 30 percent of the highest values of fluid particle velocities fig 15 b presents the same results for the transmission wave although it shows some scatter in the experimental results overall there is a reasonable agreement between the experiments and the numerical modeling meanwhile a comparison among the velocities close to the bed seaward and landward of the breakwater structures indicates that the structure of breakwaters has the least interference on the bed this can be used to construct environmentally friendly structures considering the subsequent minimal effects on the seabed creatures the mean error value using rmse formula between the numerical and experimental results of the water particle velocities along x and z coordinates are 0 09 and 0 06 respectively in addition the errors in fig 15 a and b are 0 15 and 0 1 respectively fig 16 shows the variation of the wave transmission coefficient parameter related to the regular wave the comparison between the numerical and experimental results shows 7 percent scatter among the results furthermore it can be concluded that the performance of the breakwater will increase with the decrease of the wave period fig 17 shows a comparison between the numerical and experimental results of the vertical allocation for the in line dynamic pressures caused by irregular waves the results of the in line dynamic pressures were measured by averaging among 5 percent of the highest values of dynamic pressure at different moments the irregular waves were generated based on the pm spectrum with the peak wave period and significant wave height of 1 67 s and 0 12 m respectively the rmse between the numerical and experimental results is 0 33 despite a noticeable difference between the observed results for the depth of 0 02 m the numerical outputs generally have a satisfactory agreement with the laboratory results 3 2 evaluation of the performance of the mono piles the performance of the mono piles with square and circular cross sections was investigated under the irregular waves the characteristics of the incident waves were considered using the details mentioned in table 2 the method of mansard and funk 1980 was employed to calculate the reflection coefficients table 3 compares the results for the piles with square and circular cross sections table 3 implies that the reflection coefficient for the square cross section pile is higher than the cylindrical one by approximately 2 5 percent on the other hand it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases with an increase in incident wave spectrum energy increases of wave height 3 3 effect of the orientation of the square cross section pile against the incident waves the shear stresses around the piles with respect to the local and global scour the inline wave force and wave force coefficient and wave reflection coefficient were investigated to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves to achieve this aim the angles of piles around the y and z coordinates are nominated as ζ and ψ respectively fig 18 3 3 1 evaluation of the bed shear stress and the wave conditions fig 19 shows the bed shear stress distribution adjacent to the mono pile with square cross section in the considered irregular wave condition in the related figures the x and y axes were considered along the incoming waves and in the width direction of the flume respectively the shear stresses are shown in the form of the amplification factor τ τ along the width of the flume here τ is the mean bed shear stress in the presence of the pile and τ is the maximum value of the undisturbed mean bed shear stress as shown in fig 19 bed shear stress decreases by increasing the angle of ζ in each case furthermore the peaks of the related curves shift from the middle part of the pile toward its one side by changing the angle of ψ the maximum bed shear stresses around the mono pile were also measured under certain regular wave conditions as a function of the kc numbers the considered periods and wave heights ranged between 1 2 and 2 5 s and 0 10 0 20 m respectively and the related measured kc numbers are shown in the x axis of fig 20 it can be observed from the results that the maximum shear amplification factor gradually increases as the kc number is increased and attains a value of about 3 at kc 4 5 from this kc number throughout the considered range it remains practically almost constant at a factor of 3 namely at a value of 3 times more than the undisturbed bed shear stress for low kc numbers it is clear that because of the interference of the flows around individual pile members the resulting scour picture in the case of pile groups may differ significantly from that occurring around a single pile sumer and fredsøe 2002 therefore in the case of scouring the results obtained for the solitary piles are not in a simple and proportional relation with the ones from a group of piles in a way that cannot be generalized to the pile breakwater as a structure 3 3 2 evaluation of the force coefficients and the wave conditions the characteristics of drag and inertia coefficients for the vertical pile with square cross section in regular waves are illustrated in fig 21 for the various angles of attack ψ 0 to ψ 45 in general the drag coefficients decrease with an increase in kc the results show that the larger values of drag coefficient occur at lower kc numbers and decreases with an increase in kc numbers furthermore the values of cm are slightly larger for low kc numbers indeed the inertia coefficient does not change significantly when kc 5 moreover the results show that the pile with a zero angle of attack generally had the highest drag and inertia coefficient especially compared to the models with a 45 attack angle furthermore the wave load action on the piles was investigated for the mono pile wave forces are due to the wave induced dynamic pressure which is scaled by γa where γ is the specific weight of water and a is wave amplitude the wave in line force per unit length of pile f is normalized in each depth by 0 5γdehs where de is the equivalent diameter of the pile considering various angles of attack fig 22 shows the dimensionless in line wave force changes along the pile as shown in fig 22 dimensionless in line wave force is inversely proportional to z d where z is the position of force measurement and d is the still water depth moreover the dimensionless in line wave force decreases by increasing the ψ meanwhile by comparing dimensionless in line wave force results in various ζ it could be concluded that ζ does not have much effect on the wave force although the wave forces increase slightly by increasing the ζ 3 3 3 development of the equations for the pile based on the orientation against the incident waves the parametric models and equations can be used to investigating the random uncertainties for marine structures mojtahedi et al 2018 in this study the wave reflection coefficients for the mono pile with the square cross section were determined using the validated numerical model the corresponding results are presented in table 4 the numerical model was run for almost 50 conditions and the obtained numerical results were used for estimation of eqs 10 and 11 which obtained by non linear fitting on the measured values to evaluate the wave reflection coefficient of considered piles during the post processing of the required data for the fitting procedure the numerical measured sparse data which was considerably out of the observed linear average were discard to gain more accurate equation to predict the coefficients the marked houses in table 4 are related to the omitted data which were not bring to the table eqs 10 and 11 are valid for the range of 0 ζ 10 and ζ 10 respectively the ζ and ψ in the eqs 10 and 11 are in radian unit these equations were obtained using the coefficient of determinations 0 92 and 0 94 respectively fig 23 illustrates the scattering graph of the results for both the numerical and statistical models finally the measured statistical equations were used to estimate the optimal conditions 10 k r 1 0

for ζ 10 ζ 0 1745 rad values of 12 ψ 17 and ζ 15 can be considered as the optimum angles for the performance of piles under study of course it is necessary to mention that the equations are fitted on the results obtained by a deterministic model and not the probabilistic one while in view of the unexpected aspects arising from the marine environment there are numerous uncertainty parameters which can influence the accuracy of the methods which employ the deterministic model concepts these uncertainties have a great effect on the hydrodynamic behavior of the structures and many practical problems caused by various types of uncertainty make it a complicated issue however in situations where we can trust that a numerical model can give reliable results with engineering accuracy it can be the tool of choice of course numerical modeling should be calibrated through experimental work but after that it can provide more insight into the subject in this regard we report the values via the statistical equations achieving almost 90 percent reliability which can be considered acceptable for engineering purposes and the remained 10 percent can be allocated to unavoidable uncertainties 3 4 performance of the nine pile breakwater with different shapes of piles the nine pile breakwater mentioned in section 2 2 3 was modeled in regular and irregular wave states to investigate the best performance of the breakwater with consideration of different pile shapes to do this the piles with square cross sections were considered with measured optimum angles the dimensionless parameters of the breakwater porosity ratio of the gap between the piles to their equal diameters were considered the same for both circular and square cross sections as 0 175 the results of pile breakwater performance are presented as follows 3 4 1 evaluation of the bed shear stress and the wave conditions around the middle pile fig 24 depicts the behavior of the bed shear stress amplification around the middle pile of the studied pile breakwater along the x axis the results are measured in 4 different conditions of irregular waves as defined in table 2 and in 4 scenarios including 1 piles with a circular cross section ζ 11 2 piles with a square cross section ζ 11 and ψ 0 3 piles with a square cross section and optimum angle of reflection ζ 10 and ψ 12 and 4 piles with a square cross section and optimum angle of reflection ζ 15 and ψ 17 fig 24 shows the increases in bed shear stress amplification in proximity to the pile it is also implied that the bed shear stresses are slightly higher for the piles with square cross sections than ones with circular cross sections it is necessary to mention that there is a considerable difference between the observed results of this study and the results in the related literature regarding the physical models with similar geometric scale but located at the steady current such as sumer et al 1995 while in the wave conditions of this study the maximum amplification factor increases only to somewhere between 2 and 3 but this value may even increase to a value of 12 in steady current this result could be related to differences between steady and surface fluctuating flow the experimental tests of this study were carried out in a flume equipped with a hinged flapper type wave maker system in this case the particle orbit geometries of the propagated waves are approximately in a circular form throughout the water column and decrease in diameter with increasing distance below the water surface and almost die out over the bottom and the orbits do not affect the bottom therefore the effects of bottom shear stress can be expected to be less efficient based on the mentioned concepts 3 4 2 evaluation of the force coefficients and the wave conditions around the middle pile fig 25 shows the force coefficient related to the middle pile of the pile breakwater mentioned above there are 4 scenarios of pile shapes and in regular and irregular waves as shown in fig 25 the force coefficients of piles with a circular cross section are less than piles with a square cross section moreover the force coefficients for piles with a square cross section and optimum angle in reflection are generally less than piles with a square cross section ζ 11 and ψ 0 fig 26 compares the dimensionless in line wave force changes along the middle pile of the breakwaters in the above mentioned 4 scenarios the results indicate that dimensionless in line wave force for the breakwater with piles with a circular cross section is less than the breakwater with piles with a square cross section however the dimensionless in line wave force of the square cross section is slightly higher than the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles furthermore results show that by increasing the energy of incoming wave spectrum the dimensionless in line wave force increases 3 4 3 evaluation of the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients against the incident waves fig 27 compares the obtained results of wave reflection transmission and energy loss coefficient for the breakwaters with square and circular cross sections in the 4 different scenarios energy dissipation of the breakwater is investigated using the following equation isaacson et al 1998 12 k e 1 k r 2 k t 2 where kt is the transmission coefficient kr is the reflection coefficient and ke is the energy loss coefficient based on the description of the energy dissipation in eq 12 this parameter should not be considered as a comparable factor for the hydraulic performance of considered breakwaters in this study the characteristics of the considered generated waves were also similar to the parameters shown in table 2 that were used to generate them as shown in fig 27 the reflection coefficients decrease and transmission coefficients increase with the increase of the wave spectrum energy however the energy dissipation coefficient does not change noticeably with the increase of the spectrum energy the reflection coefficients decrease with the increase of the spectrum energy of the incident waves as shown in fig 27 considering all 4 mentioned scenarios the wave reflection coefficient is maximum for breakwater in the wave with the spectrum number 1 as shown in table 2 and the wave reflection coefficient is minimum for the wave with the spectrum number 4 furthermore the wave reflection coefficients decrease in a similar trend for all scenarios and therefore the trends are independent of the shapes by comparing all cases of the piles with square cross sections the reflection coefficient was found to be larger for the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles furthermore the shape of the pile can be considered to be another challenge because it can strongly affect the flow pattern around its structure the attack angle of the flow can be considered as an important factor for a pile with square or rectangular cross sections and in this case the problem becomes more complicated however sharp edged pile structures have long been considered a common shape and used to make some of the structural members used in hydraulic and marine engineering in this regard an accurate estimation of the hydrodynamic forces acting on these piles is required to determine the best geometries for the case of practical engineering the benefits of these kinds of piles can be used by locating a breakwater at an optimum angle according to the estimated dominant wave direction furthermore as most of the past research has focused on the members with circular cross sections and not members with square or rectangular cross sections this manuscript can be considered an attempt to investigate the idea of using this kind of pile in construction of the pile breakwater studies regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using them would be useful and can be considered as another possible subject for future research 4 conclusions this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance of a type of closely spaced pile breakwater considering both regular and irregular wave conditions the structure of the studied breakwater consists of nine piles in 2 rows in a configuration to provide effective shore protection as an environmentally friendly coastal structure the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the performance of the mono pile with square and circular cross sections was compared under irregular waves and the reflection coefficients were calculated the results imply that in this case the reflection coefficient for the square cross section pile is higher than the cylindrical one in addition it is observed that the reflection coefficient decreases with the increase of incident wave spectrum energy but the wave reflection coefficients decrease following a similar trend for all scenarios and are independent of the shapes 2 meanwhile the wave reflection coefficients for the mono pile with the square cross section were determined in order to measure the optimal orientation of the piles against the incident waves the parametric equations were estimated by non linear fitting on the measured values to measure the wave reflection coefficient values of 12 ψ 17 and ζ 15 are assessed as the optimum angles for the performance of the considered pile where ζ and ψ are angles of the piles around the defined y and z coordinates respectively 3 the bed shear stress distributions were also evaluated adjacent to the mono piles in considered irregular wave conditions they were estimated in the form of the amplification factors results show that bed shear stress decreases with increasing the angle of ζ in each case the peaks of the related curves shift from the middle part of the pile toward its one side by changing the angle of ψ 4 the maximum bed shear stresses around the mono pile were measured as a function of the kc numbers it is observed that the maximum shear amplification factor gradually increases as the kc number is increased and attains a value of about 3 at kc 4 5 from this kc number throughout the considered range it remains practically almost constant at a factor of 3 5 the characteristics of drag and inertia coefficients for the pile with square cross sections in regular waves were investigated for various angles of attack ψ 0 to ψ 45 the results demonstrate that the inertia coefficient does not change significantly for the considered range of the kc number the results show that the pile with a zero angle of attack generally had the highest drag and inertia coefficient especially compared to the models with 45 attack angle 6 the nine pile breakwater was considered to investigate the best performance of the breakwater with respect to different pile shapes to do this piles with square cross sections were considered with measured optimum angles the behavior of the bed shear stress amplification around the middle pile of the studied pile breakwater was also investigated results show the increases in the bed shear stress amplification in proximity to the pile they also imply that the bed shear stresses are slightly higher for the piles with square cross sections than ones with circular cross sections 7 a considerable difference was observed between the obtained results of this study and the results in the related literature with respect to the physical models with similar geometric scale but located in steady current while in the wave condition of this study the maximum amplification factor increases only to somewhere between 2 and 3 this value even may increase to a value of 12 in steady current this result could be related to differences between steady and surface fluctuating flow in the second case the particle orbit geometries of the propagated waves are approximately in a circular form throughout the water column and decrease in diameter with increasing distance below the water surface and almost die out over the bottom and the orbits do not affect the bottom 8 by comparison of all cases with square cross section piles it is observed that the reflection coefficient is higher for the breakwater with the optimum angles of the piles the obtained results demonstrate that the piles with the square cross section in optimum conditions have at least 7 percent even to a maximum of 30 percent higher reflections than other considered conditions with mild and short waves it can be related to the effect of the piles edges on the separation process of the flow credit authorship contribution statement

21412,reefs is a novel multipurpose patented wave energy converter wec that combines electric energy production with shore protection the device shows some similarities with natural reefs and detached submerged breakwaters however unlike previous ones it is installed with an orthogonal alignment relative to coast line and with a greater freeboard exterior stay vanes are another distinct characteristic of the device therefore the reefs differentiating functionality of shore protection cannot be directly extrapolated from detached submerged breakwater studies and the effective energy dissipation capacity of this new wec taking into account its specific characteristics should be investigated in this article an experimental investigation of the energy dissipation potential of reefs wec was implemented a small scale physical model 1 5 100 was installed in a piston wavemaker flume and tested under regular wave conditions established by applying froude similarity to typical west portuguese sea state conditions resistive wave gauges were installed upstream and downstream the device in order to record water level time series discrete fourier transform technique was used to compute the wave energy spectra wes energy dissipation was evaluated by comparing upstream and downstream wes two versions of the device were tested i without exterior stay vanes ii with exterior stay vanes regardless of the version the reefs model proved to be able to dissipate part of the incident wave energy this capacity exhibited a dependence on the wave period globally decreasing as the wave period increased the version equipped with stay vanes always exhibited a substantially higher energy dissipation from a relative point of view stay vanes showed to be more important for long waves reefs energy dissipation was not far from the inferior values reported in literature review for submerged breakwaters of comparable dimensions confirming the expectations about its shore protection functionality keywords novel multipurpose wave energy converter submerged breakwater wave energy dissipation shore protection wave breaking wave flume 1 introduction reefs is a recently patented lopes de almeida 2019 novel multipurpose nearshore wave energy converter wec that combines electric energy production with shore protection the device makes use of the pressure and velocity fields created bellow a sea wave to create an inner steady flow that drives a submersible hydropower turbo generator to produce electricity e g fig 1 a the pressure field is harnessed through a mesh membrane composite valve system that controls inlet and outlet flows by the enveloping squared apertures illustrated in fig 1 the velocity field is harnessed by the exterior stay vanes e g fig 1 b that drive the water to the mentioned squared apertures the reefs design philosophy functioning principles preliminary power output evaluation and simplified expedient computational model were already presented in lopes de almeida 2017 lopes de almeida et al 2018 2020 where detailed descriptions can be found in its preferential construction form the reefs structure is a prefabricated concrete box with longitudinal direction parallel to the dominant wave propagation direction the device mimics the natural reefs that provide shore protection because they originate storm waves breaking which reduces its energy before reaching the coast accordingly it was named with the acronym reefs that stands for renewable electric energy from sea in fig 1 we present a profile view illustration of the reefs device in fig 2 we present a tridimensional illustration of reefs relative positioning to the coast line as stated by foteinis and tsoutsos 2017 strategies are needed to improve sustainability and economic feasibility of wec technology wec incorporation in coastal defense is presented by these authors as an innovative way to offset wec high initial capital expenditure dual wave farms for energy production and coastal protection are also suggested in abanades et al 2018 where it is demonstrated that they can be beneficial in terms of reducing both storm erosion and accretion these authors refer that these positive externalities for coastal management must be translated into incentives in economic terms for the wave farms developers they anticipate that if correctly applied the potential of this new approach will be immense to investigate the role of wave farms in coastal defense several authors developed prospective studies most of them based in numerical simulations and more rarely in experimental data palha et al 2010 analyzed the impact of pelamis wave farms in the portuguese shoreline wave state they adapted the numerical model refdif monochromatic waves to simulate energy extraction by wave farms installed in the pilot zone of the portuguese west coast near são pedro de moel between 30 m and 90 m water depth they concluded that in absolute terms there are no significant differences between wave heights observed near the coast with and without pelamis wave farms installation eugen rusu and guedes soares 2013 developed similar studies with pelamis farms for a coastal environment located north of peniche in the west portuguese coast however these authors developed simulations using the numerical model swan spectral numerical wave model from the analysis of the wave data in the nearshore they concluded that the impact of the pelamis wave farm is highly attenuated inducing a relative significant wave height decrease between 2 and 3 and not greater than 5 depending on which wave farm configuration is considered the potential coastal protection effect of other types of wave energy converters has also been studied by several authors zanuttigh and angelelli 2013 draw the attention to the need of developing sustainable solutions based on combined installation for wave energy production and coastal defence they studied the use of near shore floating wave energy converters from the wave activated body type for coastal protection based on tridimensional laboratory tests experiments considering a single dexa device in 1 30 scale and considering three dexa devices of the same type in 1 60 scale were conducted in deep water wave tank at aalborg university based on experimental results considering individual functioning and wave farm functioning 3 devices the authors concluded that these devices lead to a modest reductions of incident wave energy the dexa was also studied by mendoza et al 2014 in a comparative study that also included the seabreth wavedragon and blowjet these wecs were numerically tested in front of two beaches one of them located in the bay of santander in spain and the other in las glorias beach in mexico in both cases the long shore sediment transport was dominant the model used to reproduce the hydrodynamics induced by these devices was calibrated against experimental results from this study the authors concluded that depending on the type of device and on the location a low to moderate accretion could be achieved they concluded that although a greater shore protection could have been achieved with traditional alternatives the advantage of using wec farms is that they provide two services the wavecat is another floating wec that has been extensively studied for coastal protection purposes in abanades et al 2014a iglesias and carballo 2014 abanades et al 2014b abanades et al 2015a abanades et al 2015b bergillos et al 2018 and rodriguez delgado et al 2018 several aspects concerning wavecat farms are approached such as the evaluation of the wave farm impact on the beach profile the role of the farm to coast distance the coastal defence through wave farms the wave farm impact on beach modal state the wave farm impact on eroding deltas and the wave farm protective effect in gravel dominated coasts these approaches relied on numerical simulations sometimes incorporating data obtained from laboratory tests globally these studies have been indicating that although no remarkable reduction of coastal wave height occurs in the long term wave farms can induce accretion contributing to reduce coastal erosion installing wecs in breakwaters is an alternative approach also reported in the literature wec installation in breakwaters is quite different from using wave farms for coastal defense although both approaches share the similar aim of multipurpose functionality as reported in mustapa et al 2017 several challenges still need to be considered the main one consisting in finding suitable breakwater locations because of the necessity of carefully considering the direction of incoming wave the tidal range the wave reflection and the under water bathymetry to operate well the wec device need to be placed directly facing the incoming waves which implies that in storm conditions they are exposed to extreme loading from the wave so we may conclude that installing wecs in breakwaters is a quite limited response to the need of increasing wec coastal defense multipurpose functionality hybrid floating breakwater wec systems are an interesting alternative to installing wecs in conventional breakwaters according to dai et al 2018 floating breakwaters present some advantages such as low dependency on seabed conditions on tidal variation and on sea level raise by global warming low aesthetical impact minimal interference with water circulation and relocation flexibility as referred in zhao et al 2019 the hybrid floating breakwater wec systems represent a synergetic opportunity to convert part of the wasted energy resulting from breakwater dissipation and reflection into useful energy absorbed by the on board wec system according to this study the hybrid systems present several typologies that can be categorized as floating breakwater ob type wec systems floating breakwater owc type wec systems and floating breakwater overtopping type wec systems despite the attractiveness of the concept on what concerns cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality the hybrid floating breakwater systems still need to overcome several challenges such as assessing the performance in realistic sea states broadening the effective frequency bandwidth of the system and analyzing the survivability in extreme waves zhao et al 2019 wave breaking by means of artificial reefs or submerged breakwaters sbw was investigated by several authors such as ahrens 1987 hur et al 2003 ranasinghe et al 2006 chaplin and blenkinsopp 2008 ranasinghe et al 2010 chella et al 2015 and ryu et al 2016 as reported in ranasinghe et al 2006 conventional solutions such as groins and emergent breakwaters are becoming increasingly unpopular essentially because of their adverse impact on beach amenity and aesthetics in contrast sbws are becoming a popular option for coastal protection mostly because of their small aesthetic impact on the natural environment ranasinghe et al 2010 sbws use for coastal protection as not been a traditional option so their efficacy is still largely unknown investigating the structural and environmental conditions that determine the way shoreline responds i e shoreline erosion vs shoreline accretion to sbws is a very important subject of research which can be found in ranasinghe et al 2010 hur et al 2003 analyzed the governing parameters of the wave breaking over sbw with a prismatic shape for regular waves hur et al 2003 proposed expressions for wave breaking criteria over the central zone of the sbw those expressions clearly demonstrate the effective wave breaking capability of this type of submerged infrastructures which anticipates an effective multipurpose shore protection functionality for the reefs wec ryu et al 2016 studied the effect of the porosity of a submerged breakwater on wave fields using particle image velocimetry piv they concluded that porosity determines the different patterns of dissipated kinetic energy by comparing the stability of the wave fields for impermeable and permeable conditions they concluded that longer waves are more affected by porous media the reefs device presented in detail in lopes de almeida 2017 lopes de almeida et al 2018 and lopes de almeida et al 2020 shows some similarities with natural reefs and detached submerged breakwaters however unlike the previous ones the reefs device is installed with an orthogonal alignment relative to coast line e g fig 2 the freeboard must be large enough to avoid excessive breaking in order to ensure good wave energy resource up to about 5 m wave height the exterior stay vanes e g fig 1 b are another distinct characteristic of this device therefore the claimed functionality of shore protection cannot be directly extrapolated from detached submerged breakwater studies and the effective energy dissipation capacity of this new wec taking into account its specific characteristics should be investigated the main objective of this article is to report the experimental work developed to assess reefs potential usefulness for coastal protection based on the evaluation of the passive wave energy dissipation in the device such evaluation has never been done before and will enable to demonstrate the claimed patented differentiating shore protection functionality the criteria adopted to measure energy dissipation was based on the computation of the downstream and upstream wave energy density given the complexity of the phenomena an experimental approach was adopted a small scale model 1 5 100 was installed in a piston wavemaker flume and portuguese west coast sea state conditions were simulated using froude similarity the device was tested in shutoff conditions to comply with storm conditions considered in the sea state scenarios analysis and discussion of the experimental results will be presented to support conclusions about the extent of coastal protection multipurpose functionality that can be attributed to the reefs wec 2 materials and methods the key objective of this section is to present the materials and methods used to evaluate reefs wave energy dissipation capability the reduction of incoming wave energy density provided by the device was considered as the guiding parameter it was evaluated by comparing downstream and upstream wave energy density experimental evaluation of upstream and downstream wave energy density was based in reefs small scale model 1 5 100 installation and testing in the 36 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m high piston wavemaker flume of the laboratory of hydraulics water resources and environment lhwre of the civil engineering department of the university of coimbra uc the wave flume was equipped with twin wire resistive 300 mm long wave gauges e g p0 p1 p2 and p3 in figs 3 and 4 and a downstream beach preceded by a permeable fabric to minimize wave reflection e g fig 3 wave gauges p2 and p3 were positioned at the same distance 9 1 m from the upstream top of the wave flume they were uniformly distributed with 1 3 m spacing along the width of the flume e g fig 4 in order to better characterize the average downstream irregular wave state the corresponding laboratorial experimental set up described in detail in santos martinho 2017 is schematically illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the reefs small scale model 1 5 100 was available from previous experiments described in lopes de almeida 2017 and lopes de almeida et al 2018 the model is essentially made of acrylic steel and plastic presenting a rectangular parallelepiped shape with 1 32 m long 0 30 m wide and a total height of 0 18 m base included as illustrated in fig 5 a as described in lopes de almeida 2017 the reefs body was connected to an axial turbine module e g fig 1 a to demonstrate its ability to drive a rotary machine however the objective of the present study is to evaluate the shore protection potential therefore the sea wave conditions selected for laboratorial simulations must include wave heights corresponding to storm conditions in these situations it is not realistic to consider that the turbine will be operating consequently the turbine module illustrated in fig 1 a was removed and inner flow blocked to replicate turbine shutoff this procedure was extended to simulations with smaller wave heights by two major reasons i the objective of the study will focus in evaluating passive wave energy dissipation provided by the device i e without the help of extra energy dissipation mechanisms such as turbine operation ii maintaining turbine shutoff in all simulated sea state conditions will ensure a uniform infrastructural condition that reduces complexity in data analysis and interpretation the reefs device was tested considering two alternative configurations i without the metallic exterior stay vanes installed as represented in fig 5 a ii with the metallic exterior stay vanes installed as represented in fig 5 b to ensure uniform depth in all the wave gauges the sand box i e lowest flume bottom in fig 3 was partially covered in its upstream zone by an extension platform e g fig 3 the fundamental steps of the experimental procedure can be summarized as follows 1 install a 1 5 100 reefs small scale physical model sspm in the wave flume 2 install and calibrate resistive wave gauges upstream p0 p1 and downstream p2 p3 the reefs sspm 3 submit the sspm to simulated sea state conditions of west portuguese coast recurring to the froude similarity to compute the corresponding laboratorial monochromatic wave characteristics to be inputted in the wavemaker control software 4 compute the wave energy density upstream and downstream the sspm by processing the wave gauge water level time series using spectral analysis 5 evaluate energy dissipation by comparing average wave energy density upstream and downstream the reefs sspm mechanical energy of gravity water waves at a given time instant is composed by two parcels the potential energy which is determined by the instantaneous wave water particles positioning relative to a horizontal datum and the kinetic energy which is determined by the instantaneous velocities of all the wave water particles for monochromatic waves it is possible to derive expressions that provide averaged values over a wave period of wave mechanical energy for instance in case of waves propagating in stokes 1st and 2nd order theory validity domain the very well known expression of the average wave energy density e is dean and dalrymple 1991 1 e 1 8 ρ g h 2 where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the wave height equation 1 can be used to compute wave energy density in the upstream wave gauge i e fig 3 p0 and p1 because as previously mentioned the experimental tests were developed considering monochromatic incident waves when monochromatic waves approach nearshore surrounding environment with low depth bathymetry and maritime structures they can suffer complex transformations including wave breaking that leads to profound modification of initial wave profile in such situations the subsequent sea surface often becomes irregular as the result of the chaotic and highly turbulent processes involved after such dramatic events energy density cannot be computed by equation 1 because the monochromatic character of incident wave is no longer present the latter described situation applies to the downstream part of the experimental installation where wave gauges p2 and p3 are installed e g figs 3 and 4 indeed in most of the experimental tests the incident monochromatic wave approaching the reefs small scale model suffered a sudden and strong modification when passing over it resulting in subsequent irregular wave profile downstream the device fig 6 summarizes the main components of the laboratorial experimental set up to measure wave water level time series four twin wire resistive hr wallingford wave gauges with 300 mm hr wallingford 2019a were installed two upstream p0 and p1 and the remaining two downstream p2 and p3 as mentioned before e g fig 6 b and c they are comprised of two parallel fixed wires which are installed vertically and perpendicular to the flow direction a high frequency alternating current is passed through the wires the conductance between the two parallel fixed vertical wires varies depending on the portion of the wires submerged by the flow by following a previous calibration procedure the measured conductance can be converted into water surface elevation the resistive wave gauges were connected to a hr wallingford wave probe monitor system hr wallingford 2019a which was connected to a personal computer e g fig 6 a the software hr waves data acquisition and analysis software program hr wallingford 2019b was used in the calibration data processing and monitoring e g fig 6 a a computer with the wave maker control software dhi wave synthesizer software dhi 2007 was used to generate the wave profiles e g fig 6 e and transfer it to the dhi awacs active wave absorption control system e g fig 6 f that controls the actuators of the piston wavemakers e g fig 6 g of the wave flume e g fig 6 d in fig 6 b the reefs sspm is equipped with exterior stay vanes in fig 6 c the reefs sspm has no exterior stay vanes and the extension platform is still not installed data recording was only activated 60 s after wavemaker start the objective of this initial period was to ensure flow stabilization after the data was recorded during 60 s with a time step of 0 0586 s ensuring wave water level time series with 1024 values after wavemaker stop there was a pause of about 10 min for complete reestablishment of still water level during this period the collected data was inspected to check eventual malfunctioning that would require the repetition of the experiment wave gauge calibration was periodically repeated to account for water temperature variation or water composition variation the prototype wave characteristics considered in this research were similar to those considered in the previous studies with the same device reported in lopes de almeida 2017 and lopes de almeida et al 2018 the wave periods varied from 6 s 7 s 8 s 9 s 10 s 11 s 12 s plus an exploratory period of 17 s the wave heights varied from approximately h 0 7 m to h 6 0 m and water depth was d 18 3 m gravity water waves propagation is essentially governed by gravity pressure and inertia forces therefore froude similarity was adopted to compute the time scale e t after geometrical scale e l 1 5 100 was established lopes de almeida et al 2018 2 e t e l 1 22475 10 1 with the geometrical and time scales we can compute the model wave characteristics model wave periods varied from 0 73 s 0 86 s 0 98 s 1 10 s 1 22 s 1 35 s 1 45 s plus an exploratory period of 2 08 s the wave heights varied from about h 1 cm to h 9 cm the water depth was d 27 5 cm a total of 260 experiments were performed during several weeks they comprised two situations i in half of the experiments the small scale model was deprived from the exterior stay vanes ii in the other half of the experiments the small scale model was equipped with the exterior stay vanes the experimental data used in this article was obtained by the second author in the ambitus of his m sc thesis research santos martinho 2017 fig 7 illustrates one of these experiments for an incident monochromatic wave with period t 0 98 s height h 4 7 cm propagating at a water depth d 27 5 cm over the reefs small scale model equipped with exterior stay vanes e g fig 5 b from fig 7 it is perceivable that water surface displacements relative to the mean water level η t near the wave gauges p2 and p3 are irregular randomly changing in space and time if we consider that such random phenomenon can be described by a stochastic process similar to the one considered in sea state characterization we will be able to compute the energy density by spectral analysis ochi 2005 spectral analysis is a technique that transforms a time domain representation in to a frequency domain representation time domain wave water level records can be processed using the discrete fourier transform dft technique smith 2007 to obtain the wave energy spectra wes sometimes called spectral density function ochi 2005 wave spectra or even variance spectrum because it became common practice to simply plot half of the square of wave amplitude instead of the wave energy density world meteorological organization 2018 the wes is a 2d plot of the spectral density function s f that provides an immediate perception of the average wave energy density distribution by the wave frequencies

experimental work reported in this article the dft technique was applied to process the water level time series of wave gauges p2 and p3 in order to derive the wes despite the availability of spectral analysis functionality in previously mentioned software the dft was implemented using fourier analysis function available in analysis toolpak of microsoft excel microsoft 2019 due to its generalized compatibility and availability dft requires that the number of time series data points dp must satisfy the condition 5 d p 2 n where n is an integer number a total number of 260 experiments each of them producing 3 wave gauge time series had to be processed therefore a total number of 780 dft had to be computed which required a considerable amount of time initial sensitivity analysis showed that using 512 time series data points d p 2 9 instead of 1024 time series data points d p 2 10 could save a considerable time without noticeable modifications in the results leading us to adopt dp 512 the nyquist frequency represents the highest resolvable frequency that can be computed from the wave record it is computed using the time series step δ t according to the following equation leis 2011 6 f n y q u i s t 1 2 δ t the experimental data was recorded with δ t 0 0586 s therefore the highest resolvable frequency is f n y q u i s t 8 5324 hz the rayleigh frequency represents the lowest resolvable frequency that can be computed from the wave record kleinfeld and mitra 2014 it is computed using the time series step δ t and the total number of data points dp according to the following equation 7 f r a y l e i g h 1 n p δ t as mentioned before dp 512 therefore the lowest resolvable frequency is f r a y l e i g h 0 0333 hz from this inferior value the component frequencies are consecutively incremented by 0 0333 hz until nyquist frequency is achieved the total number of component frequencies 0 0333 hz 0 0666 hz 0 0999 hz 8 5324 hz is 256 corresponding to np 2 keeping in mind that experimental incident wave periods varied from t 0 73 s 1 3698 hz to t 2 08 s 0 4808 hz we can observe that the component frequency range is large enough to detect possible wave energy transfer to considerably shorter or longer waves once wes is computed equation 4 can be applied to calculate the m0 value which represents the average energy density of the irregular wave state near wave gauges p2 and p3 this method was also applied to the upstream wave gauge p1 which enabled to double check the computation of the incoming monochromatic average wave energy density recurring to equation 1 as it will be exemplified in the next section 3 results and discussion to obtain the average energy density reduction provided by the reefs small scale model a total of 780 wave spectra were computed common practice drops the term ρ g of equation 1 and simply plots a 2 2 along the vertical axis of the wave spectra were a is the wave amplitude a h 2 in this article we will adopt the previous mentioned representation of the wave spectra once it is impossible to present all the computed wave spectra we will illustrate the procedure taking as example the experiment presented in fig 7 after we will present the results of all the computed wave spectra in a condensate manner based in graphical representation of the corresponding m0 values in fig 9 we present the wave spectra corresponding to the wave profile partially shown in fig 7 a the total length of each processed wave profile was 512 data points the average energy density of the wave represented in fig 7 a can be computed with equation 1 because it is a monochromatic wave in stokes 2nd order theory validity domain the resulting value is 2 7 j m 2 on the other hand the wave spectrum of fig 9 provides the average energy density of the referred monochromatic wave which is m0 0 000277 m2 therefore the two values of energy density e should mach however to compare them we must previously convert m0 by multiplying it by the water density 1000 kg m 3 and the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 as expected the resulting value is 2 7 j m 2 confirming the one previously obtained a double check computation of incident wave average energy density was done in all the experiments where equation 1 was applicable in figs 10 and 11 we present the wave spectra corresponding to the wave profiles partially shown in fig 7 b and c the total length of each processed wave profile was 512 data points by comparing fig 9 with both figs 10 and 11 we can clearly perceive a large energy density reduction from wave gauge p1 m0 0 000277 m2 to both p2 m0 0 000060 m2 and p3 m0 0 000058 m2 this energy dissipation is produced by partial or total wave breaking over the reefs model that acts like a pseudo submerged breakwater the energy reduction from p1 to both p2 and p3 is accompanied by a partial transfer of the incident wave energy to waves with higher frequencies shorter waves this is particularly visible in case of fig 10 wave gauge p2 energy reduction from upstream to downstream and energy transfer to higher frequencies second order and third order components was a general behavior identified in the remaining experiments although with considerably varying magnitude this behavior is in accordance with the literature for the case of breaking waves within the surf zone where it was found that the large decrease in energy flux observed across the surf zone in the energetic part of the wave spectrum is balanced closely by the estimated nonlinear energy transfers from the spectral peak to higher frequencies herbers et al 2000 this behavior was also described when a wave propagates over a bar by beji and battjes 1993 that developed laboratory experiments to elucidate the phenomenon of high frequency energy generation observed in the power spectra of waves traveling over submerged bars by comparing the wave spectra in wave gauges p2 fig 10 and p3 fig 11 we can observe that energy distribution pattern by the component frequencies is not the same however the total energy density is similar in both wave gauges m0 0 000060 m2 p2 and m0 0 000058 m2 p3 in most of the experiments the average energy density in wave gauges p2 and p3 was similar however to account for some differences the average of p2 and p3 values was adopted as the guiding parameter to define downstream wave state energy density the m0 values of the computed wave spectra were organized using the period of the incoming wave as the main guiding parameter for each period a pair of graphs will be presented the first graph corresponding to the device without stay vanes installed and the second one corresponding to the device with stay vanes installed the stay vanes are a differentiating characteristic of the concept therefore the objective of these dual comparisons is to evaluate its impact in energy dissipation for each graph presented in next figs 12 21 the average energy density in p1 and p2 p3 m0 in vertical axis will be plotted against the height of the incident wave h in horizontal axis the theoretical value of m0 corresponding to the height of the monochromatic incident wave in p1 will also be plotted m0 1 8 h2 we would like to underline that due to some inevitable reflections from upstream face of the reefs small scale model as well as from the downstream beach some constructive or destructive interference with the wavemaker incoming wave occurred they were detected by slight variations of p1 zero crossing wave heights during the analysis of the recorded water level time series therefore the wave height to be associated to each incoming wave required a previous analysis of p1 wave profile in order to compute the zero crossing wave heights after an average of the zero crossing wave heights was computed and adopted as the incoming wave height to be used in the graphs wave energy depends on the square of the wave height therefore the previous procedure is only acceptable to normalize very slight wave heights variations an alternative normalization procedure is to compute a conventional incoming wave height corresponding to the m0 value of the wave spectra measured in p1 this is easily done by combining equations 1 and 4 the latter requiring the multiplicative term ρ g as previously mentioned the only requirement is the assumption that equation 1 holds its validity in all the range of performed experiments both methods were implemented the second one leading to slightly better curve adjustments due to the extensive number of graphs to be displayed we will only retain the ones corresponding to the second method moreover to do not overload the article with excessive graphs we will jump intermediate wave periods of the performed sequence of experiments i e we will only present wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s plus the exploratory period of 2 08 s which are depicted in the next figs 12 21 by analyzing each pair figs 12 and 13 figs 14 and 15 figs 16 and 17 figs 18 and 19 and figs 20 and 21 it is clearly perceivable that reefs model equipped with exterior stay vanes always provides a higher wave energy dissipation this effect was predictable once the exterior stay vanes originate an increased macro roughness and block the inferior part of orbital water trajectories induced by the passing wave figs 12 14 16 18 and 20 show that energy dissipation decreases as the wave period increases adopting as a reference the values measured in the right vertical line h 0 06 m of the reference dashed square we obtained ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy of 40 58 59 72 and 100 for wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s and 2 08 s respectively they correspond to percentages of incident wave energy dissipation of 60 42 41 28 and 0 respectively a particular situation is the one depicted by fig 20 there we can see that p1 and p2 p3 curves are practically overlapping its relative positioning being essentially conditioned by the experimental error margin this shows that for a very long wave t 2 08 s in model corresponds to t 17 s in prototype the energy dissipation is practically null if the device is deprived of stay vanes figs 13 15 17 19 and 21 confirm that energy dissipation also decreases as wave period increases when stay vanes are installed however the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy in the same reference abscissa h 0 06 m are lower 16 22 26 29 and 66 for wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s and 2 08 s respectively they correspond to higher percentages of incident wave energy dissipation of 84 78 74 71 and 34 respectively the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy with stay vanes installed are approximately 40 of the corresponding values without stay vanes for wave periods varying from 0 73 s to 1 45 s which demonstrates its favorable dissipative effect by dividing the percentages of the incoming wave energy dissipated with stay vanes installed by the corresponding values without stay vanes we conclude that stay vanes increase energy dissipation by a factor that goes from 1 4 to 2 5 when the wave period rises from 0 73 s to 1 45 s this shows that from a relative point of view stay vanes dissipative effect is more important for long waves the stay vanes create a macro roughness that is somewhat comparable to an enveloping porosity in the sense that it allows some local circulation but at the expense of large energy dissipation from this perspective it agrees with the conclusion presented in ryu et al 2016 when comparing the wave fields for impermeable and permeable breakwaters from these observations we can conclude that longer waves are more affected by porous media ahrens examined energy dissipated by submerged and emerged breakwaters through extensive laboratory tests he concluded that for short wave periods the submerged breakwaters dissipates about 80 90 of the incident energy ahrens 1987 based on the referential experimental values mentioned in this article the average effective energy dissipation for reefs model deprived of stay vanes is 43 period range from 0 73 s until 1 45 s for the case of reefs model equipped with stay vanes the average energy dissipation is 68 period range from 0 73 s until 2 08 s this last value is not too far from the inferior value of 80 reported in ahrens 1987 when a wave approaches an obstacle such as a submerged breakwater some of the energy is reflected and some is locally dissipated the remaining energy is transmitted to the lee of the breakwater reflection k r dissipation k d and transmission k t coefficients are classical parameters used to characterize the breakwater impact on wave transformation the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave height h r to the incident wave height h i mckee et al 2018 8 k r h r h i similarly the wave transmission coefficient can be defined by the following equation 9 k t h t h i where h t is the transmitted wave height peña et al 2011 identifying the transmitted wave height may not be an easy task because energy dissipation process may originate irregular waves in the lee of the submerged breakwater a way to overcome such difficulty is to calculate transmission coefficient based on the wes of the incident and transmitted waves as proposed in liang et al 2020 the 1st order moments of the incident and transmitted wes m0 i and m0 t respectively are proportional to the energy density of the corresponding wave states therefore the transmission coefficient can then be calculated by 10 k t m 0 t m 0 i once reflection k r and dissipation k d coefficients are known the dissipation coefficient k d can be derived based on the energy conservation law liang et al 2020 and seeling and ahrens 1981 11 k d 2 k r 2 k t 2 1 several methods have been proposed to evaluate the reflection coefficient as discussed in varghese et al 2016 zhi 2018 and mckee et al 2018 if only two fixed upstream water level wave gauges are available the well known goda s method for estimation of incident and reflected waves in random wave experiments can be adopted goda and suzuki 1976 goda 2010 liang et al 2020 this is the case of the present experimental set up e g figs 3 and 4 therefore this method was applied to the data collected in wave gauges p0 and p1 for t 0 78 s t 0 86 s t 0 98 s t 1 10 s t 1 22 s t 1 35 s and t 1 47 s data corresponding to the very long wave t 2 08 s was not considered because no conclusive reflection coefficient could be calculated when stay vanes were not installed e g fig 20 according to goda and suzuki 1976 the method is not valid when relative gauge spacing is near δ l l n 2 n 0 1 2 therefore situations with t 0 73 s t 1 10 s and t 1 22 s add to be excluded as illustrated by the shadowed cells of table 1 in fig 22 we present the k r coefficient variation with wave period the dft technique was used to compute the a1 b1 a2 and b2 amplitudes of the goda s method goda and suzuki 1976 goda 2010 in order to obtain the incident and reflected wave amplitudes after the reflection coefficient was computed using equation 8 for each wave period all the experimental wave heights were considered and the corresponding average k r coefficient was computed from fig 22 we can see that the reflection coefficient is low showing a tendency to slightly decrease as the wave period increases as expectable stay vanes installation originates an increase of the reflection coefficient in fig 23 we present the k t coefficient variation with wave period it was obtained by replacing the first order moment of the wes in p1 incident wave and the average of first order moments of the wes in p2 and p3 transmitted wave in equation 10 the k t coefficient was computed as in the previous case i e for each wave period it was averaged among all wave heights from fig 23 we can observe that stay vanes installation originates a remarkable decrease of the transmission coefficient contrary to what happens with the reflection coefficient the transmission coefficient shows a tendency to increase as the wave period increases in fig 24 we present the k d coefficient variation with wave period it was computed by applying equation 11 to the previously computed k r and k t values presented in figs 22 and 23 from fig 24 we can observe as expectable that stay vanes installation considerably increases the energy dissipation contrary to the transmission coefficient the dissipation coefficient shows a tendency to decrease as wave period increases the average values from figs 22 and 23 considering that stay vanes are installed are k r 16 and k t 59 leading to k d 79 the corresponding values considering that stay vanes are installed are k r 11 k t 86 and k d 50 the stay vanes installation adds 5 cm in each side of the reefs model cross section this represents a global width increase by a factor of 1 3 comparatively the increase in the average k d coefficient is about 1 6 this indicates that stay vanes which were originally idealized to capture the kinetic energy lopes de almeida 2017 are also a remarkable way of increasing the dissipation coefficient of the device we will finally compare the experimental results based on m0 with the results based on the coefficients k r k t and k d it must be previously underlined that both analysis cannot perfectly match because the analysis based on m0 e g figs 12 21 relies on data with t 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s and 1 45 s whereas the analysis based on the coefficients k r k t and k d e g figs 22 24 relies on data with some different periods t 0 86 s 0 98 s 1 35 s 1 45 s because of goda s relative gauge spacing requirements furthermore the analysis based on m0 used values taken in an arbitrary reference wave height of h 0 06 m whereas the analysis based on the coefficients k r k t and k d is much more global because it is based on average values computed with all the wave heights as previously mentioned in the analysis based on m0 the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy with stay vanes installed are approximately 40 of the corresponding values without stay vanes by picking the previously presented transmission coefficients the corresponding ratio can be computed by k t stay vanes 2 k t no stay vanes 2 47 which fairly compares with corresponding value of 40 in the analysis based on m0 is was observed that by dividing the percentages of the incoming wave energy dissipated with stay vanes installed by the corresponding values without stay vanes the energy dissipation increases by a factor that goes from 1 4 to 2 5 which corresponds to an average factor of 2 0 on the other hand the corresponding factor can be computed by k d stay vanes 2 k d no stay vanes 2 2 5 which fairly compares with the previously referred factor of 2 0 4 conclusions this article demonstrated that a laboratorial set up can be successfully implemented to experimentally assess energy dissipation provided by a new wave energy converter subjected to monochromatic waves recurring to resistive wave gauges to record water level time series and spectral analysis to compute wave state average energy density a total of 260 laboratory tests were conducted in a wave flume equipped with a wave gauge located upstream the reefs small scale model and two wave gauges located downstream the device providing data that enabled the computation of 780 wave spectra the analysis of these experimental results provided the conclusions presented herein except in one situation the reefs model always produced a reduction of incident wave energy energy reduction was detectable by comparing the zero order moment of the wave spectra computed upstream and downstream the device for equal conditions of the incident wave the reefs model equipped with exterior stay vanes always exhibited a superior capacity for dissipating wave energy this demonstrated the usefulness of the exterior stay vanes as a differentiating characteristic of this device the reefs model energy dissipating capacity when expressed by the ratio between downstream energy and upstream energy always showed a decrease as the wave period increased regardless of having the exterior stay vanes installed or not for a reefs model deprived of stay vanes and a wave period of 2 08 s corresponding to a prototype long wave with a period of 17 s the energy dissipation was null this situation showed that the reefs device deprived of stay vanes may be useless in case long waves are considered the ratio between energy dissipation with stay vanes and energy dissipation without stay vanes increased as the wave period increased this showed that from a relative point of view stay vanes dissipative effect is more important for long waves which indicates it can be a way to overcome the previously mentioned inefficiency in case long waves are considered the results based in first order moments m0 and the results based in reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients k r k t and k d consistently demonstrated a considerable passive energy dissipation in the reefs model these experimental results demonstrated that the device can behave like a submerged breakwater providing considerable passive wave energy dissipation literature review showed that reefs wave energy dissipation is not far from inferior values reported in literature for incident energy dissipation provided by submerged breakwaters subjected to short waves this indicates that the reefs novel multipurpose wave energy converter presents a good shore protection potential further research is still needed namely to analyze energy dissipation under irregular incident wave conditions it is also necessary to analyze energy dissipation under operating conditions where the device is no longer impermeable because the enveloping mesh membrane composite valve system will allow water to circulate inside it credit authorship contribution statement j p p g lopes de almeida methodology software writing review editing m f e santos martinho software data

21412,reefs is a novel multipurpose patented wave energy converter wec that combines electric energy production with shore protection the device shows some similarities with natural reefs and detached submerged breakwaters however unlike previous ones it is installed with an orthogonal alignment relative to coast line and with a greater freeboard exterior stay vanes are another distinct characteristic of the device therefore the reefs differentiating functionality of shore protection cannot be directly extrapolated from detached submerged breakwater studies and the effective energy dissipation capacity of this new wec taking into account its specific characteristics should be investigated in this article an experimental investigation of the energy dissipation potential of reefs wec was implemented a small scale physical model 1 5 100 was installed in a piston wavemaker flume and tested under regular wave conditions established by applying froude similarity to typical west portuguese sea state conditions resistive wave gauges were installed upstream and downstream the device in order to record water level time series discrete fourier transform technique was used to compute the wave energy spectra wes energy dissipation was evaluated by comparing upstream and downstream wes two versions of the device were tested i without exterior stay vanes ii with exterior stay vanes regardless of the version the reefs model proved to be able to dissipate part of the incident wave energy this capacity exhibited a dependence on the wave period globally decreasing as the wave period increased the version equipped with stay vanes always exhibited a substantially higher energy dissipation from a relative point of view stay vanes showed to be more important for long waves reefs energy dissipation was not far from the inferior values reported in literature review for submerged breakwaters of comparable dimensions confirming the expectations about its shore protection functionality keywords novel multipurpose wave energy converter submerged breakwater wave energy dissipation shore protection wave breaking wave flume 1 introduction reefs is a recently patented lopes de almeida 2019 novel multipurpose nearshore wave energy converter wec that combines electric energy production with shore protection the device makes use of the pressure and velocity fields created bellow a sea wave to create an inner steady flow that drives a submersible hydropower turbo generator to produce electricity e g fig 1 a the pressure field is harnessed through a mesh membrane composite valve system that controls inlet and outlet flows by the enveloping squared apertures illustrated in fig 1 the velocity field is harnessed by the exterior stay vanes e g fig 1 b that drive the water to the mentioned squared apertures the reefs design philosophy functioning principles preliminary power output evaluation and simplified expedient computational model were already presented in lopes de almeida 2017 lopes de almeida et al 2018 2020 where detailed descriptions can be found in its preferential construction form the reefs structure is a prefabricated concrete box with longitudinal direction parallel to the dominant wave propagation direction the device mimics the natural reefs that provide shore protection because they originate storm waves breaking which reduces its energy before reaching the coast accordingly it was named with the acronym reefs that stands for renewable electric energy from sea in fig 1 we present a profile view illustration of the reefs device in fig 2 we present a tridimensional illustration of reefs relative positioning to the coast line as stated by foteinis and tsoutsos 2017 strategies are needed to improve sustainability and economic feasibility of wec technology wec incorporation in coastal defense is presented by these authors as an innovative way to offset wec high initial capital expenditure dual wave farms for energy production and coastal protection are also suggested in abanades et al 2018 where it is demonstrated that they can be beneficial in terms of reducing both storm erosion and accretion these authors refer that these positive externalities for coastal management must be translated into incentives in economic terms for the wave farms developers they anticipate that if correctly applied the potential of this new approach will be immense to investigate the role of wave farms in coastal defense several authors developed prospective studies most of them based in numerical simulations and more rarely in experimental data palha et al 2010 analyzed the impact of pelamis wave farms in the portuguese shoreline wave state they adapted the numerical model refdif monochromatic waves to simulate energy extraction by wave farms installed in the pilot zone of the portuguese west coast near são pedro de moel between 30 m and 90 m water depth they concluded that in absolute terms there are no significant differences between wave heights observed near the coast with and without pelamis wave farms installation eugen rusu and guedes soares 2013 developed similar studies with pelamis farms for a coastal environment located north of peniche in the west portuguese coast however these authors developed simulations using the numerical model swan spectral numerical wave model from the analysis of the wave data in the nearshore they concluded that the impact of the pelamis wave farm is highly attenuated inducing a relative significant wave height decrease between 2 and 3 and not greater than 5 depending on which wave farm configuration is considered the potential coastal protection effect of other types of wave energy converters has also been studied by several authors zanuttigh and angelelli 2013 draw the attention to the need of developing sustainable solutions based on combined installation for wave energy production and coastal defence they studied the use of near shore floating wave energy converters from the wave activated body type for coastal protection based on tridimensional laboratory tests experiments considering a single dexa device in 1 30 scale and considering three dexa devices of the same type in 1 60 scale were conducted in deep water wave tank at aalborg university based on experimental results considering individual functioning and wave farm functioning 3 devices the authors concluded that these devices lead to a modest reductions of incident wave energy the dexa was also studied by mendoza et al 2014 in a comparative study that also included the seabreth wavedragon and blowjet these wecs were numerically tested in front of two beaches one of them located in the bay of santander in spain and the other in las glorias beach in mexico in both cases the long shore sediment transport was dominant the model used to reproduce the hydrodynamics induced by these devices was calibrated against experimental results from this study the authors concluded that depending on the type of device and on the location a low to moderate accretion could be achieved they concluded that although a greater shore protection could have been achieved with traditional alternatives the advantage of using wec farms is that they provide two services the wavecat is another floating wec that has been extensively studied for coastal protection purposes in abanades et al 2014a iglesias and carballo 2014 abanades et al 2014b abanades et al 2015a abanades et al 2015b bergillos et al 2018 and rodriguez delgado et al 2018 several aspects concerning wavecat farms are approached such as the evaluation of the wave farm impact on the beach profile the role of the farm to coast distance the coastal defence through wave farms the wave farm impact on beach modal state the wave farm impact on eroding deltas and the wave farm protective effect in gravel dominated coasts these approaches relied on numerical simulations sometimes incorporating data obtained from laboratory tests globally these studies have been indicating that although no remarkable reduction of coastal wave height occurs in the long term wave farms can induce accretion contributing to reduce coastal erosion installing wecs in breakwaters is an alternative approach also reported in the literature wec installation in breakwaters is quite different from using wave farms for coastal defense although both approaches share the similar aim of multipurpose functionality as reported in mustapa et al 2017 several challenges still need to be considered the main one consisting in finding suitable breakwater locations because of the necessity of carefully considering the direction of incoming wave the tidal range the wave reflection and the under water bathymetry to operate well the wec device need to be placed directly facing the incoming waves which implies that in storm conditions they are exposed to extreme loading from the wave so we may conclude that installing wecs in breakwaters is a quite limited response to the need of increasing wec coastal defense multipurpose functionality hybrid floating breakwater wec systems are an interesting alternative to installing wecs in conventional breakwaters according to dai et al 2018 floating breakwaters present some advantages such as low dependency on seabed conditions on tidal variation and on sea level raise by global warming low aesthetical impact minimal interference with water circulation and relocation flexibility as referred in zhao et al 2019 the hybrid floating breakwater wec systems represent a synergetic opportunity to convert part of the wasted energy resulting from breakwater dissipation and reflection into useful energy absorbed by the on board wec system according to this study the hybrid systems present several typologies that can be categorized as floating breakwater ob type wec systems floating breakwater owc type wec systems and floating breakwater overtopping type wec systems despite the attractiveness of the concept on what concerns cost sharing space sharing and multi functionality the hybrid floating breakwater systems still need to overcome several challenges such as assessing the performance in realistic sea states broadening the effective frequency bandwidth of the system and analyzing the survivability in extreme waves zhao et al 2019 wave breaking by means of artificial reefs or submerged breakwaters sbw was investigated by several authors such as ahrens 1987 hur et al 2003 ranasinghe et al 2006 chaplin and blenkinsopp 2008 ranasinghe et al 2010 chella et al 2015 and ryu et al 2016 as reported in ranasinghe et al 2006 conventional solutions such as groins and emergent breakwaters are becoming increasingly unpopular essentially because of their adverse impact on beach amenity and aesthetics in contrast sbws are becoming a popular option for coastal protection mostly because of their small aesthetic impact on the natural environment ranasinghe et al 2010 sbws use for coastal protection as not been a traditional option so their efficacy is still largely unknown investigating the structural and environmental conditions that determine the way shoreline responds i e shoreline erosion vs shoreline accretion to sbws is a very important subject of research which can be found in ranasinghe et al 2010 hur et al 2003 analyzed the governing parameters of the wave breaking over sbw with a prismatic shape for regular waves hur et al 2003 proposed expressions for wave breaking criteria over the central zone of the sbw those expressions clearly demonstrate the effective wave breaking capability of this type of submerged infrastructures which anticipates an effective multipurpose shore protection functionality for the reefs wec ryu et al 2016 studied the effect of the porosity of a submerged breakwater on wave fields using particle image velocimetry piv they concluded that porosity determines the different patterns of dissipated kinetic energy by comparing the stability of the wave fields for impermeable and permeable conditions they concluded that longer waves are more affected by porous media the reefs device presented in detail in lopes de almeida 2017 lopes de almeida et al 2018 and lopes de almeida et al 2020 shows some similarities with natural reefs and detached submerged breakwaters however unlike the previous ones the reefs device is installed with an orthogonal alignment relative to coast line e g fig 2 the freeboard must be large enough to avoid excessive breaking in order to ensure good wave energy resource up to about 5 m wave height the exterior stay vanes e g fig 1 b are another distinct characteristic of this device therefore the claimed functionality of shore protection cannot be directly extrapolated from detached submerged breakwater studies and the effective energy dissipation capacity of this new wec taking into account its specific characteristics should be investigated the main objective of this article is to report the experimental work developed to assess reefs potential usefulness for coastal protection based on the evaluation of the passive wave energy dissipation in the device such evaluation has never been done before and will enable to demonstrate the claimed patented differentiating shore protection functionality the criteria adopted to measure energy dissipation was based on the computation of the downstream and upstream wave energy density given the complexity of the phenomena an experimental approach was adopted a small scale model 1 5 100 was installed in a piston wavemaker flume and portuguese west coast sea state conditions were simulated using froude similarity the device was tested in shutoff conditions to comply with storm conditions considered in the sea state scenarios analysis and discussion of the experimental results will be presented to support conclusions about the extent of coastal protection multipurpose functionality that can be attributed to the reefs wec 2 materials and methods the key objective of this section is to present the materials and methods used to evaluate reefs wave energy dissipation capability the reduction of incoming wave energy density provided by the device was considered as the guiding parameter it was evaluated by comparing downstream and upstream wave energy density experimental evaluation of upstream and downstream wave energy density was based in reefs small scale model 1 5 100 installation and testing in the 36 m long 1 m wide and 1 2 m high piston wavemaker flume of the laboratory of hydraulics water resources and environment lhwre of the civil engineering department of the university of coimbra uc the wave flume was equipped with twin wire resistive 300 mm long wave gauges e g p0 p1 p2 and p3 in figs 3 and 4 and a downstream beach preceded by a permeable fabric to minimize wave reflection e g fig 3 wave gauges p2 and p3 were positioned at the same distance 9 1 m from the upstream top of the wave flume they were uniformly distributed with 1 3 m spacing along the width of the flume e g fig 4 in order to better characterize the average downstream irregular wave state the corresponding laboratorial experimental set up described in detail in santos martinho 2017 is schematically illustrated in figs 3 and 4 the reefs small scale model 1 5 100 was available from previous experiments described in lopes de almeida 2017 and lopes de almeida et al 2018 the model is essentially made of acrylic steel and plastic presenting a rectangular parallelepiped shape with 1 32 m long 0 30 m wide and a total height of 0 18 m base included as illustrated in fig 5 a as described in lopes de almeida 2017 the reefs body was connected to an axial turbine module e g fig 1 a to demonstrate its ability to drive a rotary machine however the objective of the present study is to evaluate the shore protection potential therefore the sea wave conditions selected for laboratorial simulations must include wave heights corresponding to storm conditions in these situations it is not realistic to consider that the turbine will be operating consequently the turbine module illustrated in fig 1 a was removed and inner flow blocked to replicate turbine shutoff this procedure was extended to simulations with smaller wave heights by two major reasons i the objective of the study will focus in evaluating passive wave energy dissipation provided by the device i e without the help of extra energy dissipation mechanisms such as turbine operation ii maintaining turbine shutoff in all simulated sea state conditions will ensure a uniform infrastructural condition that reduces complexity in data analysis and interpretation the reefs device was tested considering two alternative configurations i without the metallic exterior stay vanes installed as represented in fig 5 a ii with the metallic exterior stay vanes installed as represented in fig 5 b to ensure uniform depth in all the wave gauges the sand box i e lowest flume bottom in fig 3 was partially covered in its upstream zone by an extension platform e g fig 3 the fundamental steps of the experimental procedure can be summarized as follows 1 install a 1 5 100 reefs small scale physical model sspm in the wave flume 2 install and calibrate resistive wave gauges upstream p0 p1 and downstream p2 p3 the reefs sspm 3 submit the sspm to simulated sea state conditions of west portuguese coast recurring to the froude similarity to compute the corresponding laboratorial monochromatic wave characteristics to be inputted in the wavemaker control software 4 compute the wave energy density upstream and downstream the sspm by processing the wave gauge water level time series using spectral analysis 5 evaluate energy dissipation by comparing average wave energy density upstream and downstream the reefs sspm mechanical energy of gravity water waves at a given time instant is composed by two parcels the potential energy which is determined by the instantaneous wave water particles positioning relative to a horizontal datum and the kinetic energy which is determined by the instantaneous velocities of all the wave water particles for monochromatic waves it is possible to derive expressions that provide averaged values over a wave period of wave mechanical energy for instance in case of waves propagating in stokes 1st and 2nd order theory validity domain the very well known expression of the average wave energy density e is dean and dalrymple 1991 1 e 1 8 ρ g h 2 where ρ is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the wave height equation 1 can be used to compute wave energy density in the upstream wave gauge i e fig 3 p0 and p1 because as previously mentioned the experimental tests were developed considering monochromatic incident waves when monochromatic waves approach nearshore surrounding environment with low depth bathymetry and maritime structures they can suffer complex transformations including wave breaking that leads to profound modification of initial wave profile in such situations the subsequent sea surface often becomes irregular as the result of the chaotic and highly turbulent processes involved after such dramatic events energy density cannot be computed by equation 1 because the monochromatic character of incident wave is no longer present the latter described situation applies to the downstream part of the experimental installation where wave gauges p2 and p3 are installed e g figs 3 and 4 indeed in most of the experimental tests the incident monochromatic wave approaching the reefs small scale model suffered a sudden and strong modification when passing over it resulting in subsequent irregular wave profile downstream the device fig 6 summarizes the main components of the laboratorial experimental set up to measure wave water level time series four twin wire resistive hr wallingford wave gauges with 300 mm hr wallingford 2019a were installed two upstream p0 and p1 and the remaining two downstream p2 and p3 as mentioned before e g fig 6 b and c they are comprised of two parallel fixed wires which are installed vertically and perpendicular to the flow direction a high frequency alternating current is passed through the wires the conductance between the two parallel fixed vertical wires varies depending on the portion of the wires submerged by the flow by following a previous calibration procedure the measured conductance can be converted into water surface elevation the resistive wave gauges were connected to a hr wallingford wave probe monitor system hr wallingford 2019a which was connected to a personal computer e g fig 6 a the software hr waves data acquisition and analysis software program hr wallingford 2019b was used in the calibration data processing and monitoring e g fig 6 a a computer with the wave maker control

actuators of the piston wavemakers e g fig 6 g of the wave flume e g fig 6 d in fig 6 b the reefs sspm is equipped with exterior stay vanes in fig 6 c the reefs sspm has no exterior stay vanes and the extension platform is still not installed data recording was only activated 60 s after wavemaker start the objective of this initial period was to ensure flow stabilization after the data was recorded during 60 s with a time step of 0 0586 s ensuring wave water level time series with 1024 values after wavemaker stop there was a pause of about 10 min for complete reestablishment of still water level during this period the collected data was inspected to check eventual malfunctioning that would require the repetition of the experiment wave gauge calibration was periodically repeated to account for water temperature variation or water composition variation the prototype wave characteristics considered in this research were similar to those considered in the previous studies with the same device reported in lopes de almeida 2017 and lopes de almeida et al 2018 the wave periods varied from 6 s 7 s 8 s 9 s 10 s 11 s 12 s plus an exploratory period of 17 s the wave heights varied from approximately h 0 7 m to h 6 0 m and water depth was d 18 3 m gravity water waves propagation is essentially governed by gravity pressure and inertia forces therefore froude similarity was adopted to compute the time scale e t after geometrical scale e l 1 5 100 was established lopes de almeida et al 2018 2 e t e l 1 22475 10 1 with the geometrical and time scales we can compute the model wave characteristics model wave periods varied from 0 73 s 0 86 s 0 98 s 1 10 s 1 22 s 1 35 s 1 45 s plus an exploratory period of 2 08 s the wave heights varied from about h 1 cm to h 9 cm the water depth was d 27 5 cm a total of 260 experiments were performed during several weeks they comprised two situations i in half of the experiments the small scale model was deprived from the exterior stay vanes ii in the other half of the experiments the small scale model was equipped with the exterior stay vanes the experimental data used in this article was obtained by the second author in the ambitus of his m sc thesis research santos martinho 2017 fig 7 illustrates one of these experiments for an incident monochromatic wave with period t 0 98 s height h 4 7 cm propagating at a water depth d 27 5 cm over the reefs small scale model equipped with exterior stay vanes e g fig 5 b from fig 7 it is perceivable that water surface displacements relative to the mean water level η t near the wave gauges p2 and p3 are irregular randomly changing in space and time if we consider that such random phenomenon can be described by a stochastic process similar to the one considered in sea state characterization we will be able to compute the energy density by spectral analysis ochi 2005 spectral analysis is a technique that transforms a time domain representation in to a frequency domain representation time domain wave water level records can be processed using the discrete fourier transform dft technique smith 2007 to obtain the wave energy spectra wes sometimes called spectral density function ochi 2005 wave spectra or even variance spectrum because it became common practice to simply plot half of the square of wave amplitude instead of the wave energy density world meteorological organization 2018 the wes is a 2d plot of the spectral density function s f that provides an immediate perception of the average wave energy density distribution by the wave frequencies f fig 8 presents an expressive illustration of the transformation of a real wave water level time series time domain into a wave spectra frequency domain very important parameters can be derived from wes by computing the moments of the spectrum the nth moment of the wes is defined as world meteorological organization 2018 ochi 2005 3 m n 0 f n s f d f for n 0 we get the zero order moment m 0 4 m 0 0 s f d f the zero order moment m 0 is the total area under the s f curve e g fig 8 it is a very important value because it represents the average energy density of the sea state ochi 2005 in the experimental work reported in this article the dft technique was applied to process the water level time series of wave gauges p2 and p3 in order to derive the wes despite the availability of spectral analysis functionality in previously mentioned software the dft was implemented using fourier analysis function available in analysis toolpak of microsoft excel microsoft 2019 due to its generalized compatibility and availability dft requires that the number of time series data points dp must satisfy the condition 5 d p 2 n where n is an integer number a total number of 260 experiments each of them producing 3 wave gauge time series had to be processed therefore a total number of 780 dft had to be computed which required a considerable amount of time initial sensitivity analysis showed that using 512 time series data points d p 2 9 instead of 1024 time series data points d p 2 10 could save a considerable time without noticeable modifications in the results leading us to adopt dp 512 the nyquist frequency represents the highest resolvable frequency that can be computed from the wave record it is computed using the time series step δ t according to the following equation leis 2011 6 f n y q u i s t 1 2 δ t the experimental data was recorded with δ t 0 0586 s therefore the highest resolvable frequency is f n y q u i s t 8 5324 hz the rayleigh frequency represents the lowest resolvable frequency that can be computed from the wave record kleinfeld and mitra 2014 it is computed using the time series step δ t and the total number of data points dp according to the following equation 7 f r a y l e i g h 1 n p δ t as mentioned before dp 512 therefore the lowest resolvable frequency is f r a y l e i g h 0 0333 hz from this inferior value the component frequencies are consecutively incremented by 0 0333 hz until nyquist frequency is achieved the total number of component frequencies 0 0333 hz 0 0666 hz 0 0999 hz 8 5324 hz is 256 corresponding to np 2 keeping in mind that experimental incident wave periods varied from t 0 73 s 1 3698 hz to t 2 08 s 0 4808 hz we can observe that the component frequency range is large enough to detect possible wave energy transfer to considerably shorter or longer waves once wes is computed equation 4 can be applied to calculate the m0 value which represents the average energy density of the irregular wave state near wave gauges p2 and p3 this method was also applied to the upstream wave gauge p1 which enabled to double check the computation of the incoming monochromatic average wave energy density recurring to equation 1 as it will be exemplified in the next section 3 results and discussion to obtain the average energy density reduction provided by the reefs small scale model a total of 780 wave spectra were computed common practice drops the term ρ g of equation 1 and simply plots a 2 2 along the vertical axis of the wave spectra were a is the wave amplitude a h 2 in this article we will adopt the previous mentioned representation of the wave spectra once it is impossible to present all the computed wave spectra we will illustrate the procedure taking as example the experiment presented in fig 7 after we will present the results of all the computed wave spectra in a condensate manner based in graphical representation of the corresponding m0 values in fig 9 we present the wave spectra corresponding to the wave profile partially shown in fig 7 a the total length of each processed wave profile was 512 data points the average energy density of the wave represented in fig 7 a can be computed with equation 1 because it is a monochromatic wave in stokes 2nd order theory validity domain the resulting value is 2 7 j m 2 on the other hand the wave spectrum of fig 9 provides the average energy density of the referred monochromatic wave which is m0 0 000277 m2 therefore the two values of energy density e should mach however to compare them we must previously convert m0 by multiplying it by the water density 1000 kg m 3 and the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 as expected the resulting value is 2 7 j m 2 confirming the one previously obtained a double check computation of incident wave average energy density was done in all the experiments where equation 1 was applicable in figs 10 and 11 we present the wave spectra corresponding to the wave profiles partially shown in fig 7 b and c the total length of each processed wave profile was 512 data points by comparing fig 9 with both figs 10 and 11 we can clearly perceive a large energy density reduction from wave gauge p1 m0 0 000277 m2 to both p2 m0 0 000060 m2 and p3 m0 0 000058 m2 this energy dissipation is produced by partial or total wave breaking over the reefs model that acts like a pseudo submerged breakwater the energy reduction from p1 to both p2 and p3 is accompanied by a partial transfer of the incident wave energy to waves with higher frequencies shorter waves this is particularly visible in case of fig 10 wave gauge p2 energy reduction from upstream to downstream and energy transfer to higher frequencies second order and third order components was a general behavior identified in the remaining experiments although with considerably varying magnitude this behavior is in accordance with the literature for the case of breaking waves within the surf zone where it was found that the large decrease in energy flux observed across the surf zone in the energetic part of the wave spectrum is balanced closely by the estimated nonlinear energy transfers from the spectral peak to higher frequencies herbers et al 2000 this behavior was also described when a wave propagates over a bar by beji and battjes 1993 that developed laboratory experiments to elucidate the phenomenon of high frequency energy generation observed in the power spectra of waves traveling over submerged bars by comparing the wave spectra in wave gauges p2 fig 10 and p3 fig 11 we can observe that energy distribution pattern by the component frequencies is not the same however the total energy density is similar in both wave gauges m0 0 000060 m2 p2 and m0 0 000058 m2 p3 in most of the experiments the average energy density in wave gauges p2 and p3 was similar however to account for some differences the average of p2 and p3 values was adopted as the guiding parameter to define downstream wave state energy density the m0 values of the computed wave spectra were organized using the period of the incoming wave as the main guiding parameter for each period a pair of graphs will be presented the first graph corresponding to the device without stay vanes installed and the second one corresponding to the device with stay vanes installed the stay vanes are a differentiating characteristic of the concept therefore the objective of these dual comparisons is to evaluate its impact in energy dissipation for each graph presented in next figs 12 21 the average energy density in p1 and p2 p3 m0 in vertical axis will be plotted against the height of the incident wave h in horizontal axis the theoretical value of m0 corresponding to the height of the monochromatic incident wave in p1 will also be plotted m0 1 8 h2 we would like to underline that due to some inevitable reflections from upstream face of the reefs small scale model as well as from the downstream beach some constructive or destructive interference with the wavemaker incoming wave occurred they were detected by slight variations of p1 zero crossing wave heights during the analysis of the recorded water level time series therefore the wave height to be associated to each incoming wave required a previous analysis of p1 wave profile in order to compute the zero crossing wave heights after an average of the zero crossing wave heights was computed and adopted as the incoming wave height to be used in the graphs wave energy depends on the square of the wave height therefore the previous procedure is only acceptable to normalize very slight wave heights variations an alternative normalization procedure is to compute a conventional incoming wave height corresponding to the m0 value of the wave spectra measured in p1 this is easily done by combining equations 1 and 4 the latter requiring the multiplicative term ρ g as previously mentioned the only requirement is the assumption that equation 1 holds its validity in all the range of performed experiments both methods were implemented the second one leading to slightly better curve adjustments due to the extensive number of graphs to be displayed we will only retain the ones corresponding to the second method moreover to do not overload the article with excessive graphs we will jump intermediate wave periods of the performed sequence of experiments i e we will only present wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s plus the exploratory period of 2 08 s which are depicted in the next figs 12 21 by analyzing each pair figs 12 and 13 figs 14 and 15 figs 16 and 17 figs 18 and 19 and figs 20 and 21 it is clearly perceivable that reefs model equipped with exterior stay vanes always provides a higher wave energy dissipation this effect was predictable once the exterior stay vanes originate an increased macro roughness and block the inferior part of orbital water trajectories induced by the passing wave figs 12 14 16 18 and 20 show that energy dissipation decreases as the wave period increases adopting as a reference the values measured in the right vertical line h 0 06 m of the reference dashed square we obtained ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy of 40 58 59 72 and 100 for wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s and 2 08 s respectively they correspond to percentages of incident wave energy dissipation of 60 42 41 28 and 0 respectively a particular situation is the one depicted by fig 20 there we can see that p1 and p2 p3 curves are practically overlapping its relative positioning being essentially conditioned by the experimental error margin this shows that for a very long wave t 2 08 s in model corresponds to t 17 s in prototype the energy dissipation is practically null if the device is deprived of stay vanes figs 13 15 17 19 and 21 confirm that energy dissipation also decreases as wave period increases when stay vanes are installed however the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy in the same reference abscissa h 0 06 m are lower 16 22 26 29 and 66 for wave periods of 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s 1 45 s and 2 08 s respectively they correspond to higher percentages of incident wave energy dissipation of 84 78 74 71 and 34 respectively the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy with stay vanes installed are approximately 40 of the corresponding values without stay vanes for wave periods varying from 0 73 s to 1 45 s which demonstrates its favorable dissipative effect by dividing the percentages of the incoming wave energy dissipated with stay vanes installed by the corresponding values without stay vanes we conclude that stay vanes increase energy dissipation by a factor that goes from 1 4 to 2 5 when the wave period rises from 0 73 s to 1 45 s this shows that from a relative point of view stay vanes dissipative effect is more important for long waves the stay vanes create a macro roughness that is somewhat comparable to an enveloping porosity in the sense that it allows some local circulation but at the expense of large energy dissipation from this perspective it agrees with the conclusion presented in ryu et al 2016 when comparing the wave fields for impermeable and permeable breakwaters from these observations we can conclude that longer waves are more affected by porous media ahrens examined energy dissipated by submerged and emerged breakwaters through extensive laboratory tests he concluded that for short wave periods the submerged breakwaters dissipates about 80 90 of the incident energy ahrens 1987 based on the referential experimental values mentioned in this article the average effective energy dissipation for reefs model deprived of stay vanes is 43 period range from 0 73 s until 1 45 s for the case of reefs model equipped with stay vanes the average energy dissipation is 68 period range from 0 73 s until 2 08 s this last value is not too far from the inferior value of 80 reported in ahrens 1987 when a wave approaches an obstacle such as a submerged breakwater some of the energy is reflected and some is locally dissipated the remaining energy is transmitted to the lee of the breakwater reflection k r dissipation k d and transmission k t coefficients are classical parameters used to characterize the breakwater impact on wave transformation the reflection coefficient k r is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave height h r to the incident wave height h i mckee et al 2018 8 k r h r h i similarly the wave transmission coefficient can be defined by the following equation 9 k t h t h i where h t is the transmitted wave height peña et al 2011 identifying the transmitted wave height may not be an easy task because energy dissipation process may originate irregular waves in the lee of the submerged breakwater a way to overcome such difficulty is to calculate transmission coefficient based on the wes of the incident and transmitted waves as proposed in liang et al 2020 the 1st order moments of the incident and transmitted wes m0 i and m0 t respectively are proportional to the energy density of the corresponding wave states therefore the transmission coefficient can then be calculated by 10 k t m 0 t m 0 i once reflection k r and dissipation k d coefficients are known the dissipation coefficient k d can be derived based on the energy conservation law liang et al 2020 and seeling and ahrens 1981 11 k d 2 k r 2 k t 2 1 several methods have been proposed to evaluate the reflection coefficient as discussed in varghese et al 2016 zhi 2018 and mckee et al 2018 if only two fixed upstream water level wave gauges are available the well known goda s method for estimation of incident and reflected waves in random wave experiments can be adopted goda and suzuki 1976 goda 2010 liang et al 2020 this is the case of the present experimental set up e g figs 3 and 4 therefore this method was applied to the data collected in wave gauges p0 and p1 for t 0 78 s t 0 86 s t 0 98 s t 1 10 s t 1 22 s t 1 35 s and t 1 47 s data corresponding to the very long wave t 2 08 s was not considered because no conclusive reflection coefficient could be calculated when stay vanes were not installed e g fig 20 according to goda and suzuki 1976 the method is not valid when relative gauge spacing is near δ l l n 2 n 0 1 2 therefore situations with t 0 73 s t 1 10 s and t 1 22 s add to be excluded as illustrated by the shadowed cells of table 1 in fig 22 we present the k r coefficient variation with wave period the dft technique was used to compute the a1 b1 a2 and b2 amplitudes of the goda s method goda and suzuki 1976 goda 2010 in order to obtain the incident and reflected wave amplitudes after the reflection coefficient was computed using equation 8 for each wave period all the experimental wave heights were considered and the corresponding average k r coefficient was computed from fig 22 we can see that the reflection coefficient is low showing a tendency to slightly decrease as the wave period increases as expectable stay vanes installation originates an increase of the reflection coefficient in fig 23 we present the k t coefficient variation with wave period it was obtained by replacing the first order moment of the wes in p1 incident wave and the average of first order moments of the wes in p2 and p3 transmitted wave in equation 10 the k t coefficient was computed as in the previous case i e for each wave period it was averaged among all wave heights from fig 23 we can observe that stay vanes installation originates a remarkable decrease of the transmission coefficient contrary to what happens with the reflection coefficient the transmission coefficient shows a tendency to increase as the wave period increases in fig 24 we present the k d coefficient variation with wave period it was computed by applying equation 11 to the previously computed k r and k t values presented in figs 22 and 23 from fig 24 we can observe as expectable that stay vanes installation considerably increases the energy dissipation contrary to the transmission coefficient the dissipation coefficient shows a tendency to decrease as wave period increases the average values from figs 22 and 23 considering that stay vanes are installed are k r 16 and k t 59 leading to k d 79 the corresponding values considering that stay vanes are installed are k r 11 k t 86 and k d 50 the stay vanes installation adds 5 cm in each side of the reefs model cross section this represents a global width increase by a factor of 1 3 comparatively the increase in the average k d coefficient is about 1 6 this indicates that stay vanes which were originally idealized to capture the kinetic energy lopes de almeida 2017 are also a remarkable way of increasing the dissipation coefficient of the device we will finally compare the experimental results based on m0 with the results based on the coefficients k r k t and k d it must be previously underlined that both analysis cannot perfectly match because the analysis based on m0 e g figs 12 21 relies on data with t 0 73 s 0 98 s 1 22 s and 1 45 s whereas the analysis based on the coefficients k r k t and k d e g figs 22 24 relies on data with some different periods t 0 86 s 0 98 s 1 35 s 1 45 s because of goda s relative gauge spacing requirements furthermore the analysis based on m0 used values taken in an arbitrary reference wave height of h 0 06 m whereas the analysis based on the coefficients k r k t and k d is much more global because it is based on average values computed with all the wave heights as previously mentioned in the analysis based on m0 the ratios of downstream wave energy to upstream wave energy with stay vanes installed are approximately 40 of the corresponding values without stay vanes by picking the previously presented transmission coefficients the corresponding ratio can be computed by k t stay vanes 2 k t no stay vanes 2 47 which fairly compares with corresponding value of 40 in the analysis based on m0 is was observed that by dividing the percentages of the incoming wave energy dissipated with stay vanes installed by the corresponding values without stay vanes the energy dissipation increases by a factor that goes from 1 4 to 2 5 which corresponds to an average factor of 2 0 on the other hand the corresponding factor can be computed by k d stay vanes 2 k d no stay vanes 2 2 5 which fairly compares with the previously referred factor of 2 0 4 conclusions this article demonstrated that a laboratorial set up can be successfully implemented to experimentally assess energy dissipation provided by a new wave energy converter subjected to monochromatic waves recurring to resistive wave gauges to record water level time series and spectral analysis to compute wave state average energy density a total of 260 laboratory tests were conducted in a wave flume equipped with a wave gauge located upstream the reefs small scale model and two wave gauges located downstream the device providing data that enabled the computation of 780 wave spectra the analysis of these experimental results provided the conclusions presented herein except in one situation the reefs model always produced a reduction of incident wave energy energy reduction was detectable by comparing the zero order moment of the wave spectra computed upstream and downstream the device for equal conditions of the incident wave the reefs model equipped with exterior stay vanes always exhibited a superior capacity for dissipating wave energy this demonstrated the usefulness of the exterior stay vanes as a differentiating characteristic of this device the reefs model energy dissipating capacity when expressed by the ratio between downstream energy and upstream energy always showed a decrease as the wave period increased regardless of having the exterior stay vanes installed or not for a reefs model deprived of stay vanes and a wave period of 2 08 s corresponding to a prototype long wave with a period of 17 s the energy dissipation was null this situation showed that the reefs device deprived of stay vanes may be useless in case long waves are considered the ratio between energy dissipation with stay vanes and energy dissipation without stay vanes increased as the wave period increased this showed that from a relative point of view stay vanes dissipative effect is more important for long waves which indicates it can be a way to overcome the previously mentioned inefficiency in case long waves are considered the results based in first order moments m0 and the results based in reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients k r k t and k d consistently demonstrated a considerable passive energy dissipation in the reefs model these experimental results demonstrated that the device can behave like a submerged breakwater providing considerable passive wave energy dissipation literature review showed that reefs wave energy dissipation is not far from inferior values reported in literature for incident energy dissipation provided by submerged breakwaters subjected to short waves this indicates that the reefs novel multipurpose wave energy converter presents a good shore protection potential further research is still needed namely to analyze energy dissipation under irregular incident wave conditions it is also necessary to analyze energy dissipation under operating conditions where the device is no longer impermeable because the enveloping mesh membrane composite valve

21413,risk analysis is of paramount importance in maritime transportation due to the particularly hazardous nature of the work while the international maritime organization imo has circulated formal safety assessment fsa for the assessment of on board risk it has not introduced a specific tool for risk analysis and a more proactive approach to the assessment of risk is consequently sought by maritime safety researchers this paper aims to demonstrate how the fuzzy bow tie method of analysis might be deployed to quantitatively analyse risk focussing on the specific context of ship to ship sts cargo operations enables specific insights into the method to be gained the findings of the research can be utilised by maritime safety professionals sts superintends mooring masters tanker safety inspectors company fleet managers and tanker shipowners in order to mitigate potential risks and enhance marine safety during the sts operation keywords risk analysis fuzzy bow tie collision sts operation 1 introduction the issue of safety at sea has a very important place in the maritime industry in terms of minimizing marine accidents and the impact of these accidents on human life the environment and the commodities being transported in order to improve safety at sea a wide range of rules and regulations have been adopted over time the imo is a regulatory body related to shipping and maritime activities it works to enhance safety at sea and minimize potential risks the american bureau of shipping abs 2014 defines risk as a combination of the contingency of an occurrence of dangerous events and the severity of injury and damage that this event can cause one major pillar of the imo is the safety of life at sea solas convention whose provisions aim to safeguard the safety of merchant ships the main purpose of the solas convention is to provide minimum standards for the safe operation of vessels and to improve operational safety at sea with codes such as the international safety management ism international maritime dangerous goods code imdg etc in addition the imo introduced the formal safety assessment fsa for maritime stakeholders in order to improve safety at sea by conducting risk analysis gul et al 2017 besides paragraph 1 of the ism code addresses risk by defining the requirements of risk assessment according to the code all companies should evaluate the crew the marine environment vessels and all risks on board ism 2010 nonetheless despite all these affords to enhance safety at sea the maritime sector still carries a high risk of accidents in order to ensure safety the risk factor must be maintained at an acceptable level hereby risk assessment plays a critical role in increasing safety in the maritime industry akyuz and celik 2015a in particular because of the cargoes transported by tankers are flammable explosive and environmental pollutants tanker activities such as cargo handling berthing unberthing tank cleaning tank maintenance inerting gas freeing and sts cargo transferring have extensive risks although risk assessment is of paramount importance for the tanker operations there has been limited research focused on the topic to date in this context current study describes a quantitative risk analysis for ship collision contact during sts cargo transfer since this operation poses potential harm to the human and maritime environment a robust numerical method including fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta is employed under a fuzzy sets environment enabling the empirical analysis and description of operational failures during sts operations the top event te is selected as collision contact of ships during sts operations accordingly the paper is organised as follows this section gives motivation behind the study section 2 conducts comprehensive literature reviewing section 3 introduces methodology section 4 performs quantitative risk analysing through sts operation section 5 gives conclusion and potential contribution of the study 2 literature reviewing within the field of maritime industry a wide range of studies exist on the topic of risk assessment such as maritime collision chai et al 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2015 grounding mazaheri et al 2016 akhtar utne 2014 and fire or explosion li and huang 2012 maritime operations sakar and zorba 2017 arslan et al 2017 because accidents on tankers are more likely to cause serious damages injuries and environmental pollution much of the risk assessment literature has focussed on this class of ship for instance goerlandt and montewka 2014 proposed a bayesian network bn model for reasoning under uncertainty for the assessment of accidental cargo oil outflow in a ship ship collision where a tanker is struck the model provides a reasonable estimate of possible oil outflows under various scenarios another risk analysis performed by akyuz and celik 2015b focussed on the process of on board gas freeing aboard crude oil tankers in the paper a fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel method is used likewise hsu et al 2017 conducted a risk analysis for operational safety of oil tankers the authors utilised a revised risk matrix based on a fuzzy analytic hierarchical process fahp akyuz 2015 discussed risks deriving from human factor related to the gas inerting process on board crude oil tankers in the paper cognitive reliability and error analysing method cream was used to quantify such risks the bow tie method is a widely used approach that deals with the main causes and effects of risk there are some examples of risk assessment in offshore industries which utilise bow tie methodology abimbola et al 2014 khakzad et al 2013 ferdous et al 2012 however application of the bow tie method to maritime risk assessment is relatively rare due to the lack of data acquisition mokhtari et al 2011 used the method to perform a causal risk analysis of sea ports and offshore terminals the authors integrated fuzzy event tree analysis and fuzzy fault tree analysis to identify risk factors in this context another study adopting the bow tie method analysed potential risks in

both an ft fault tree and an event tree et to establish the potential causes and results of the undesired event respectively the links between the accident and its possible causes are indicated by the fault tree while the accident and its possible consequences can be represented using the event tree mokhtari et al 2011 in this paper the bow tie method will be utilised under a fuzzy sets environment to tackle with vagueness of expert judgement since there is lack of numerical data in maritime transportation the integration of bow tie method and fuzzy sets are described as follows 3 3 fuzzy bow tie approach in this study fault tree analysis and event tree analysis are combined under a fuzzy cluster environment since human error data scarcity is one of the significant challenges to risk analysis in the maritime industry fig 1 shows the conceptual framework of the fuzzy bow tie approach 3 3 1 build up ft diagram the ft scheme was established to estimate the probability of occurrence of the top event te which is the most important event in the system the consequences of which are potentially destructive to the human commodity and maritime environments in addition an ft diagram can give the importance of each be basic event which reflects the influence rate of failure causes on the top event all these events connect each other with using standard logic gates and or etc ferdous et al 2011 3 3 2 obtain failure data from expert judgement due to the lack of operational data in the maritime sector expert judgements are commonly used to provide practical solutions to risk assessment lavasani et al 2015 experts give their opinions on those bes which constitute the sub events of the fault tree and the start point of the error chain however because the experts have different levels of experience education and accumulation of knowledge the relative weight of their opinions on each attribute is likely to vary yuhua and datao 2005 developed an expert weighting

used to calculate the possibility of each be hsu and chen 1994 proposed an expert elicitation methodology for non homogeneous groups of experts the method known as similarity aggregation method sam converts linguistic terms to their corresponding fuzzy numbers and aggregates the individual opinions of experts the basic steps of sam methodology are provided below step 1 aggregating obtained possibility in the first step of sam the possibilities are aggregated aggregation calculations are applied for subjective quantitative data coming from m experts in order to realize this purpose suppose each expert e k k 1 2 m expresses his her opinion on a particular attribute contrasted with a specific context by a predefined set of linguistic variables thereafter the linguistic terms of

in the equation x denotes the fuzzy possibility u i x defines aggregated membership function and x states the output variable step 3 converting possibilities to probabilities in the last step possibilities gathered from experts judgements are converted into probabilities for this purpose onisawa 1988 proposed a formula which is used to transform fuzzy faılure from possibility to probability the fuzzy probability score f p r can be taken from the f p s the following equations are used 8 p r 1 10 k f p s 0 0 f p s 0 9 k 1 f p s f p s 1 3 2 301 6 1 computation of mcss and te failure probability a minimal cut set mcs is a group of basic events comprising the critical elements of the ft the structural vulnerability of the system can be determined using an mcs it means that the more mcss the more dangerous the system is the bes are undesired events in the system and if all bes under the mcs succeed the te will occur identifying mcss is also important from the perspective of risk the mcs ranking is used to represent the importance of each mcs to the occurrence of the te the mcss can be ranked using the vesely fussell importance measure v fim method in other words sensitivity of te s probability is computed via ranking the mcss for their contribution to te probability and importance level of mcss in this study v fim is used to analyse the sensitivity ünver et al 2019 this method provides numerical significance for bes specified in the fault tree and is expressed as follows 10 i i v f t q i t q s t where i i v f t defines the magnitude of m c i q i t the probability of the occurrence failure represented by cut set i and q s t gives the probability of the occurrence failure of te in all mcs 6 2 construct event tree diagram an et diagram is used to determine the route from an initiating event of the failure to the various consequences and the expected frequency of each consequence it also describes the safety functions designed to tackle the initial event and the sequence of events needed to improve system safety 6 3 calculate the probabilities for consequences in this step the probabilities for each potential consequences are calculated under a fuzzy set environment expert judgements are utilised to convert linguistic assessment into numerical value this requires the application of the similarity aggregation method sam and centre of area coa methodologies described previously equations 8 and 9 are used to transform possibilities to probabilities then the traditional event tree equation is applied to calculate probabilities for each consequence ferdous et al 2011 6 4 analysis of results the final step provides the outcomes where the potential consequences of the te are analysed to determine risk 7 the case of ship collision during the sts operation in this section the case of ship collision contact during the sts operation is examined in order to demonstrate the application of risk analysis using the fuzzy bow tie method 7 1 sts operation in tanker ships the sts operation refers to the transhipment of cargoes such as crude oil liquefied gas bulk cargo and petroleum products between two vessels the discharging vessels positioned alongside each other during the sts operation are known as the ship to be lightened sbl and the loading vessel the service ship ss ocimf 2009 in cases where vessels are unable to berth owing to the port fees and draught restrictions the sts operation is performed in the open seas the cargo transfer procedure can be carried out either while vessels are at anchor or underway ics 2011 sts operations are achieved in accordance with guidelines or recommendations identified by the oil companies international marine forum ocimf society of international gas tanker and terminal operators sigtto chemical distribution institute cdi international chamber of shipping ics and the international maritime organization imo sts transfer guide 2013 the purpose of these documents is to guide those involved in the planning and implementation of sts operations such as masters superintendents and sts service operators the amendments to chapter 8 of marpol annex i of the protocol of 1978 for the prevention of pollution from ships constituted the first important convention establishing common rules during sts transfer operations regulation 41 of the marpol convention required any oil tanker involved in sts operation to have a plan for conducting the sts operation despite international recommendations the sts operation still involves many dangers such as collision fire explosion oil spill etc since the two ships maneuver at close range during the sts operation the most prevalent accident is that of collision contact between vessels therefore collision contact during sts operation is chosen as the top event in the study 7 2 problem statement collision contact between the two vessels is the most widespread type of accident that occurs during sts operations ventikos and stavrou 2013 sts operation is severely affected by variables such as environmental conditions wind swell current etc personnel capabilities the maneuvering performance of each vessel and the specific area for the transfer shallow or deep waters suitability for maneuver etc since the collision of two ships may lead to severe consequences such as loss of life marine pollution capsizing or flooding a risk analysis is essential to enhance safety and minimize failures that may cause collision during sts operation 7 3 analysis of respondents since there is a lack of data in maritime transportation expert judgement can be used a group of marine experts state their opinions on each basic event be which may cause a collision contact accident during the sts operation also they evaluate the potential consequences of a collision contact accident in event tree analysis in the current study data were collected from marine experts who have wide knowledge and experience of sts operations on tankers since each expert s opinion may not be of equal weight the evaluations are affected by their relative importance the six marine experts surveyed included an operation manager superintendent master mariner chief officer and maritime lecturer marine experts evaluate the fps of components or systems based on their experience and knowledge thus a weighting factor is necessary to be introduced in order to represent the relative quality of different experts yazdi and kabir 2017 in this context table 2 demonstrates the weights scores of the non homogenous marine experts who participated in the survey senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 7 4 quantitative risk analysis in the paper collision contact during the sts operation is selected as the top event since it may pose acute dangers to crew on board and marine environment in the view of face to face interviews with six marine experts and information taken from sts transfer guide and mooring equipment guidelines ies and bes were determined and the ft diagram was constructed under supervision of group of these marine experts fig 2 the basic application steps of the ft methodology were presented to group of marine experts before interviews due to the lack of known failure probability the failure probabilities on the ft diagram is evaluated under the supervision of six marine experts whose details are provided in table 3 in total twenty six bes and ten ies were included in the ft diagram table 4 defines all potential failures related with collision contact during sts operation in the ft diagram environmental effects ie4 is taking separately since environmental conditions play an important role for all critical maritime based operations sts cargo loading discharging lashing tank or hold cleaning etc to be safely accomplished sometimes when the cargo transfer is carried out off port sheltered limits and bad environmental conditions makes a fall the operations have to be aborted for safety the linguistic expressions of marine experts were converted into fuzzy numbers using the numerical approach method linguistic scales illustrated in table 5 very low vl low l medium low ml medium m medium high mh high h very high vh are used to convert linguistic terms to fuzzy numbers baas and kwakernaak 1977 chen and hwang 1992 within this scope fig 3 shows the ratings and membership functions of the fuzzy sets that were developed as mentioned above the sample of marine experts participating in the survey was heterogeneous so the relative weight of their opinions needed to be accounted for table 6 shows the weights of the marine experts according to their profiles position sea shore working experience educational level senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 table 7 after the judgements of the marine experts had been recorded the aggregation stage was implemented by using equations 2 5 respectively the similarity value indicates the relationship of the opinion of each expert to the opinion of other experts for each be in this context table 8 gives the similarity functions and similarity values for be1 table 9 illustrates the average agreement of marine experts aa the relative agreement between the marine experts and the consensus coefficient cc since all marine experts are considered identical in this calculation β is determined as 0 5 senol et al 2015 the last stage of the sam consisted of calculating the aggregation of the experts judgements this stage consisted of multiplying the cc for each judgement and adding this to the values of their related fuzzy expressions equation 6 was used to obtain these judgements and defuzzification was then applied in order to convert the fuzzy numbers to crisp values equation 7 table 10 shows the aggregated experts judgements and defuzzification results for all the bes the possibilities obtained from the experts linguistic expressions for each bes were converted into numeric probability values with equations 8 and 9 used at this stage the probability values obtained from the possibilities are given in table 11 then the probabilities of the mcss and the te were calculated after calculation the failure probability of the te was found to be 2 30e 01 equation 10 was then applied to establish the significance of each mcs in the fault tree the probabilities of occurrence for each mcs and sensitivity analysis are shown in table 12 in order to complete quantitative risk analysis using the bow tie approach an et diagram was produced under the supervision of six marine experts by first addressing the initiating event held to be collision contact during the sts operation the probabilities of the consequences were calculated according to the judgements of these experts table 13 shows their linguistic assessment of each consequence after the probabilities of each consequence were calculated fig 4 is the final bow tie which includes the ft and et diagrams and illustrates the probability of occurrence for each consequence 7 5 discussion and findings as a result of the fuzzy fault tree analysis the probability of collision contact accident te of the problem during the sts operation was determined as 2 30e 01 the result shows that the collision contact accident poses a high risk in the sts operation in order to reduce the risk bes having the highest failure probability can be eliminated judgements taken from experts demonstrate that the te is mostly affected by be17 be1 be12 be18 and be20 also the mcss of be19be20be21 be23be24be25 and be2be3 are important failures affecting the probability of occurrence of the te the analysis clearly indicates that be17 not to follow the maneuvering plan with a probability of occurrence of 3 87e 2 is the most significant failure before the operation the sts operation maneuver mooring and unmooring sections between 6 and 9 specified in the sts transfer guide should be considered sts transfer guide 2013 in addition depending on the specific characteristics of the ships and the type of the sts operation either ships are at anchor or underway issues such as the maneuvering procedures berthing or leaving the position of the primary and secondary fenders position of manifolds and hoses and arrangement of the mooring lines were also identified as contributing to the success or failure of sts operations crew failure to comply with the plan incorrect evaluation of the mooring master and master commands disagreement between vessels and sudden development of environmental impacts are potential causes of the failure to follow the maneuvering plan since the most significant difference between the sts and standard tanker terminal operations is maneuvering following the maneuver plan is required to enhance safety be1 not to take necessary action for interaction effect with a probability of occurrence of 3 39e 02 is the second most likely failure when the sts operation is carried out with two vessels at underway the ships maneuver towards each other and sail together throughout the operation the movement of ships at close range generates an interaction force between them de decker 2006 ship to ship interaction is caused by the irregular water pressure around the hulls the high speed and irregularity of the fluid between hulls decreases the hydrodynamic pressure that water exerts this is the main cause of the suction force and pulling moment between the ships gierusz and waszkiel 2012 it is quite important to adjust the influence of the interaction force on the position speed and acceleration of the ships to prevent a collision contact accident be12 lack of appropriate monitoring at close quarters with occurrence probability 2 79e 02 is also significant failure to te during sts ships carry out cargo operations alongside one another in this case the need to simultaneously attend to the ship s position and monitor cargo transfer increases the risk of collision contact be18 lack of coordination with mooring team on deck is another critical failure calculated to occur with a probability of 2 61e 02 in the system it may be caused by neglecting to adjust the tension of mooring lines during the operation resulting in collision or contact between vessels next be20 not to check the condition of mooring ropes and tails is an important incident with a probability of occurrence calculated to be 2 57e 02 mooring lines to be used in an sts operation should therefore be inspected beforehand and should be maintained in accordance with official guidelines for each type the recommendations in the mooring equipment guide meg and sts transfer guide should be taken into consideration when carrying out checks handling soft tail for flexibility when steel wire or high modulus synthetic fiber rope is used using the nylon tails minimum 11 m for increasing the rope flexibility using chafing covers to reduce chafing of the ropes etc sts transfer guide 2013 mooring eqipment guidelines 2008 failure to check the condition of mooring ropes in this way may cause the lines to break during an operation potentially resulting in collision contact accidents finally the bow tie diagram presented in fig 4 indicates that near miss 2 17e 01 has the strongest association with collision contact accidents during sts operations followed by financial damage 1 27e 02 sensitivity analysis is the general term for a systematic study of how the inputs to a model influence the results of the model ferson and tucker 2006 in the paper sam is employed in order to convert linguistic terms to their corresponding fuzzy numbers and aggregates the individual opinions of experts under fuzzy logic environment in this study input variables expert weights shape and numerical values of the fuzzy functions for sam can be considered as limitation of the study meantime uncertainties are inherent in all scientific undertakings in particular risk assessment and cannot be avoided the extent to which uncertainties in data and analyses can be measured and expressed in highly quantitative terms depends upon the types of investigations used to develop scientific knowledge berner and flage 2016 in the paper there is uncertainty during calculation of occurrence probability of bes and ies due to lack of data in maritime transportation physical constraints or lack of resources are the main contributing factors for data scarcity on the other hands expert elicitation is the synthesis of expert s opinions of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient data rausand and hoyland 2004 experts elicitation is essentially a scientific consensus methodology it allows for parameterization an educated guess for the respective topic under study since it can quantify uncertainty examples of fields that have contributed to probability elicitation are decision analysis psychology risk analysis quantification of subjective probabilities is employed in a number of circumstances lavasani et al 2015 kotra et al 1996 8 conclusion sts is a dangerous operation in terms of safety for ship crew vessel commodity and marine environment in particular collision contact accidents can occur extensively as the ships navigate at close range therefore it is quite important to identify potential risks associated with this case during the sts operation this paper has aimed to enhance maritime safety in operational aspects by describing a quantitative risk analysis for the collision contact of ships during the sts operation in the paper bow tie methodology was used to predict risk while a fuzzy set is used to firm up the vagueness of expert judgement basic events rooted in human error that may lead to accident were revealed and the probability of the top event occurring was calculated after calculating the occurrence of the te and ranking of the mcss based on their calculated priorities v fim be17 be1 be12 have been observed as the significant failures of the system event sequences from the top event to its multiple possible consequences were then extensively analysed finally the results show that consequence event c6 has the strongest relation with collision contact accidents during sts operations in conclusion the findings of the paper can be utilised by maritime safety researchers maritime safety professionals and tanker ship operators to minimize the potential risk of collision contact during sts cargo operations future research may involve extending fuzzy sets numbers into type 2 fuzzy sets numbers in order to increase the consistency of the findings declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment the authors wish to thank the reviewers and editor in charge for their very constructive feedback 
21413,risk analysis is of paramount importance in maritime transportation due to the particularly hazardous nature of the work while the international maritime organization imo has circulated formal safety assessment fsa for the assessment of on board risk it has not introduced a specific tool for risk analysis and a more proactive approach to the assessment of risk is consequently sought by maritime safety researchers this paper aims to demonstrate how the fuzzy bow tie method of analysis might be deployed to quantitatively analyse risk focussing on the specific context of ship to ship sts cargo operations enables specific insights into the method to be gained the findings of the research can be utilised by maritime safety professionals sts superintends mooring masters tanker safety inspectors company fleet managers and tanker shipowners in order to mitigate potential risks and enhance marine safety during the sts operation keywords risk analysis fuzzy bow tie collision sts operation 1 introduction the issue of safety at sea has a very important place in the maritime industry in terms of minimizing marine accidents and the impact of these accidents on human life the environment and the commodities being transported in order to improve safety at sea a wide range of rules and regulations have been adopted over time the imo is a regulatory body related to shipping and maritime activities it works to enhance safety at sea and minimize potential risks the american bureau of shipping abs 2014 defines risk as a combination of the contingency of an occurrence of dangerous events and the severity of injury and damage that this event can cause one major pillar of the imo is the safety of life at sea solas convention whose provisions aim to safeguard the safety of merchant ships the main purpose of the solas convention is to provide minimum standards for the safe operation of vessels and to improve operational safety at sea with codes such as the international safety management ism international maritime dangerous goods code imdg etc in addition the imo introduced the formal safety assessment fsa for maritime stakeholders in order to improve safety at sea by conducting risk analysis gul et al 2017 besides paragraph 1 of the ism code addresses risk by defining the requirements of risk assessment according to the code all companies should evaluate the crew the marine environment vessels and all risks on board ism 2010 nonetheless despite all these affords to enhance safety at sea the maritime sector still carries a high risk of accidents in order to ensure safety the risk factor must be maintained at an acceptable level hereby risk assessment plays a critical role in increasing safety in the maritime industry akyuz and celik 2015a in particular because of the cargoes transported by tankers are flammable explosive and environmental pollutants tanker activities such as cargo handling berthing unberthing tank cleaning tank maintenance inerting gas freeing and sts cargo transferring have extensive risks although risk assessment is of paramount importance for the tanker operations there has been limited research focused on the topic to date in this context current study describes a quantitative risk analysis for ship collision contact during sts cargo transfer since this operation poses potential harm to the human and maritime environment a robust numerical method including fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta is employed under a fuzzy sets environment enabling the empirical analysis and description of operational failures during sts operations the top event te is selected as collision contact of ships during sts operations accordingly the paper is organised as follows this section gives motivation behind the study section 2 conducts comprehensive literature reviewing section 3 introduces methodology section 4 performs quantitative risk analysing through sts operation section 5 gives conclusion and potential contribution of the study 2 literature reviewing within the field of maritime industry a wide range of studies exist on the topic of risk assessment such as maritime collision chai et al 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2015 grounding mazaheri et al 2016 akhtar utne 2014 and fire or explosion li and huang 2012 maritime operations sakar and zorba 2017 arslan et al 2017 because accidents on tankers are more likely to cause serious damages injuries and environmental pollution much of the risk assessment literature has focussed on this class of ship for instance goerlandt and montewka 2014 proposed a bayesian network bn model for reasoning under uncertainty for the assessment of accidental cargo oil outflow in a ship ship collision where a tanker is struck the model provides a reasonable estimate of possible oil outflows under various scenarios another risk analysis performed by akyuz and celik 2015b focussed on the process of on board gas freeing aboard crude oil tankers in the paper a fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory dematel method is used likewise hsu et al 2017 conducted a risk analysis for operational safety of oil tankers the authors utilised a revised risk matrix based on a fuzzy analytic hierarchical process fahp akyuz 2015 discussed risks deriving from human factor related to the gas inerting process on board crude oil tankers in the paper cognitive reliability and error analysing method cream was used to quantify such risks the bow tie method is a widely used approach that deals with the main causes and effects of risk there are some examples of risk assessment in offshore industries which utilise bow tie methodology abimbola et al 2014 khakzad et al 2013 ferdous et al 2012 however application of the bow tie method to maritime risk assessment is relatively rare due to the lack of data acquisition mokhtari et al 2011 used the method to perform a causal risk analysis of sea ports and offshore terminals the authors integrated fuzzy event tree analysis and fuzzy fault tree analysis to identify risk factors in this context another study adopting the bow tie method analysed potential risks in the shipbuilding industry mapping the causes and consequences of shipbuilding accidents jacinto and silva 2010 likewise cormier et al 2019 used bow tie methodology to conduct an exhaustive risk analysis and integrate marine environmental practices with protection strategies a literature review also conducted upon sts operation in maritime transportation indicates that most of the papers focus on dealing with the operational risk analysis of sts cargo transferring operation sultana et al 2019 husjord 2016 stavro ventikos 2015 there is limited study tackling with collision case during sts operation since it poses high risk for tankers to address this concern the paper performs quantitative risk analysis on collision during sts operation a bow tie method is used under fuzzy logic

possibilities gathered from experts judgements are converted into probabilities for this purpose onisawa 1988 proposed a formula which is used to transform fuzzy faılure from possibility to

failure probability a minimal cut set mcs is a group of basic events comprising the critical elements of the ft the structural vulnerability of the system can be determined using an mcs it means that the more mcss the more dangerous the system is the bes are undesired events in the system and if all bes under the mcs succeed the te will occur identifying mcss is also important from the perspective of risk the mcs ranking is used to represent the importance of each mcs to the occurrence of the te the mcss can be ranked using the vesely fussell importance measure v fim method in other words sensitivity of te s probability is computed via ranking the mcss for their contribution to te probability and importance level of mcss in this study v fim is used to analyse the sensitivity ünver et al 2019 this method provides numerical significance for bes specified in the fault tree and is expressed as follows 10 i i v f t q i t q s t where i i v f t defines the magnitude of m c i q i t the probability of the occurrence failure represented by cut set i and q s t gives the probability of the occurrence failure of te in all mcs 6 2 construct event tree diagram an et diagram is used to determine the route from an initiating event of the failure to the various consequences and the expected frequency of each consequence it also describes the safety functions designed to tackle the initial event and the sequence of events needed to improve system safety 6 3 calculate the probabilities for consequences in this step the probabilities for each potential consequences are calculated under a fuzzy set environment expert judgements are utilised to convert linguistic assessment into numerical value this requires the application of the similarity aggregation method sam and centre of area coa methodologies described previously equations 8 and 9 are used to transform possibilities to probabilities then the traditional event tree equation is applied to calculate probabilities for each consequence ferdous et al 2011 6 4 analysis of results the final step provides the outcomes where the potential consequences of the te are analysed to determine risk 7 the case of ship collision during the sts operation in this section the case of ship collision contact during the sts operation is examined in order to demonstrate the application of risk analysis using the fuzzy bow tie method 7 1 sts operation in tanker ships the sts operation refers to the transhipment of cargoes such as crude oil liquefied gas bulk cargo and petroleum products between two vessels the discharging vessels positioned alongside each other during the sts operation are known as the ship to be lightened sbl and the loading vessel the service ship ss ocimf 2009 in cases where vessels are unable to berth owing to the port fees and draught restrictions the sts operation is performed in the open seas the cargo transfer procedure can be carried out either while vessels are at anchor or underway ics 2011 sts operations are achieved in accordance with guidelines or recommendations identified by the oil companies international marine forum ocimf society of international gas tanker and terminal operators sigtto chemical distribution institute cdi international chamber of shipping ics and the international maritime organization imo sts transfer guide 2013 the purpose of these documents is to guide those involved in the planning and implementation of sts operations such as masters superintendents and sts service operators the amendments to chapter 8 of marpol annex i of the protocol of 1978 for the prevention of pollution from ships constituted the first important convention establishing common rules during sts transfer operations regulation 41 of the marpol convention required any oil tanker involved in sts operation to have a plan for conducting the sts operation despite international recommendations the sts operation still involves many dangers such as collision fire explosion oil spill etc since the two ships maneuver at close range during the sts operation the most prevalent accident is that of collision contact between vessels therefore collision contact during sts operation is chosen as the top event in the study 7 2 problem statement collision contact between the two vessels is the most widespread type of accident that occurs during sts operations ventikos and stavrou 2013 sts operation is severely affected by variables such as environmental conditions wind swell current etc personnel capabilities the maneuvering performance of each vessel and the specific area for the transfer shallow or deep waters suitability for maneuver etc since the collision of two ships may lead to severe consequences such as loss of life marine pollution capsizing or flooding a risk analysis is essential to enhance safety and minimize failures that may cause collision during sts operation 7 3 analysis of respondents since there is a lack of data in maritime transportation expert judgement can be used a group of marine experts state their opinions on each basic event be which may cause a collision contact accident during the sts operation also they evaluate the potential consequences of a collision contact accident in event tree analysis in the current study data were collected from marine experts who have wide knowledge and experience of sts operations on tankers since each expert s opinion may not be of equal weight the evaluations are affected by their relative importance the six marine experts surveyed included an operation manager superintendent master mariner chief officer and maritime lecturer marine experts evaluate the fps of components or systems based on their experience and knowledge thus a weighting factor is necessary to be introduced in order to represent the relative quality of different experts yazdi and kabir 2017 in this context table 2 demonstrates the weights scores of the non homogenous marine experts who participated in the survey senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 7 4 quantitative risk analysis in the paper collision contact during the sts operation is selected as the top event since it may pose acute dangers to crew on board and marine environment in the view of face to face interviews with six marine experts and information taken from sts transfer guide and mooring equipment guidelines ies and bes were determined and the ft diagram was constructed under supervision of group of these marine experts fig 2 the basic application steps of the ft methodology were presented to group of marine experts before interviews due to the lack of known failure probability the failure probabilities on the ft diagram is evaluated under the supervision of six marine experts whose details are provided in table 3 in total twenty six bes and ten ies were included in the ft diagram table 4 defines all potential failures related with collision contact during sts operation in the ft diagram environmental effects ie4 is taking separately since environmental conditions play an important role for all critical maritime based operations sts cargo loading discharging lashing tank or hold cleaning etc to be safely accomplished sometimes when the cargo transfer is carried out off port sheltered limits and bad environmental conditions makes a fall the operations have to be aborted for safety the linguistic expressions of marine experts were converted into fuzzy numbers using the numerical approach method linguistic scales illustrated in table 5 very low vl low l medium low ml medium m medium high mh high h very high vh are used to convert linguistic terms to fuzzy numbers baas and kwakernaak 1977 chen and hwang 1992 within this scope fig 3 shows the ratings and membership functions of the fuzzy sets that were developed as mentioned above the sample of marine experts participating in the survey was heterogeneous so the relative weight of their opinions needed to be accounted for table 6 shows the weights of the marine experts according to their profiles position sea shore working experience educational level senol et al 2015 lavasani et al 2015 table 7 after the judgements of the marine experts had been recorded the aggregation stage was implemented by using equations 2 5 respectively the similarity value indicates the relationship of the opinion of each expert to the opinion of other experts for each be in this context table 8 gives the similarity functions and similarity values for be1 table 9 illustrates the average agreement of marine experts aa the relative agreement between the marine experts and the consensus coefficient cc since all marine experts are considered identical in this calculation β is determined as 0 5 senol et al 2015 the last stage of the sam consisted of calculating the aggregation of the experts judgements this stage consisted of multiplying the cc for each judgement and adding this to the values of their related fuzzy expressions equation 6 was used to obtain these judgements and defuzzification was then applied in order to convert the fuzzy numbers to crisp values equation 7 table 10 shows the aggregated experts judgements and defuzzification results for all the bes the possibilities obtained from the experts linguistic expressions for each bes were converted into numeric probability values with equations 8 and 9 used at this stage the probability values obtained from the possibilities are given in table 11 then the probabilities of the mcss and the te were calculated after calculation the failure probability of the te was found to be 2 30e 01 equation 10 was then applied to establish the significance of each mcs in the fault tree the probabilities of occurrence for each mcs and sensitivity analysis are shown in table 12 in order to complete quantitative risk analysis using the bow tie approach an et diagram was produced under the supervision of six marine experts by first addressing the initiating event held to be collision contact during the sts operation the probabilities of the consequences were calculated according to the judgements of these experts table 13 shows their linguistic assessment of each consequence after the probabilities of each consequence were calculated fig 4 is the final bow tie which includes the ft and et diagrams and illustrates the probability of occurrence for each consequence 7 5 discussion and findings as a result of the fuzzy fault tree analysis the probability of collision contact accident te of the problem during the sts operation was determined as 2 30e 01 the result shows that the collision contact accident poses a high risk in the sts operation in order to reduce the risk bes having the highest failure probability can be eliminated judgements taken from experts demonstrate that the te is mostly affected by be17 be1 be12 be18 and be20 also the mcss of be19be20be21 be23be24be25 and be2be3 are important failures affecting the probability of occurrence of the te the analysis clearly indicates that be17 not to follow the maneuvering plan with a probability of occurrence of 3 87e 2 is the most significant failure before the operation the sts operation maneuver mooring and unmooring sections between 6 and 9 specified in the sts transfer guide should be considered sts transfer guide 2013 in addition depending on the specific characteristics of the ships and the type of the sts operation either ships are at anchor or underway issues such as the maneuvering procedures berthing or leaving the position of the primary and secondary fenders position of manifolds and hoses and arrangement of the mooring lines were also identified as contributing to the success or failure of sts operations crew failure to comply with the plan incorrect evaluation of the mooring master and master commands disagreement between vessels and sudden development of environmental impacts are potential causes of the failure to follow the maneuvering plan since the most significant difference between the sts and standard tanker terminal operations is maneuvering following the maneuver plan is required to enhance safety be1 not to take necessary action for interaction effect with a probability of occurrence of 3 39e 02 is the second most likely failure when the sts operation is carried out with two vessels at underway the ships maneuver towards each other and sail together throughout the operation the movement of ships at close range generates an interaction force between them de decker 2006 ship to ship interaction is caused by the irregular water pressure around the hulls the high speed and irregularity of the fluid between hulls decreases the hydrodynamic pressure that water exerts this is the main cause of the suction force and pulling moment between the ships gierusz and waszkiel 2012 it is quite important to adjust the influence of the interaction force on the position speed and acceleration of the ships to prevent a collision contact accident be12 lack of appropriate monitoring at close quarters with occurrence probability 2 79e 02 is also significant failure to te during sts ships carry out cargo operations alongside one another in this case the need to simultaneously attend to the ship s position and monitor cargo transfer increases the risk of collision contact be18 lack of coordination with mooring team on deck is another critical failure calculated to occur with a probability of 2 61e 02 in the system it may be caused by neglecting to adjust the tension of mooring lines during the operation resulting in collision or contact between vessels next be20 not to check the condition of mooring ropes and tails is an important incident with a probability of occurrence calculated to be 2 57e 02 mooring lines to be used in an sts operation should therefore be inspected beforehand and should be maintained in accordance with official guidelines for each type the recommendations in the mooring equipment guide meg and sts transfer guide should be taken into consideration when carrying out checks handling soft tail for flexibility when steel wire or high modulus synthetic fiber rope is used using the nylon tails minimum 11 m for increasing the rope flexibility using chafing covers to reduce chafing of the ropes etc sts transfer guide 2013 mooring eqipment guidelines 2008 failure to check the condition of mooring ropes in this way may cause the lines to break during an operation potentially resulting in collision contact accidents finally the bow tie diagram presented in fig 4 indicates that near miss 2 17e 01 has the strongest association with collision contact accidents during sts operations followed by financial damage 1 27e 02 sensitivity analysis is the general term for a systematic study of how the inputs to a model influence the results of the model ferson and tucker 2006 in the paper sam is employed in order to convert linguistic terms to their corresponding fuzzy numbers and aggregates the individual opinions of experts under fuzzy logic environment in this study input variables expert weights shape and numerical values of the fuzzy functions for sam can be considered as limitation of the study meantime uncertainties are inherent in all scientific undertakings in particular risk assessment and cannot be avoided the extent to which uncertainties in data and analyses can be measured and expressed in highly quantitative terms depends upon the types of investigations used to develop scientific knowledge berner and flage 2016 in the paper there is uncertainty during calculation of occurrence probability of bes and ies due to lack of data in maritime transportation physical constraints or lack of resources are the main contributing factors for data scarcity on the other hands expert elicitation is the synthesis of expert s opinions of a subject where there is uncertainty due to insufficient data rausand and hoyland 2004 experts elicitation is essentially a scientific consensus methodology it allows for parameterization an educated guess for the respective topic under study since it can quantify uncertainty examples of fields that have contributed to probability elicitation are decision analysis psychology risk analysis quantification of subjective probabilities is employed in a number of circumstances lavasani et al 2015 kotra et al 1996 8 conclusion sts is a dangerous operation in terms of safety for ship crew vessel commodity and marine environment in particular collision contact accidents can occur extensively as the ships navigate at close range therefore it is quite important to identify potential risks associated with this case during the sts operation this paper has aimed to enhance maritime safety in operational aspects by describing a quantitative risk analysis for the collision contact of ships during the sts operation in the paper bow tie methodology was used to predict risk while a fuzzy set is used to firm up the vagueness of expert judgement basic events rooted in human error that may lead to accident were revealed and the probability of the top event occurring was calculated after calculating the occurrence of the te and ranking of the mcss based on their calculated priorities v fim be17 be1 be12 have been observed as the significant failures of the system event sequences from the top event to its multiple possible consequences were then extensively analysed finally the results show that consequence event c6 has the strongest relation with collision contact accidents during sts operations in conclusion the findings of the paper can be utilised by maritime safety researchers maritime safety professionals and tanker ship operators to minimize the potential risk of collision contact during sts cargo operations future research may involve extending fuzzy sets numbers into type 2 fuzzy sets numbers in order to increase the consistency of the findings declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

21414,antifouling and drag reduction are two critical issues for the shipping industry previous studies have revealed that biomimetic shell surfaces have distinct antifouling features in this study ten simplified surface microstructures with the same cross section area are designed based on the antifouling scale of the shell surface morphology turbulent flow over the riblet structures is simulated using a finite volume based cfd solver with the shear stress transport k ω model to examine the effects of the riblet structures on skin friction with mean flow velocities ranging from 1 to 7 m s the corresponding dimensionless square root of the groove cross section area is l g 4 5 25 6 considering the predicted drag performance and issues concerning riblet tip rounding and fabrication an optimal geometry with both antifouling and drag reduction features has been identified the present study confirms that the riblets lift off streamwise vortices pushing the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the surface and impede the spanwise movement of streamwise vortices leading to skin friction reduction further the investigation of the effect of the riblet interval on the drag behaviour indicates the existence of a balance point between the wetted perimeter and the total area of the riblet surface for minimizing drag keywords turbulent flow skin friction drag reduction riblet surface computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction when a marine vessel navigates in the ocean it is subject to three types of resistance including pressure drag skin friction and wave making resistance much energy is spent to overcome the friction resistance which accounts for around 45 of the total drag during navigation through water dean and bhushan 2010 many aspects of the nature could serve as an inspiration for designs to reduce the friction drag one possible way to reduce the skin friction is to introduce riblets that is rows of small longitudinal grooves on the surface aligned in the streamwise direction the most extensively studied riblet structure is the biomimetic surface inspired by shark skin which has been investigated for over 40 years and the results from both experimental and numerical studies indicate possible drag reduction of up to 10 dean and bhushan 2010 a major hypothesis has been put forward to explain the drag reduction mechanisms of the riblet bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 choi et al 1993 and many researchers have attempted to explain or quantify the drag reduction mechanisms based on numerical or experimental data choi et al 1993 pointed out that drag reduction occurred with an optimal riblet spacing they conducted a direct numerical simulation dns of various riblets in a turbulent channel flow which indicates that the spanwise flow motions and the momentum transfer are suppressed by the riblets in the near wall region this observation agrees with the experimental results of choi 1989 who carried out a series of wind tunnel tests using a hot wire anemometry and revealed that the restriction of spanwise movement of the quasi streamwise vortices by optimum designed riblets led to the premature sweep events accompanied by a reduction of the skin friction subsequently luchini et al 1991 and bechert et al 1997 attempted to explain and quantify choi et al 1993 s hypothesis it is found that the mean flow sees a different origin to that of the cross flow resulting in a thicker viscous sublayer and hence a lower drag force this explanation agrees with the previous results obtained through a series of drag measurements in an oil channel bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 the above studies suggest that the presence of the riblets rectifies the turbulent flow by impeding the fluctuating cross stream component and thereby results in the reduction of turbulent momentum transfer in addition to the skin friction biofouling as another concern that could cause additional drag force during the sailing of marine vessels is an unavoidable issue to be addressed for the shipping industry especially for commercial vessels it is a costly and harmful phenomenon as a great number of aquatic growths appear on the underwater structures of the ship hull the settlement and accumulation of aquatic growths and marine organisms such as diatoms and algae on the inanimate substrate may create substantial penalties for the engineered structures of a navigation object the direct impacts include increasing the weight of marine vessels and voyage resistance which will lead to increased fuel consumption and reduced navigation speed it has been indicated that slime a type of micro biofouling would increase the resistance on marine vessels by 1 2 weed fouling could increase drag by up to 10 and hard shell fouling like barnacles could even cause the vessel drag rising by up to 40 willsher 2001 therefore the successful application of antifouling technology will not only help prevent the aquatic growths but also reduce the drag on the ship hull applying biomimetic surfaces is one of the strategies to resolve the fouling problems the shell surface is considered as a better biomimetic object compared to the biomimetic surfaces inspired by shark and fish the mucus secreted by fish would mix with the fluid in the boundary layer and reduce the friction while fish is swimming moreover a small amount of mucus is observed to be present on shark skins in the natural marine environment the mucus not only contributes to drag reduction but also has an antifouling feature this is because the antifouling mechanisms involved in shark and fish skins are related to not only the surface physical microstructures but also hydrophilic and low surface energy caused by mucus however there are mainly proteins but no mucus on shell surfaces bai et al 2013 also the sharks often swim at a high speed in the ocean while the marine shells mostly maintain at a static state it is widely acknowledged that bioaccumulation is prone to occur on the hull of the ship at static and low speed conditions and there are little fouling organisms formed during fast sailing therefore the living condition of shells is closer to the real condition of ship fouling occurrence accordingly shell surfaces are better biomimetic objects for antifouling compared to the surfaces of shark and fish skins in the previous investigation mentioned above bai et al 2013 three common marine shells including natural dosinia japonica gafrarium pectinatum and mimachlamys nobilis were selected to investigate the relationship between the shell surface microstructures and the antifouling performance using the natural shells and their replicas made from two different materials polyurethane and e44 epoxy resin the antifouling feature of the shell surfaces mainly depends on the surface microstructures at the micro scale the fouling testing results indicated that the surface microstructures of shells indeed affect the attachment of fouling organisms and they may block the adhesion of marine organisms among the tested samples the e44 replica surface of d japonica has the best antifouling ability however the drag performance of the surface has not been investigated the riblet spacing s and height h of the surface riblet structures of the d japonica are considered as the two most significant parameters contributing to its antifouling performance due to the strong correlation between drag reduction and antifouling it is necessary to investigate the drag reduction potential of the antifouling surface microstructures accordingly this study aims to identify an optimal biomimetic surface morphology that integrates both antifouling and drag reduction features specifically ten simplified riblet structures are designed based on the featured dimensions riblet spacing s and height h of the surface morphology of the d japonica steady state simulations are performed to compute fully developed turbulent flows over smooth and riblet surfaces using a rans reynolds averaged navier stokes model the drag performances of the various riblet structures are compared to identify an optimal riblet geometry for drag reduction the mechanisms causing drag reduction are also discussed 2 numerical model and tests in this study the marine shell dosinia japonica which has an antifouling feature due to its surface microstructures bai et al 2013 is considered as the biomimetic object for the drag reduction study the detailed geometric dimensions of the riblets of the d japonica surface have been reported in bai et al 2013 based on scanning electron microscope sem measurements and wavelet analysis it is found that the antifouling shell surface dimensions are typically in the range of 50 700 μm for the riblet spacing s and 40 400 μm for the riblet height h bai et al 2013 these two parameters determine the antifouling performance of the riblet surfaces and thus the ranges of s and h are considered as the appropriate antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface the antifouling capability of the d japonica surface may be explained using the attachment point theory scardino et al 2006 2008 which states that fouling organisms larger than the scale of microtexture have reduced adhesion strength due to fewer attachment points and those smaller than the scale of microtexture have greater adhesion strength due to increased number of attachment points further the experimental study conducted by walsh 1982 showed that consistent net drag reduction occurred for s 30 and h 25 where s and h are defined in equations 1 and 2 below the design of the riblet surfaces in this study considers the requirements for both antifouling and drag reduction to better characterise the turbulent flow over riblet surfaces all length scales are converted to non dimensional wall units denoted by a superscript in this study the riblet spacing s and the riblet height h are non dimensionalized as 1 s s u τ ν 2 h h u τ ν where ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid u τ refers to the friction velocity u τ τ 0 ρ 1 2 where τ 0 denotes the wall shear stress and ρ is the density of the fluid garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 identified a new geometric parameter the square root of the riblet cross section area l g a g 1 2 which captures the influence of both the riblet spacing and shape it is defined as 3 l g a g 1 2 u τ ν where a g denotes the riblet cross section area through which the fluid is flowing the existing drag reduction experimental data was found to collapse better with this new length scale l g and the optimum drag reduction performance was achieved at l g 11 for all the riblet structures reviewed by garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 hence l g can better characterise drag behaviour of riblet surfaces compared with the classical choices of the non dimensional riblet spacing s and height h several factors are considered to determine the physical dimensions of the riblet structures in the present investigation firstly the above mentioned dimensional parameters need to cover sufficiently wide ranges so that the optimum configuration may be identified secondly the design of the riblet surfaces needs to enable a comparison of the drag performance of the present designs with the corresponding cases reported in the previous studies in terms of the dimensionless parameters thirdly since the optimal drag reduction range was found to be s o p t 15 20 and l g 11 the riblet should be designed to centre the dimensionless parameters around these values this allows either side of the optimum dimensionless range to be tested finally the antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface mentioned above should also be considered in the design of the riblet structures to reflect the real life situation of ocean navigation for marine vessels in this study the flow velocity applied in the simulations is determined with consideration of the economical speed of cargo ships in the situation of high fossil fuel prices slow steaming speed range is 3 16 knots has been adopted by shipping companies to cut costs as required by the environmental agenda therefore the velocity range adopted in this study is determined based on this slow steaming cruising speed of marine vessels which corresponds to 1 7 m s in terms of the mean flow velocity u m 2 1 simplified riblet designs previous studies have reported that s over the range of 15 20 gave the best drag reduction performance bechert et al 1997 choi et al 1993 peet and sagaut 2009 walsh 1982 walsh and lindemann 1984 in particular choi et al 1993 proposed that the frictional drag on the riblets was reduced when the riblet spacing s was less than the diameter of the streamwise near wall vortex that was approximately 25 35 wall units in this case the streamwise vortices cannot intrude into the riblets and the occurrence of large shear was only restricted to the tips of the riblets hence the optimal dimensionless parameter range is not only related to the physical scale of the riblets but also the scale of the streamwise vortices further the riblet structure design should also consider the antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface as mentioned above a series of streamwise aligned riblet configurations are designed based on the criteria mentioned above and the velocity range considered in this study as shown in fig 1 three riblet shapes v shape trapezoidal and circular riblets are considered all the riblets protrude into the flow with the mean flow velocity u m in the range of 1 7 m s considered in this study the non dimensionalized riblet spacing s and height h vary approximately over the ranges of 6 43 and 3 35 respectively whereas l g varies over the range of 4 25 the detailed dimensions of each riblet design are displayed in table 1 three sets of investigations are carried out to determine the optimal riblet design for drag reduction firstly since the dimensional cross section areas a g of all the ten riblet designs are kept the same the optimal riblet cross section shape is identified based on their drag reduction performances secondly three candidate riblet geometries of the identified shapes are compared to determine the optimal design in this study and finally the effect of the riblet interval t of the v shape riblets on the drag performance is investigated to obtain further insight into how the riblet geometry affects the drag performance of the riblet surfaces 2 2 numerical details 2 2 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in this study the friction drag on a small segment of the ship hull subject to turbulent flows of various velocities is calculated numerically to facilitate direct comparison of the drag performance between smooth and riblet surfaces under identical flow conditions the computational domain is configured with the riblet surface located at the bottom and the smooth surface at the top respectively refer to fig 2 both surfaces are rigid and no slip and are separated by a distance h a similar setup has been adopted in choi et al 1993 and martin and bhushan 2014 it is worth noting that this numerical setup is different from the real ship scenario in which the far field of the ship hull is unconfined as such the adopted computational domain is only appropriate for analyzing the near wall flow within the inner layer but is not sufficiently large for resolving the outer layer since the effect of the riblets on the turbulent boundary layer is present in the near wall region only refer to the numerical results presented in section 3 3 below the present setup is deemed appropriate for comparing the drag reduction performances of the different riblet surfaces the streamwise l and spanwise w dimensions of the domain are 3δ and δ respectively where δ denotes the channel half height δ h 2 δ is set to 2 4 mm in this study periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction are adopted at the inlet and outlet of the flow domain to capture the flow behaviour over an infinitely long surface the same treatment is done in the spanwise direction by adopting periodic boundary conditions on the two side surfaces of the computational domain a range of flow velocities u m 1 7 m s are considered to determine the drag performance of the riblet surfaces under different flow conditions with the present setup the friction reynolds number r e τ δ u τ ν calculated in this study varies approximately from 162 to 874 and the corresponding reynolds number of the channel flow between the smooth and riblet surfaces defined by equation 5 below ranges from 2400 to 16 800 jimenez and moin 1991 recommended that for simulating turbulent flows the spanwise w and streamwise l lengths of the computational domain must be larger than 100 and 250 300 wall units respectively the smallest computational domain adopted in this investigation is of l h w 477 317 159 wall units refer to fig 2 which is substantially larger than the minimum channel adopted by jimenez and moin 1991 the numerical results presented in section 3 3 below indicate that the streamwise vortices have a diameter around 30 dimensionless wall units and thus the present computational domain is deemed sufficiently large for resolving the largest vortex structure 2 2 2 mesh construction structured meshes are constructed throughout the computational domain for all cases a wall adapted mesh is applied for the bottom riblet surface this type of mesh is constructed to ensure the accuracy and fast convergence of the calculations in the central region of the computational domain the mesh is much coarser compared to those near the upper and lower wall regions in the smallest dimensionless domain case the grid resolution of δx 30 is adopted in the streamwise direction resulting in 16 nodes uniformly distributed in this direction the same streamwise grid resolution was adopted in the numerical studies of martin and bhushan 2014 and choi et al 1993 which indicate that the grid resolution is adequate in the spanwise direction the grid spacing varies from 0 2 to 1 wall unit with most cases having a resolution of δz 0 5 in the wall normal direction 225 grid points are distributed with the first grid point at y 0 3 away from the surfaces to capture the flow characteristics near the surfaces more accurately the mesh is biased towards the surfaces and the growth rate of the mesh in the wall normal direction is approximately 1 04 the mesh resolution is kept the same near the smooth and riblet surfaces for comparing the friction force as for the overall mesh quality the average values of the skewness and orthogonal quality of the grids are approximately 0 03 and 0 99 respectively which meet the general requirement of the sst k ω turbulence model adopted in this investigation see the following subsection 2 2 3 numerical method a finite volume based cfd solver with a steady rans turbulence model is adopted in this study the steady rans model is appropriate since we are only interested in the flow statistics over riblet surfaces with comparison to that over a smooth surface under identical flow conditions an unsteady rans model which has advantages over the steady rans model for flows involving separation and unsteady large scale vortical structures is unnecessary for the present investigation the appropriateness of steady rans solutions for predicting turbulent channel flows influenced by wall roughness has been demonstrated by jin and herwig 2015 a dns or les large eddy simulation study is ideal for resolving the instantaneous flow over the micro scale riblets and capturing the near wall dynamics however for the present parametric study les or dns becomes prohibitive in contrast rans simulations can generate data for identifying trends and obtain acceptable results for predicting the drag performance of different riblet surfaces although the small scale secondary motions over the riblets cannot be fully resolved the rans models are able to provide estimates of the drag reduction performance through reproducing the velocity shift δ u which is indicative of the effects of riblets on drag menter et al 2003 the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulent model which is a hybrid two equation model combining the advantages of both k ε and k ω models is adopted to model turbulence in this study this model was developed by menter 1994 to blend the robust formulation of the k ω model in the near wall regions with the freestream independence of the k ε model in the far field menter 2011 it takes advantage of a y insensitive wall treatment which makes the solution insensitive to wall mesh refinement by appropriately blending solutions for the viscous sublayer and logarithmic layer in the near wall region the y insensitive wall formulation is preferable compared to the standard wall function because the standard wall function imposes lower limits on the grid resolution that is the grid should not be refined below y 30 this could be problematic since it does not allow for a distinction between numerical and modeling errors menter 2011 therefore it is preferable to take advantage of the y insensitive formulation rather than adopting the standard wall function in this study the simple scheme is used for pressure velocity coupling the least square cell based option is adopted for gradient reconstruction and the second order upwind method is used for advection terms in all equations to ensure an adequately accurate solution to meet the convergence criteria an iterative procedure is adopted to solve the discretized governing equations with the maximum residual for all the equations set to 10 8 which is found to be appropriate for ensuring global conservation and convergence of the predicted friction force 2 2 4 numerical tests choi et al 1993 investigated the influence of grid resolution on turbulence statistics by doubling the grid points in both the streamwise and spanwise directions and reported that the maximum turbulence intensities and the reynolds shear stress changed by less than 2 in this study two meshes are constructed for the representative riblet structures following a similar procedure the grid spacing in the streamwise direction is fixed at δx 30 while the grid numbers in the spanwise and wall normal directions are increased from a coarser mesh to a finer mesh the total numbers of mesh element are around 2 million and 4 million for the coarse and fine meshes respectively additionally the sensitivity of the predicted drag force to the residual criteria for convergence is also tested by changing the convergence criteria residuals for all the governing equations from 10 8 to 10 9 the results of the grid and residual dependence tests obtained at the highest flow velocity u m 7 m s are summarised in table 2 which also shows sample meshes in a cross sectional plane for each type of the riblet structures v shape trapezoidal and circular riblets here the numerical uncertainty associated with the grid dependence test is the variation of the drag obtained with the coarser mesh relative to that obtained with the finer mesh and the uncertainty associated with the residual test is the variation of the drag obtained with the residual of 10 8 relative to that obtained with the residual of 10 9 the overall numerical uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties associated with the grid resolution and residual tests it is seen in table 2 that for all the riblet structures considered in this study the overall numerical uncertainty is well below 1 considering the numerical accuracy and the constraints of computing resources the relatively coarse mesh with approximately 2 million cells is adopted in the subsequent calculations for all the riblet structures and the residual for convergence of all the governing equations is set to 10 8 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 validation of the rans model to examine the validity of using the sst k ω turbulence model to calculate the fully turbulent channel flow the skin friction coefficient numerically obtained from a smooth wall is compared with the empirical correlation given by zanoun et al 2003 as 4 c f 0 058 r e m 0 243 where the bulk reynolds number r e m of the flow is computed based on the mean streamwise velocity u m as follows 5 r e m u m δ ν zanoun s correlation was obtained by curve fitting of the skin friction coefficient data obtained from both the pressure gradient and the local skin friction measurements using oil film interferometry a good agreement of the wall skin friction data was found between these two measurements and the obtained empirical correlation also compared well with the classic dean s equation dean 1978 given below 6 c f 0 073 r e 0 25 where the reynolds number in equation 6 above is calculated based on the full channel height here zanoun s modified equation equation 4 above is used to validate the rans model the comparison with the present calculation is shown in fig 3 it is seen in fig 3 that the calculated results of c f on the smooth surface show an excellent agreement with the data calculated using zanoun s empirical correlation fig 4 further compares the computed velocity profile against the law of the wall the present simulation results are obtained over the smooth surface in the sv1 case at the highest flow velocity u m 7 m s the streamwise velocity and the distance to the wall are non dimensionalized as u u u τ and y y u τ ν respectively it is clear in fig 4 that the numerically obtained u profile above the smooth wall is in a good agreement with the law of wall since both the calculated skin friction coefficient and the velocity profile over the smooth surface compare well with the theoretical or empirical correlations the present numerical models are deemed appropriate for this study as further validation of the numerical model fig 5 plots the predicted drag reduction ratio of the sv1 riblet surface as a function of the normalised riblet spacing along with a comparison to the experimental data of walsh 1982 here the drag reduction ratio d r is defined as 7 d r f r i b l e t f s m o o t h f s m o o t h where f r i b l e t and f s m o o t h represent the frictional forces experienced by the riblet and smooth surfaces respectively a positive value of the drag reduction ratio indicates a drag increase while a negative value indicates a drag reduction due to the riblets it is seen in fig 5 that the present results generally agree well with the experimental measurement suggesting that the present numerical model may be adopted to predict the drag performance of the riblet surfaces at least in a qualitative sense 3 2 drag performance in this section the overall drag reduction performance and detailed spanwise skin friction distributions of the different riblet surfaces are presented 3 2 1 drag reduction performance for assessing the drag reduction performance of all the riblet configurations considered in this study the correlations of d r the different riblets with the three non dimensional parameters s h and l g are presented in fig 6 it is seen in this figure that the optimal drag reduction performance occurs for the normalised riblet spacing s 17 26 and at the normalised square root of the riblet cross section area l g 12 15 these values are in general agreement with the maximum drag reduction achieved at s 18 walsh 1982 and at l g 11 for all riblet structures reviewed by garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 among the four configurations of the v shape riblets fig 6 a d and 6g it is clear that sv1 shows the best drag reduction performance d r 2 42 followed by sv2 sv3 and sv4 in descending order considering that the cross section area a g of all the riblets is fixed at a g 4900 μm2 while only the riblet interval t is varied in this investigation it is speculated that smaller t enables better drag reduction performance for the v shaped riblets this will be further discussed in section 3 4 to reveal the mechanism behind the drag performance with varying t among the three trapezoidal riblet configurations fig 6 b e and 6h st1 has the best drag reduction performance with d r 3 05 with the same trapezoidal riblet shape it is worth noting that the drag reduction performance improves with reducing tip angle α fig 6 c f and 6 i show that the three circular riblet configurations give a similar drag reduction performance intuitively to achieve a good drag reduction performance the tip of the riblet should be thin and sharp because when vortices are lifted off from the riblet surface only a small contact area of the riblet tips is exposed to a high shear stress martin and bhushan 2014 however the present results show that the circular riblets with measurable tip thicknesses sc1 and sc3 also produce favourable results in terms of drag reduction overall among the three riblet shapes considered in this study the circular riblets display the best drag reduction performance and the performance of the circular riblets is the least sensitive to the changing dimensions with a fixed cross section area 3 2 2 skin friction distribution although it has been shown above that the circular riblets have the best drag reduction performance among the three types of riblet geometries with the same cross section area the sv1 and st1 configurations also demonstrated comparable drag reduction performance to gain further insight regarding how drag reduction is achieved by the different riblet geometries and a better understanding of how the riblets alter the near wall flow the skin friction distributions over the different riblet surfaces are examined since the riblet surfaces contain repeating phases of the riblets in the spanwise direction and periodic boundary conditions are prescribed on the two spanwise end planes of the computational domain the skin friction coefficient c f averaged across all the phases is computed for each case and presented in fig 7 as a function of z λ the c f of the corresponding smooth surface for each case is also shown for comparison to illustrate the c f distribution the z coordinate is measured from the start of the riblets as shown in figure insets and normalised by the spanwise wavelength λ of the riblet structures for sv2 sv3 and sv4 λ s t whereas for the other riblet structures considered in this study λ is equivalent to the riblet spacing s the c f profile shown in fig 7 for each riblet configuration corresponds to the case with the optimal drag reduction performance as mentioned above for a given riblet geometry both s and h could be used to characterise the drag reduction performance however when comparing the performance of riblets of different shapes l g is a better non dimensional parameter to characterise the riblet geometry the skin friction profiles plotted in fig 7 correspond to l g 15 5 for sv1 and sc1 and l g 12 1 for the other 8 riblet configurations for sv1 in fig 7 a all the trapezoidal riblets st in fig 7 b and sc2 in fig 7 c the maximum c f occurs at the tips of the riblet surface for the other riblet surfaces the maximum c f is observed at the left and right edges of the riblet intervals the minimum c f of the riblets which is significantly lower than that on the smooth surface occurs at the sharp corners of the riblet valleys for the st riblets for the other riblets i e the sv and sc riblets the minimum c f is observed at the centre of the riblet valleys accordingly from the c f distribution curve of the different riblets it can be speculated that vortices are lifted off by the riblet tips of the sv and sc riblets so that only the tip area is exposed to high shear stresses the optimal drag reduction is obtained with the spacing s around 20 for all the cases in addition by keeping the vortices above the riblet tips the fluctuations of the spanwise velocity inside the riblet valleys would be constrained by the surface topography compared to that above a flat plate this leads to reduced skin friction on the riblet surface for the st riblets the convex shaped c f distribution over the bottom of the riblet is worth noting it may be caused by the occurrence of small scale vorticity in the riblet grooves which causes a slight increase of c f around the centre of the riblet valley but reduces the overall drag by damping out the larger streamwise vortices in the buffer layer this flow mechanism has also been described in the previous studies of jung et al 1992 and jimenez and pinelli 1999 to recommend an optimal riblet structure for drag reduction from this study three riblet geometries are chosen based on the drag reduction performance demonstrated in figs 6 and 7 for further comparison although sv1 gives the best drag reduction performance among the v shape riblets it only produces a maximum d r of 2 42 which is worse than any of the circular riblet configurations and the trapezoidal riblet configuration st3 the present result agrees with that of dean and bhushan 2010 who stated that the sawtooth riblets provided the least drag reduction benefit therefore st1 sc1 and sc2 are selected as candidate riblets for further comparison in section 3 3 3 3 optimization of riblet geometry to optimise riblet geometry for drag reduction two significant features associated with riblet geometry need to be considered firstly the lifting and pinning of streamwise vortices away from the riblet surface reduces the mixing of high speed and low speed fluids lee and lee 2001 lifting reduces the total skin friction since the vortices are only in contact with the small riblet tips further pinning is believed to provide anisotropic flow that reduces the cross stream fluid motion and in the meantime the ejection of vortices from the viscous sublayer inhibits momentum transfer bechert et al 1997 2000 dean and bhushan 2010 oeffner and lauder 2012 secondly it is necessary to minimise the skin friction on the riblets themselves since riblets protrude into the flow the increased surface area would contribute to increased drag because the total area of the riblet surface may be significantly larger than the area of the smooth surface even if the local shear stress on the riblet surface is lower than that on the smooth surface the total skin friction on the riblet surface may not be necessarily lower than that on the smooth surface to obtain overall drag reduction performance both the local drag reduction on riblets and the increase of the surface area should be taken into consideration a dilemma exists here since an oversized riblet spacing would lead to the exposure of a large surface area to high speed fluid whereas a too small riblet spacing may cause a significant increase in the number of high shear stress zones choi et al 1993 therefore a balance point between the shear stress and surface area needs to be identified such a balance point depends on the flow velocity and the dimensions of the riblets in the following subsections the effect of the extent of surface exposure on drag reduction performance is studied with the introduction of a new parameter wetted perimeter the effect of the riblets is investigated by depicting the flow statistics over the three candidate riblets selected above discussions are then drawn from the perspective of real life applications to recommend an optimal riblet structure 3 3 1 effect of wetted perimeter table 3 presents the important statistics of the three candidate riblets the detailed dimensions of these riblets can be found in table 1 considering that all the riblets are aligned along the streamwise direction and have the same cross section area 4900 μm2 the wetted perimeter of the riblets denoted by w p is introduced to quantify the extent of surface exposure to vortices it is clear in table 3 that st1 and sc1 have a similar drag reduction performance while their wetted perimeters are close to each other for sc2 with a relatively smaller wetted perimeter it displays the best drag reduction performance among the three riblet configurations this observation suggests that the wetted perimeter of riblets should be minimized to avoid exposing the surface to high speed fluid which would lead to reduced drag it is worth noting that the sc2 configuration also has the second highest numerical uncertainty 0 71 which might invalidate the above claim accordingly other riblet configurations are also examined in order to verify the effectiveness of the wetted perimeter w p for characterising the drag reduction performance fig 8 plots the drag reduction ratios of all the four v shaped riblets along with the three riblet configurations listed in table 3 against the normalised wetted perimeter w p w p u τ ν all the data in this figure are obtained at l g 12 1 it is clear in fig 8 that in general the drag reduction performance improves with reducing normalised wetted perimeter therefore the present numerical results support the hypothesis that minimizing the wetted perimeter would generally lead to a better drag reduction performance of the riblets based on the data shown in fig 8 sc2 is considered to perform slightly better compared to the other two riblet configurations it is worth noting that the above observations are under the condition of having the same cross section area of the riblet geometry 3 3 2 mean velocity profile in the near wall region of a smooth surface the viscous effect dominates below y 5 the most active part of the flow is in the buffer region at 10 y 100 jimenez 2004 this layer involves long longitudinal streaks of high and low streamwise vortices as well as shorter quasi streamwise vortices robinson 1991 in the region further away from the wall the mean streamwise velocity follows the logarithmic distribution which is widely accepted and given by 8 u κ 1 log y a where κ denotes the von kármán constant κ 0 4 and the constant a 5 1 for a smooth surface based on experimental results the above equation is applicable for y 30 for a rough surface equation 8 needs to be modified by introducing an additional term a roughness function δ u to account for the interaction of the rough surface and the flow the modified equation is written as 9 u κ 1 log y a δ u the roughness function δ u here is a negative number for most rough surfaces it is positive for drag reducing cases equation 9 has been adopted to study not only rough surfaces such as coatings or fouling on the ship hull surfaces but also the near wall flow above riblets gaudet 1987 sawyer and winter 1987 tani 1988 in the case of the riblet surfaces the roughness function δ u appears as a velocity shift as such it may be regarded as upward and downward shifts of the mean velocity profile under drag reducing and drag increasing conditions respectively fig 9 presents the variation of the mean velocity profiles with different choices of the virtual origin for the three candidate riblet surfaces the adopted virtual origins are located at the peak and valley regions of the riblets respectively as shown in the figure the differences in the mean velocity profiles over various spanwise locations are restricted within the vicinity of the wall which reflects the variations of the skin friction and the interaction between the near wall flow and the riblets note that the mean velocity profiles are normalised by the local friction velocity u τ l τ w ρ where τ w denotes the local shear stress and the mean velocity is averaged in the streamwise direction it is found in fig 9 a that the mean velocity at location 1 is the largest followed by that at location 2 the smooth surface and location 0 in sequence the c f plot of st1 in fig 7 b follows exactly the reversed order of comparisons which confirms the validity of using the roughness function δ u to indicate the drag performance of the riblet surfaces similar observations are made for the sc1 and sc2 configurations shown in fig 9 b c respectively in summary a downward velocity shift in the log law region is found near the riblet tip while significant upward shifts are observed in the riblet valley this observation indicates that the skin friction distributions at different spanwise positions may be characterised by the corresponding mean flow velocity above it 3 3 3 turbulence statistics in this section the turbulent flow statistics over the three selected riblet structures are explored considering that the variation of the statistical flow properties in the streamwise direction is insignificant the turbulence statistics in the cross sectional plane at the mid point along the streamwise direction are calculated for discussion the turbulence kinetic energy k is calculated since it is directly related to the flow state and the wall shear the near wall contours of the turbulent kinetic energy in the transverse plane for st1 sc1 and sc2 and their corresponding smooth surface are plotted for l g 12 1 in fig 10 a note that the lowest point of the riblet valley corresponds to y δ 1 and the location of the smooth surface at the top of the computational domain corresponds to y δ 1 it is seen that non uniform distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy are induced by the riblets compared to those over the smooth surface as shown in fig 10 a the presence of the riblets alters the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy profiles in the near wall region and pushes the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the surface as a quantitative indicator of the effect of the riblet on the turbulence distribution the locations of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy are determined for the smooth surface k max occurs at around y 40 6 whereas this location is pushed away from the surface by approximately 6 0 9 4 and 7 7 dimensionless wall units for st1 sc1 and sc2 respectively this observation is consistent with the drag reduction mechanism proposed by bechert et al 2000 that is a lower skin friction on the riblet surface is obtained since a thicker viscous sublayer is generated due to the displacement of the turbulent events caused by the riblet surface these turbulent events containing lateral flow velocity components w are displaced further away from the riblet surface the detailed turbulent kinetic energy profiles near y δ 1 are shown in fig 10 b in which the arrows in the plots indicate the spanwise locations from the riblet valley to riblet tip it is observed that the turbulent kinetic energy profiles above the five arbitrarily selected spanwise locations show similar features except for the region very close to the riblets this observation confirms that the effects of the riblets are restricted in the vicinity of the wall further it is noticeable that the peak values of the turbulent kinetic energy k max above all the three riblet surfaces are smaller than those above the smooth surface this is consistent with the results obtained by choi et al 1993 via a dns study which suggests the turbulent kinetic energy production over the riblets is suppressed the k max of sc1 is reduced by 5 42 compared to that of the smooth surface while the reductions are 5 06 and 5 05 for st1 and sc2 respectively it may be speculated that secondary vortices may be induced by the riblet tips which in turn weaken the turbulence intensity above the riblet surfaces and lead to drag reduction the secondary vortices have a very small contribution to skin friction since the magnitude and vorticity of the secondary vortices are relatively small lee and lee 2001 however they serve to weaken the streamwise vortices as well as restrict the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices which is a prime mechanism for turbulent drag reduction choi 1989 this is also supported by the observation of bacher and smith 1985 via flow visualization in which the lateral movement of the streaks above the riblet surface was found to be substantially less than that above the smooth surface in the region of y 15 this cross stream variation contributes to the reduction of the skin friction and momentum transfer over the riblet surfaces which minimizes the effect of the increased wetted area to further understand and test this hypothesis the vorticity distribution above the three candidate riblets are examined to identify the vortices near the riblet surfaces fig 11 displays the contours of the streamwise vorticity in the region near the riblet surfaces for all the three riblet configurations at l g 12 1 it is seen that the highest streamwise vorticity approximately 30 s 1 occurs at the tip of the st1 riblet as shown in fig 11 a and the magnitudes of the vorticity obtained at the same location for sc1 and sc2 are about half of that for st1 apparently much higher streamwise vorticity is induced by st1 near the riblet tips suggesting that the tip of st1 has more impact on the flow compared to the other two riblets among the three riblet surfaces sc1 induces the weakest streamwise vortices these observations are consistent with the c f results shown in fig 7 b which shows that the relatively higher wall shear stress only concentrates near the tip zone of st1 as proposed by choi et al 1993 the region of larger skin friction is always associated with stronger streamwise vortices the riblet peaks modify the near wall turbulent boundary layer by restricting the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices in the drag reduction case thus the sweep motions caused by streamwise vortices are less likely to move into the riblet valleys in contrast oversized riblet dimensions measured in wall units may be too large to prevent streamwise vortices from moving into the riblet valleys as a result stronger interactions between the sweep motion and riblet surface may take place which causes drag increase other than the streamwise vortices the secondary vortices may be generated by the streamwise vortices near riblets as previously mentioned however these secondary vortices could not be identified in fig 11 since the present rans simulation cannot resolve to that level of details in the near wall flows in contrast to the dns simulation combining the above observations and the existing understanding a simplified drag reduction mechanism as depicted in fig 12 is proposed with appropriate riblet dimensions streamwise vortices are lifted off by the riblet tips and they spawn counter rotation secondary vortices which weaken the streamwise vortices and retain the low speed fluid in the riblet valleys as a consequence the overall friction on the riblet surface is reduced 3 3 4 discussion three candidate riblets st1 sc1 and sc2 are selected since they have superior drag reduction performance compared to the other riblet configurations considered in this study an optimal riblet can be identified based on the following discussions in terms of the wetted perimeter sc2 performs slightly better compared to the other two riblet configurations however if the numerical uncertainties are taken into account there is no discernible difference between the three riblets therefore the wetted perimeter alone is not a reliable indicator for determining the optimal riblet structure the near wall turbulence statistics could reflect the effects of the riblets on the flow behaviour to a certain extent a higher reduction of the peak turbulent kinetic energy is observed with sc1 5 42 which compares to st1 5 06 and sc2 5 05 it is also found that the maximum turbulent kinetic energy production k max is displaced further away from the surface by the riblets compared to that for the smooth surface for st1 k max is located at 6 0 wall units further away relative to the smooth surface case and for sc1 and sc2 the locations are approximately 9 4 and 7 7 wall units away relative to the smooth surface case therefore the location of k max of sc1 is displaced furthest the observation of bechert et al 2000 indicates that a thicker viscous sublayer is generated due to the displacement of the turbulent events caused by the riblet surface which may lead to reduced skin friction on the riblet surface accordingly the quantitative comparison in terms of turbulent kinetic energy suggests that sc1 is the best in weakening the near wall flow furthermore from the contours of the streamwise vorticity it could be speculated that st1 induces the strongest streamwise vortices whereas sc1 induces the weakest one since st1 and sc1 achieve similar drag reduction they are both potential candidates of optimum riblet surface designs to further identify which design is better than the other other factors need to be considered as suggested by bacher and smith 1985 the effectiveness of the riblets is better for those with rounded valleys such as sc1 because it is more likely for the secondary vortices to develop in the rounded valley allowing a more organized process of the vorticity transfer dissipation which may further weaken the primary vortices furthermore in the sense of durability of the riblets sc1 is considered better for practical applications strong vortices may accelerate the erosion of the riblet tips which could pose detrimental effects on the drag reduction performance of the riblets this is further explained below for certain riblet geometries such as the v shape riblets trapezoidal riblets and sc2 considered in this study the tip sharpness is critical for maximizing the drag reduction performance therefore the erosion of riblet tips is a major concern for riblet applications in industries the experimental study of walsh 1982 reported a 3 4 decrease in drag reduction performance due to the peak curvature of a triangular riblet however the curvature did not affect the drag outside the drag reduction region walsh 1982 also found no significant performance degradation from the rounding of the groove bottoms the later study of garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 is in an agreement with walsh 1982 suggesting a dramatic performance decrease of triangular riblets with tip rounding on the contrary it has been reported that for flat peak blades the drag reduction performance varies little with tip rounding and even increases slightly with growing radii garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 as for those initially blunt riblets such as sc1 tip rounding sharpens their peaks which may lead to improvement of the drag reduction performance considering erosion has been a major concern for the shipping industries it is preferable to adopt riblets that do not rely heavily on the tip sharpness so that they can maintain a good drag reduction performance in such an environment accordingly sc1 is preferred over st1 since its flat peak is less sensitive to the tip erosion which implies better durability in practical applications riblet fabrication for large scale commercial applications is also one of the major challenges in practice the high costs of microscale manufacturing techniques such as 3d printing make them unviable for large scale engineering applications even for research purposes most researchers prefer to adopt the conventional cost effective methods such as milling or molding instead of microscale fabrication techniques accurate fabrication of microscale riblets is of importance to ensure a good drag reduction performance and the incremental changes in the characteristic dimensions of the riblets need to be guaranteed during the manufacturing process which is one of the major challenges for optimizing riblet geometries from the riblet fabrication point of view sc1 stands out as the optimal riblet because it is much easier to be fabricated using the conventional cost effective methods in contrast it is difficult to manufacture the sharp tips of st1 and sc2 accurately based on the above discussions this study recommends the sc1 riblet surface as the optimal configuration for application on marine vessels under the considered flow conditions the sc1 riblet surface has the potential to integrate both the antifouling and drag reduction features however further experiments are required to confirm the behaviours of the riblet surfaces and to understand further the flow mechanisms that control their behaviours 3 4 effect of riblet interval t to obtain further insight regarding how the riblet geometry affects the drag performance of the riblet surface the effect of riblet interval t on the vorticity profile above the v shape riblets sv1 sv2 sv3 and sv4 is investigated in this section for blade riblet structures martin and bhushan 2014 reported that modifying the riblet thickness t 0 08 0 5 which is equivalent to modifying the riblet interval t of the v shape riblets considered in this study had minimal impact on the turbulence fluctuations and the drag reduction performance was found to stay roughly constant however that is not the case for the variation of riblet interval over a larger scale t 3 5 24 3 this is confirmed by the apparent variations of the drag performances of the v shape riblets with different riblet intervals as shown in fig 6 d accordingly it is speculated that the variation of the riblet interval t does have an impact on the near wall flow if it reaches a certain scale the flow structures over the v shape riblets are examined with the streamwise vorticity contours shown in fig 13 the strongest streamwise vortices are found near the tips of the v shape riblets where the maximum wall shear stress also occurs with increasing riblet interval t the maximum wall shear at the riblet tips reduces and the vortices weaken for assessing the overall drag reduction performance both the local drag behaviour around the riblet tips and that over the wetted area should be taken into consideration it is evident in fig 13 that with the increase of t from sv2 to sv4 the wetted area of the riblet surfaces decreases however although sv4 has the lowest maximum drag force on its tips and the minimum wetted area among the four v shape riblet configurations the overall drag reduction performance of sv4 is the worst as indicated in fig 6 a based on the above observation and the observations of martin and bhushan 2014 about the effect of the thickness of blade riblets it can be speculated that with a particular riblet cross section shape the variation of the riblet interval would not affect the drag notably over a small scale t 0 08 0 5 however the variation of the riblet interval over a relatively large scale approximately t 3 5 24 3 in the present study may cause notable variations of the drag reduction performance therefore an optimum riblet interval t needs to be identified and the optimum configuration may depend on the cross section shapes of the riblets to further illustrate the drag variation mechanism over the v shape riblets schematics of two representative scenarios are shown in fig 14 the characteristics are similar to the drag modification mechanism proposed by choi et al 1993 in the first scenario fig 14 a and b the oversized riblets make it easier for the streamwise vortices to move in the cross flow direction and the counter rotation streamwise vortices may fall into the riblet valleys causing exposure of a large surface area to high shear stress and in turn leading to a drag increase in contrast in the second scenario fig 14 c and d the appropriately designed riblet size and spacing force the vortices to be lifted off as a result only a very small surface area of the riblet tips is exposed to high shear stress the negative impact of the increased wetted area is offset by the reduced cross stream velocity fluctuations inside the riblet valleys compared to that above a smooth plate lee and lee 2001 however it is worth noting that if the overall size of the riblets decreases to a certain level it may significantly increase the surface area and the vortex translation cannot be adequately impeded as well the behaviour of the riblet surface then approaches that of the smooth surface in another scenario for the riblets with the same cross section shape increasing the riblet interval t could lead to a smaller surface area the effects of which may become noticeable once the riblet interval increases to a certain level as early mentioned combining with the observations of the effects of the wetted perimeter of the riblets on drag reduction in section 3 3 1 a balance point between the wetted perimeter and the surface area needs to be reached also the local drag reduction by the riblets needs to be considered therefore the spanwise scale of the riblet structures should be appropriately determined to achieve an optimal drag reduction performance a more systematic study needs to be performed to identify such an optimum configuration 4 summary and conclusions in this study ten simplified riblet geometries with the same dimensional cross section area have been designed based on the physical dimensions of the antifouling surface of dosinia japonica their drag reduction performances have been examined numerically a steady rans model has been adopted to simulate fully developed turbulent flows over smooth and riblet surfaces with the mean flow velocity over the range of 1 7 m s the corresponding normalised square root of the cross section area is l g 4 5 25 6 the numerical model has been validated against zanoun s equation the law of the wall and the experimental results of walsh 1982 the present numerical results indicate that the circular riblets have the best overall drag reduction performance among the three riblet shapes whereas the v shape riblets provide the least drag reduction benefit more specifically st1 sc1 and sc2 are found to have optimal drag reduction performance with the maximum drag reduction ratios of 3 05 3 07 and 3 26 respectively at l g 12 1 15 6 accordingly they are selected as the three candidate riblets for further comparison the discussions consider both the numerically predicted drag performance of the different riblet surfaces and the issues affecting practical applications based on these considerations sc1 is opted to be the optimal riblet structure for obtaining an overall drag reduction performance a compromise between the local drag reduction by the riblets and the increase of the surface area needs to be reached such compromise depends on the flow condition and the dimensions of the riblets since all the riblets considered in this study are aligned in the streamwise direction the surface area may be characterised by the wetted perimeter w p of the riblets it is found that appropriately minimizing the wetted perimeter may lead to better drag reduction performance of the riblets by examining the near wall flow statistics of the three candidate riblets it is found that a downward or upward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law layer corresponds to drag increase or decrease this observation indicates that the skin friction distribution at different spanwise positions may be characterised by the mean flow velocity profile the mechanisms that control the drag behaviour have also been discussed based on the present observations which supports the drag reduction mechanisms proposed by others the drag reduction mechanisms can be briefly summarised as follows the presence of the riblets lifts off streamwise vortices and pushes the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the riblet surface further the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices is impeded by the riblet structure which results in a reduction of turbulent momentum transfer accompanied by a reduction of the skin friction further the effect of the riblet interval on the drag behaviour has been investigated the present investigation demonstrates that the riblet interval affects the drag reduction performance over the range t 3 5 24 3 therefore a balance point of appropriately designed riblet interval t needs to be identified further a conceptual model of the drag reduction mechanism is proposed which implies another possible balance point between the wetted perimeter and the overall surface area these two balance points may vary for different cross section shapes of the riblets the present investigation has presented a novel idea to achieve both antifouling and drag reduction with engineered riblet surfaces which have potential applications to marine vessels the simplified flow structures over riblet surfaces are depicted and analyzed to obtain an insight into the flow mechanisms by which the riblets alter the drag behaviour credit

21414,antifouling and drag reduction are two critical issues for the shipping industry previous studies have revealed that biomimetic shell surfaces have distinct antifouling features in this study ten simplified surface microstructures with the same cross section area are designed based on the antifouling scale of the shell surface morphology turbulent flow over the riblet structures is simulated using a finite volume based cfd solver with the shear stress transport k ω model to examine the effects of the riblet structures on skin friction with mean flow velocities ranging from 1 to 7 m s the corresponding dimensionless square root of the groove cross section area is l g 4 5 25 6 considering the predicted drag performance and issues concerning riblet tip rounding and fabrication an optimal geometry with both antifouling and drag reduction features has been identified the present study confirms that the riblets lift off streamwise vortices pushing the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the surface and impede the spanwise movement of streamwise vortices leading to skin friction reduction further the investigation of the effect of the riblet interval on the drag behaviour indicates the existence of a balance point between the wetted perimeter and the total area of the riblet surface for minimizing drag keywords turbulent flow skin friction drag reduction riblet surface computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction when a marine vessel navigates in the ocean it is subject to three types of resistance including pressure drag skin friction and wave making resistance much energy is spent to overcome the friction resistance which accounts for around 45 of the total drag during navigation through water dean and bhushan 2010 many aspects of the nature could serve as an inspiration for designs to reduce the friction drag one possible way to reduce the skin friction is to introduce riblets that is rows of small longitudinal grooves on the surface aligned in the streamwise direction the most extensively studied riblet structure is the biomimetic surface inspired by shark skin which has been investigated for over 40 years and the results from both experimental and numerical studies indicate possible drag reduction of up to 10 dean and bhushan 2010 a major hypothesis has been put forward to explain the drag reduction mechanisms of the riblet bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 choi et al 1993 and many researchers have attempted to explain or quantify the drag reduction mechanisms based on numerical or experimental data choi et al 1993 pointed out that drag reduction occurred with an optimal riblet spacing they conducted a direct numerical simulation dns of various riblets in a turbulent channel flow which indicates that the spanwise flow motions and the momentum transfer are suppressed by the riblets in the near wall region this observation agrees with the experimental results of choi 1989 who carried out a series of wind tunnel tests using a hot wire anemometry and revealed that the restriction of spanwise movement of the quasi streamwise vortices by optimum designed riblets led to the premature sweep events accompanied by a reduction of the skin friction subsequently luchini et al 1991 and bechert et al 1997 attempted to explain and quantify choi et al 1993 s hypothesis it is found that the mean flow sees a different origin to that of the cross flow resulting in a thicker viscous sublayer and hence a lower drag force this explanation agrees with the previous results obtained through a series of drag measurements in an oil channel bechert and bartenwerfer 1989 the above studies suggest that the presence of the riblets rectifies the turbulent flow by impeding the fluctuating cross stream component and thereby results in the reduction of turbulent momentum transfer in addition to the skin friction biofouling as another concern that could cause additional drag force during the sailing of marine vessels is an unavoidable issue to be addressed for the shipping industry especially for commercial vessels it is a costly and harmful phenomenon as a great number of aquatic growths appear on the underwater structures of the ship hull the settlement and accumulation of aquatic growths and marine organisms such as diatoms and algae on the inanimate substrate may create substantial penalties for the engineered structures of a navigation object the direct impacts include increasing the weight of marine vessels and voyage resistance which will lead to increased fuel consumption and reduced navigation speed it has been indicated that slime a type of micro biofouling would increase the resistance on marine vessels by 1 2 weed fouling could increase drag by up to 10 and hard shell fouling like barnacles could even cause the vessel drag rising by up to 40 willsher 2001 therefore the successful application of antifouling technology will not only help prevent the aquatic growths but also reduce the drag on the ship hull applying biomimetic surfaces is one of the strategies to resolve the fouling problems the shell surface is considered as a better biomimetic object compared to the biomimetic surfaces inspired by shark and fish the mucus secreted by fish would mix with the fluid in the boundary layer and reduce the friction while fish is swimming moreover a small amount of mucus is observed to be present on shark skins in the natural marine environment the mucus not only contributes to drag reduction but also has an antifouling feature this is because the antifouling mechanisms involved in shark and fish skins are related to not only the surface physical microstructures but also hydrophilic and low surface energy caused by mucus however there are mainly proteins but no mucus on shell surfaces bai et al 2013 also the sharks often swim at a high speed in the ocean while the marine shells mostly maintain at a static state it is widely acknowledged that bioaccumulation is prone to occur on the hull of the ship at static and low speed conditions and there are little fouling organisms formed during fast sailing therefore the living condition of shells is closer to the real condition of ship fouling occurrence accordingly shell surfaces are better biomimetic objects for antifouling compared to the surfaces of shark and fish skins in the previous investigation mentioned above bai et al 2013 three common marine shells including natural dosinia japonica gafrarium pectinatum and mimachlamys nobilis were selected to investigate the relationship between the shell surface microstructures and the antifouling performance using the natural shells and their replicas made from two different materials polyurethane and e44 epoxy resin the antifouling feature of the shell surfaces mainly depends on the surface microstructures at the micro scale the fouling testing results indicated that the surface microstructures of shells indeed affect the attachment of fouling organisms and they may block the adhesion of marine organisms among the tested samples the e44 replica surface of d japonica has the best antifouling ability however the drag performance of the surface has not been investigated the riblet spacing s and height h of the surface riblet structures of the d japonica are considered as the two most significant parameters contributing to its antifouling performance due to the strong correlation between drag reduction and antifouling it is necessary to investigate the drag reduction potential of the antifouling surface microstructures accordingly this study aims to identify an optimal biomimetic surface morphology that integrates both antifouling and drag reduction features specifically ten simplified riblet structures are designed based on the featured dimensions riblet spacing s and height h of the surface morphology of the d japonica steady state simulations are performed to compute fully developed turbulent flows over smooth and riblet surfaces using a rans reynolds averaged navier stokes model the drag performances of the various riblet structures are compared to identify an optimal riblet geometry for drag reduction the mechanisms causing drag reduction are also discussed 2 numerical model and tests in this study the marine shell dosinia japonica which has an antifouling feature due to its surface microstructures bai et al 2013 is considered as the biomimetic object for the drag reduction study the detailed geometric dimensions of the riblets of the d japonica surface have been reported in bai et al 2013 based on scanning electron microscope sem measurements and wavelet analysis it is found that the antifouling shell surface dimensions are typically in the range of 50 700 μm for the riblet spacing s and 40 400 μm for the riblet height h bai et al 2013 these two parameters determine the antifouling performance of the riblet surfaces and thus the ranges of s and h are considered as the appropriate antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface the antifouling capability of the d japonica surface may be explained using the attachment point theory scardino et al 2006 2008 which states that fouling organisms larger than the scale of microtexture have reduced adhesion strength due to fewer attachment points and those smaller than the scale of microtexture have greater adhesion strength due to increased number of attachment points further the experimental study conducted by walsh 1982 showed that consistent net drag reduction occurred for s 30 and h 25 where s and h are defined in equations 1 and 2 below the design of the riblet surfaces in this study considers the requirements for both antifouling and drag reduction to better characterise the turbulent flow over riblet surfaces all length scales are converted to non dimensional wall units denoted by a superscript in this study the riblet spacing s and the riblet height h are non dimensionalized as 1 s s u τ ν 2 h h u τ ν where ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of the fluid u τ refers to the friction velocity u τ τ 0 ρ 1 2 where τ 0 denotes the wall shear stress and ρ is the density of the fluid garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 identified a new geometric parameter the square root of the riblet cross section area l g a g 1 2 which captures the influence of both the riblet spacing and shape it is defined as 3 l g a g 1 2 u τ ν where a g denotes the riblet cross section area through which the fluid is flowing the existing drag reduction experimental data was found to collapse better with this new length scale l g and the optimum drag reduction performance was achieved at l g 11 for all the riblet structures reviewed by garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 hence l g can better characterise drag behaviour of riblet surfaces compared with the classical choices of the non dimensional riblet spacing s and height h several factors are considered to determine the physical dimensions of the riblet structures in the present investigation firstly the above mentioned dimensional parameters need to cover sufficiently wide ranges so that the optimum configuration may be identified secondly the design of the riblet surfaces needs to enable a comparison of the drag performance of the present designs with the corresponding cases reported in the previous studies in terms of the dimensionless parameters thirdly since the optimal drag reduction range was found to be s o p t 15 20 and l g 11 the riblet should be designed to centre the dimensionless parameters around these values this allows either side of the optimum dimensionless range to be tested finally the antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface mentioned above should also be considered in the design of the riblet structures to reflect the real life situation of ocean navigation for marine vessels in this study the flow velocity applied in the simulations is determined with consideration of the economical speed of cargo ships in the situation of high fossil fuel prices slow steaming speed range is 3 16 knots has been adopted by shipping companies to cut costs as required by the environmental agenda therefore the velocity range adopted in this study is determined based on this slow steaming cruising speed of marine vessels which corresponds to 1 7 m s in terms of the mean flow velocity u m 2 1 simplified riblet designs previous studies have reported that s over the range of 15 20 gave the best drag reduction performance bechert et al 1997 choi et al 1993 peet and sagaut 2009 walsh 1982 walsh and lindemann 1984 in particular choi et al 1993 proposed that the frictional drag on the riblets was reduced when the riblet spacing s was less than the diameter of the streamwise near wall vortex that was approximately 25 35 wall units in this case the streamwise vortices cannot intrude into the riblets and the occurrence of large shear was only restricted to the tips of the riblets hence the optimal dimensionless parameter range is not only related to the physical scale of the riblets but also the scale of the streamwise vortices further the riblet structure design should also consider the antifouling scale of the shell inspired surface as mentioned above a series of streamwise aligned riblet configurations are designed based on the criteria mentioned above and the velocity range considered in this study as shown in fig 1 three riblet shapes v shape trapezoidal and circular riblets are considered all the riblets protrude into the flow with the mean flow velocity u m in the range of 1 7 m s considered in this study the non dimensionalized riblet spacing s and height h vary approximately over the ranges of 6 43 and 3 35 respectively whereas l g varies over the range of 4 25 the detailed dimensions of each riblet design are displayed in table 1 three sets of investigations are carried out to determine the optimal riblet design for drag reduction firstly since the dimensional cross section areas a g of all the ten riblet designs are kept the same the optimal riblet cross section shape is identified based on their drag reduction performances secondly three candidate riblet geometries of the identified shapes are compared to determine the optimal design in this study and finally the effect of the riblet interval t of the v shape riblets on the drag performance is investigated to obtain further insight into how the riblet geometry affects the drag performance of the riblet surfaces 2 2 numerical details 2 2 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in this study the friction drag on a small segment of the ship hull subject to turbulent flows of various velocities is calculated numerically to facilitate direct comparison of the drag performance between smooth and riblet surfaces under identical flow conditions the computational domain is configured with the riblet surface located at the bottom and the smooth surface at the top respectively refer to fig 2 both surfaces are rigid and no slip and are separated by a distance h a similar setup has been adopted in choi et al 1993 and martin and bhushan 2014 it is worth noting that this numerical setup is different from the real ship scenario in which the far field of the ship hull is unconfined as such the adopted computational domain is only appropriate for analyzing the near wall flow within the inner layer but is not sufficiently large for resolving the outer layer since the effect of the riblets on the turbulent boundary layer is present in the near wall region only refer to the numerical results presented in section 3 3 below the present setup is deemed appropriate for comparing the drag reduction performances of the different riblet surfaces the streamwise l and spanwise w dimensions of the domain are 3δ and δ respectively where δ denotes the channel half height δ h 2 δ is set to 2 4 mm in this study periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction are adopted at the inlet and outlet of the flow domain to capture the flow behaviour over an infinitely long surface the same treatment is done in the spanwise direction by adopting periodic boundary conditions on the two side surfaces of the computational domain a range of flow velocities u m 1 7 m s are considered to determine the drag performance of the riblet surfaces under different flow conditions with the present setup the friction reynolds number r e τ δ u τ ν calculated in this study varies approximately from 162 to 874 and the corresponding reynolds number of the channel flow between the smooth and riblet surfaces defined by equation 5 below ranges from 2400 to 16 800 jimenez and moin 1991 recommended that for simulating turbulent flows the spanwise w and streamwise l lengths of the computational domain must be larger than 100 and 250 300 wall units respectively the smallest computational domain adopted in this investigation is of l h w 477 317 159 wall units refer to fig 2 which is substantially larger than the minimum channel adopted by jimenez and moin 1991 the numerical results presented in section 3 3 below indicate that the streamwise vortices have a diameter around 30 dimensionless wall units and thus the present computational domain is deemed sufficiently large for resolving the largest vortex structure 2 2 2 mesh construction structured meshes are constructed throughout the computational domain for all cases a wall adapted mesh is applied for the bottom riblet surface this type of mesh is constructed to ensure the accuracy and fast convergence of the calculations in the central region of the computational domain the mesh is much coarser compared to those near the upper and lower wall regions in the smallest dimensionless domain case the grid resolution of δx 30 is adopted in the streamwise direction resulting in 16 nodes uniformly distributed in this direction the same streamwise grid resolution was adopted in the numerical studies of martin and bhushan 2014 and choi et al 1993 which indicate that the grid resolution is adequate in the spanwise direction the grid spacing varies from 0 2 to 1 wall unit with most cases having a resolution of δz 0 5 in the wall normal direction 225 grid points are distributed with the first grid point at y 0 3 away from the surfaces to capture the flow characteristics near the surfaces more accurately the mesh is biased towards the surfaces and the growth rate of the mesh in the wall normal direction is approximately 1 04 the mesh resolution is kept the same near the smooth and riblet surfaces for comparing the friction force as for the overall mesh quality the average values of the skewness and orthogonal quality of the grids are approximately 0 03 and 0 99 respectively which meet the general requirement of the sst k ω turbulence model adopted in this investigation see the following subsection 2 2 3 numerical method a finite volume based cfd solver with a steady rans turbulence model is adopted in this study the steady rans model is appropriate since we are only interested in the flow statistics over riblet surfaces with comparison to that over a smooth surface under identical flow conditions an unsteady rans model which has advantages over the steady rans model for flows involving separation and unsteady large scale vortical structures is unnecessary for the present investigation the appropriateness of steady rans solutions for predicting turbulent channel flows influenced by wall roughness has been demonstrated by jin and herwig 2015 a dns or les large eddy simulation study is ideal for resolving the instantaneous flow over the micro scale riblets and capturing the near wall dynamics however for the present parametric study les or dns becomes prohibitive in contrast rans simulations can generate data for identifying trends and obtain acceptable results for predicting the drag performance of different riblet surfaces although the small scale secondary motions over the riblets cannot be fully resolved the rans models are able to provide estimates of the drag reduction performance through reproducing the velocity shift δ u which is indicative of the effects of riblets on drag menter et al 2003 the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulent model which is a hybrid two equation model combining the advantages of both k ε and k ω models is adopted to model turbulence in this study this model was developed by menter 1994 to blend the robust formulation of the k ω model in the near wall regions with the freestream independence of the k ε model in the far field menter 2011 it takes advantage of a y insensitive wall treatment which makes the solution insensitive to wall mesh refinement by appropriately blending solutions for the viscous sublayer and logarithmic layer in the near wall region the y insensitive wall formulation is preferable compared to the standard wall function because the standard wall function imposes lower limits on the grid resolution that is the grid should not be refined below y 30 this could be problematic since it does not allow for a distinction between numerical and modeling errors menter 2011 therefore it is preferable to take advantage of the y insensitive formulation rather than adopting the standard wall function in this study the simple scheme is used for pressure velocity coupling the least square cell based option is adopted for gradient reconstruction and the second order upwind method is used for advection terms in all equations to ensure an adequately accurate solution to meet the convergence criteria an iterative procedure is adopted to solve the discretized governing equations with the maximum residual for all the equations set to 10 8 which is found to be appropriate for ensuring global conservation and convergence of the predicted friction force 2 2 4 numerical tests choi et al 1993 investigated the influence of grid resolution on turbulence statistics by doubling the grid points in both the streamwise and spanwise directions and reported that the maximum turbulence intensities and the reynolds shear stress changed by less than 2 in this study two meshes are constructed for the representative riblet structures following a similar procedure the grid spacing in the streamwise direction is fixed at δx 30 while the grid numbers in the spanwise and wall normal directions are increased from a coarser mesh to a finer mesh the total numbers of mesh element are around 2 million and 4 million for the coarse and fine meshes respectively additionally the sensitivity of the predicted drag force to the residual criteria for convergence is also tested by changing the convergence criteria residuals for all the governing equations from 10 8 to 10 9 the results of the grid and residual dependence tests obtained at the highest flow velocity u m 7 m s are summarised in table 2 which also shows sample meshes in a cross sectional plane for each type of the riblet structures v shape trapezoidal and circular riblets here the numerical uncertainty associated with the grid dependence test is the variation of the drag obtained with the coarser mesh relative to that obtained with the finer mesh and the uncertainty associated with the residual test is the variation of the drag obtained with the residual of 10 8 relative to that obtained with the residual of 10 9 the overall numerical uncertainty is the sum of the uncertainties associated with the grid resolution and residual tests it is seen in table 2 that for all the riblet structures considered in this study the overall numerical uncertainty is well below 1 considering the numerical accuracy and the constraints of computing resources the relatively coarse mesh with approximately 2 million cells is adopted in the subsequent calculations for all the riblet structures and the residual for convergence of all the governing equations is set to 10 8 3 numerical results and discussion 3 1 validation of the rans model to examine the validity of using the sst k ω turbulence model to calculate the fully turbulent channel flow the skin friction coefficient numerically obtained from a smooth wall is compared with the empirical correlation given by zanoun et al 2003 as 4 c f 0 058 r e m 0 243 where the bulk reynolds number r e m of the flow is computed based on the mean streamwise velocity u m as follows 5 r e m u m δ ν zanoun s correlation was obtained by curve fitting of the skin friction coefficient data obtained from both the pressure gradient and the local skin friction measurements using oil film interferometry a good agreement of the wall skin friction data was found between these two measurements and the obtained empirical correlation also compared well with the classic dean s equation dean 1978 given below 6 c f 0 073 r e 0 25 where the reynolds number in equation 6 above is calculated based on the full channel height here zanoun s modified equation equation 4 above is used to validate the rans model the comparison with the present calculation is shown in fig 3 it is seen in fig 3 that the calculated results of c f on the smooth surface show an excellent agreement with the data calculated using zanoun s empirical correlation fig 4 further compares the computed velocity profile against the law of the wall the present simulation results are obtained over the smooth surface in the sv1 case at the highest flow velocity u m 7 m s the streamwise velocity and the distance to the wall are non dimensionalized as u u u τ and y y u τ ν respectively it is clear in fig 4 that the numerically obtained u profile above the smooth wall is in a good agreement with the law of wall since both the calculated skin friction coefficient and the velocity profile over the smooth surface compare well with the theoretical or empirical correlations the present numerical models are deemed appropriate for this study as further validation of the numerical model fig 5 plots the predicted drag reduction ratio of the sv1 riblet surface as a function of the normalised riblet spacing along with a comparison to the experimental data of walsh 1982 here the drag reduction ratio d r is defined as 7 d r f r i b l e t f s m o o t h f s m o o t h where f r i b l e t and f s m o o t h represent the frictional forces experienced by the riblet and smooth surfaces respectively a positive value of the drag reduction ratio indicates a drag increase while a negative value indicates a drag reduction due to the riblets it is seen in fig 5 that the present results generally agree well with the experimental measurement suggesting that the present numerical model may be adopted to predict the drag performance of the riblet surfaces at least in a qualitative sense 3 2 drag performance in this section the overall drag reduction performance and detailed spanwise skin friction distributions of the different riblet surfaces are presented 3 2 1 drag reduction performance for assessing the drag reduction performance of all the riblet configurations considered in this study the correlations of d r the different riblets with the three non dimensional parameters s h and l g are presented in fig 6 it is seen in this figure that the optimal drag reduction performance occurs for the normalised riblet spacing s 17 26 and at the normalised square root of the riblet cross section area l g 12 15 these values are in general agreement with the maximum drag reduction achieved at s 18 walsh 1982 and at l g 11 for all riblet structures reviewed by garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 among the four configurations of the v shape riblets fig 6 a d and 6g it is clear that sv1 shows the best drag reduction performance d r 2 42 followed by sv2 sv3 and sv4 in descending order considering that the cross section area a g of all the riblets is fixed at a g 4900 μm2 while only the riblet interval t is varied in this investigation it is speculated that smaller t enables better drag reduction performance for the v shaped riblets this will be further discussed in section 3 4 to reveal the mechanism behind the drag performance with varying t among the three trapezoidal riblet configurations fig 6 b e and 6h st1 has the best drag reduction performance with d r 3 05 with the same trapezoidal riblet shape it is worth noting that the drag reduction performance improves with reducing tip angle α fig 6 c f and 6 i show that the three circular riblet configurations give a similar drag reduction performance intuitively to achieve a good drag reduction performance the tip of the riblet should be thin and sharp because when vortices are lifted off from the riblet surface only a small contact area of the riblet tips is exposed to a high shear stress martin and bhushan 2014 however the present results show that the circular riblets with measurable tip thicknesses sc1 and sc3 also produce favourable results in terms of drag reduction overall among the three riblet shapes considered in this study the circular riblets display the best drag reduction performance and the performance of the circular riblets is the least sensitive to the changing dimensions with a fixed cross section area 3 2 2 skin friction distribution although it has been shown above that the circular riblets have the best drag reduction performance among the three types of riblet geometries with the same cross section area the sv1 and st1 configurations also demonstrated comparable drag reduction performance to gain further insight regarding how drag reduction is achieved by the different riblet geometries and a better understanding of how the riblets alter the near wall flow the skin friction distributions over the different riblet surfaces are examined since the riblet surfaces contain repeating phases of the riblets in the spanwise direction and periodic boundary conditions are prescribed on the two spanwise end planes of the computational domain the skin friction coefficient c f averaged across all the phases is computed for each case and presented in fig 7 as a function of z λ the c f of the corresponding smooth surface for each case is also shown for comparison to illustrate the c f distribution the z coordinate is measured from the start of the riblets as shown in figure insets and normalised by the spanwise wavelength λ of the riblet structures for sv2 sv3 and sv4 λ s t whereas for the other riblet structures considered in this study λ is equivalent to the riblet spacing s the c f profile shown in fig 7 for each riblet configuration corresponds to the case with the optimal drag reduction performance as mentioned above for a given riblet geometry both s and h could be used to characterise the drag reduction performance however when comparing the performance of riblets of different shapes l g is a better non dimensional parameter to characterise the riblet geometry the skin friction profiles plotted in fig 7 correspond to l g 15 5 for sv1 and sc1 and l g 12 1 for the other 8 riblet configurations for sv1 in fig 7 a all the trapezoidal riblets st in fig 7 b and sc2 in fig 7 c the maximum c f occurs at the tips of the riblet surface for the other riblet surfaces the maximum c f is observed at the left and right edges of the riblet intervals the minimum c f of the riblets which is significantly lower than that on the smooth surface occurs at the sharp corners of the riblet valleys for the st riblets for the other riblets i e the sv and sc riblets the minimum c f is observed at the centre of the riblet valleys accordingly from the c f distribution curve of the different riblets it can be speculated that vortices are lifted off by the riblet tips of the sv and sc riblets so that only the tip area is exposed to high shear stresses the optimal drag reduction is obtained with the spacing s around 20 for all the cases in addition by keeping the vortices above the riblet tips the fluctuations of the spanwise velocity inside the riblet valleys would be constrained by the surface topography compared to that above a flat plate this leads to reduced skin friction on the riblet surface for the st riblets the convex shaped c f distribution over the bottom of the riblet is worth noting it may be caused by the occurrence of small scale vorticity in the riblet grooves which causes a slight increase of c f around the centre of the riblet valley but reduces the overall drag by damping out the larger streamwise vortices in the buffer layer this flow mechanism has also been described in the previous studies of jung et al 1992 and jimenez and pinelli 1999 to recommend an optimal riblet structure for drag reduction from this study three riblet geometries are chosen based on the drag reduction performance demonstrated in figs 6 and 7 for further comparison although sv1 gives the best drag reduction performance among the v shape riblets it only produces a maximum d r of 2 42 which is worse than any of the circular riblet configurations and the trapezoidal riblet configuration st3 the present result agrees with that of dean and bhushan 2010 who stated that the sawtooth riblets provided the least drag reduction benefit therefore st1 sc1 and sc2 are selected as candidate riblets for further comparison in section 3 3 3 3 optimization of riblet geometry to optimise riblet geometry for drag reduction two significant features associated with riblet geometry need to be considered firstly the lifting and pinning of streamwise vortices away from the riblet surface reduces the mixing of high speed and low speed fluids lee and lee 2001 lifting reduces the total skin friction since the vortices are only in contact with the small riblet tips further pinning is believed to provide anisotropic flow that reduces the cross stream fluid motion and in the meantime the ejection of vortices from the viscous sublayer inhibits momentum transfer bechert et al 1997 2000 dean and bhushan 2010 oeffner and lauder 2012 secondly it is necessary to minimise the skin friction on the riblets themselves since riblets protrude into the flow the increased surface area would contribute to increased drag because the total area of the riblet surface may be significantly larger than the area of the smooth surface even if the local shear stress on the riblet surface is lower than that on the smooth surface the total skin friction on the riblet surface may not be necessarily lower than that on the smooth surface to obtain overall drag reduction performance both the local drag reduction on riblets and the increase of the surface area should be taken into consideration a dilemma exists here since an oversized riblet spacing would lead to the exposure of a large surface area to high speed fluid whereas a too small riblet spacing may cause a significant increase in the number of high shear stress zones choi et al 1993 therefore a balance point between the shear stress and surface area needs to be identified such a balance point depends on the flow velocity and the dimensions of the riblets in the following subsections the effect of the extent of surface exposure on drag reduction performance is studied with the introduction of a new parameter wetted perimeter the effect of the riblets is investigated by depicting the flow statistics over the three candidate riblets selected above discussions are then drawn from the perspective of real life applications to recommend an optimal riblet structure 3 3 1 effect of wetted perimeter table 3 presents the important statistics of the three candidate riblets the detailed dimensions of these riblets can be found in table 1 considering that all the riblets are aligned along the streamwise direction and have the same cross section area 4900 μm2 the wetted perimeter of the riblets denoted by w p is introduced to quantify the extent of surface exposure to vortices it is clear in table 3 that st1 and sc1 have a similar drag reduction performance while their wetted perimeters are close to each other for sc2 with a relatively smaller wetted perimeter it displays the best drag reduction performance among the three riblet configurations this observation suggests that the wetted perimeter of riblets should be minimized to avoid exposing the surface to high speed fluid which would lead to reduced drag it is worth noting that the sc2 configuration also has the second highest numerical uncertainty 0 71 which might invalidate the above claim accordingly other riblet configurations are also examined in order to verify the effectiveness of the wetted perimeter w p for characterising the drag reduction performance fig 8 plots the drag reduction ratios of all the four v shaped riblets along with the three riblet configurations listed in table 3 against the normalised wetted perimeter w p w p u τ ν all the data in this figure are obtained at l g 12 1 it is clear in fig 8 that in general the drag reduction performance improves with reducing normalised wetted perimeter therefore the present numerical results support the hypothesis that minimizing the wetted perimeter would generally lead to a better drag reduction performance of the riblets based on the data shown in fig 8 sc2 is considered to perform slightly better compared to the other two riblet configurations it is worth noting that the above observations are under the condition of having the same cross section area of the riblet geometry 3 3 2 mean velocity profile in the near wall region of a smooth surface the viscous effect dominates below y 5 the most active part of the flow is in the buffer region at 10 y 100 jimenez 2004 this layer involves long longitudinal streaks of high and low streamwise vortices as well as shorter quasi streamwise vortices robinson 1991 in the region further away from the wall the mean streamwise velocity follows the logarithmic distribution which is widely accepted and given by 8 u κ 1 log y a where κ denotes the von kármán constant κ 0 4 and the constant a 5 1 for a smooth surface based on experimental results the above equation is applicable for y 30 for a rough surface equation 8 needs to be modified by introducing an additional term a roughness function δ u to account for the interaction of the rough surface and the flow the modified equation is written as 9 u κ 1 log y a δ u the roughness function δ u here is a negative number for most rough surfaces it is positive for drag reducing cases equation 9 has been adopted to study not only rough surfaces such as coatings or fouling on the ship hull surfaces but also the near wall flow above riblets gaudet 1987 sawyer and winter 1987 tani 1988 in the case of the riblet surfaces the roughness function δ u appears as a velocity shift as such it may be regarded as upward and downward shifts of the mean velocity profile under drag reducing and drag increasing conditions respectively fig 9 presents the variation of the mean velocity profiles with different choices of the virtual origin for the three candidate riblet surfaces the adopted virtual origins are located at the peak and valley regions of the riblets respectively as shown in the figure the differences in the mean velocity profiles over various spanwise locations are restricted within the vicinity of the wall which reflects the variations of the skin friction and the interaction between the near wall flow and the riblets note that the mean velocity profiles are normalised by the local friction velocity u τ l τ w ρ where τ w denotes the local shear stress and the mean velocity is averaged in the streamwise direction it is found in fig 9 a that the mean velocity at location 1 is the largest followed by that at location 2 the smooth surface and location 0 in sequence the c f plot of st1 in fig 7 b follows exactly the reversed order of comparisons which confirms the validity of using the roughness function δ u to indicate the drag performance of the riblet surfaces similar observations are made for the sc1 and sc2 configurations shown in fig 9 b c respectively in summary a downward velocity shift in the log law region is found near the riblet tip while significant upward shifts are observed in the riblet valley this observation indicates that the skin friction distributions at different spanwise positions may be characterised by the corresponding mean flow velocity above it 3 3 3 turbulence statistics in this section the turbulent flow statistics over the three selected riblet structures are explored considering that the variation of the statistical flow properties in the streamwise direction is insignificant the turbulence statistics in the cross sectional plane at the mid point along the streamwise direction are calculated for discussion the turbulence kinetic energy k is calculated since it is directly related to the flow state and the wall shear the near wall contours of the turbulent kinetic energy in the transverse plane for st1 sc1 and sc2 and their corresponding smooth surface are plotted for l g 12 1 in fig 10 a note that the lowest point of the riblet valley corresponds to y δ 1 and the location of the smooth surface at the top of the computational domain corresponds to y δ 1 it is seen that non uniform distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy are induced by the riblets compared to those over the smooth surface as shown in fig 10 a the presence of the riblets alters the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy profiles in the near wall region and pushes the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the surface as a quantitative indicator of the effect of the riblet on the turbulence distribution the locations of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy are determined for the smooth surface k max occurs at around y 40 6 whereas this location is pushed away from the surface by approximately 6 0 9 4 and 7 7 dimensionless wall units for st1 sc1 and sc2 respectively this observation is consistent with the drag reduction mechanism proposed by bechert et al 2000 that is a lower skin friction on the riblet surface is obtained since a thicker viscous sublayer is generated due to the displacement of the turbulent events caused by the riblet surface these turbulent events containing lateral flow velocity components w are displaced further away from the riblet surface the detailed turbulent kinetic energy profiles near y δ 1 are shown in fig 10 b in which the arrows in the plots indicate the spanwise locations from the riblet valley to riblet tip it is observed that the turbulent kinetic energy profiles above the five arbitrarily selected spanwise locations show similar features except for the region very close to the riblets this observation confirms that the effects of the riblets are restricted in the vicinity of the wall further it is noticeable that the peak values of the turbulent kinetic energy k max above all the three riblet surfaces are smaller than those above the smooth surface this is consistent with the results obtained by choi et al 1993 via a dns study which suggests the turbulent kinetic energy production over the riblets is suppressed the k max of sc1 is reduced by 5 42 compared to that of the smooth surface while the reductions are 5 06 and 5 05 for st1 and sc2 respectively it may be speculated that secondary vortices may be induced by the riblet tips which in turn weaken the turbulence intensity above the riblet surfaces and lead to drag reduction the secondary vortices have a very small contribution to skin friction since the magnitude and vorticity of the secondary vortices are relatively small lee and lee 2001 however they serve to weaken the streamwise vortices as well as restrict the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices which is a prime mechanism for turbulent drag reduction choi 1989 this is also supported by the observation of bacher and smith 1985 via flow visualization in which the lateral movement of the streaks above the riblet surface was found to be substantially less than that above the smooth surface in the region of y 15 this cross stream variation contributes to the reduction of the skin friction and momentum transfer over the riblet surfaces which minimizes the effect of the increased wetted area to further understand and test this hypothesis the vorticity distribution above the three candidate riblets are examined to identify the vortices near the riblet surfaces fig 11 displays the contours of the streamwise vorticity in the region near the riblet surfaces for all the three riblet configurations at l g 12 1 it is seen that the highest streamwise vorticity approximately 30 s 1 occurs at the tip of the st1 riblet as shown in fig 11 a and the magnitudes of the vorticity obtained at the same location for sc1 and sc2 are about half of that for st1 apparently much higher streamwise vorticity is induced by st1 near the riblet tips suggesting that the tip of st1 has more impact on the flow compared to the other two riblets among the three riblet surfaces sc1 induces the weakest streamwise vortices these observations are consistent with the c f results shown in fig 7 b which shows that the relatively higher wall shear stress only concentrates near the tip zone of st1 as proposed by choi et al 1993 the region of larger skin friction is always associated with stronger streamwise vortices the riblet peaks modify the near wall turbulent boundary layer by restricting the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices in the drag reduction case thus the sweep motions caused by streamwise vortices are less likely to move into the riblet valleys in contrast oversized riblet dimensions measured in wall units may be too large to prevent streamwise vortices from moving into the riblet valleys as a result stronger interactions between the sweep motion and riblet surface may take place which causes drag increase other than the streamwise vortices the secondary vortices may be generated by the streamwise vortices near riblets as previously mentioned however these secondary vortices could not be identified in fig 11 since the present rans simulation cannot resolve to that level of details in the near wall flows in contrast to the dns simulation combining the above observations and the existing understanding a simplified drag reduction mechanism as depicted in fig 12 is proposed with appropriate riblet dimensions streamwise vortices are lifted off by the riblet tips and they spawn counter rotation secondary vortices which weaken the streamwise vortices and retain the low speed fluid in the riblet valleys as a consequence the overall friction on the riblet surface is reduced 3 3 4 discussion three candidate riblets st1 sc1 and sc2 are selected since they have superior drag reduction performance compared to the other riblet configurations considered in this study an optimal riblet can be identified based on the following discussions in terms of the wetted perimeter sc2 performs slightly better compared to the other two riblet configurations however if the numerical uncertainties are taken into account there is no discernible difference between the three riblets therefore the wetted perimeter alone is not a reliable indicator for determining the optimal riblet structure the near wall turbulence statistics could reflect the effects of the riblets on the flow behaviour to a certain extent a higher reduction of the peak turbulent kinetic energy is observed with sc1 5 42 which compares to st1 5 06 and sc2 5 05 it is also found that the maximum turbulent kinetic energy production k max is displaced further away from the surface by the riblets compared to that for the smooth surface for st1 k max is located at 6 0 wall units further away relative to the smooth surface case and for sc1 and sc2 the locations are approximately 9 4 and 7 7 wall units away relative to the smooth surface case therefore the location of k max of sc1 is displaced furthest the observation of bechert et al 2000 indicates that a thicker viscous sublayer is generated due to the displacement of the turbulent events caused by the riblet surface which may lead to reduced skin friction on the riblet surface accordingly the quantitative comparison in terms of turbulent kinetic energy suggests that sc1 is the best in weakening the near wall flow furthermore from the contours of the streamwise vorticity it could be speculated that st1 induces the strongest streamwise vortices whereas sc1 induces the weakest one since st1 and sc1 achieve similar drag reduction they are both potential candidates of optimum riblet surface designs to further identify which design is better than the other other factors need to be considered as suggested by bacher and smith 1985 the effectiveness of the riblets is better for those with rounded valleys such as sc1 because it is more likely for the secondary vortices to develop in the rounded valley allowing a more organized process of the vorticity transfer dissipation which may further weaken the primary vortices furthermore in the sense of durability of the riblets sc1 is considered better for practical applications strong vortices may accelerate the erosion of the riblet tips which could pose detrimental effects on the drag reduction performance of the riblets this is further explained below for certain riblet geometries such as the v shape riblets trapezoidal riblets and sc2 considered in this study the tip sharpness is critical for maximizing the drag reduction performance therefore the erosion of riblet tips is a major concern for riblet applications in industries the experimental study of walsh 1982 reported a 3 4 decrease in drag reduction performance due to the peak curvature of a triangular riblet however the curvature did not affect the drag outside the drag reduction region walsh 1982 also found no significant performance degradation from the rounding of the groove bottoms the later study of garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 is in an agreement with walsh 1982 suggesting a dramatic performance decrease of triangular riblets with tip rounding on the contrary it has been reported that for flat peak blades the drag reduction performance varies little with tip rounding and even increases slightly with growing radii garcia mayoral and jimenez 2011 as for those initially blunt riblets such as sc1 tip rounding sharpens their peaks which may lead to improvement of the drag reduction performance considering erosion has been a major concern for the shipping industries it is preferable to adopt riblets that do not rely heavily on the tip sharpness so that they can maintain a good drag reduction performance in such an environment accordingly sc1 is preferred over st1 since its flat peak is less sensitive to the tip erosion which implies better durability in practical applications riblet fabrication for large scale commercial applications is also one of the major challenges in practice the high costs of microscale manufacturing techniques such as 3d printing make them unviable for large scale engineering applications even for research purposes most researchers prefer to adopt the conventional cost effective methods such as milling or molding instead of microscale fabrication techniques accurate fabrication of microscale riblets is of importance to ensure a good drag reduction performance and the incremental changes in the characteristic dimensions of the riblets need to be guaranteed during the manufacturing process which is one of the major challenges for optimizing riblet geometries from the riblet fabrication point of view sc1 stands out as the optimal riblet because it is much easier to be fabricated using the conventional cost effective methods in contrast it is difficult to manufacture the sharp tips of st1 and sc2 accurately based on the above discussions this study recommends the sc1 riblet surface as the optimal configuration for application on marine vessels under the considered flow conditions the sc1 riblet surface has the potential to integrate both the antifouling and drag reduction features however further experiments are required to confirm the behaviours of the riblet surfaces and to understand further the flow mechanisms that control their behaviours 3 4 effect of riblet interval t to obtain further insight regarding how the riblet geometry affects the drag performance of the riblet surface the effect of riblet interval t on the vorticity profile above the v shape riblets sv1 sv2 sv3 and sv4 is investigated in this section for blade riblet structures martin and bhushan 2014 reported that modifying the riblet thickness t 0 08 0 5 which is equivalent to modifying the riblet interval t of the v shape riblets considered in this study had minimal impact on the turbulence fluctuations and the drag reduction performance was found to stay roughly constant however that is not the case for the variation of riblet interval over a larger scale t 3 5 24 3 this is confirmed by the apparent variations of the drag performances of the v shape riblets with different riblet intervals as shown in fig 6 d accordingly it is speculated that the variation of the riblet interval t does have an impact on the near wall flow if it reaches a certain scale the flow structures over the v shape riblets are examined with the streamwise vorticity contours shown in fig 13 the strongest streamwise vortices are found near the tips of the v shape riblets where the maximum wall shear stress also occurs with increasing riblet interval t the maximum wall shear at the riblet tips reduces and the vortices weaken for assessing the overall drag reduction performance both the local drag behaviour around the riblet tips and that over the wetted area should be taken into consideration it is evident in fig 13 that with the increase of t from sv2 to sv4 the wetted area of the riblet surfaces decreases however although sv4 has the lowest maximum drag force on its tips and the minimum wetted area among the four v shape riblet configurations the overall drag reduction performance of sv4 is the worst as indicated in fig 6 a based on the above observation and the observations of martin and bhushan 2014 about the effect of the thickness of blade riblets it can be speculated that with a particular riblet cross section shape the variation of the riblet interval would not affect the drag notably over a small scale t 0 08 0 5 however the variation of the riblet interval over a relatively large scale approximately t 3 5 24 3 in the present study may cause notable variations of the drag reduction performance therefore an optimum riblet interval t needs to be identified and the optimum configuration may depend on the cross section shapes of the riblets to further illustrate the drag variation mechanism over the v shape riblets schematics of two representative scenarios are shown in fig 14 the characteristics are similar to the drag modification mechanism proposed by choi et al 1993 in the first scenario fig 14 a and b the oversized riblets make it easier for the streamwise vortices to move in the cross flow direction and the counter rotation streamwise vortices may fall into the riblet valleys causing exposure of a large surface area to high shear stress and in turn leading to a drag increase in contrast in the second scenario fig 14 c and d the appropriately designed riblet size and spacing force the vortices to be lifted off as a result only a very small surface area of the riblet tips is exposed to high shear stress the negative impact of the increased wetted area is offset by the reduced cross stream velocity fluctuations inside the riblet valleys compared to that above a smooth plate lee and lee 2001 however it is worth noting that if the overall size of the riblets decreases to a certain level it may significantly increase the surface area and the vortex translation cannot be adequately impeded as well the behaviour of the riblet surface then approaches that of the smooth surface in another scenario for the riblets with the same cross section shape increasing the riblet interval t could lead to a smaller surface area the effects of which may become noticeable once the riblet interval increases to a certain level as early mentioned combining with the observations of the effects of the wetted perimeter of the riblets on drag reduction in section 3 3 1 a balance point between the wetted perimeter and the surface area needs to be reached also the local drag reduction by the riblets needs to be considered therefore the spanwise scale of the riblet structures should be appropriately determined to achieve an optimal drag reduction performance a more systematic study needs to be performed to identify such an optimum configuration 4 summary and conclusions in this study ten simplified riblet geometries with the same dimensional cross section area have been designed based on the physical dimensions of the antifouling surface of dosinia japonica their drag reduction performances have been examined numerically a steady rans model has been adopted to simulate fully developed turbulent flows over smooth and riblet surfaces with the mean flow velocity over the range of 1 7 m s the corresponding normalised square root of the cross section area is l g 4 5 25 6 the numerical model has been validated against zanoun s equation the law of the wall and the experimental results of walsh 1982 the present numerical results indicate that the circular riblets have the best overall drag reduction performance among the three riblet shapes whereas the v shape riblets provide the least drag reduction benefit more specifically st1 sc1 and sc2 are found to have optimal drag reduction performance with the maximum drag reduction ratios of 3 05 3 07 and 3 26 respectively at l g 12 1 15 6 accordingly they are selected as the three candidate riblets for further comparison the discussions consider both the numerically predicted drag performance of the different riblet surfaces and the issues affecting practical applications based on these considerations sc1 is opted to be the optimal riblet structure for obtaining an overall drag reduction performance a compromise between the local drag reduction by the riblets and the increase of the surface area needs to be reached such compromise depends on the flow condition and the dimensions of the riblets since all the riblets considered in this study are aligned in the streamwise direction the surface area may be characterised by the wetted perimeter w p of the riblets it is found that appropriately minimizing the wetted perimeter may lead to better drag reduction performance of the riblets by examining the near wall flow statistics of the three candidate riblets it is found that a downward or upward shift of the mean velocity profile in the log law layer corresponds to drag increase or decrease this observation indicates that the skin friction distribution at different spanwise positions may be characterised by the mean flow velocity profile the mechanisms that control the drag behaviour have also been discussed based on the present observations which supports the drag reduction mechanisms proposed by others the drag reduction mechanisms can be briefly summarised as follows the presence of the riblets lifts off streamwise vortices and pushes the high turbulent kinetic energy region away from the riblet surface further the spanwise movement of the streamwise vortices is impeded by the riblet structure which results in a reduction of turbulent momentum transfer accompanied by a reduction of the skin friction further the effect of the riblet interval on the drag behaviour has been investigated the present investigation demonstrates that the riblet interval affects the drag reduction performance over the range t 3 5 24 3 therefore a balance point of appropriately designed riblet interval t needs to be identified further a conceptual model of the drag reduction mechanism is proposed which implies another possible balance point between the wetted perimeter and the overall surface area these two balance points may vary for different cross section shapes of the riblets the present investigation has presented a novel idea to achieve both antifouling and drag reduction with engineered riblet surfaces which have potential applications to marine vessels the simplified flow structures over riblet surfaces are depicted and analyzed to obtain an insight into the flow mechanisms by which the riblets alter the drag behaviour credit
