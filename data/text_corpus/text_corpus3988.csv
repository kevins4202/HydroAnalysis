19940,fouling of fine pore diffusers can cause substantial aeration energy wastage it remains challenging to monitor their condition and decide the optimal time for labour intensive and costly cleaning actions in this study we show that data from standard sensors airflow rate dissolved oxygen concentration pressure and airflow valve position which are fed to simple models can track the diffuser s condition additionally the parameter estimation of diffuser dynamic wet pressure oxygen transfer rate respiration rate and the joint alpha fouling factor α f was facilitated by an active fault detection inspired method the method executes a sequence with piecewise constant valve positions via the control system as a result airflow rates in a sequence similar to a staircase are obtained which simplifies the estimation of dissolved oxygen dynamics and airflow rate dynamics the proposed method was evaluated on a full scale over 18 months and successfully detected a reduced cleaning in the diffusers and several sensor related disturbances ultimately the findings motivate further research on how modelling combined with repetitive process disturbances can leverage data

introduction despite technical improvements in fine pore diffusers and advanced control systems the aeration system remains the single most energy demanding operational unit in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs regular cleaning of diffusers is crucial for preventing deteriorating energy efficiency garrido baserba et al 2017 rosso et al 2008 garrido baserba et al 2017 reported a 24 increase in energy consumption for the common ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm disc diffuser due to fouling and aging the first 14 months of diffuser operation in a low rate loaded wrrf fouling progression was reported to be even quicker for high loading rates the decrease in energy efficiency has been attributed to fouling and aging of the diffusers krampe 2011 rosso and stenstrom 2006 leading to a decreased oxygen transfer efficiency ote in contrast the underlying causal effects may differ garrido baserba et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 rosso and stenstrom 2006 aging and chemical fouling scaling both cause the diffuser membranes to become less flexible and increases the diffuser pressure resistance i e an increase in dynamic wet pressure dwp rosso et al 2008 wang et al 2020 both aging and fouling change the membrane properties for example by changing bubble size and distribution which results in a decreased ote garrido baserba et al 2016 garrido baserba et al 2018 odize et al 2017 1 1 timely diffuser maintenance is essential but difficult to implement timely countermeasures are essential to minimize energy wastage due to deteriorated diffuser efficiency fouling can be suppressed through different cleaning actions such as top hose cleaning manual mechanical cleaning gas sparging chemical acid cleaning and reverse flex cleaning jiang et al 2020 odize et al 2017 rosso 2018 cleaning actions are costly resource demanding and can require a temporary reduction in treatment capacity for example top hose cleaning requires a temporary shutdown of the current activated sludge process asp treatment line it is difficult to accurately predict when cleaning is needed since the fouling progression depends on factors that vary between sites garrido baserba et al 2017 odize et al 2017 garrido baserba et al 2017 reported a state of the art prediction model for linking diffuser fouling to reduced ote using deoxyribonucleic acid dna quantification on the diffusor surface such dna analyses are however not viable in practice the use of dna analysis was motivated by the inconsistent prediction results produced by historically used predictors such as mixed liquor content mlss and solids retention time srt by contrast monitoring changes in dwp in situ is straightforward epa us 1989 rosso 2018 but not sufficient on its own since changes in dwp are only partly correlated with changes in ote thus direct monitoring of the ote is also needed 1 2 assessing diffuser fouling from off gas measurements the ote can be determined directly using off gas measurements as redmon et al 1983 originally described although the off gas method provides accurate data it has three drawbacks for diffuser fouling monitoring the method is reliant on dedicated measurement equipment i e a floating hood vacuum pump and sensors which are costly and require maintenance a representative hood coverage is representative of only a part of the monitored diffusers the hood needs to be physically moved to change the monitoring position which is labour intense changes in ote obtained from off gas measurements cannot separate effects from changes in α value due to changed diffuser properties the change in ote for a used diffuser relative to the new diffuser is a factor f f metcalf and eddy 2004 rosso 2018 note that ote is proportional to the product αf and both α and f describe how effective oxygen in the air is converted to dissolved oxygen do the α value relates oxygen transfer rate in clean water and process water rosso 2018 in general the α value is challenging to monitor as it is influenced by several factors amaral et al 2019 it is dynamically changing jiang et al 2017 and is influenced partly in unknown ways rosso 2018 for this reason the only established method to separate changed diffuser properties f from changes in α is to conduct clean water ote measurements on the actual fouled diffuser this approach is obviously not feasible during real time operations 1 3 estimating oxygen transfer and respiration rate from in situ oxygen dynamics an alternative and well studied approach for assessing ote is to estimate its proxy the oxygen mass transfer function k l a this can be done recursively using for example a kalman filter as in holmberg and olsson 1985 holmberg et al 1989 lindberg 1997 the main challenge in using this approach is to excite the system change the airflow rate and do concentration sufficiently to make it possible to separate the estimation of respiration rate r from k l a several approaches have been used to excite the system including square waves holmberg and olsson 1985 oscillating do setpoints holmberg et al 1989 and on off aeration irizar et al 2009 these approaches have been tested on a full scale but only for a limited time several days there is a lack of long term studies demonstrating the practicability and usefulness of in situ estimation of r and k l a 1 4 practicability study of the staircase method as mentioned reducing energy wastage due to fouled fine pore diffusers remains a challenge because the existing method to decide a time point for cleaning requires costly and complicated off gas measurements here we propose a method for in situ condition monitoring of fine pore aeration diffusers the goal is to automatically obtain information about the condition of the diffuser during real time operations using only standard instrumentation the proposed method extracts data during an airflow rate sequence used for model parameter estimation the airflow rate excitation consists of a series of steps similar to a staircase where the valve position is kept piecewise constant at different magnitudes this facilitates the estimation of α f and dwp which are then related to the diffuser s condition the suggested approach is in line with the concept of active fault detection which has recently been useful for detecting biofilm formation on do sensors samuelsson et al 2019 the method s potential is demonstrated with an 18 month long experiment during which fouling and changes in α f and dwp were monitored in four aerated zones in a full scale wrrf 2 methods and materials the first section section 2 1 describes how the proposed staircase method was studied with the corresponding experimental setting section 2 2 next the staircase method section 2 3 is described and how it facilitates parameter estimation of dwp section 2 3 2 and α f section 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 along with a brief summary of the software implementation section 2 4 2 1 methodology the proposed staircase method was studied by comparing its parameter estimates of dwp and α f for diffusers in two parallel asp lines in a real wrrf the parameter estimates which resemble the diffusers condition were studied for 18 months to separate potential seasonal effects from long term diffuser fouling the diffusers were of different ages in the two asp lines and therefore they were assumed to exhibit different fouling rates 2 2 experimental system description the experiment was performed in the 350 000 p e bromma wrrf located in stockholm sweden the wrrf operates at a medium loading rate srt 6 days mlss 3 600 mg l in six parallel asp lines each divided into seven zones fig 1 four positions were selected for the experiment fig 1 the line 1 diffusers were 37 months old at the start of the experiment the line 2 diffusers were six months old at the start of the experiment zone 3 was only aerated during winter and therefore expected to exhibit more fouling than zone 4 zone 4 was aerated as required depending on the load situation the diffusers were made from epdm jaeger jetflex hd340 and supplied air at a water depth of 4 07 m 0 58 m above the basin bottom the basin had a sloped bottom 1 m slope on each side of the bottom with a 3 2 m flat area between the sloped sides the diffusers were mounted on the flat area with an active diffuser area density of 28 zone 3 and 30 zone 4 the air supply was controlled via a cascade controller with a fixed do setpoint for each zone with underlying slave controllers controlling the airflow rate the sensors used for control included electrochemical do sensors cerlic o2x duo thermal gas flow rate sensors endress hauser at70 and a magnetic induction sensor for assessing the current valve position the butterfly airflow valve gefa k19 was driven by a positioner siemens sipart ps2 the air was distributed with constant pressure setpoint 0 51 bar through a common manifold for the entire asp 2 3 staircase design a sequence of ten fixed airflow valve positions fig 2 each one ranging from one to ten minutes long henceforth referred to as slots were used to facilitate the estimation of dwp and α f in short a constant valve position facilitates the estimation of dwp a sizeable step in the airflow rate causing a large do change facilitates estimation of k l a and r which are needed to estimate α f the estimation procedure is further described in section 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 2 3 1 diffuser maintenance airmaint in addition to facilitating parameter estimation a high airflow rate slot seven fig 2 was applied to retain the diffusers flexible and remove coatings this so called airflow maintenance airmaint was applied at one aerated zone at the time to avoid pressure drops in the manifold air distribution system the staircase was repeated at a fixed time and on weekdays tuesdays and thursdays this was done to only compare influent loads during the same weekday and time thereby reducing the impact of daily variations in the influent and α airflow maintenance is a diffuser maintenance procedure similar to reverse flex cleaning odize et al 2017 during which the maximum nominal diffuser airflow rate is exceeded by 20 for 10 min here the originally applied airmaint procedure was slightly modified by applying a fixed valve position in contrast to the original setting where the airflow rate is fixed the airmaint was applied in the middle of the staircase fig 2 to assess its effectiveness by comparing estimated dwp and α f before and after the airmaint 2 3 2 estimating diffuser dynamic wet pressure the diffuser dynamic wet pressure dwp change can be obtained by measuring the differential pressure over the diffuser however pressure measurements were not available after the airflow valve as is common in wrrfs for this reason the dwp was instead estimated from measurements of the airflow rate through the valve the valve s position the water level above the diffuser the manifold air pressure and by using manufacturing data about the valve s flow characteristics one dwp estimate was obtained per slot and fixed valve position and airflow rate details about the dwp estimation are given in appendix a one reason for using fixed valve positions in the staircase and not data from routine operations where the valve position and airflow rate continuously vary was to handle a hysteresis in the valve position that is the airflow rates differed for the same valve position depending on the valve s motion direction for example a larger airflow rate was obtained in closing motion compared to when it was opening compare the airflow rates in slots two and five in fig 2 the impact from the valve position hysteresis was handled by only comparing dwp estimates based on the same valve motion direction with each other first an indicator for monitoring long term changes in dwp was defined as the mean value of the dwp estimates in opening motion slot five and six and denoted d w p a v g second the effect from airmaint was measured in terms of dwp as the difference between the estimated dwp before slot two and after airmaint slot nine as d w p c l e a n e f f note that both slots produce data with a valve in closing motion changes in the actual valve position hysteresis was monitored by manually choosing the lowest valve position that produced zero airflow rate in closing motion for slot three and the valve position that gave an airflow rate just above zero in closing motion for slot ten any changes in the airflow rates in either slot three or ten indicate an increasing decreasing valve hysteresis 2 3 3 estimating the alpha fouling factor α f as mentioned in section 1 2 it is challenging to separate α from the fouling factor f therefore the product α f was used as an indicator for diffuser fouling where f ranges from zero fully fouled with no air passing through the diffuser to one unfouled new diffuser the α f is defined as the ratio of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient during process conditions k l a p r o c e s s and clean water conditions k l a c l e a n as α f k l a proc ess k l a clean here k l a c l e a n was obtained using manufacturer clean water test data and rearranging the standard ote definition sote see appendix b the k l a p r o c e s s was estimated with data from the staircase and is further described in section 2 3 4 and is henceforth denoted k l a 2 3 4 estimating oxygen mass transfer and respiration rate from dissolved oxygen dynamics the theoretical basis for describing do dynamics in both continuous and discrete time has been described by for example lindberg 1997 and is briefly given here for clarity the do dynamics in a completely stirred tank with volume v is given by 1 d d o t d t q t v d o i n t d o t k l a q a i r t d o d o t r t where d o i n is the do entering the tank q is the flow rate of the influent and effluent airflow rate q a i r d o is the do saturation concentration the prediction error method pem described in söderström and stoica 1989 was used to estimate both k l a and r as constants one estimate per slot in total the staircase enabled seven k l a estimates for the fixed airflow rates during slot two and slot four to nine and two respiration rates during slot three and ten since discrete time measurements from the wrrf were to be used 1 was discretized for simplicity the euler forward was used d d o t d t d o k 1 d o k t s where t s is the sampling time and k is an integer denoting discrete time samples a general challenge is that r needs to be estimated simultaneously with k l a as both quantities vary in time due to load and sludge activity here the trick was to first estimate r as a constant and separately from k l a when the airflow rate was zero slot three and ten fig 2 this result in zero k l a in 1 and enable two estimates of the respiration rate 30 min apart slot three and ten in fig 2 next k l a was estimated by considering r as a constant where r was the mean of the two estimated respiration rates specifically the variance weighted least squares mean as described in gustafsson 2012 was used to simplify the estimation of the respiration rate only do measurements above 2 5 mg l were considered this avoids modelling the influence of do on r which has an effect mainly up to 2 and 3 mg l lopez vazquez et al 2016 note that an accurate r is critical as any errors in r will be transferred to k l a and in turn to α f variations in load or any other parameter with influence on the respiration will however be captured in r how much these aspects induce is not be possible to quantify with the proposed method this is however not needed to obtain the desired parameter estimates 2 4 software implementation and data processing the staircase sequence was implemented in the wrrf s control system siemens pcs7 data were exported from the historical database with a one second sampling time for all signals except water flow rate and temperature which were exported with a one minute sampling time data evaluation was performed offline in matlab version r2020a data from all slots were truncated by removing the first 60 s to remove effects from lowpass filters in the control system additionally 60 s were removed from slots three and ten to allow the do concentration to stabilize the different slots in each step were automatically identified by smoothing the valve position data and then detecting the change points using the matlab function ischange the smoothing was performed by applying the matlab function smoothdata twice using moving median movmedian and linear regression lowess 3 results and discussion the results are presented and discussed in four sections the first section section 3 1 gives an overview of two experimental disturbances which had an influence on the diffuser s condition and the estimated parameters next the key results are presented for the parameter estimates of d w p and α f including r and k l a and their ability to capture changes in diffuser conditions section 3 2 the results are evaluated based on the methodology section 2 1 and by considering the impact from the mentioned disturbances section 3 1 third practical experimental problems that led to poor parameter estimates are detailed and discussed section 3 3 the last section section 3 4 discusses improvements in the staircase design section 3 4 1 the experimental methodology section 3 4 2 and how the staircase method can be extended for purposes other than diffuser condition monitoring section 3 4 3 3 1 experimental factors with influence on the diffuser condition the airflow rate sensors were cleaned from coatings of dust after three months grey horizontal line fig 3 to improve the accuracy of the airflow rate measurements and additionally to study the impact of biased airflow rate measurements on the estimated parameters the cleaning increased the measured airflow rate by almost 50 1 300 nm3 h to 1 900 nm3 h at 20 valve opening for l2z4 which had the dirtiest sensor the other positions showed a smaller increase or decrease of 100 200 nm3 h the operational staff indicated that the airflow rate sensors were not routinely cleaned and had not been cleaned for at least ten years humid air in the manifold air system occasionally caused a flapping valve error which in turn prohibited a successful airmaint sequence and the intended diffuser cleaning specifically in l1z3 the targeted maximum airflow rate was not reached during airmaint from june 2019 onwards the maximum airflow rate was particularly low 1 000 nm3 h compared with the desired 6600 nm3 h between june and october 2019 from january 2020 onwards the valve was fully open during airmaint in l1z3 without producing the desired airflow rate the flapping valve error is detailed separately in section 3 2 4 but reported here since the absence of airmaint cleaning impacted the diffuser dwp as will be described in section 3 2 3 2 tracking model parameters reflecting diffuser condition this section presents the key results including the estimated dwp and α f including r and k l a concerning changes in the diffuser s condition 3 2 1 diffuser dynamic wet pressure dwp detection of absent airmaint cleaning the estimated average dwp before airmaint d w p a v g was intended to measure changes in the diffuser dynamic wet pressure due to fouling and ageing section 2 3 2 indeed the results show that d w p a v g was clearly affected by the loss of airmaint section 3 1 as shown by the marked increase 0 15 bar in d w p a v g during 2019 in l1z3 black dots fig 3 the increase was unlikely to be caused by aging effects as l1z4 had diffusers of the same age but remained able to reach the maximum airflow rate and did not show the same behaviour as l1z3 compare l1z3 and l1z4 fig 3 compared to the magnitude of the marked increase the dwp increased with only 0 03 bar in polyurethane diffusers during their first year of operation odize et al 2017 the absence of airmaint cleaning are similarly captured by dw p clea neff solid blue line l1z3 fig 3 which measures the change in dwp before and after airmaint section 2 3 2 these results indicate that the diffusers in l1z3 were fouled likely due to the absent airmaint cleaning diffuser age and incorrect measurements impact on estimated dynamic wet pressure the effect from cleaning the airflow rate sensors is seen as a sudden decrease in d w p a v g at the end of march 2019 vertical grey dashed line fig 3 in all positions this demonstrates the importance of accurate airflow rate measurements considering only data from the cleaned airflow rate sensors there is a larger trend for increasing d w p a v g for line 2 compared to l1z4 disregarding l1z3 due to the insufficient cleaning action the d w p a v g is also on average larger in line 1 than in line 2 this agrees with our expectations that newer diffusers in line 2 would show a more apparent aging effect and increase in dwp compared to line 1 the results however differed from our expectations regarding the absolute values of d w p a v g all positions showed negative d w p a v g on the order of 0 05 bar fig 3 this indicates a general bias in either model assumptions 1 or in a joint measurement air temperature and air distribution pressure the offset could also have been caused by bias in the individual measurements at the four positions airflow rate and valve position although this is less likely because it assumes that the bias was similar in magnitude at all positions ultimately we cannot identify the root cause for the offset in d w p a v g since one faulty measurement alone could not have caused such large bias therefore in future studies it would be interesting to quantify the dwp bias for new unfouled diffusers 3 2 2 the alpha fouling factor α f the trends for α f partly differed from those for d w p a v g compare figs 3 with 4 notably there was no change in α f for l1z3 due to the absent airmaint cleaning as was seen for d w p a v g this observation is in line with odize et al 2017 in which an increased dwp was not linked to a decrease in aeration efficiency the sudden change in airflow rate due to manual cleaning was not as clear in α f at l2z4 as for dwp in fig 3 considering only data after cleaning of the airflow rate sensors there is a slight trend towards increasing α f at all positions apart from l1z3 this contrasts with our expectations as we assumed there would be an increase in fouling and thus a decrease in aeration efficiency over the experimental period due to ageing and fouling such decrease was observed in garrido baserba et al 2017 and the contradicting results here could either be that the suggested method was incapable of assessing changes in aeration efficiency or that the decrease in aeration efficiency was negligible furthermore we assumed that the newer diffusers line 2 would show a larger better α f than line 1 which was not observed the α f was also above 1 0 its theoretical maximum for short periods since the current wrrf has a medium loading rate leading to extensive sensor fouling samuelsson et al 2018 we suggest that the unexpected results indicate model or measurement errors rather than negligible diffusor fouling note that any error in the estimated underlying parameters r k l a k l a c l e a n would be reflected in the α f it is likely that also large variations in the α factor due to influent composition variations mask changes in f the α f is expected to lie in the interval α f 0 11 0 79 metcalf and eddy 2004 it is known that variations in α are large and occasionally periodic we still expected a slow trend in α f due to diffusor fouling that would have been clear despite periodic variations as indicated in l2z4 fig 4 therefore further studies are needed to assess whether changes in the fouling factor f can be distinguished from influent variations with the proposed method such assessment would require extensive measurements including off gas respirometry laboratory analyses and clean water tests of fouled diffusers 3 2 3 respiration rate r the estimated respiration rate indicated an uneven load distribution between line 1 and 2 and a higher respiration rate for zone 3 than for zone 4 these interesting process related observations are detailed in the supplementary materials as they do not directly relate to the diffusers condition a reliability check of the estimated respiration rates supplementary materials indicated normal rates in all positions apart from l2z4 which was in the lower range as measured by the sludge activity scale henze et al 2002 3 2 4 oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a line 2 showed the most stable k l a and close to the expected values especially in slots four and five when compared with other positions fig 5 a see supplementary materials for a complete set of figures there was a temporary increase and periodic variation in k l a for the period july to october empty circles fig 5 a which was not predicted from the theoretical clean water value k l a c l e a n grey line fig 5 a this sudden increase was seen at all positions supplementary materials indicating that it reflects a change in the water composition either influent or activated sludge rather than in the diffusers the effect of cleaning the airflow rate sensor is shown as a step increase in the theoretical k l a c l e a n in the beginning of april in all slots fig 5 a note that in general the predicted variations in k l a c l e a n are small compared to k l a also the impact from k l a c l e a n and cleaning airflow rate sensors has a much smaller impact on α f than the variations in k l a compare the dip in α f in early march with the manual cleaning in end of march for l1z4 and l2z4 fig 4 this supports the indication that influent variations causing variations in α may be too large and mask the smaller variations in f this difficulty that can severely limit the usage of k l a to represent ote of diffusors has not been demonstrated in previous studies holmberg and olsson 1985 irizar et al 2009 lindberg 1997 most likely because they only evaluated their approach for a short time days in addition to the variations assumed to be caused by the influent all positions and slots were also affected by sensor measurement disturbances filled markers fig 5 a the disturbances however could be explained and are analysed in section 3 3 3 3 practical experimental problems related to the staircase method 3 3 1 flapping valve error a large variation or flapping in both airflow rate and valve position was observed for several measurements as shown in fig 6 and by the black dots in fig 5 the root cause for this disturbance was that the airflow rate sensor was biased by humid air which made the measured airflow rate exceeding its maximum value this in turn triggered the control system to close the valve rapidly once closed the valve was opened again which caused an excessive airflow rate that was repeated until the airflow sensor was dried out or the staircase entered a slot with a lower airflow rate the impact from humid air was concluded with a separate experiment where the flapping valve error disappeared when water condensate was removed from the aeration system the flapping valve issue was mainly seen in slot two probably when the air distribution system contained the largest condensate water volume and in slot six when the airflow rate was high and close to the maximum limit see supplementary materials for plots equivalent to fig 5 a for all positions surprisingly the flapping valve was unsuccessful in suppressing dwp despite the resulting frequent changes in airflow rate compare the black dots around july in fig 5 b with dw p avg in l1z3 in fig 3 this indicates that the maximum airflow rate was more important than the variation for effective reverse flex cleaning this suggestion is reinforced by the observed negative correlation between lowered maximum airflow rate during airmaint and dw p avg supplementary materials fig 1 3 3 2 erroneous airflow rate during the period from june to october the k l a c l e a n in l1z3 exhibited a series of peaks followed by a dip grey diamonds fig 5 b similar events were seen for several slots in zones 3 and 4 line 1 supplementary materials these were caused by a seemingly erroneous airflow rate that had a direct impact on k l a c l e a n we identified two different reasons for the deviating airflow rates first the peaks in fig 5 b were caused by a confusion in the slot identification algorithm induced by the flapping valve due to the flapping valve the valve position variations were large making it difficult to identify when a new slot began as mentioned in section 2 4 data for the different slots were extracted based on a change detection algorithm that identified the different slots from valve position data as a result the airflow rates from the wrong slots were used which showed as erroneous airflow rates second the period with low or zero k l a c l e a n in l1z3 was caused by a low airflow rate in the staircases it was clear that the airflow rate was zero at all valve positions indicating either a frozen or broken airflow rate sensor or a closed valve with faulty position indication the do measurement oscillated between zero or very low concentration and normal values this somewhat mysterious behaviour was explained by a play in the airflow rate sensor which was solved in november by replacing the sensor resulting in expected values for k l a c l e a n 3 3 3 insufficient do excitation slots seven to nine showed insufficient do excitation blue dots fig 5 a this was found to be caused by the intensive aeration during airmaint the airmaint resulted in a do concentration close to or above the maximum saturated value limiting the available increase in do concentration in subsequent slots this made it difficult to estimate k l a accurately as the model 1 may provide a poor estimate when d o k 1 d o k t s is small the other positions showed similar results with insufficient do excitation as in l2z4 supplementary materials when the do is close to its saturated value the related problem is that the oxygen is transferred to the off gas instead of the water this is not captured in 1 and introduces a bias in k l a from fig 5 a it is not clear whether the high do concentration caused a sufficiently large bias to be problematic as there is no clear difference between normal empty circles and potentially biased estimates blue circles for example in slot two to five 3 3 4 biased do measurements occasionally the measured do was even above its theoretical saturated concentration this result in a negative difference d o d o t in 1 which in turn produce negative k l a slot seven and nine in fig 5 a do measurements above the theoretically saturated value more than 1 mg l above were flagged as biased measurements red dots fig 5 a the biased measurements were mainly found in l1z4 39 in slot seven see supplementary materials fig 5 b which indicates that the do sensor in l1z4 produced inaccurate measurements for comparison the l2z4 showed 8 biased measurements for the same slot supplementary materials fig 5 d slot seven the effect of the biased do sensor on the estimated k l a values was unclear because we lacked information about the bias type and magnitude similarly as for the erroneous airflow rates we note that the staircase method can detect data quality issues here in terms of a biased do sensor the biased do sensors were not noticed in the wrrfs everyday routines which shows the potential for the staircase method also to indicate data quality issues 3 4 suggested method and experimental improvements 3 4 1 improving the staircase the many disturbances with a negative impact on k l a are expected to be mitigated if the following improvements to the staircase are made the airmaint should be positioned at the beginning of the sequence to remove as much condensate water as possible and reduce the risk of a flapping valve during airmaint the valve should be controlled to an airflow rate setpoint instead of a predefined valve position this would also avoid the flapping valve error during airmaint a sufficient do excitation could be obtained if the do was allowed to settle to about 4 mg l between each aeration slot for example the second slot with zero airflow rate slot ten should be placed directly after the airmaint to lower the do concentration sufficiently 3 4 2 recommendations for replicating the implementation in a future implementation the results would be less uncertain if the observed challenges in this study were considered we recommend obtaining baseline parameter estimates when new diffusers are installed measuring variations in temperature and humidity both before and after the blowers close to the valve to estimate the impact of condensate water an even better solution is to automatically remove the condensate water early in the air distribution system verifying that the airflow rate sensors are clean and provide accurate measurements as this is not commonly part of sensor maintenance procedures after calibrating and validating the do sensors comparing the measured maximum do saturation concentration in buckets with clean and process water this will be an additional validation of the measured accuracy at the abnormally high do concentrations used for estimating k l a the method should be further validated by comparing estimated values with suitable reference measurements such as pressure measurements before and after the diffuser respirometry and off gas measurements 3 4 3 extending the method to additional applications the staircase method was inspired by the active fault detection concept puncochár and skach 2018 in line with that concept the staircase could be used to obtain additional information about the process and sensors estimating respiration rate has many potential applications as exemplified in olsson 2012 and the suggested method would be applicable for in situ respirometry at several all zones and lines without the need for added instrumentation as indicated previously the maximum do concentration is reached or can be assumed to be reached during airmaint this value could be used to assess the deviation in do measurements to quantify bias direction and magnitude in the do sensor finally the large change in do during airmaint can be considered to be a controlled disturbance that will impact the do in the subsequent zones by monitoring how quickly the subsequent do controllers suppress the disturbance a measure of their disturbance rejection ability could be obtained using the method by petersson et al 2002 4 conclusions diffuser condition and the reverse flex cleaning effect airmaint can be monitored using only existing sensors in combination with the proposed staircase method an increase in the dynamic wet pressure due to insufficient reverse flex cleaning was detected as changes in the related parameter estimates d w p a v g and d w p c l e a n e f f these estimates of the dynamic wet pressure are therefore suggested as promising early warning indicators for diffuser fouling by contrast the estimated alpha fouling factor showed no trends of increasing diffusor fouling instead large variations were seen in alpha fouling factor which were suspected to originate from influent composition variations and in turn the estimated oxygen mass transfer coefficient this crucial challenge for using the oxygen mass transfer coefficient for diffusor condition monitoring has to the best of our knowledge not been emphasized before and needs to be considered in future studies ultimately this study demonstrates that the staircase method is a promising strategy since it is available and straightforward with minor costs the staircase method can also be valuable for data quality assessment disturbances causing bias in airflow rates and do sensor measurements were found which would have gone undetected without analysing the data produced by the staircase method further research is motivated on how modelling in combination with repetitive process disturbances can provide useful information without

19940,fouling of fine pore diffusers can cause substantial aeration energy wastage it remains challenging to monitor their condition and decide the optimal time for labour intensive and costly cleaning actions in this study we show that data from standard sensors airflow rate dissolved oxygen concentration pressure and airflow valve position which are fed to simple models can track the diffuser s condition additionally the parameter estimation of diffuser dynamic wet pressure oxygen transfer rate respiration rate and the joint alpha fouling factor α f was facilitated by an active fault detection inspired method the method executes a sequence with piecewise constant valve positions via the control system as a result airflow rates in a sequence similar to a staircase are obtained which simplifies the estimation of dissolved oxygen dynamics and airflow rate dynamics the proposed method was evaluated on a full scale over 18 months and successfully detected a reduced cleaning in the diffusers and several sensor related disturbances ultimately the findings motivate further research on how modelling combined with repetitive process disturbances can leverage data driven insights from standard instrumentation graphical asbtract image graphical abstract keywords alpha factor diffuser maintenance fouling kla oxygen mass transfer rate process monitoring 1 introduction despite technical improvements in fine pore diffusers and advanced control systems the aeration system remains the single most energy demanding operational unit in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs regular cleaning of diffusers is crucial for preventing deteriorating energy efficiency garrido baserba et al 2017 rosso et al 2008 garrido baserba et al 2017 reported a 24 increase in energy consumption for the common ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm disc diffuser due to fouling and aging the first 14 months of diffuser operation in a low rate loaded wrrf fouling progression was reported to be even quicker for high loading rates the decrease in energy efficiency has been attributed to fouling and aging of the diffusers krampe 2011 rosso and stenstrom 2006 leading to a decreased oxygen transfer efficiency ote in contrast the underlying causal effects may differ garrido baserba et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 rosso and stenstrom 2006 aging and chemical fouling scaling both cause the diffuser membranes to become less flexible and increases the diffuser pressure resistance i e an increase in dynamic wet pressure dwp rosso et al 2008 wang et al 2020 both aging and fouling change the membrane properties for example by changing bubble size and distribution which results in a decreased ote garrido baserba et al 2016 garrido baserba et al 2018 odize et al 2017 1 1 timely diffuser maintenance is essential but difficult to implement timely countermeasures are essential to minimize energy wastage due to deteriorated diffuser efficiency fouling can be suppressed through different cleaning actions such as top hose cleaning manual mechanical cleaning gas sparging chemical acid cleaning and reverse flex cleaning jiang et al 2020 odize et al 2017 rosso 2018 cleaning actions are costly resource demanding and can require a temporary reduction in treatment capacity for example top hose cleaning requires a temporary shutdown of the current activated sludge process asp treatment line it is difficult to accurately predict when cleaning is needed since the fouling progression depends on factors that vary between sites garrido baserba et al 2017 odize et al 2017 garrido baserba et al 2017 reported a state of the art prediction model for linking diffuser fouling to reduced ote using deoxyribonucleic acid dna quantification on the diffusor surface such dna analyses are however not viable in practice the use of dna analysis was motivated by the inconsistent prediction results produced by historically used predictors such as mixed liquor content mlss and solids retention time srt by contrast monitoring changes in dwp in situ is straightforward epa us 1989 rosso 2018 but not sufficient on its own since changes in dwp are only partly correlated with changes in ote thus direct monitoring of the ote is also needed 1 2 assessing diffuser fouling from off gas measurements the ote can be determined directly using off gas measurements as redmon et al 1983 originally described although the off gas method provides accurate data it has three drawbacks for diffuser fouling monitoring the method is reliant on dedicated measurement equipment i e a floating hood vacuum pump and sensors which are costly and require maintenance a representative hood coverage is representative of only a part of the monitored diffusers the hood needs to be physically moved to change the monitoring position which is labour intense changes in ote obtained from off gas measurements cannot separate effects from changes in α value due to changed diffuser properties the change in ote for a used diffuser relative to the new diffuser is a factor f f metcalf and eddy 2004 rosso 2018 note that ote is proportional to the product αf and both α and f describe how effective oxygen in the air is converted to dissolved oxygen do the α value relates oxygen transfer rate in clean water and process water rosso 2018 in general the α value is challenging to monitor as it is influenced by several factors amaral et al 2019 it is dynamically changing jiang et al 2017 and is influenced partly in unknown ways rosso 2018 for this reason the only established method to separate changed diffuser properties f from changes in α is to conduct clean water ote measurements on the actual fouled diffuser this approach is obviously not feasible during real time operations 1 3 estimating oxygen transfer and respiration rate from in situ oxygen dynamics an alternative and well studied approach for assessing ote is to estimate its proxy the oxygen mass transfer function k l a this can be done recursively using for example a kalman filter as in holmberg and olsson 1985 holmberg et al 1989 lindberg 1997 the main challenge in using this approach is to excite the system change the airflow rate and do concentration sufficiently to make it possible to separate the estimation of respiration rate r from k l a several approaches have been used to excite the system including square waves holmberg and olsson 1985 oscillating do setpoints holmberg et al 1989 and on off aeration irizar et al 2009 these approaches have been tested on a full scale but only for a limited time several days there is a lack of long term studies demonstrating the practicability and usefulness of in situ estimation of r and k l a 1 4 practicability study of the staircase method as mentioned reducing energy wastage due to fouled fine pore diffusers remains a challenge because the existing method to decide a time point for cleaning requires costly and complicated off gas measurements here we propose a method for in situ condition monitoring of fine pore aeration diffusers the goal is to automatically obtain information about the condition of the diffuser during real time operations using only standard instrumentation the proposed method extracts data during an airflow rate sequence used for model parameter estimation the airflow rate excitation consists of a series of steps similar to a staircase where the valve position is kept piecewise constant at different magnitudes this facilitates the estimation of α f and dwp which are then related to the diffuser s condition the suggested approach is in line with the concept of active fault detection which has recently been useful for detecting biofilm formation on do sensors samuelsson et al 2019 the method s potential is demonstrated with an 18 month long experiment during which fouling and changes in α f and dwp were monitored in four aerated zones in a full scale wrrf 2 methods and materials the first section section 2 1 describes how the proposed staircase method was studied with the corresponding experimental setting section 2 2 next the staircase method section 2 3 is described and how it facilitates parameter estimation of dwp section 2 3 2 and α f section 2 3 3 and 2 3 4 along with a brief summary of the software implementation section 2 4 2 1 methodology the proposed staircase method was studied by comparing its parameter estimates of dwp and α f for diffusers in two parallel asp lines in a real wrrf the parameter estimates which resemble the diffusers condition were studied for 18 months to separate potential seasonal effects from long term diffuser fouling the diffusers were of different ages in the two asp lines and therefore they were assumed to exhibit different fouling rates 2 2 experimental system description the experiment was performed in the 350 000 p e bromma wrrf located in stockholm sweden the wrrf operates at a medium loading rate srt 6 days mlss 3 600 mg l in six parallel asp lines each divided into seven zones fig 1 four positions were selected for the experiment fig 1 the line 1 diffusers were 37 months old at the start of the experiment the line 2 diffusers were six months old at the start of the experiment zone 3 was only aerated during winter and therefore expected to exhibit more fouling than zone 4 zone 4 was aerated as required depending on the load situation the diffusers were made from epdm jaeger jetflex hd340 and supplied air at a water depth of 4 07 m 0 58 m above the basin bottom the basin had a sloped bottom 1 m slope on each side of the bottom with a 3 2 m flat area between the sloped sides the diffusers were mounted on the flat area with an active diffuser area density of 28 zone 3 and 30 zone 4 the air supply was controlled via a cascade controller with a fixed do setpoint for each zone with underlying slave controllers controlling the airflow rate the sensors used for control included electrochemical do sensors cerlic o2x duo thermal gas flow rate sensors endress hauser at70 and a magnetic induction sensor for assessing the current valve position the butterfly airflow valve gefa k19 was driven by a positioner siemens sipart ps2 the air was distributed with constant pressure setpoint 0 51 bar through a common manifold for the entire asp 2 3 staircase design a sequence of ten fixed airflow valve positions fig 2 each one ranging from one to ten minutes long henceforth referred to as slots were used to facilitate the estimation of dwp and α f in short a constant valve position facilitates the estimation of dwp a sizeable step in the airflow rate causing a large do change facilitates estimation of k l a and r which are needed to estimate α f the estimation procedure is further described in section 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 2 3 1 diffuser maintenance airmaint in addition to facilitating parameter estimation a high airflow rate slot seven fig 2 was applied to retain the diffusers flexible and remove coatings this so called airflow maintenance airmaint was applied at one aerated zone at the time to avoid pressure drops in the manifold air distribution system the staircase was repeated at a fixed time and on weekdays tuesdays and thursdays this was done to only compare influent loads during the same weekday and time thereby reducing the impact of daily variations in the influent and α airflow maintenance is a diffuser maintenance procedure similar to reverse flex cleaning odize et al 2017 during which the maximum nominal diffuser airflow rate is exceeded by 20 for 10 min here the originally applied airmaint procedure was slightly modified by applying a fixed valve position in contrast to the original setting where the airflow rate is fixed the airmaint was applied in the middle of the staircase fig 2 to assess its effectiveness by comparing estimated dwp and α f before and after the airmaint 2 3 2 estimating diffuser dynamic wet pressure the diffuser dynamic wet pressure dwp change can be obtained by measuring the differential pressure over the diffuser however pressure measurements were not available after the airflow valve as is common in wrrfs for this reason the dwp was instead estimated from measurements of the airflow rate through the valve the valve s position the water level above the diffuser the manifold air pressure and by using manufacturing data about the valve s flow characteristics one dwp estimate was obtained per slot and fixed valve position and airflow rate details about the dwp estimation are given in appendix a one reason for using fixed valve positions in the staircase and not data from routine operations where the valve position and airflow rate continuously vary was to handle a hysteresis in the valve position that is the airflow rates differed for the same valve position depending on the valve s motion direction for example a larger airflow rate was obtained in closing motion compared to when it was opening compare the airflow rates in slots two and five in fig 2 the impact from the valve position hysteresis was handled by only comparing dwp estimates based on the same valve motion direction with each other first an indicator for monitoring long term changes in dwp was defined as the mean value of the dwp estimates in opening motion slot five and six and denoted d w p a v g second the effect from airmaint was measured in terms of dwp as the difference between the estimated dwp before slot two and after airmaint slot nine as d w p c l e a n e f f note that both slots produce data with a valve in closing motion changes in the actual valve position hysteresis was monitored by manually choosing the lowest valve position that produced zero airflow rate in closing motion for slot three and the valve position that gave an airflow rate just above zero in closing motion for slot ten any changes in the airflow rates in either slot three or ten indicate an increasing decreasing valve hysteresis 2 3 3 estimating the alpha fouling factor α f as mentioned in section 1 2 it is challenging to separate α from the fouling factor f therefore the product α f was used as an indicator for diffuser fouling where f ranges from zero fully fouled with no air passing through the diffuser to one unfouled new diffuser the α f is defined as the ratio of the oxygen mass transfer coefficient during process conditions k l a p r o c e s s and clean water conditions k l a c l e a n as α f k l a proc ess k l a clean here k l a c l e a n was obtained using manufacturer clean water test data and rearranging the standard ote definition sote see appendix b the k l a p r o c e s s was estimated with data from the staircase and is further described in section 2 3 4 and is henceforth denoted k l a 2 3 4 estimating oxygen mass transfer and respiration rate from dissolved oxygen dynamics the theoretical basis for describing do dynamics in both continuous and discrete time has been described by for example lindberg 1997 and is briefly given here for clarity the do dynamics in a completely stirred tank with volume v is given by 1 d d o t d t q t v d o i n t d o t k l a q a i r t d o d o t r t where d o i n is the do entering the tank q is the flow rate of the influent and effluent airflow rate q a i r d o is the do saturation concentration the prediction error method pem described in söderström and stoica 1989 was used to estimate both k l a and r as constants one estimate per slot in total the staircase enabled seven k l a estimates for the fixed airflow rates during slot two and slot four to nine and two respiration rates during slot three and ten since discrete time measurements from the wrrf were to be used 1 was discretized for simplicity the euler forward was used d d o t d t d o k 1 d o k t s where t s is the sampling time and k is an integer denoting discrete time samples a general challenge is that r needs to be estimated simultaneously with k l a as both quantities vary in time due to load and sludge activity here the trick was to first estimate r as a constant and separately from k l a when the airflow rate was zero slot three and ten fig 2 this result in zero k l a in 1 and enable two estimates of the respiration rate 30 min apart slot three and ten in fig 2 next k l a was estimated by considering r as a constant where r was the mean of the two estimated respiration rates specifically the variance weighted least squares mean as described in gustafsson 2012 was used to simplify the estimation of the respiration rate only do measurements above 2 5 mg l were considered this avoids modelling the influence of do on r which has an effect mainly up to 2 and 3 mg l lopez vazquez et al 2016 note that an accurate r is critical as any errors in r will be transferred to k l a and in turn to α f variations in load or any other parameter with influence on the respiration will however be captured in r how much these aspects induce is not be possible to quantify with the proposed method this is however not needed to obtain the desired parameter estimates 2 4 software implementation and data processing the staircase sequence was implemented in the wrrf s control system siemens pcs7 data were exported from the historical database with a one second sampling time for all signals except water flow rate and temperature which were exported with a one minute sampling time data evaluation was performed offline in matlab version r2020a data from all slots were truncated by removing the first 60 s to remove effects from lowpass filters in the control system additionally 60 s were removed from slots three and ten to allow the do concentration to stabilize the different slots in each step were automatically identified by smoothing the valve position data and then detecting the change points using the matlab function ischange the smoothing was performed by applying the matlab function smoothdata twice using moving median movmedian and linear regression lowess 3 results and discussion the results are presented and discussed in four sections the first section section 3 1 gives an overview of two experimental disturbances which had an influence on the diffuser s condition and the estimated parameters next the key results are presented for the parameter estimates of d w p and α f including r and k l a and their ability to capture changes in diffuser conditions section 3 2 the results are evaluated based on the methodology section 2 1 and by considering the impact from the mentioned disturbances section 3 1 third practical experimental problems that led to poor parameter estimates are detailed and discussed section 3 3 the last section section 3 4 discusses improvements in the staircase design section 3 4 1 the experimental methodology section 3 4 2 and how the staircase method can be extended for purposes other than diffuser condition monitoring section 3 4 3 3 1 experimental factors with influence on the diffuser condition the airflow rate sensors were cleaned from coatings of dust after three months grey horizontal line fig 3 to improve the accuracy of the airflow rate measurements and additionally to study the impact of biased airflow rate measurements on the estimated parameters the cleaning increased the measured airflow rate by almost 50 1 300 nm3 h to 1 900 nm3 h at 20 valve opening for l2z4 which had the dirtiest sensor the other positions showed a smaller increase or decrease of 100 200 nm3 h the operational staff indicated that the airflow rate sensors were not routinely cleaned and had not been cleaned for at least ten years humid air in the manifold air system occasionally caused a flapping valve error which in turn prohibited a successful airmaint sequence and the intended diffuser cleaning specifically in l1z3 the targeted maximum airflow rate was not reached during airmaint from june 2019 onwards the maximum airflow rate was particularly low 1 000 nm3 h compared with the desired 6600 nm3 h between june and october 2019 from january 2020 onwards the valve was fully open during airmaint in l1z3 without producing the desired airflow rate the flapping valve error is detailed separately in section 3 2 4 but reported here since the absence of airmaint cleaning impacted the diffuser dwp as will be described in section 3 2 3 2 tracking model parameters reflecting diffuser condition this section presents the key results including the estimated dwp and α f including r and k l a concerning changes in the diffuser s condition 3 2 1 diffuser dynamic wet pressure dwp detection of absent airmaint cleaning the estimated average dwp before airmaint d w p a v g was intended to measure changes in the diffuser dynamic wet pressure due to fouling and ageing section 2 3 2 indeed the results show that d w p a v g was clearly affected by the loss of airmaint section 3 1 as shown by the marked increase 0 15 bar in d w p a v g during 2019 in l1z3 black dots fig 3 the increase was unlikely to be caused by aging effects as l1z4 had diffusers of the same age but remained able to reach the maximum airflow rate and did not show the same behaviour as l1z3 compare l1z3 and l1z4 fig 3 compared to the magnitude of the marked increase the dwp increased with only 0 03 bar in polyurethane diffusers during their first year of operation odize et al 2017 the absence of airmaint cleaning are similarly captured by dw p clea neff solid blue line l1z3 fig 3 which measures the change in dwp before and after airmaint section 2 3 2 these results indicate that the diffusers in l1z3 were fouled likely due to the absent airmaint cleaning diffuser age and incorrect measurements impact on estimated dynamic wet pressure the effect from cleaning the airflow rate sensors is seen as a sudden decrease in d w p a v g at the end of march 2019 vertical grey dashed line fig 3 in all positions this demonstrates the importance of accurate airflow rate measurements considering only data from the cleaned airflow rate sensors there is a larger trend for increasing d w p a v g for line 2 compared to l1z4 disregarding l1z3 due to the insufficient cleaning action the d w p a v g is also on average larger in line 1 than in line 2 this agrees with our expectations that newer diffusers in line 2 would show a more apparent aging effect and increase in dwp compared to line 1 the results however differed from our expectations regarding the absolute values of d w p a v g all positions showed negative d w p a v g on the order of 0 05 bar fig 3 this indicates a general bias in either model assumptions 1 or in a joint measurement air temperature and air distribution pressure the offset could also have been caused by bias in the individual measurements at the four positions airflow rate and valve position although this is less likely because it assumes that the bias was similar in magnitude at all positions ultimately we cannot identify the root cause for the offset in d w p a v g since one faulty measurement alone could not have caused such large bias therefore in future studies it would be interesting to quantify the dwp bias for new unfouled diffusers 3 2 2 the alpha fouling factor α f the trends for α f partly differed from those for d w p a v g compare figs 3 with 4 notably there was no change in α f for l1z3 due to the absent airmaint cleaning as was seen for d w p a v g this observation is in line with odize et al 2017 in which an increased dwp was not linked to a decrease in aeration efficiency the sudden change in airflow rate due to manual cleaning was not as clear in α f at l2z4 as for dwp in fig 3 considering only data after cleaning of the airflow rate sensors there is a slight trend towards increasing α f at all positions apart from l1z3 this contrasts with our expectations as we assumed there would be an increase in fouling and thus a decrease in aeration efficiency over the experimental period due to ageing and fouling such decrease was observed in garrido baserba et al 2017 and the contradicting results here could either be that the suggested method was incapable of assessing changes in aeration efficiency or that the decrease in aeration efficiency was negligible furthermore we assumed that the newer diffusers line 2 would show a larger better α f than line 1 which was not observed the α f was also above 1 0 its theoretical maximum for short periods since the current wrrf has a medium loading rate leading to extensive sensor fouling samuelsson et al 2018 we suggest that the unexpected results indicate model or measurement errors rather than negligible diffusor fouling note that any error in the estimated underlying parameters r k l a k l a c l e a n would be reflected in the α f it is likely that also large variations in the α factor due to influent composition variations mask changes in f the α f is expected to lie in the interval α f 0 11 0 79 metcalf and eddy 2004 it is known that variations in α are large and occasionally periodic we still expected a slow trend in α f due to diffusor fouling that would have been clear despite periodic variations as indicated in l2z4 fig 4 therefore further studies are needed to assess whether changes in the fouling factor f can be distinguished from influent variations with the proposed method such assessment would require extensive measurements including off gas respirometry laboratory analyses and clean water tests of fouled diffusers 3 2 3 respiration rate r the estimated respiration rate indicated an uneven load distribution between line 1 and 2 and a higher respiration rate for zone 3 than for zone 4 these interesting process related observations are detailed in the supplementary materials as they do not directly relate to the diffusers condition a reliability check of the estimated respiration rates supplementary materials indicated normal rates in all positions apart from l2z4 which was in the lower range as measured by the sludge activity scale henze et al 2002 3 2 4 oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a line 2 showed the most stable k l a and close to the expected values especially in slots four and five when compared with other positions fig 5 a see supplementary materials for a complete set of figures there was a temporary increase and periodic variation in k l a for the period july to october empty circles fig 5 a which was not predicted from the theoretical clean water value k l a c l e a n grey line fig 5 a this sudden increase was seen at all positions supplementary materials indicating that it reflects a change in the water composition either influent or activated sludge rather than in the diffusers the effect of cleaning the airflow rate sensor is shown as a step increase in the theoretical k l a c l e a n in the beginning of april in all slots fig 5 a note that in general the predicted variations in k l a c l e a n are small compared to k l a also the impact from k l a c l e a n and cleaning airflow rate sensors has a much smaller impact on α f than the variations in k l a compare the dip in α f in early march with the manual cleaning in end of march for l1z4 and l2z4 fig 4 this supports the indication that influent variations causing variations in α may be too large and mask the smaller variations in f this difficulty that can severely limit the usage of k l a to represent ote of diffusors has not been demonstrated in previous studies holmberg and olsson 1985 irizar et al 2009 lindberg 1997 most likely because they only evaluated their approach for a short time days in addition to the variations assumed to be caused by the influent all positions and slots were also affected by sensor measurement disturbances filled markers fig 5 a the disturbances however could be explained and are analysed in section 3 3 3 3 practical experimental problems related to the staircase method 3 3 1 flapping valve error a large variation or flapping in both airflow rate and valve position was observed for several measurements as shown in fig 6 and by the black dots in fig 5 the root cause for this disturbance was that the airflow rate sensor was biased by humid air which made the measured airflow rate exceeding its maximum value this in turn triggered the control system to close the valve rapidly once closed the valve was opened again which caused an excessive airflow rate that was repeated until the airflow sensor was dried out or the staircase entered a slot with a lower airflow rate the impact from humid air was concluded with a separate experiment where the flapping valve error disappeared when water condensate was removed from the aeration system the flapping valve issue was mainly seen in slot two probably when the air distribution system contained the largest condensate water volume and in slot six when the airflow rate was high and close to the maximum limit see supplementary materials for plots equivalent to fig 5 a for all positions surprisingly the flapping valve was unsuccessful in suppressing dwp despite the resulting frequent changes in airflow rate compare the black dots around july in fig 5 b with dw p avg in l1z3 in fig 3 this indicates that the maximum airflow rate was more important than the variation for effective reverse flex cleaning this suggestion is reinforced by the observed negative correlation between lowered maximum airflow rate during airmaint and dw p avg supplementary materials fig 1 3 3 2 erroneous airflow rate during the period from june to october the k l a c l e a n in l1z3 exhibited a series of peaks followed by a dip grey diamonds fig 5 b similar events were seen for several slots in zones 3 and 4 line 1 supplementary materials these were caused by a seemingly erroneous airflow rate that had a direct impact on k l a c l e a n we identified two different reasons for the deviating airflow rates first the peaks in fig 5 b were caused by a confusion in the slot identification algorithm induced by the flapping valve due to the flapping valve the valve position variations were large making it difficult to identify when a new slot began as mentioned in section 2 4 data for the different slots were extracted based on a change detection algorithm that identified the different slots from valve position data as a result the airflow rates from the wrong slots were used which showed as erroneous airflow rates second the period with low or zero k l a c l e a n in l1z3 was caused by a low airflow rate in the staircases it was clear that the airflow rate was zero at all valve positions indicating either a frozen or broken airflow rate sensor or a closed valve with faulty position indication the do measurement oscillated between zero or very low concentration and normal values this somewhat mysterious behaviour was explained by a play in the airflow rate sensor which was solved in november by replacing the sensor resulting in expected values for k l a c l e a n 3 3 3 insufficient do excitation slots seven to nine showed insufficient do excitation blue dots fig 5 a this was found to be caused by the intensive aeration during airmaint the airmaint resulted in a do concentration close to or above the maximum saturated value limiting the available increase in do concentration in subsequent slots this made it difficult to estimate k l a accurately as the model 1 may provide a poor estimate when d o k 1 d o k t s is small the other positions showed similar results with insufficient do excitation as in l2z4 supplementary materials when the do is close to its saturated value the related problem is that the oxygen is transferred to the off gas instead of the water this is not captured in 1 and introduces a bias in k l a from fig 5 a it is not clear whether the high do concentration caused a sufficiently large bias to be problematic as there is no clear difference between normal empty circles and potentially biased estimates blue circles for example in slot two to five 3 3 4 biased do measurements occasionally the measured do was even above its theoretical saturated concentration this result in a negative difference d o d o t in 1 which in turn produce negative k l a slot seven and nine in fig 5 a do measurements above the theoretically saturated value more than 1 mg l above were flagged as biased measurements red dots fig 5 a the biased measurements were mainly found in l1z4 39 in slot seven see supplementary materials fig 5 b which indicates that the do sensor in l1z4 produced inaccurate measurements for comparison the l2z4 showed 8 biased measurements for the same slot supplementary materials fig 5 d slot seven the effect of the biased do sensor on the estimated k l a values was unclear because we lacked information about the bias type and magnitude similarly as for the erroneous airflow rates we note that the staircase method can detect data quality issues here in terms of a biased do sensor the biased do sensors were not noticed in the wrrfs everyday routines which shows the potential for the staircase method also to indicate data quality issues 3 4 suggested method and experimental improvements 3 4 1 improving the staircase the many disturbances with a negative impact on k l a are expected to be mitigated if the following improvements to the staircase are made the airmaint should be positioned at the beginning of the sequence to remove as much condensate water as possible and reduce the risk of a flapping valve during airmaint the valve should be controlled to an airflow rate setpoint instead of a predefined valve position this would also avoid the flapping valve error during airmaint a sufficient do excitation could be obtained if the do was allowed to settle to about 4 mg l between each aeration slot for example the second slot with zero airflow rate slot ten should be placed directly after the airmaint to lower the do concentration sufficiently 3 4 2 recommendations for replicating the implementation in a future implementation the results would be less uncertain if the observed challenges in this study were considered we recommend obtaining baseline parameter estimates when new diffusers are installed measuring variations in temperature and humidity both before and after the blowers close to the valve to estimate the impact of condensate water an even better solution is to automatically remove the condensate water early in the air distribution system verifying that the airflow rate sensors are clean and provide accurate measurements as this is not commonly part of sensor maintenance procedures after calibrating and validating the do sensors comparing the measured maximum do saturation concentration in buckets with clean and process water this will be an additional validation of the measured accuracy at the abnormally high do concentrations used for estimating k l a the method should be further validated by comparing estimated values with suitable reference measurements such as pressure measurements before and after the diffuser respirometry and off gas measurements 3 4 3 extending the method to additional applications the staircase method was inspired by the active fault detection concept puncochár and skach 2018 in line with that concept the staircase could be used to obtain additional information about the process and sensors estimating respiration rate has many potential applications as exemplified in olsson 2012 and the suggested method would be applicable for in situ respirometry at several all zones and lines without the need for added instrumentation as indicated previously the maximum do concentration is reached or can be assumed to be reached during airmaint this value could be used to assess the deviation in do measurements to quantify bias direction and magnitude in the do sensor finally the large change in do during airmaint can be considered to be a controlled disturbance that will impact the do in the subsequent zones by monitoring how quickly the subsequent do controllers suppress the disturbance a measure of their disturbance rejection ability could be obtained using the method by petersson et al 2002 4 conclusions diffuser condition and the reverse flex cleaning effect airmaint can be monitored using only existing sensors in combination with the proposed staircase method an increase in the dynamic wet pressure due to insufficient reverse flex cleaning was detected as changes in the related parameter estimates d w p a v g and d w p c l e a n e f f these estimates of the dynamic wet pressure are therefore suggested as promising early warning indicators for diffuser fouling by contrast the estimated alpha fouling factor showed no trends of increasing diffusor fouling instead large variations were seen in alpha fouling factor which were suspected to originate from influent composition variations and in turn the estimated oxygen mass transfer coefficient this crucial challenge for using the oxygen mass transfer coefficient for diffusor condition monitoring has to the best of our knowledge not been emphasized before and needs to be considered in future studies ultimately this study demonstrates that the staircase method is a promising strategy since it is available and straightforward with minor costs the staircase method can also be valuable for data quality assessment disturbances causing bias in airflow rates and do sensor measurements were found which would have gone undetected without analysing the data produced by the staircase method further research is motivated on how modelling in combination with repetitive process disturbances can provide useful information without

beth zürich institute of environmental engineering 8093 zürich switzerland corresponding author biological activated carbon bac filters can be used to remove residual total organic carbon toc from greywater after a membrane bioreactor the two main toc removal processes are adsorption to the granular activated carbon gac and biological degradation biodegradation leads to the growth of microorganisms in the filter bed which can lead to increased pressure loss over the filter bed however the roles of sorption and biodegradation in long term toc removal and how they complement each other are unclear we monitored toc removal from greywater in a bac filter installed following a membrane bioreactor over more than 900 days removal performance depended on the operational time of the bac filter the influent toc concentration and in the upper part of the filter on the empty bed contact time ebct across the overall filter the ebct did not significantly influence toc removal showing that the filter was sufficiently large for the range of flow rates observed analysis of the long term data revealed the equal importance of sorption and biodegradation over the whole operation period and the whole filter bed most of the toc was removed in the upper part of the filter where biodegradation was the dominant mechanism in the lower part of the filter sorption capacity remained and allowed high influent toc concentrations to be buffered the generous filter design with low average filtration rates ensured long term toc removal the only maintenance needed was backwashing which was required only after more than 800 days of operation backwashing effectively reduced the pressure loss but had no significant influence on the effluent water quality our study shows that bac filters are a suitable post treatment step for the treatment of greywater with highly variable flow and toc concentrations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological activated carbon greywater reuse adsorption biodegradation backwashing 1 introduction greywater reuse offers substantial water saving potential with the benefit that the water is also available during dry periods national academies of sciences 2016 to ensure safe reuse of water for applications involving direct contact with humans such as showers and hand washing pathogens need to be inactivated shi et al 2018 reducing the organic carbon to low levels is important i to prevent regrowth of pathogens during storage and distribution prest et al 2016 ii to ensure reliable disinfection performance winward et al 2008 and iii to prevent the negative aesthetic effects of carbon degradation after treatment dietrich 2006 analysing long term data and understanding how toc degradation is influenced by different factors in a greywater treatment system treating real greywater are therefore important the two main removal mechanisms for organic carbon in biological activated carbon bac filters are adsorption and biodegradation for fresh granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the main removal mechanism as the volume of water treated increases adsorption capacity is exhausted bacteria accumulate in the filter bed and biodegradation becomes increasingly important for toc removal from a certain point of time on biodegradation is the main removal mechanism simpson 2008 so far the extent to which various depth segments in the bac filter may be at different stages of organics removal has not been studied and neither has the extent to which biodegradation is beneficial to maintaining sorption capacity various pilot and lab studies have been conducted to study factors influencing removal performance in bac filters temperature empty bed contact time ebct and backwash frequency have been shown to impact the removal performance emelko et al 2006 hallé et al 2015 yet how a bac filter may be designed to use both adsorption and biodegradation optimally for toc removal has yet to be clarified optimal design and operation of bac filters require an understanding of the proportions of toc that are removed by two processes biodegradation and adsorption two main approaches are taken to estimating the proportions of the two processes the first approach is to inhibit biodegradation for example by adding sodium azide autoclaving the gac or using fresh gac without biomass islam et al 2016 rattier et al 2012 sharaf and liu 2021 zhiteneva et al 2020 the second approach is to stop sorption by using either exhausted gac or material without sorption capacity such as anthracite greenstein et al 2018 liang et al 2003 fundneider et al 2021b used long term pilot study data to estimate that biodegradation removes 25 42 of the organics smolin et al 2020 proposed a quantitative model to assess the contributions of biodegradation sorption and bioregeneration to toc removal in a bac filter in this study we used long term data from a building scale bac filter to estimate the proportions of sorption and biodegradation and confirmed the results with batch tests with and without gac an additional challenge is that sorption and biodegradation are not always readily separable because they can also interact herzberg et al 2003 biological degradation of organic carbon in the filter leads to bacterial growth this biomass can either accumulate in the filter or be washed out from the filter velten et al 2011 accumulated biomass and inorganic particles can clog the biofilter and lead to increasing pressure loss over the filter bed regular backwashing is considered important to maintaining long term performance and preventing exhaustive pressure loss piche et al 2019 however the extent to which backwashing is necessary is unclear when the influent to the bac filter is free of inorganic particles that might clog the filter and biomass is the main cause of pressure loss depending on the influent concentration of organics the ratio of biomass to toc degraded can vary eiler et al 2003 the organic carbon that is not used for biomass production is oxidized to co2 by microbes to gain energy for maintaining cell function long term performance in the bac filter with little pressure loss is better maintained with low biomass production in this study toc removal was monitored over a filter bed for more than 900 days in a bac filter treating greywater after a membrane bioreactor mbr the real greywater was highly variable in toc concentration this allowed us to test the filter s performance over a wide range of influent concentrations our study estimated the influence of various operational parameters on long term removal performance a carbon mass balance over the filter bed was used to estimate sorption and biodegradation and the extent to which accumulation of biomass on the filter bed hindered operation we assessed the influence of i a generous bac filter design ii reactor maintenance and iii backwashing on the reactor s performance in providing stable effluent water quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system in the water hub at nest source separated wastewater streams are treated separately https www eawag ch en department eng projects water hub accessed 26 03 2021 the light greywater collected in the building is treated with an mbr adapted version from aquacell 800 newterra followed by a custom made bac filter fig 1 the mbr degrades organic carbon and nitrifies ammonium to nitrate and the bac filter removes residual organic carbon to provide biologically stable water table 1 we treated on average 330 l d 0 to 1155 l d of greywater coming from a fitness unit public bathrooms and bathrooms in flats the bac filter was operated in gravity driven down flow mode and we used calgon filtrasorb 400 gac characterization of calgon filtrasorb 400 e g in morlay and joly 2010 sampling ports at 7 22 and 37 cm depth allowed samples to be taken from various depths for water and gac analysis a schmutzdecke with biomass developed on top of the filter bed to evaluate the contribution of the schmutzdecke water samples in the gac bed around 0 5 cm below the schmutzdecke were taken with a glass syringe and a steel needle the highly variable greywater production in the building and the operation of the mbr led to intermittent flow into the bac filter with periods with stagnant water the filter has an inner diameter of 0 3 m and the filter bed is 0 52 m deep the mean ebct was 78 min sd 27 min and the mean filtration rate 0 42 m h sd 0 45 m h the system was operated for 912 days 2 1 1 backwashing the filter was backwashed once on day 836 towards the end of the experimental period the backwash was performed with tap water in up flow mode with a flow of 20 l min corresponding to an up flow velocity of 17 m h for a duration of 11 minutes a 1 l sample of the backwash water was taken every minute in autoclaved glass bottles the backwash water was analysed for toc tcc atp and tss the maximum bed expansion during the backwash was 14 2 1 2 pressure loss pressure loss over the filter bed was determined with two pressure sensors one located above the filter bed and the other below the filter bed both sensors were of the cerabar t pmc131 endress hauser type and measurement values were saved every 4 5 s 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 total organic carbon total organic carbon toc was sampled in glass vials twice a week and only at times with flow through the bac filter samples were stored in darkness at 4 c until analysis due to the pandemic from day 668 to day 730 samples were taken once a week and were stored up to 10 weeks at 20 c until analysis toc was measured with a total organic carbon analyser shimadzu toc l kyoto japan to assess the uncertainty of the sampling and the measurement influent and effluent samples were measured in triplicate once the standard deviation was below 1 of the measurement value for both influent and effluent 2 2 2 total cell concentration total cell concentration tcc was measured with a cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa at a flow rate of 60 µl min for 60 s tcc was measured with sybr green i stain all samples were measured in triplicate 2 2 3 atp the biomass was quantified with the method described in velten et al 2007 and as reported previously hess et al 2020 in short 1 g wet weight of gac particles was transferred in a muffled glass vial with 10 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water the sample was sonicated for 3 min bandelin sonorex 9 ml supernatant was collected in a separate muffled glass vial and the sample was refilled with 9 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water this step was repeated three times in total the collected supernatant was vortexed and 0 5 ml of the sample was incubated at 38 c for at least 4 minutes some 100 µl of sample together with 100 µl of bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wi usa were measured for relative light units rlu and converted to atp concentrations 2 2 4 batch growth to assess the biological stability of the water samples 20 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd sample was inoculated with 20 µl of unfiltered sample incubated at room temperature 22 1 c for 5 d in 40 ml glass vials and agitated afterwards the samples were analysed for tcc all glassware used was muffled at 450 c for 4 h all samples were taken in triplicate 2 3 batch toc degradation tests batch tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of remaining sorption and of different types of biomass on the toc removal four batches were compared i biomass in suspension water sample taken from the influent of the bac filter with biomass in suspension ii detached biomass biomass detached by manual shaking from the gac into 0 2 µm filtered polycarbonate nuclepore membrane filter whatman influent water iii schmutzdecke biomass sampled with a steel needle and a glass syringe from the schmutzdecke of the bac filter iv biomass on gac biomass with exhausted gac from the sampling at 7 cm depth of the bac filter to obtain comparable results the same amount of biomass quantified with atp was added to each batch 1 l of the biomass in suspension 1 g of gac with biomass detached biomass from 2 g of gac or 3 ml of schmutzdecke for all the samples except suspension the bac filter influent water was 0 2 µm filtered polycarbonate nuclepore membrane filter whatman and added to provide the same nutrients to all batches the samples were placed in an overhead shaker at room temperature for 5 days and toc and tcc samples were taken on days 1 2 4 and 5 all samples were done in duplicate and the glassware used was autoclaved 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 linear regression model the long term toc data was analysed with a linear regression to estimate the relationship between tocout tocin and various input variables we looked at three independent input variables days of operation of the filter time influent toc concentration tocin and empty bed contact time ebct equation 1 1 t o c o u t t o c i n b 0 b 1 t i m e b 2 t o c i n b 3 e b c t the linear regression was performed with the fitlm matlab command the mathworks inc the validity of the model was checked by looking at the distribution of the residuals the model was used as a data analysis tool but cannot be used to predict future removal performances of the bac filter 2 4 2 mass balance toc removal a mass balance was performed with the long term data to better understand the toc removal the following paragraphs present the assumptions and calculations for the toc mass balance that differentiates between the two removal processes fig 2 and table 2 give an overview of the loads considered and the main assumptions for the calculations afterwards the calculations for the different loads are explained in more detail 2 f t o c b i o d e g r a d e d f t o c r e m o v e d f t o c s o r p t i o n 3 f t o c c o 2 f t o c b i o d e g r a d

calculations are shown in supporting information s3 2 4 2 1 flow flow was calculated from the pressure measurement on top of the filter bed as described in hess et al 2021 for the mass balance a resolution of 1 min was used 2 4 2 2 toc to calculate the overall toc load ftoc each flow value was multiplied with the nearest toc measurement for both the influent and the effluent of the bac filter the total cell load ftcc are part of the ftoc but only constitute around 0 1 of the toc we assume that the effluent ftoc does not contain a significant amount of gac debris during normal operation and therefore do not consider gac particles in the mass balance 2 4 2 3 total cells in influent and effluent no regular measurements were available for the total cell concentration in the influent and the effluent of the bac filter therefore the mean concentrations were used to calculate the total load the tcc was 3 3 105 cells ml n 99 for the influent and 8 6 105 cells ml n 82 for the effluent a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 in hess et al 2021 we demonstrated a strong correlation between tcc and turbidity r2 0 84 therefore the effluent tcc was estimated based on measured turbidity to get a range of possible tcc loads leading to 3 2 106 cells ml for the effluent the difference between effluent and influent cells was used to calculate the quantity of cells washed out from the filter 2 4 2 4 cells accumulated in the bac filter after the backwash 0 0686 g atp accumulated in the bac filter calculated from the measurements taken at the three gac sampling locations supporting information fig s4 the atp cell concentration was determined as 1 1 1014 cells g atp velten et al 2011 calculated a value of 3 1 5 10 16 gatp cell and our measurement for biomass detached with shaking gave a value of 4 8 1013 cells g atp a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 2 4 2 5 backwash the tcc load ftccbackwash removed during the backwash was calculated with the flow during the backwash 20 l min and the tcc concentrations measured in the backwash samples a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 2 4 2 6 sorption sorption was estimated based on the long term toc data the equilibrium loading qe and the total mass of 20 kg gac in filter were used to calculate the amount of toc that was removed due to adsorption the equilibrium loading was calculated with an integral mass balance based on the toc load removed in the top 7 cm of the bac filter after the highly concentrated influent peak on day 67 131 mg l toc the toc first adsorbed and then desorbed back to quite stable removal values here we assumed that qe was reached on day 80 after the phase with desorption we also assumed that until day 80 35 of the toc was removed by biodegradation and 65 by sorption this led to a qe of 25 6 mgtoc ggac to account of the uncertainty of these assumptions two scenarios were tested i all the toc was removed by sorption ii the gac was already exhausted before the peak this led to i qe 31 5 mgtoc ggac and ii qe 14 7 mgtoc ggac 3 results 3 1 what influenced the toc removal performance long term toc removal was monitored over the whole bac filter and for the different segments of the filter for a period of more than 900 days fig 3 absolute toc values for influent and the effluents are presented in supporting information fig s2 generally the effluent concentrations were highest at the first sampling point at 7 cm and then decreased with increasing depth and residence time in the bac filter on day 67 an exceptionally high influent toc concentration of 131 mg l entered the bac filter caused by exceptionally high influent toc in the raw greywater and insufficient treatment performance of the mbr when the sample with high influent concentration was taken the concentration after 7 cm was high 64 mg l while it remained low at 22 cm 37 cm and in the effluent 2 8 1 1 and 1 2 mg l respectively three days later the toc influent concentration was back at normal values 8 6 mg l while the concentration in the filter were still high with 26 89 89 and 43 mg l at 7 22 37 cm and in the effluent respectively five days after the high influent the effluent toc was 4 8 14 30 and 36 mg l for 7 22 37 cm and effluent respectively seven days after high influent the effluent toc was 2 2 3 0 6 5 and 9 1 mg l for 7 22 37 cm and effluent respectively we could observe how the toc adsorbed and then with lower influent concentrations desorbed again to values as observed before the peak influent concentrations after that peak the moving average for tocout tocin varied between 0 4 and 0 8 for 7 cm between 0 2 and 0 6 for 22 cm and between 0 1 and 0 4 for 37 cm and the bac filter effluent the long term toc data was analysed with a linear regression model to test the independent input variables eq 1 only the data after the peak with high influent concentration after day 140 was used for the linear model 1a t o c o u t t o c i n b 0 b 1 t i m e b 2 t o c i n b 3 e b c t the estimated coefficients of the linear model for the different depths are listed in table 3 all the coefficients differed significantly p 0 05 from 0 except b3 for the effluent marked with an asterisk in the table coefficient b0 is higher for higher locations in the filter bed this coefficient shows that after the peak adsorption was more exhausted in the upper segments than in the lower segments of the filter coefficient b1 shows that the removal performance deteriorated with time for all segments of the bac filter however this trend was stronger for the segments higher in the filter than for the lower ones for example at 22 cm the tocout tocin increased by 0 38 over the 770 days considered the negative coefficients for b2 show that higher influent tocin decreased tocout tocin this effect was in the same range for all segments of the bac filter tocin was on average 4 8 mg l ranging from 1 9 mg l to 19 1 mg l data in supporting information s4 which thus changed tocout tocin by 0 4 coefficient b3 varies for the different segments although longer ebct in the uppermost segment led to lower tocout tocin ebct had no significant influence on the removal performance of the whole bac filter the average ebct of the whole filter was 78 min ranging from 15 min to 166 min the flow rate and thus the ebct depends on the operation of the preceding mbr and the flux through the membrane fig 4 shows the toc removal in the various segments of the bac filter for different influent toc concentrations the first segment is only 7 cm whereas the others are 15 cm each and thus have double the gac volume the higher the influent toc the more toc is removed in the bac filter for all influent concentrations the highest quantity of toc was removed in the top 7 cm of the bac filter the upper limit of toc removed in the top segment was defined by a quite clear line with a slope of around 0 85 mgtocremoved mgtocin the segment from 7 cm to 22 cm behaved similarly to the top segment for almost all the cases more toc was removed in the top segment than in the ones below and the more toc was in the influent the more toc was removed for the segment from 22 cm to 37 cm only once was more than 2 mg l of toc removed for the influent toc of 19 mg l for the segment from 37 cm to 52 cm the removal was always below 0 4 mg l up to influent toc concentrations of 4 mg l and with higher tocin toc removal rose to 1 6 mg l the lowest segment mainly contributed to overall toc removal for high influent toc concentrations 3 2 how is the toc removed over the whole experimental period of 912 days 1024 g of toc were removed in the bac filter of all toc removed 59 was removed in the top 7 cm 24 in the second 15 cm 12 in the third segment and only 5 in the lowest 15 cm segment of the bac filter a few measurements were taken directly below the schmutzdecke after the schmutzdecke on average 18 of the incoming toc 7 36 had already been removed we used a mass balance to estimate that over the whole experimental period and over the whole bac 50 of the removed toc was removed by adsorption onto the gac and the other half was removed by biological degradation fig 5 we assumed the equilibrium loading qe for adsorbed toc to be 25 6 mgtoc ggac we used a range of assumptions to calculate qe to be between 14 7 mgtoc ggac and 31 5 mgtoc ggac leading us to estimate the contribution of sorption as between 36 and 77 of the biodegraded carbon only 1 was assimilated as biomass by accumulation in the bac filter washing out and removal with the backwash and 99 left the system as co2 of the biomass that grew in the bac filter due to carbon degradation 5 accumulated in the filter bed as biofilm on the gac and less than 1 was removed with the backwash on day 836 the remaining 94 of biomass was continuously washed out of the filter with the treated water as suspended solids leading to higher cell concentrations in the effluent on average 8 6 105 cells ml than in the influent on average 3 3 105 cells ml the cell concentrations were calculated from infrequent water samples the calculation of effluent cells from turbidity led to an even higher estimation of cells washed out 99 the contribution of carbon that was assimilated in cells increases to 4 leaving 96 as co2 for this case a further assumption concerned the cells atp ratio which influences the estimation of the cells accumulated in the filter the main calculation assumed a value of 1 1 1014 cells g atp which was measured from biomass removed with sonication from the gac with the value we obtained for easily detachable biomass 4 8 1013 cells g atp the proportion of cells accumulated in the filter decreases to 2 with a literature value from velten et al 2011 of 3 1015cells g atp which was determined for a bac filter treating drinking water the proportion of accumulated cells would increase to 61 of the biomass produced the quantity of cells in the backwash water show that 1 of the biomass was removed with the backwash however the quantity of toc in the backwash water was 3 4 g much higher than the toc in the backwash calculated from tcc 0 02 g toc the assumption is that the remaining toc mainly represents fine gac particles and dust and is therefore not considered in this toc mass balance if the opposite assumption were be made that all the toc in the backwash water were related to biomass for instance extracellular polymeric substances the proportion of the biomass removed in the backwash would increase to 53 but 1 of the biodegraded carbon would still be assimilated as biomass biodegradation and sorption contributed equally to toc removal in the bac filter as a whole but the importance of the two processes varied significantly in the different segments of the filter fig 6 biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the top segment of the bac filter where it accounted for nearly 90 of the removed toc in the top segment the sorption capacity was exhausted after a few months for the lower segments some sorption capacity still remained after more than 900 days of operation so up to 100 of the carbon could be removed by sorption nevertheless we cannot exclude the possibility that biodegradation also occurred in the lower parts of the filter bed we used batch tests with biomass and gac from 7 cm depths to confirm that sorption did not play a significant role in the top segment of the bac filter towards the end of the experiment data shown in supporting information s5 in the batch experiments the same removal performance for biomass from the schmutzdecke and biofilm from gac was observed for both high initial toc and for typical influent toc concentrations between 57 and 68 of high initial toc was removed and 7 13 of typical influent toc concentrations further the batch with biomass on gac did not show improved removal performance compared to batches with only biomass additionally no difference was observed if the biomass was in suspension or in a biofilm 3 3 influence of backwashing the bac filter was operated without backwashing for more than two years the backwash performed after 836 days reduced pressure loss over the filter significantly to values similar to the beginning of the bac filter operation fig 7 the flow to the bac filter was controlled to prevent overflow and thus the inflow was stopped at a pressure loss of 22 mbar therefore pressure losses of more than 22 mbar were prevented sudden drops in pressure loss occurred even before the backwash some of these pressure loss drops can be explained by reactor maintenance work and sampling of gac from the filter however some of the sudden decreases such as that on day 455 cannot be explained with the data available although pressure loss over the filter bed was significantly lower after the backwash backwashing did not influence toc removal fig 3 moreover the backwash did not significantly influence the quantity of bacteria washed out from the bac filter data shown in supporting information s6 the effluent tcc was 2 0 106 ml sd 6 8 105 ml before the backwash and 1 9 106 ml sd 7 1 105 ml after the backwash batch growth was measured as an indicator of biological stability data shown in supporting information fig s5 batch growth in the effluent of the bac filter was lower directly after the backwash but increased again to prebackwash levels within one day with no mid to long term influence on removal performance the batch growth in the effluent was 7 8 105 ml sd 3 2 105 ml before the backwash and 8 3 105 ml sd 3 4 105 ml after the backwash both before and after backwash batch growth was higher at higher locations in the filter bed showing that the bac filter was effective in reducing assimilable organic carbon further we assessed the quantity of active biomass in the bac with atp atp on gac was reduced directly after backwash and quickly recovered to prebackwash levels with the highest values at 7 cm 2 4 10 6 gatp ggac and lower values at 22 cm 1 3 10 6 gatp ggac and 37 cm 5 4 10 7 gatp ggac data in supporting information fig s4 turbidity which can be used as a proxy for tcc after the bac filter hess et al 2021 showed that more cells were washed out of the bac filter than normal after the backwash however after around 600 l water volume had passed through the bac normal turbidity patterns were observed again 4 discussion 4 1 what influenced the toc removal performance highly variable flows into greywater treatment systems and the operation of mbrs lead to constantly changing operational parameters such as ebcts and filtration rates this study assessed the influence of these changes on toc removal performance operation time influences toc removal because adsorption capacity is exhausted over time and biological degradation increases therefore removal performance deteriorates fast initially and then change slows over time simpson 2008 although the toc breakthrough curve reached the first and the second sampling ports relatively quickly the change in water quality in the lower segments of the bac filter was slower biodegradation in the upper part allows sorption to continue at the bottom over a long period of operation several studies have reported that longer ebcts improve removal performance up to a certain ebct but that no further improvement can be achieved if the ebct is further prolonged fundneider et al 2021a seredyńska sobecka et al 2006 urfer et al 1997 this fits with the observation reported here that the varying ebct had a significant influence on removal performance in the upper parts of the filter but not across the overall filter for which the ebct was always sufficiently long one characteristic of decentralized greywater treatment is its highly variable flow hess et al 2020 treatment steps therefore cannot be dimensioned for one specific flow if good effluent water quality needs to be ensured at all times a generous bac filter design with low average filtration rate and long average ebct is therefore needed to be able to deal with variable flow and thus variable ebcts however compared to main treatment with an mbr the footprint required and the costs are still low high influent toc concentrations may be caused by either high raw greywater concentrations or low residence times in either case less biodegradation occurs in the mbr leading to higher quantities of biodegradable carbon in the bac and thus to better removal performances for higher influent toc concentrations furthermore adsorption equilibria in batch tests also depend on water quality yapsaklı et al 2009 one finding of this study is that for higher tocin more toc is removed this is beneficial for ensuring stable effluent water quality across variable influent concentrations the removal performance observed in this study was compared to other long term studies that used bac filter for treatment of drinking water after ozonation greywater treatment or advanced wastewater treatment to be able to compare removal performance we calculated the influent load loadin vtreated mgac tocin for several publications supporting information table s1 of the studies considered three had a loadin larger than 300 gtoc kggac this study fundneider et al 2021b gibert et al 2013b in this study 41 of the toc was removed after a filter bed depth of 7 cm whereas in fundneider et al 2021b and gibert et al 2013b only around 20 toc removal were maintained after similar toc loadings although ebct was higher for fundneider et al 2021b at 25 min it was comparable between gibert et al 2013b at 13 min and this study at 15 min after 7 cm ebct therefore cannot be used as the only explanation for the better removal performance observed in this study the filtration rate clearly differed across the studies in this study the filtration rate was much lower at 0 42 m h than the 7 m h in fundneider et al 2021b and the 3 7 9 7 m h in gibert et al 2013b typically ebct is the main design variable and the effect of filtration rate is not considered when bac filters are dimensioned urfer et al 1997 this comparison shows that a low filtration rate potentially helps to maintain higher long term removal performance bac filters for greywater post treatment were studied in two other publications ziemba et al 2020 zipf et al 2016 they reported a toc removal performance of 31 and 50 respectively however it is not clear if this performance would also last long term because both treated a loadin of less than 50 gtoc kggac therefore direct comparison of their removal performances with this study is not possible one specific characteristic of the system in this study is the intermittent flow leading to times with stagnant water hess et al 2020 showed that intermittent flow does not significantly influence removal performance however the water source can make an important difference because of the varying composition of the organic carbon liang et al 2007 the literature compared shows that bac filters tend to work better for greywater post treatment than for drinking water treatment however more data for long term performance of bac filters for greywater treatment is needed 4 2 how is the toc removed the long term toc data was used to estimate the proportions of toc removed by biodegradation and sorption overall 50 of the toc was removed by biodegradation but in the top part of the filter the proportion of biodegradation was higher at 89 these values for biodegradation are higher than those reported in literature 26 biodegradation by sharaf and liu 2021 18 by islam et al 2016 and 25 42 by fundneider et al 2021b however the studies vary in the methods used to estimate biodegradation sharaf and liu 2021 and islam et al 2016 inhibited biodegradation with sodium azide whereas this study used long term data to estimate sorption and biodegradation which was confirmed with batch tests using sodium azide to inhibit biodegradation has two limitations i sodium azide does not inhibit all organisms and ii sodium azide can interact with the gac and thus influence the sorption capacity klimenko et al 2010 these are two reasons to query whether the sodium azide method may underestimate the proportion of biodegradation and overestimate that of sorption another difference is that in this study the proportion of biodegradation was calculated over long term removal whereas sharaf and liu 2021 and islam et al 2016 examined batch tests before sorption capacity had been reached the estimation of sorption in this study also relies on some important assumptions our assumption for calculating the equilibrium load on the gac neglects slower sorption into smaller pores and assumes that it is mainly the surface and the larger pores of the gac that are relevant to toc removal erdem et al 2020 previous research showed that the assumption of constant equilibrium loading is feasible despite variable influent concentration hess et al 2020 the estimated 1 of organic carbon assimilated in biomass is quite low and shows that a high proportion of biodegraded carbon was used for microbial maintenance at lower concentrations of organics lower growth efficiency can be expected and thus less growth eiler et al 2003 the values calculated in this study are in line with other studies velten et al 2011 estimated that 3 of the removed carbon was assimilated in biomass in a bac filter treating drinking water they also estimated that 84 of the biomass was detached and washed out from the biofilter when operated without backwashing in this study 94 of the biomass detached continuously and only a small portion less than 1 of the biomass was removed with the backwash fundneider et al 2021b removed more around 10 of the biomass with the backwash but used a different method volatile suspended solids to quantify the biomass in the system they also used water and air for backwashing while in this study the backwash was performed with water alone so far studies have focussed on biofilm development over the filter bed and how biodegradation replaces adsorption as the main removal mechanism over time velten et al 2011 gibert et al 2013a to our best knowledge this is the first study that examined the role of sorption capacity remaining at the bottom of the filter in buffering high influent concentrations biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the upper part it was important to maintaining sorption capacity at the bottom and thus extending the lifespan of the bac filter the long term data was also confirmed by higher sorption capacity for methylene blue at the bottom of the bac filter supporting information s7 previous studies have shown that activated carbon has advantages as a biofilm carrier and has a higher biofilm activity than inert media herzberg et al 2003 here we showed that an additional advantage of using gac as a medium in biofilters is the sorption capacity remaining in the bottom part of the filter 4 3 influence of backwashing for this system we found that backwashing reduced pressure loss but did not significantly influence removal performance this is in line with studies that have shown that biomass quickly returns to prebackwash levels and that effluent water quality is not influenced by backwashing gibert et al 2013a piche et al 2019 the biomass accumulated in the bac filter could lead to more microbial decay products in the effluent microbial decay products can lead to lower biological stability derlon et al 2014 velten et al 2011 this study found no change in batch growth due to backwashing this indicates that no significant quantity of old biomass in which hydrolysis leads to increased batch growth was removed with the backwash during this study no regular backwashing was necessary one of the causes of filter clogging is the accumulation of inorganic particles in the bac filter in our setup a membrane with a pore size of 0 04 µm in front of the bac filter retained the particles and therefore less clogging occurred fundneider et al 2021b also found this effect of membranes in parallel operated bac filters in both water treatment and decentralized greywater treatment membranes are becoming increasingly important and a bac filter can be used as an effective low maintenance post treatment step to remove residual organics low percentages of removed carbon assimilated as biomass are beneficial to the long term operation of bac filters with low maintenance less biomass growing in the bac filter leads to less clogging we showed that a simple backwash with water alone is effective in reducing pressure loss the loss of pressure was slow so frequent backwashing was not necessary generally the maintenance of the bac filter with backwashing is much less than that for the mbr where the membranes need to be exchanged and chemically cleaned 5 conclusions this study used a bac filter as post treatment after an mbr and reached three main conclusions biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the upper part of the bac filter whereas sorption capacity remained towards the bottom of the filter thanks to a generous filter design with low filtration rate 0 42 m h and long average ebct 78 min this design allows stable removal of organic carbon over a wide range of influent concentrations and flow rates estimations based on mass balances with long term toc data showed that overall sorption and biodegradation contributed similar proportions to toc removal a bac filter installed as post treatment after an mbr is simple to operate low cost and improves the biological stability of reclaimed

beth zürich institute of environmental engineering 8093 zürich switzerland corresponding author biological activated carbon bac filters can be used to remove residual total organic carbon toc from greywater after a membrane bioreactor the two main toc removal processes are adsorption to the granular activated carbon gac and biological degradation biodegradation leads to the growth of microorganisms in the filter bed which can lead to increased pressure loss over the filter bed however the roles of sorption and biodegradation in long term toc removal and how they complement each other are unclear we monitored toc removal from greywater in a bac filter installed following a membrane bioreactor over more than 900 days removal performance depended on the operational time of the bac filter the influent toc concentration and in the upper part of the filter on the empty bed contact time ebct across the overall filter the ebct did not significantly influence toc removal showing that the filter was sufficiently large for the range of flow rates observed analysis of the long term data revealed the equal importance of sorption and biodegradation over the whole operation period and the whole filter bed most of the toc was removed in the upper part of the filter where biodegradation was the dominant mechanism in the lower part of the filter sorption capacity remained and allowed high influent toc concentrations to be buffered the generous filter design with low average filtration rates ensured long term toc removal the only maintenance needed was backwashing which was required only after more than 800 days of operation backwashing effectively reduced the pressure loss but had no significant influence on the effluent water quality our study shows that bac filters are a suitable post treatment step for the treatment of greywater with highly variable flow and toc concentrations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological activated carbon greywater reuse adsorption biodegradation backwashing 1 introduction greywater reuse offers substantial water saving potential with the benefit that the water is also available during dry periods national academies of sciences 2016 to ensure safe reuse of water for applications involving direct contact with humans such as showers and hand washing pathogens need to be inactivated shi et al 2018 reducing the organic carbon to low levels is important i to prevent regrowth of pathogens during storage and distribution prest et al 2016 ii to ensure reliable disinfection performance winward et al 2008 and iii to prevent the negative aesthetic effects of carbon degradation after treatment dietrich 2006 analysing long term data and understanding how toc degradation is influenced by different factors in a greywater treatment system treating real greywater are therefore important the two main removal mechanisms for organic carbon in biological activated carbon bac filters are adsorption and biodegradation for fresh granular activated carbon gac adsorption is the main removal mechanism as the volume of water treated increases adsorption capacity is exhausted bacteria accumulate in the filter bed and biodegradation becomes increasingly important for toc removal from a certain point of time on biodegradation is the main removal mechanism simpson 2008 so far the extent to which various depth segments in the bac filter may be at different stages of organics removal has not been studied and neither has the extent to which biodegradation is beneficial to maintaining sorption capacity various pilot and lab studies have been conducted to study factors influencing removal performance in bac filters temperature empty bed contact time ebct and backwash frequency have been shown to impact the removal performance emelko et al 2006 hallé et al 2015 yet how a bac filter may be designed to use both adsorption and biodegradation optimally for toc removal has yet to be clarified optimal design and operation of bac filters require an understanding of the proportions of toc that are removed by two processes biodegradation and adsorption two main approaches are taken to estimating the proportions of the two processes the first approach is to inhibit biodegradation for example by adding sodium azide autoclaving the gac or using fresh gac without biomass islam et al 2016 rattier et al 2012 sharaf and liu 2021 zhiteneva et al 2020 the second approach is to stop sorption by using either exhausted gac or material without sorption capacity such as anthracite greenstein et al 2018 liang et al 2003 fundneider et al 2021b used long term pilot study data to estimate that biodegradation removes 25 42 of the organics smolin et al 2020 proposed a quantitative model to assess the contributions of biodegradation sorption and bioregeneration to toc removal in a bac filter in this study we used long term data from a building scale bac filter to estimate the proportions of sorption and biodegradation and confirmed the results with batch tests with and without gac an additional challenge is that sorption and biodegradation are not always readily separable because they can also interact herzberg et al 2003 biological degradation of organic carbon in the filter leads to bacterial growth this biomass can either accumulate in the filter or be washed out from the filter velten et al 2011 accumulated biomass and inorganic particles can clog the biofilter and lead to increasing pressure loss over the filter bed regular backwashing is considered important to maintaining long term performance and preventing exhaustive pressure loss piche et al 2019 however the extent to which backwashing is necessary is unclear when the influent to the bac filter is free of inorganic particles that might clog the filter and biomass is the main cause of pressure loss depending on the influent concentration of organics the ratio of biomass to toc degraded can vary eiler et al 2003 the organic carbon that is not used for biomass production is oxidized to co2 by microbes to gain energy for maintaining cell function long term performance in the bac filter with little pressure loss is better maintained with low biomass production in this study toc removal was monitored over a filter bed for more than 900 days in a bac filter treating greywater after a membrane bioreactor mbr the real greywater was highly variable in toc concentration this allowed us to test the filter s performance over a wide range of influent concentrations our study estimated the influence of various operational parameters on long term removal performance a carbon mass balance over the filter bed was used to estimate sorption and biodegradation and the extent to which accumulation of biomass on the filter bed hindered operation we assessed the influence of i a generous bac filter design ii reactor maintenance and iii backwashing on the reactor s performance in providing stable effluent water quality 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system in the water hub at nest source separated wastewater streams are treated separately https www eawag ch en department eng projects water hub accessed 26 03 2021 the light greywater collected in the building is treated with an mbr adapted version from aquacell 800 newterra followed by a custom made bac filter fig 1 the mbr degrades organic carbon and nitrifies ammonium to nitrate and the bac filter removes residual organic carbon to provide biologically stable water table 1 we treated on average 330 l d 0 to 1155 l d of greywater coming from a fitness unit public bathrooms and bathrooms in flats the bac filter was operated in gravity driven down flow mode and we used calgon filtrasorb 400 gac characterization of calgon filtrasorb 400 e g in morlay and joly 2010 sampling ports at 7 22 and 37 cm depth allowed samples to be taken from various depths for water and gac analysis a schmutzdecke with biomass developed on top of the filter bed to evaluate the contribution of the schmutzdecke water samples in the gac bed around 0 5 cm below the schmutzdecke were taken with a glass syringe and a steel needle the highly variable greywater production in the building and the operation of the mbr led to intermittent flow into the bac filter with periods with stagnant water the filter has an inner diameter of 0 3 m and the filter bed is 0 52 m deep the mean ebct was 78 min sd 27 min and the mean filtration rate 0 42 m h sd 0 45 m h the system was operated for 912 days 2 1 1 backwashing the filter was backwashed once on day 836 towards the end of the experimental period the backwash was performed with tap water in up flow mode with a flow of 20 l min corresponding to an up flow velocity of 17 m h for a duration of 11 minutes a 1 l sample of the backwash water was taken every minute in autoclaved glass bottles the backwash water was analysed for toc tcc atp and tss the maximum bed expansion during the backwash was 14 2 1 2 pressure loss pressure loss over the filter bed was determined with two pressure sensors one located above the filter bed and the other below the filter bed both sensors were of the cerabar t pmc131 endress hauser type and measurement values were saved every 4 5 s 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 total organic carbon total organic carbon toc was sampled in glass vials twice a week and only at times with flow through the bac filter samples were stored in darkness at 4 c until analysis due to the pandemic from day 668 to day 730 samples were taken once a week and were stored up to 10 weeks at 20 c until analysis toc was measured with a total organic carbon analyser shimadzu toc l kyoto japan to assess the uncertainty of the sampling and the measurement influent and effluent samples were measured in triplicate once the standard deviation was below 1 of the measurement value for both influent and effluent 2 2 2 total cell concentration total cell concentration tcc was measured with a cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa at a flow rate of 60 µl min for 60 s tcc was measured with sybr green i stain all samples were measured in triplicate 2 2 3 atp the biomass was quantified with the method described in velten et al 2007 and as reported previously hess et al 2020 in short 1 g wet weight of gac particles was transferred in a muffled glass vial with 10 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water the sample was sonicated for 3 min bandelin sonorex 9 ml supernatant was collected in a separate muffled glass vial and the sample was refilled with 9 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd tap water this step was repeated three times in total the collected supernatant was vortexed and 0 5 ml of the sample was incubated at 38 c for at least 4 minutes some 100 µl of sample together with 100 µl of bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay promega corporation madison wi usa were measured for relative light units rlu and converted to atp concentrations 2 2 4 batch growth to assess the biological stability of the water samples 20 ml of 0 2 µm filtered millex gp merck milipore ltd sample was inoculated with 20 µl of unfiltered sample incubated at room temperature 22 1 c for 5 d in 40 ml glass vials and agitated afterwards the samples were analysed for tcc all glassware used was muffled at 450 c for 4 h all samples were taken in triplicate 2 3 batch toc degradation tests batch tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of remaining sorption and of different types of biomass on the toc removal four batches were compared i biomass in suspension water sample taken from the influent of the bac filter with biomass in suspension ii detached biomass biomass detached by manual shaking from the gac into 0 2 µm filtered polycarbonate nuclepore membrane filter whatman influent water iii schmutzdecke biomass sampled with a steel needle and a glass syringe from the schmutzdecke of the bac filter iv biomass on gac biomass with exhausted gac from the sampling at 7 cm depth of the bac filter to obtain comparable results the same amount of biomass quantified with atp was added to each batch 1 l of the biomass in suspension 1 g of gac with biomass detached biomass from 2 g of gac or 3 ml of schmutzdecke for all the samples except suspension the bac filter influent water was 0 2 µm filtered polycarbonate nuclepore membrane filter whatman and added to provide the same nutrients to all batches the samples were placed in an overhead shaker at room temperature for 5 days and toc and tcc samples were taken on days 1 2 4 and 5 all samples were done in duplicate and the glassware used was autoclaved 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 linear regression model the long term toc data was analysed with a linear regression to estimate the relationship between tocout tocin and various input variables we looked at three independent input variables days of operation of the filter time influent toc concentration tocin and empty bed contact time ebct equation 1 1 t o c o u t t o c i n b 0 b 1 t i m e b 2 t o c i n b 3 e b c t the linear regression was performed with the fitlm matlab command the mathworks inc the validity of the model was checked by looking at the distribution of the residuals the model was used as a data analysis tool but cannot be used to predict future removal performances of the bac filter 2 4 2 mass balance toc removal a mass balance was performed with the long term data to better understand the toc removal the following paragraphs present the assumptions and calculations for the toc mass balance that differentiates between the two removal processes fig 2 and table 2 give an overview of the loads considered and the main assumptions for the calculations afterwards the calculations for the different loads are explained in more detail 2 f t o c b i o d e g r a d e d f t o c r e m o v e d f t o c s o r p t i o n 3 f t o c c o 2 f t o c b i o d e g r a d

calculations are shown in supporting information s3 2 4 2 1 flow flow was calculated from the pressure measurement on top of the filter bed as described in hess et al 2021 for the mass balance a resolution of 1 min was used 2 4 2 2 toc to calculate the overall toc load ftoc each flow value was multiplied with the nearest toc measurement for both the influent and the effluent of the bac filter the total cell load ftcc are part of the ftoc but only constitute around 0 1 of the toc we assume that the effluent ftoc does not contain a significant amount of gac debris during normal operation and therefore do not consider gac particles in the mass balance 2 4 2 3 total cells in influent and effluent no regular measurements were available for the total cell concentration in the influent and the effluent of the bac filter therefore the mean concentrations were used to calculate the total load the tcc was 3 3 105 cells ml n 99 for the influent and 8 6 105 cells ml n 82 for the effluent a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 in hess et al 2021 we demonstrated a strong correlation between tcc and turbidity r2 0 84 therefore the effluent tcc was estimated based on measured turbidity to get a range of possible tcc loads leading to 3 2 106 cells ml for the effluent the difference between effluent and influent cells was used to calculate the quantity of cells washed out from the filter 2 4 2 4 cells accumulated in the bac filter after the backwash 0 0686 g atp accumulated in the bac filter calculated from the measurements taken at the three gac sampling locations supporting information fig s4 the atp cell concentration was determined as 1 1 1014 cells g atp velten et al 2011 calculated a value of 3 1 5 10 16 gatp cell and our measurement for biomass detached with shaking gave a value of 4 8 1013 cells g atp a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 2 4 2 5 backwash the tcc load ftccbackwash removed during the backwash was calculated with the flow during the backwash 20 l min and the tcc concentrations measured in the backwash samples a carbon content of 2 10 14 gtoc cell was assumed velten et al 2011 2 4 2 6 sorption sorption was estimated based on the long term toc data the equilibrium loading qe and the total mass of 20 kg gac in filter were used to calculate the amount of toc that was removed due to adsorption the equilibrium loading was calculated with an integral mass balance based on the toc load removed in the top 7 cm of the bac filter after the highly concentrated influent peak on day 67 131 mg l toc the toc first adsorbed and then desorbed back to quite stable removal values here we assumed that qe was reached on day 80 after the phase with desorption we also assumed that until day 80 35 of the toc was removed by biodegradation and 65 by sorption this led to a qe of 25 6 mgtoc ggac to account of the uncertainty of these assumptions two scenarios were tested i all the toc was removed by sorption ii the gac was already exhausted before the peak this led to i qe 31 5 mgtoc ggac and ii qe 14 7 mgtoc ggac 3 results 3 1 what influenced the toc removal performance long term toc removal was monitored over the whole bac filter and for the different segments of the filter for a period of more than 900 days fig 3 absolute toc values for influent and the effluents are presented in supporting information fig s2 generally the effluent concentrations were highest at the first sampling point at 7 cm and then decreased with increasing depth and residence time in the bac filter on day 67 an exceptionally high influent toc concentration of 131 mg l entered the bac filter caused by exceptionally high influent toc in the raw greywater and insufficient treatment performance of the mbr when the sample with high influent concentration was taken the concentration after 7 cm was high 64 mg l while it remained low at 22 cm 37 cm and in the effluent 2 8 1 1 and 1 2 mg l respectively three days later the toc influent concentration was back at normal values 8 6 mg l while the concentration in the filter were still high with 26 89 89 and 43 mg l at 7 22 37 cm and in the effluent respectively five days after the high influent the effluent toc was 4 8 14 30 and 36 mg l for 7 22 37 cm and effluent respectively seven days after high influent the effluent toc was 2 2 3 0 6 5 and 9 1 mg l for 7 22 37 cm and effluent respectively we could observe how the toc adsorbed and then with lower influent concentrations desorbed again to values as observed before the peak influent concentrations after that peak the moving average for tocout tocin varied between 0 4 and 0 8 for 7 cm between 0 2 and 0 6 for 22 cm and between 0 1 and 0 4 for 37 cm and the bac filter effluent the long term toc data was analysed with a linear regression model to test the independent input variables eq 1 only the data after the peak with high influent concentration after day 140 was used for the linear model 1a t o c o u t t o c i n b 0 b 1 t i m e b 2 t o c i n b 3 e b c t the estimated coefficients of the linear model for the different depths are listed in table 3 all the coefficients differed significantly p 0 05 from 0 except b3 for the effluent marked with an asterisk in the table coefficient b0 is higher for higher locations in the filter bed this coefficient shows that after the peak adsorption was more exhausted in the upper segments than in the lower segments of the filter coefficient b1 shows that the removal performance deteriorated with time for all segments of the bac filter however this trend was stronger for the segments higher in the filter than for the lower ones for example at 22 cm the tocout tocin increased by 0 38 over the 770 days considered the negative coefficients for b2 show that higher influent tocin decreased tocout tocin this effect was in the same range for all segments of the bac filter tocin was on average 4 8 mg l ranging from 1 9 mg l to 19 1 mg l data in supporting information s4 which thus changed tocout tocin by 0 4 coefficient b3 varies for the different segments although longer ebct in the uppermost segment led to lower tocout tocin ebct had no significant influence on the removal performance of the whole bac filter the average ebct of the whole filter was 78 min ranging from 15 min to 166 min the flow rate and thus the ebct depends on the operation of the preceding mbr and the flux through the membrane fig 4 shows the toc removal in the various segments of the bac filter for different influent toc concentrations the first segment is only 7 cm whereas the others are 15 cm each and thus have double the gac volume the higher the influent toc the more toc is removed in the bac filter for all influent concentrations the highest quantity of toc was removed in the top 7 cm of the bac filter the upper limit of toc removed in the top segment was defined by a quite clear line with a slope of around 0 85 mgtocremoved mgtocin the segment from 7 cm to 22 cm behaved similarly to the top segment for almost all the cases more toc was removed in the top segment than in the ones below and the more toc was in the influent the more toc was removed for the segment from 22 cm to 37 cm only once was more than 2 mg l of toc removed for the influent toc of 19 mg l for the segment from 37 cm to 52 cm the removal was always below 0 4 mg l up to influent toc concentrations of 4 mg l and with higher tocin toc removal rose to 1 6 mg l the lowest segment mainly contributed to overall toc removal for high influent toc concentrations 3 2 how is the toc removed over the whole experimental period of 912 days 1024 g of toc were removed in the bac filter of all toc removed 59 was removed in the top 7 cm 24 in the second 15 cm 12 in the third segment and only 5 in the lowest 15 cm segment of the bac filter a few measurements were taken directly below the schmutzdecke after the schmutzdecke on average 18 of the incoming toc 7 36 had already been removed we used a mass balance to estimate that over the whole experimental period and over the whole bac 50 of the removed toc was removed by adsorption onto the gac and the other half was removed by biological degradation fig 5 we assumed the equilibrium loading qe for adsorbed toc to be 25 6 mgtoc ggac we used a range of assumptions to calculate qe to be between 14 7 mgtoc ggac and 31 5 mgtoc ggac leading us to estimate the contribution of sorption as between 36 and 77 of the biodegraded carbon only 1 was assimilated as biomass by accumulation in the bac filter washing out and removal with the backwash and 99 left the system as co2 of the biomass that grew in the bac filter due to carbon degradation 5 accumulated in the filter bed as biofilm on the gac and less than 1 was removed with the backwash on day 836 the remaining 94 of biomass was continuously washed out of the filter with the treated water as suspended solids leading to higher cell concentrations in the effluent on average 8 6 105 cells ml than in the influent on average 3 3 105 cells ml the cell concentrations were calculated from infrequent water samples the calculation of effluent cells from turbidity led to an even higher estimation of cells washed out 99 the contribution of carbon that was assimilated in cells increases to 4 leaving 96 as co2 for this case a further assumption concerned the cells atp ratio which influences the estimation of the cells accumulated in the filter the main calculation assumed a value of 1 1 1014 cells g atp which was measured from biomass removed with sonication from the gac with the value we obtained for easily detachable biomass 4 8 1013 cells g atp the proportion of cells accumulated in the filter decreases to 2 with a literature value from velten et al 2011 of 3 1015cells g atp which was determined for a bac filter treating drinking water the proportion of accumulated cells would increase to 61 of the biomass produced the quantity of cells in the backwash water show that 1 of the biomass was removed with the backwash however the quantity of toc in the backwash water was 3 4 g much higher than the toc in the backwash calculated from tcc 0 02 g toc the assumption is that the remaining toc mainly represents fine gac particles and dust and is therefore not considered in this toc mass balance if the opposite assumption were be made that all the toc in the backwash water were related to biomass for instance extracellular polymeric substances the proportion of the biomass removed in the backwash would increase to 53 but 1 of the biodegraded carbon would still be assimilated as biomass biodegradation and sorption contributed equally to toc removal in the bac filter as a whole but the importance of the two processes varied significantly in the different segments of the filter fig 6 biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the top segment of the bac filter where it accounted for nearly 90 of the removed toc in the top segment the sorption capacity was exhausted after a few months for the lower segments some sorption capacity still remained after more than 900 days of operation so up to 100 of the carbon could be removed by sorption nevertheless we cannot exclude the possibility that biodegradation also occurred in the lower parts of the filter bed we used batch tests with biomass and gac from 7 cm depths to confirm that sorption did not play a significant role in the top segment of the bac filter towards the end of the experiment data shown in supporting information s5 in the batch experiments the same removal performance for biomass from the schmutzdecke and biofilm from gac was observed for both high initial toc and for typical influent toc concentrations between 57 and 68 of high initial toc was removed and 7 13 of typical influent toc concentrations further the batch with biomass on gac did not show improved removal performance compared to batches with only biomass additionally no difference was observed if the biomass was in suspension or in a biofilm 3 3 influence of backwashing the bac filter was operated without backwashing for more than two years the backwash performed after 836 days reduced pressure loss over the filter significantly to values similar to the beginning of the bac filter operation fig 7 the flow to the bac filter was controlled to prevent overflow and thus the inflow was stopped at a pressure loss of 22 mbar therefore pressure losses of more than 22 mbar were prevented sudden drops in pressure loss occurred even before the backwash some of these pressure loss drops can be explained by reactor maintenance work and sampling of gac from the filter however some of the sudden decreases such as that on day 455 cannot be explained with the data available although pressure loss over the filter bed was significantly lower after the backwash backwashing did not influence toc removal fig 3 moreover the backwash did not significantly influence the quantity of bacteria washed out from the bac filter data shown in supporting information s6 the effluent tcc was 2 0 106 ml sd 6 8 105 ml before the backwash and 1 9 106 ml sd 7 1 105 ml after the backwash batch growth was measured as an indicator of biological stability data shown in supporting information fig s5 batch growth in the effluent of the bac filter was lower directly after the backwash but increased again to prebackwash levels within one day with no mid to long term influence on removal performance the batch growth in the effluent was 7 8 105 ml sd 3 2 105 ml before the backwash and 8 3 105 ml sd 3 4 105 ml after the backwash both before and after backwash batch growth was higher at higher locations in the filter bed showing that the bac filter was effective in reducing assimilable organic carbon further we assessed the quantity of active biomass in the bac with atp atp on gac was reduced directly after backwash and quickly recovered to prebackwash levels with the highest values at 7 cm 2 4 10 6 gatp ggac and lower values at 22 cm 1 3 10 6 gatp ggac and 37 cm 5 4 10 7 gatp ggac data in supporting information fig s4 turbidity which can be used as a proxy for tcc after the bac filter hess et al 2021 showed that more cells were washed out of the bac filter than normal after the backwash however after around 600 l water volume had passed through the bac normal turbidity patterns were observed again 4 discussion 4 1 what influenced the toc removal performance highly variable flows into greywater treatment systems and the operation of mbrs lead to constantly changing operational parameters such as ebcts and filtration rates this study assessed the influence of these changes on toc removal performance operation time influences toc removal because adsorption capacity is exhausted over time and biological degradation increases therefore removal performance deteriorates fast initially and then change slows over time simpson 2008 although the toc breakthrough curve reached the first and the second sampling ports relatively quickly the change in water quality in the lower segments of the bac filter was slower biodegradation in the upper part allows sorption to continue at the bottom over a long period of operation several studies have reported that longer ebcts improve removal performance up to a certain ebct but that no further improvement can be achieved if the ebct is further prolonged fundneider et al 2021a seredyńska sobecka et al 2006 urfer et al 1997 this fits with the observation reported here that the varying ebct had a significant influence on removal performance in the upper parts of the filter but not across the overall filter for which the ebct was always sufficiently long one characteristic of decentralized greywater treatment is its highly variable flow hess et al 2020 treatment steps therefore cannot be dimensioned for one specific flow if good effluent water quality needs to be ensured at all times a generous bac filter design with low average filtration rate and long average ebct is therefore needed to be able to deal with variable flow and thus variable ebcts however compared to main treatment with an mbr the footprint required and the costs are still low high influent toc concentrations may be caused by either high raw greywater concentrations or low residence times in either case less biodegradation occurs in the mbr leading to higher quantities of biodegradable carbon in the bac and thus to better removal performances for higher influent toc concentrations furthermore adsorption equilibria in batch tests also depend on water quality yapsaklı et al 2009 one finding of this study is that for higher tocin more toc is removed this is beneficial for ensuring stable effluent water quality across variable influent concentrations the removal performance observed in this study was compared to other long term studies that used bac filter for treatment of drinking water after ozonation greywater treatment or advanced wastewater treatment to be able to compare removal performance we calculated the influent load loadin vtreated mgac tocin for several publications supporting information table s1 of the studies considered three had a loadin larger than 300 gtoc kggac this study fundneider et al 2021b gibert et al 2013b in this study 41 of the toc was removed after a filter bed depth of 7 cm whereas in fundneider et al 2021b and gibert et al 2013b only around 20 toc removal were maintained after similar toc loadings although ebct was higher for fundneider et al 2021b at 25 min it was comparable between gibert et al 2013b at 13 min and this study at 15 min after 7 cm ebct therefore cannot be used as the only explanation for the better removal performance observed in this study the filtration rate clearly differed across the studies in this study the filtration rate was much lower at 0 42 m h than the 7 m h in fundneider et al 2021b and the 3 7 9 7 m h in gibert et al 2013b typically ebct is the main design variable and the effect of filtration rate is not considered when bac filters are dimensioned urfer et al 1997 this comparison shows that a low filtration rate potentially helps to maintain higher long term removal performance bac filters for greywater post treatment were studied in two other publications ziemba et al 2020 zipf et al 2016 they reported a toc removal performance of 31 and 50 respectively however it is not clear if this performance would also last long term because both treated a loadin of less than 50 gtoc kggac therefore direct comparison of their removal performances with this study is not possible one specific characteristic of the system in this study is the intermittent flow leading to times with stagnant water hess et al 2020 showed that intermittent flow does not significantly influence removal performance however the water source can make an important difference because of the varying composition of the organic carbon liang et al 2007 the literature compared shows that bac filters tend to work better for greywater post treatment than for drinking water treatment however more data for long term performance of bac filters for greywater treatment is needed 4 2 how is the toc removed the long term toc data was used to estimate the proportions of toc removed by biodegradation and sorption overall 50 of the toc was removed by biodegradation but in the top part of the filter the proportion of biodegradation was higher at 89 these values for biodegradation are higher than those reported in literature 26 biodegradation by sharaf and liu 2021 18 by islam et al 2016 and 25 42 by fundneider et al 2021b however the studies vary in the methods used to estimate biodegradation sharaf and liu 2021 and islam et al 2016 inhibited biodegradation with sodium azide whereas this study used long term data to estimate sorption and biodegradation which was confirmed with batch tests using sodium azide to inhibit biodegradation has two limitations i sodium azide does not inhibit all organisms and ii sodium azide can interact with the gac and thus influence the sorption capacity klimenko et al 2010 these are two reasons to query whether the sodium azide method may underestimate the proportion of biodegradation and overestimate that of sorption another difference is that in this study the proportion of biodegradation was calculated over long term removal whereas sharaf and liu 2021 and islam et al 2016 examined batch tests before sorption capacity had been reached the estimation of sorption in this study also relies on some important assumptions our assumption for calculating the equilibrium load on the gac neglects slower sorption into smaller pores and assumes that it is mainly the surface and the larger pores of the gac that are relevant to toc removal erdem et al 2020 previous research showed that the assumption of constant equilibrium loading is feasible despite variable influent concentration hess et al 2020 the estimated 1 of organic carbon assimilated in biomass is quite low and shows that a high proportion of biodegraded carbon was used for microbial maintenance at lower concentrations of organics lower growth efficiency can be expected and thus less growth eiler et al 2003 the values calculated in this study are in line with other studies velten et al 2011 estimated that 3 of the removed carbon was assimilated in biomass in a bac filter treating drinking water they also estimated that 84 of the biomass was detached and washed out from the biofilter when operated without backwashing in this study 94 of the biomass detached continuously and only a small portion less than 1 of the biomass was removed with the backwash fundneider et al 2021b removed more around 10 of the biomass with the backwash but used a different method volatile suspended solids to quantify the biomass in the system they also used water and air for backwashing while in this study the backwash was performed with water alone so far studies have focussed on biofilm development over the filter bed and how biodegradation replaces adsorption as the main removal mechanism over time velten et al 2011 gibert et al 2013a to our best knowledge this is the first study that examined the role of sorption capacity remaining at the bottom of the filter in buffering high influent concentrations biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the upper part it was important to maintaining sorption capacity at the bottom and thus extending the lifespan of the bac filter the long term data was also confirmed by higher sorption capacity for methylene blue at the bottom of the bac filter supporting information s7 previous studies have shown that activated carbon has advantages as a biofilm carrier and has a higher biofilm activity than inert media herzberg et al 2003 here we showed that an additional advantage of using gac as a medium in biofilters is the sorption capacity remaining in the bottom part of the filter 4 3 influence of backwashing for this system we found that backwashing reduced pressure loss but did not significantly influence removal performance this is in line with studies that have shown that biomass quickly returns to prebackwash levels and that effluent water quality is not influenced by backwashing gibert et al 2013a piche et al 2019 the biomass accumulated in the bac filter could lead to more microbial decay products in the effluent microbial decay products can lead to lower biological stability derlon et al 2014 velten et al 2011 this study found no change in batch growth due to backwashing this indicates that no significant quantity of old biomass in which hydrolysis leads to increased batch growth was removed with the backwash during this study no regular backwashing was necessary one of the causes of filter clogging is the accumulation of inorganic particles in the bac filter in our setup a membrane with a pore size of 0 04 µm in front of the bac filter retained the particles and therefore less clogging occurred fundneider et al 2021b also found this effect of membranes in parallel operated bac filters in both water treatment and decentralized greywater treatment membranes are becoming increasingly important and a bac filter can be used as an effective low maintenance post treatment step to remove residual organics low percentages of removed carbon assimilated as biomass are beneficial to the long term operation of bac filters with low maintenance less biomass growing in the bac filter leads to less clogging we showed that a simple backwash with water alone is effective in reducing pressure loss the loss of pressure was slow so frequent backwashing was not necessary generally the maintenance of the bac filter with backwashing is much less than that for the mbr where the membranes need to be exchanged and chemically cleaned 5 conclusions this study used a bac filter as post treatment after an mbr and reached three main conclusions biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the upper part of the bac filter whereas sorption capacity remained towards the bottom of the filter thanks to a generous filter design with low filtration rate 0 42 m h and long average ebct 78 min this design allows stable removal of organic carbon over a wide range of influent concentrations and flow rates estimations based on mass balances with long term toc data showed that overall sorption and biodegradation contributed similar proportions to toc removal a bac filter installed as post treatment after an mbr is simple to operate low cost and improves the biological stability of reclaimed

19942,a key characteristic of decentralized greywater treatment and reuse is high variability in both nutrient concentrations and flow this variability in flow leads to stagnant water in the system and causes short term fluctuations in the effluent water quality automated monitoring tools provide data to understand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics and to adapt control strategies accordingly we investigated the fluctuations in a building scale greywater treatment system comprising a membrane bioreactor followed by a biological activated carbon filter short term dynamics in the effluent of the biological activated carbon filter were monitored with automated flow cytometry and turbidity and the impact of these fluctuations on various hygiene relevant parameters in the reuse water was evaluated continuous biofilm detachment into the stagnant water in the biological activated carbon filter led to temporarily increased turbidity and cell concentrations in the effluent after periods of stagnation the fluctuations in cell concentrations were consistent with a model assuming higher detachment rates during flow than during times with stagnant water for this system total cell concentration and turbidity were strongly correlated we also showed that the observed increase in cell concentration was not related to either an increase of organic carbon concentration or the concentration of two opportunistic pathogens p aeruginosa and l pneumophila our findings demonstrate that turbidity measurements are sensitive to changes in the effluent water quality and can be used to monitor the fluctuations caused by intermittent flow intermittent flow did not lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens and this study provides no indications that stagnant water in biological activated carbon filters need be prevented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological activated carbon greywater reuse automated flow cytometry detachment stagnation 1 introduction greywater reuse for non potable applications such as washing machines and showers must provide hygienically acceptable water at all times this requirement renders the influence of short term fluctuations in treated water quality important one promising technology for buffering influent variability in biodegradable and adsorbable compounds is the biological activated carbon bac filter highly variable flow and stagnation have been shown to have no negative impact on total organic carbon toc removal hess et al 2020 mckie et al 2019 and bac filters can be implemented to improve the biological stability of the water ziemba et al 2020 however the biological degradation of organic carbon is linked to bacterial growth and biofilm formation in the bac velten et al 2011 where biofilm growth and detachment can in turn lead to fluctuations in the effluent water quality typically greywater is treated in a decentralized way ranging from single household and building scale up to neighborhood scale the smaller the scale the higher will be the variability in both the flow and composition of the influent into the greywater treatment system gross 2015 a time lag between the production and reuse of greywater and irregular usage patterns inevitably lead to stagnant water in treatment systems in pipes and in clean water storage tanks an effective treatment step in retaining bacterial pathogens is a membrane bioreactor mbr wu 2019 nevertheless opportunistic pathogens such as p aeruginosa and l pneumophila can grow after treatment due to remaining nutrients and nonsterile conditions and can cause serious hygienic problems for greywater reuse blanky et al 2017 friedler et al 2011 recurring stagnation can increase cell concentrations due to microbial detachment during and after stagnation for example in intermittent drinking water supply systems bautista de los santos et al 2019 kumpel and nelson 2016 and in building plumbing bédard et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 lipphaus et al 2014 however the extent to which intermittent flow and biofilm detachment in the biofilter lead to a deterioration of hygiene relevant parameters such as the concentration of opportunistic pathogens remains unclear biofilm detaches into bulk water both as single cells and through sloughing off of biofilm caused by shear stress davies 2011 shear stress can detach biofilm that formed in stagnant water when flow starts again bédard et al 2018 in tap water for example cell concentration is elevated after periods of stagnant water and the frequency with which flow is interrupted affects the extent to which bacterial numbers increase lipphaus et al 2014 this may be explained by the fact that detachment is influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions under which biofilm forms abe et al 2012 and the biofilm adapting to changing shear conditions choi and morgenroth 2003 cell concentrations can be increased after stagnation by changes in shear stress and by continuous detachment both leading to increased bulk concentrations that are washed out with the first flush besmer and hammes 2016 therefore it is important to quantify and understand these cell concentrations in greywater treatment systems that operate with intermittent flow automated online flow cytometry fcm is a valuable tool for investigating and monitoring short term microbial fluctuations such as increased cell concentrations after detachment besmer et al 2014 the high temporal resolution allows a better understanding of the underlying microbial processes in for example drinking water treatment besmer and hammes 2016 buysschaert et al 2018 and stagnant water in the distribution network farhat et al 2020 even though greywater treatment systems have to deal with high variability to our knowledge no online microbial measurements have been applied so far to study microbial water quality in greywater treatment systems whereas online fcm requires specialized sophisticated equipment and is not currently widespread online turbidity measurements are rather simple and routinely applied to monitor biofilters hooper et al 2019 turbidity and fcm both measure light scattering caused by suspended particles fcm additionally measures fluorescence fluorescent stains can be used to distinguish bacterial cells from other particles safford and bischel 2019 turbidity sensors are unable to distinguish between microbial and nonmicrobial particles depending on the system monitored turbidity may be a suitable indicator of microbial water quality or not page et al 2017 showed that turbidity and total cell concentration tcc followed similar dynamics in a karst spring in contrast ikonen et al 2013 mccoy and olson 1986 prest et al 2021 showed only a weak correlation between microbial water quality and turbidity for a drinking water distribution system and a municipal drinking water treatment plant combining online fcm with turbidity measurements provides a unique opportunity to compare turbidity and total cell concentration in a real life system with intermittent flow and highly variable nutrient concentrations the objective of this study was to better understand how stagnation an inherent consequence of the highly variable flow in greywater treatment systems influences the effluent water quality of a bac filter we measured cell concentrations in the effluent of a greywater treatment system over a two week period at high temporal resolution 5 min to quantify short term fluctuations we used these data to evaluate the extent to which turbidity was related to cell concentration we hypothesized that high cell concentration after stagnation is caused by continuous detachment of cells from the bac filter furthermore we assessed the extent to which the dynamics of cell concentrations are reflected in the dynamics of two opportunistic pathogens before and after the bac filter 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the water hub at nest is a platform for investigating technologies for source separated wastewater streams in buildings grey yellow and blackwater etter et al 2016 on average 342 l d of greywater produced in the nest building is treated in two steps a membrane bioreactor mbr with an ultrafiltration membrane is followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter figure 1 the greywater originated from a fitness unit flats and public bathrooms and its composition was highly variable table 1 the mbr is a modified version of a commercially available system aquacell 800 newterra the mbr consists of two tanks with mean hydraulic residence times of 13 h in the first tank and 17 h in the second the highly variable influent flow rate and the on off operation of the mbr lead to intermittent flow into the bac filter the bac filter column material pvc granular activated carbon gac chemviron f 400 is operated with a mean empty bed contact time ebct of 112 min and a mean hydraulic loading rate of 0 4 m h the system has been monitored with both laboratory and online measurements for a period of more than two years table 1 the bac filter was operated for 550 days before the measurement campaign with online fcm was started corresponding to 5900 treated empty bed volumes the mbr retains pathogens we obtained more than 5 5 log10 removal of enterococcus with the mbr further the mbr degrades organic carbon and nitrifies ammonium to nitrate the bac removes the residual organic carbon and is operated with gravity driven down flow and without backwashing for this study bac influent samples were taken from the water at the top of the filter bed and effluent samples from the effluent pipe material pe hd as indicated in figure 1 2 2 turbidity turbidity was measured with a turbimax cus52d endress hauser this is a sensor for drinking and process waters with a detection limit of 0 0015 fnu formazin nephelometric unit and therefore suitable for low turbidity measurements the sensor was installed directly in the up flow pipe d 63 mm after the bac photo in supporting information s1 1 the sensor measures a data point every 5 s all data points 0 fnu and 2 fnu or differing more than 0 03 fnu from the moving average over 15 data points were considered to be outliers some 3 of the data points were labelled as outliers and were excluded from the data set 2 3 automated online flow cytometry 2 3 1 measurements over a period of two weeks the effluent of the bac was analyzed every 5 minutes for total cell concentration tcc tcc was measured with a bd accuri c6 plus flow cytometer and the automation unit oncyt dofcm 200 oncyt switzerland as described previously besmer et al 2014 the samples were mixed with a fluorescent nucleic acid stain sybr green i final concentration 1 10

66 µl min after each sampling and measurement the staining module and the flow cytometer were rinsed with ultrapure water 2 3 2 data analysis data was analyzed with the customized software cyplot oncyt switzerland the density plots were visually inspected to exclude abnormal density plots from the data set a more detailed description of the abnormal density plots can be found in supporting information s 1 3 in total from 3995 data points 140 data points 4 were identified as outliers and removed from the data set 2 4 laboratory measurements laboratory measurements were taken to characterize one of the peak events in more detail the effluent of the bac was sampled first every 5 minutes and afterwards every 15 minutes an influent sample was taken for every fourth effluent sample 2 4 1 flow cytometry samples for conventional flow cytometry were taken in autoclaved glassware samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde final concentration 0 1 and formaldehyde final concentration 0 01 and kept in the dark at 4 c until analysis tcc and intact cell concentration icc were measured with a cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa at a flow rate of 60 µl min for 30 s tcc was measured with sybr green i stain final concentration 1 10 000 in tris buffer and for icc propidium iodide pi was added final concentration 6 µm all samples were measured in triplicate the tcc measured with conventional flow cytometry were also compared to tcc measured with online flow cytometry supporting information s 1 4 both show the same trends but differ somewhat in the absolute numbers measured 2 4 2 legionella pneumophila legiolert idexx laboratories usa was used to quantify the most probable number mpn of legionella pneumophila in the water samples following the nonpotable water protocol provided by the manufacturer samples were processed within 4 h after sampling 2 4 3 pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa was detected with gsp sigma aldrich selective agar with addition of penicillin g fluka i e benzylpenicillin sodium a 1 1000 dilution with nanopure water was used for filtration and the membrane filters on the agar plates were incubated at 28 c for 24 29 5 h after incubation the number of colony forming units cfus that had grown on the filter were counted no further confirmatory assays were performed all glassware used was autoclaved samples were processed within 4 h after sampling and all samples were taken in duplicate 2 4 4 total organic carbon toc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l kyoto japan within 24 h after sampling and the samples were kept at 4 c until analysis all glassware used was muffled at 450 c for 4 h 2 5 model model calculations were performed to test whether hypothesized continuous bacterial detachment in the bac filter is compatible with observations we hypothesized that continuous bacterial detachment during periods of stagnation leads to an accumulation of cells in the bulk water of the bac filter and that these are washed out when flow starts 2 5 1 hydraulic the bac filter was modelled as a series of ideal reactors the water volume on top of the filter bed was modelled as a completely mixed tank with variable volume the bac filter was modelled as a series of completely stirred tank reactors cstrs to represent a plug flow reactor pfr with dispersion the volume at the bottom of the filter bed was modelled as a single cstr and that of the pipe to the measurement and sampling point was modelled as a pfr the flow through the bac qout was calculated from the pressure changes measured on top of the filter bed the details for the calculations can be found in supporting information s 1 5 the only fitted parameter number of cstrs to represent pfr was determined from visual comparison of the hydraulic model and a tracer test using nacl supporting information s 1 5 3 2 5 2 detachment in this study we modelled the detachment of cells as a function of biomass

are discussed in this publication one with a constant kd and the other with a higher kd during times with flow and a lower kd during stagnation the coefficients were determined by visual comparison of the measured and the calculated tcc concentrations the focus was on i the peak height and ii the baseline tcc values the coefficients determined for the models are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 stagnation leads to increased turbidity and tcc highly variable inflow to the greywater system and the operation of the mbr led to intermittent flow to the bac this intermittent flow led to periods with stagnant water in the bac filter when flow resumed after stagnation both turbidity and total cell concentration tcc showed increased values in the bac effluent figure 2 the effluent concentrations in tcc and turbidity then gradually decreased to the values measured before stagnation these data show that after stagnation cells were washed out from the bac tcc was constant during periods with stagnant water indicating no growth in the stagnant water in the pipe after the bac tcc and turbidity followed the same pattern with peaks after stagnation data from two weeks of online measurements show strong statistically significant p 0 05 correlation r2 0 84 between tcc and turbidity figure 3 nonetheless a single turbidity value cannot indicate the exact cell concentration 3 2 longer stagnation periods are linked to higher tcc in the effluent the longer the water stagnated prior to flow the higher were the measured tcc and turbidity after the flow through the filter started again as an example figure 4 depicts how for tcc both the peak height and the area below the peak were higher for longer stagnation periods therefore both the maximum concentration of bacteria and the total bacterial load were increased after stagnation figure 5 shows the area below the different peak events for turbidity and tcc for different stagnation times for all the peaks that occurred over a period of 15 days the area for each peak event is calculated as the integral between the peak curve and a baseline the baseline is defined as the mean value during the first 8 minutes after flow starts again the data clearly show that the area below the curve for both turbidity and tcc increased with stagnation duration the coefficients of determination r2 are 0 56 p 0 04 for turbidity and 0 59 p 0 02 for tcc 3 3 continuous detachment of cells from the bac simple model calculations were used to test the assumption of continuous cell detachment from the bac the measured cell concentration was compared with two model configurations both assuming that detachment always occurs i constant detachment independent of the flow and ii higher detachment during flow than during stagnation the model with higher detachment during times with flow than during periods of stagnation is able to represent the general patterns of measured cell concentrations figure 6 both the constant and varying detachment models present peaks with a slight delay compared to the measured data supporting information s 2 3 the model with constant detachment overestimates the maximum peak heights whereas that with two detachment rates is more accurate both models indicate that even a short decrease in flow leads to increased cell concentration in the effluent afterwards the delay between start of flow and the peak maximum was caused by hydraulics the sampling and measuring location is not directly below the filter bed the model shows that during stagnation the tcc in the filter bed also increased due to continuous detachment during times of stagnation these cells were then washed out of the filter when flow started again 3 4 relevance for hygiene of the reuse water detachment of cells from the bac filter can also be detected in data from turbidity measurements to assess the water quality during the increased turbidity for hygiene relevant parameters one peak event was sampled for tcc icc toc l pneumophila and p aeruginosa figure 7 the washout of water that had stagnated in different locations of the system is shown over time in figure 7a the hydraulic model that was used to calculate washout is presented in supporting information s 1 5 when the flow started water that had stagnated after the bac was sampled first over time the proportion of water that had stagnated in the filter bed increased in the flow this proportion reached its maximum at the same time that the peak values for tcc and turbidity were reached when a higher proportion of the water that either stagnated on top of the filter bed or was fresh mbr permeate reached the sampling location tcc decreased again to previously observed values we therefore concluded that the water that stagnated in the filter bed had the highest tcc and turbidity the influent concentration for tcc was constant during the whole sampling period showing that the changes in the effluent were caused by processes in the filter itself and not processes in the pipes before as also observed by zhang et al 2015 the effluent tcc was higher than the influent concentration over the whole period indicating microbial growth in the bac filter the turbidity during the sampled peak event showed the typical pattern as observed for previous peak curves indicating that the more frequent sampling did not influence the observed effluent water quality significantly the influent turbidity was not measured on the day of more frequent sampling but previous measurements had shown that the influent turbidity had an mean of 0 05 sd 0 02 fnu and is thus lower than the effluent turbidity at on mean 0 23 fnu sd 0 06 the ratio between intact and total cell concentration did not change significantly between influent and effluent both influent and effluent showed a decrease in the fraction of intact cells around 1 5 h after flow onset the lowest ratio occurred after the peak in tcc was measured less than 1 h after the turbidity peak the ratio increased again to values similar to those observed at the beginning of the sampling throughout the whole measurement period a significant removal on average 68 of organic carbon was observed during the peak event of tcc no increase in toc in the effluent was measured in contrast the toc effluent concentrations were slightly lower during this period the toc in the influent did not change significantly over the 4 h of sampling the curves measured for the opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa look comparable no increase in presumptive positive concentrations was observed for either from the influent to the effluent of the bac filter also no increase was observed with the increased tcc the highest concentrations 1490 mpn l and 15500 cfu 100ml for presumptive positive l pneumophila and p aeruginosa respectively were measured in the water that stagnated on top of the filter bed p aeruginosa also showed a high cell concentration in the sample that stagnated in the effluent pipe prior to sampling whereas this was not the case for l pneumophila overall only turbidity and icc correlated significantly with tcc measured in the effluent further there was a negative correlation between toc and icc r 0 39 the correlation matrix is given in supporting information s 2 4 4 discussion 4 1 stagnation leads to increased turbidity and tcc in biofilters organic carbon is degraded and thus microbial growth is to be expected not all these cells accumulate in the filter and instead most of the bacteria are washed out of the filter leading to higher cell concentrations in the effluent than in the influent of the bac velten et al 2011 a sudden increase in flow velocity and thus shear stress or intermittent flow conditions have been shown to lead to increased bacterial concentration in the effluent of gacs besmer and hammes 2016 zhang et al 2015 therefore we were not surprised to observe increased cell concentration after periods with stagnation in the effluent of our treatment system hence even though the mbr degrades a substantial portion of the organic carbon enough nutrients remain to support subsequent growth afterwards therefore the questions are not whether growth occurs but where the remaining carbon is degraded whether most of the bacteria grow in biofilter pipes or storage tanks and whether the growth is problematic from a water quality perspective for example due to increased pathogen concentrations a biofilter allows more spatially concentrated growth which provides more opportunities for controlling and monitoring growth and detachment such monitoring might for instance be used to initiate the recirculation of water of insufficient quality data from the bac filter effluent showed a strong correlation between turbidity and total cell concentration this is somewhat unusual because most systems incorporate a wide variety of turbidity causing materials farrell et al 2018 here the ultrafiltration membrane s pore size of 0 04 µm retains most materials captured by turbidity measurements including bacteria all the cells and other turbidity causing material can therefore be assumed to originate from the pipes between the mbr and the bac and from the bac filter itself an sem microscopy analysis of the water at peak turbidity showed very few particles other than cells a few gac silicate and chalk particles were observed in the bac effluent supporting information s 2 1 however the number of particles was too low to explain the increase in turbidity moreover from an experiment with a dilution series of a bacterial pure culture we confirmed that turbidity correlated well with total cell concentration at the concentrations we observed here data shown in supporting information s 2 2 these additional measurements can explain the strong correlation of turbidity with tcc after the bac we therefore particularly recommend the use of turbidity sensors in treatment systems with membranes as an easy way to monitor growth and detachment in a biofilter concentrating growth and therefore detachment spatially in a biofilter allows a turbidity sensor to monitor these processes an unexpected change in turbidity caused for example by growth during stagnation or breakthrough of bacteria through the filter can be used as a warning signal for process failure and should be followed by a closer investigation on whether the water is still safe for reuse which type of sensors can best detect changes in water quality and process failures depends on the system that is monitored 4 2 longer stagnation periods are linked to higher tcc in the effluent typically engineered biofilters are designed to be operated without water stagnating in the filter therefore little research has been published about the effects of stagnation on the effluent water quality of bacs these publications have focused on the overall removal performance of organic carbon and how stagnation influences the biological activity and the sorption capacity on the filter but have not studied short term fluctuations hess et al 2020 mckie et al 2019 other systems with regular change between flow and stagnation include building plumbing lautenschlager et al 2010 and drinking water systems with intermittent supply bautista de los santos et al 2019 studies in building plumbing have shown that the longer the stagnation and the more biofilm in the pipe the higher is the cell concentration in the effluent after stagnation lautenschlager et al 2010 proctor 2017 a deterioration in water quality is also to be expected in intermittent water supply after water stagnates and sometimes pipes even run dry due to interrupted water supply kumpel and nelson 2016 therefore we were not surprised to observe increased tcc and turbidity in the effluent of a biofilter nevertheless there are also important differences in pipe systems cell concentration did not further increase for stagnation times longer than 12 hours lautenschlager et al 2010 but in the bac peak cell concentration continued to increase with stagnation time despite the similarities in the systems differences between pipes and biofilters could also influence the detachment of bacteria such as the surface to volume ratio bédard et al 2018 and the flow conditions picioreanu et al 2001 4 3 continuous detachment of cells from the bac the fact that higher cell concentrations were measured in the effluent after longer stagnation indicates that cells detach continuously even during periods without flow a model with continuous detachment of cells in the bac and higher detachment during periods with flow than during stagnation can explain these peak events the results of this study suggest that a combination of continuous detachment of cells from the biofilm and increased detachment caused by shear stress during times with flow lead to peaks in cell concentrations after stagnation a possible explanation could be that the biofilm in the bac adapted to the regular interruption of flow choi and morgenroth 2003 douterelo et al 2013 manuel et al 2009 and therefore the change of shear conditions did not lead to a significant sloughing off of biofilm at the beginning of the flow period continuous detachment of cells has also been identified as the main cause for the high cell concentration in the first flush of other systems with regularly occurring stagnation besmer and hammes 2016 however for systems where stagnation is a rare event and the biofilm is not adapted to sudden changes in flow conditions changing shear stress is considered an important cause of biofilm detachment paul et al 2012 4 4 relevance for hygiene of the reuse water water quality is influenced by the location at which water stagnates in the system biofilter or polyethylene pipe tcc and turbidity were highest in the water that stagnated in the filter bed by contrast organic carbon was lowest in the water that stagnated in the bac the water that stagnated in the filter bed had a much longer residence time in the filter bed 480 min instead of typically 30 min and therefore more of the organic carbon was degraded yet constructing a bac more than tenfold larger to reach a tenfold longer retention time would only increase the toc removal from an average of 68 to the observed maximum of 75 the water quality did not deteriorate in terms of toc due to stagnation in the bac the microbial communities on biofilters for water treatment play an important role in shaping the microbial community of the effluent water pinto et al 2012 this study focused on two opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa and on the extent to which the bac promotes their growth and hence the degree to which detachment of biofilm is detrimental to the hygienic quality of the reuse water l pneumophila and p aeruginosa concentrations are potentially critical to safe water reuse blanky et al 2017 coronel olivares et al 2011 however these pathogens are mentioned very few times in water reuse frameworks e g spanish regulation for water reuse pathogen concentrations in all the samples of the influent and effluent of the bac are high for any intended reuse involving direct contact with users the values measured during this one peak event were above or just below regulatory values therefore these pathogens should not be neglected when assessing the safety of the water for reuse the high concentration in the influent of the bac shows that these opportunistic pathogens grow before the bac in the pipes between the membrane and the bac consequently if growth after the membrane cannot be prevented a disinfection step is necessary after the bac to ensure the hygienic quality of the reuse water the highest values for both pathogens were measured in the water that stagnated in front of the bac filter further studies are needed to show how stagnation in the pipes between the membrane and the bac filter influences the growth of these opportunistic pathogens the numbers do not change for either pathogen because of the bac treatment meaning that they grow not in the filter itself but in the pipes and tubes between the membrane and the bac legionella has been shown to grow in biofilms with a ph in the range from 5 to 8 5 epa 2016 the temperature range in the bac of 21 c to 23 c is quite low considering legionella prefer temperatures between 35 c and 42 c rhoads et al 2016 in contrast p aeruginosa can grow optimally at temperatures between 10 c and 42 c and at low nutrient concentrations bédard et al 2016 hence this pathogen is well adapted to growth in the bac filter nevertheless both the finding that the concentrations in the bac effluent are not higher in the effluent than in the influent and that the peak in tcc does not correlate with increased pathogen numbers are strong indicators that the biofilter is not a hotspot for the growth of these opportunistic pathogens therefore in our case the bac is not of concern for the growth of these opportunistic pathogens after stagnation in the bac a deterioration in water quality was observed in terms of cell concentration and turbidity but it is important to note that the increased cell concentration is not related to the pathogens investigated in this study or to an increase in effluent toc concentrations hence stagnation does not lead to a deterioration of the parameters relevant to ensuring the hygiene of reuse water nevertheless increased turbidity can lead to decreased disinfection performance for example with uv disinfection farrell et al 2018 guidelines from the world health organization suggest that turbidity values above 0 2 ntu can negatively influence disinfection performance world health organization 2017 results such as ours that show a clear pattern of turbidity between 0 2 and 1 fnu should therefore be taken into consideration when a disinfection step is designed to ensure sufficient disinfection at all times and to prevent any negative impacts of increased turbidity on performance 5 conclusion this study presents four main conclusions highly variable flow into household scale greywater treatment systems leads to periods with stagnant water after stagnation increased turbidity and cell concentrations are measured in the effluent of the bac stagnation does not lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens in the effluent showing that the bac is not a hotspot for the growth of opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa therefore no additional measures are necessary to exclude the first water after stagnation from reuse after the bac turbidity correlates strongly with cell concentrations therefore turbidity can be used as a proxy for increased cell concentrations and unexpected fluctuations can be an indication of process failure the extent and fluctuations of increased cell concentrations and turbidity are consistent with a model that assumes that the rate of continuous detachment in the bac is higher during periods with flow than during stagnation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

19942,a key characteristic of decentralized greywater treatment and reuse is high variability in both nutrient concentrations and flow this variability in flow leads to stagnant water in the system and causes short term fluctuations in the effluent water quality automated monitoring tools provide data to understand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics and to adapt control strategies accordingly we investigated the fluctuations in a building scale greywater treatment system comprising a membrane bioreactor followed by a biological activated carbon filter short term dynamics in the effluent of the biological activated carbon filter were monitored with automated flow cytometry and turbidity and the impact of these fluctuations on various hygiene relevant parameters in the reuse water was evaluated continuous biofilm detachment into the stagnant water in the biological activated carbon filter led to temporarily increased turbidity and cell concentrations in the effluent after periods of stagnation the fluctuations in cell concentrations were consistent with a model assuming higher detachment rates during flow than during times with stagnant water for this system total cell concentration and turbidity were strongly correlated we also showed that the observed increase in cell concentration was not related to either an increase of organic carbon concentration or the concentration of two opportunistic pathogens p aeruginosa and l pneumophila our findings demonstrate that turbidity measurements are sensitive to changes in the effluent water quality and can be used to monitor the fluctuations caused by intermittent flow intermittent flow did not lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens and this study provides no indications that stagnant water in biological activated carbon filters need be prevented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological activated carbon greywater reuse automated flow cytometry detachment stagnation 1 introduction greywater reuse for non potable applications such as washing machines and showers must provide hygienically acceptable water at all times this requirement renders the influence of short term fluctuations in treated water quality important one promising technology for buffering influent variability in biodegradable and adsorbable compounds is the biological activated carbon bac filter highly variable flow and stagnation have been shown to have no negative impact on total organic carbon toc removal hess et al 2020 mckie et al 2019 and bac filters can be implemented to improve the biological stability of the water ziemba et al 2020 however the biological degradation of organic carbon is linked to bacterial growth and biofilm formation in the bac velten et al 2011 where biofilm growth and detachment can in turn lead to fluctuations in the effluent water quality typically greywater is treated in a decentralized way ranging from single household and building scale up to neighborhood scale the smaller the scale the higher will be the variability in both the flow and composition of the influent into the greywater treatment system gross 2015 a time lag between the production and reuse of greywater and irregular usage patterns inevitably lead to stagnant water in treatment systems in pipes and in clean water storage tanks an effective treatment step in retaining bacterial pathogens is a membrane bioreactor mbr wu 2019 nevertheless opportunistic pathogens such as p aeruginosa and l pneumophila can grow after treatment due to remaining nutrients and nonsterile conditions and can cause serious hygienic problems for greywater reuse blanky et al 2017 friedler et al 2011 recurring stagnation can increase cell concentrations due to microbial detachment during and after stagnation for example in intermittent drinking water supply systems bautista de los santos et al 2019 kumpel and nelson 2016 and in building plumbing bédard et al 2018 lautenschlager et al 2010 lipphaus et al 2014 however the extent to which intermittent flow and biofilm detachment in the biofilter lead to a deterioration of hygiene relevant parameters such as the concentration of opportunistic pathogens remains unclear biofilm detaches into bulk water both as single cells and through sloughing off of biofilm caused by shear stress davies 2011 shear stress can detach biofilm that formed in stagnant water when flow starts again bédard et al 2018 in tap water for example cell concentration is elevated after periods of stagnant water and the frequency with which flow is interrupted affects the extent to which bacterial numbers increase lipphaus et al 2014 this may be explained by the fact that detachment is influenced by the hydrodynamic conditions under which biofilm forms abe et al 2012 and the biofilm adapting to changing shear conditions choi and morgenroth 2003 cell concentrations can be increased after stagnation by changes in shear stress and by continuous detachment both leading to increased bulk concentrations that are washed out with the first flush besmer and hammes 2016 therefore it is important to quantify and understand these cell concentrations in greywater treatment systems that operate with intermittent flow automated online flow cytometry fcm is a valuable tool for investigating and monitoring short term microbial fluctuations such as increased cell concentrations after detachment besmer et al 2014 the high temporal resolution allows a better understanding of the underlying microbial processes in for example drinking water treatment besmer and hammes 2016 buysschaert et al 2018 and stagnant water in the distribution network farhat et al 2020 even though greywater treatment systems have to deal with high variability to our knowledge no online microbial measurements have been applied so far to study microbial water quality in greywater treatment systems whereas online fcm requires specialized sophisticated equipment and is not currently widespread online turbidity measurements are rather simple and routinely applied to monitor biofilters hooper et al 2019 turbidity and fcm both measure light scattering caused by suspended particles fcm additionally measures fluorescence fluorescent stains can be used to distinguish bacterial cells from other particles safford and bischel 2019 turbidity sensors are unable to distinguish between microbial and nonmicrobial particles depending on the system monitored turbidity may be a suitable indicator of microbial water quality or not page et al 2017 showed that turbidity and total cell concentration tcc followed similar dynamics in a karst spring in contrast ikonen et al 2013 mccoy and olson 1986 prest et al 2021 showed only a weak correlation between microbial water quality and turbidity for a drinking water distribution system and a municipal drinking water treatment plant combining online fcm with turbidity measurements provides a unique opportunity to compare turbidity and total cell concentration in a real life system with intermittent flow and highly variable nutrient concentrations the objective of this study was to better understand how stagnation an inherent consequence of the highly variable flow in greywater treatment systems influences the effluent water quality of a bac filter we measured cell concentrations in the effluent of a greywater treatment system over a two week period at high temporal resolution 5 min to quantify short term fluctuations we used these data to evaluate the extent to which turbidity was related to cell concentration we hypothesized that high cell concentration after stagnation is caused by continuous detachment of cells from the bac filter furthermore we assessed the extent to which the dynamics of cell concentrations are reflected in the dynamics of two opportunistic pathogens before and after the bac filter 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup the water hub at nest is a platform for investigating technologies for source separated wastewater streams in buildings grey yellow and blackwater etter et al 2016 on average 342 l d of greywater produced in the nest building is treated in two steps a membrane bioreactor mbr with an ultrafiltration membrane is followed by a biological activated carbon bac filter figure 1 the greywater originated from a fitness unit flats and public bathrooms and its composition was highly variable table 1 the mbr is a modified version of a commercially available system aquacell 800 newterra the mbr consists of two tanks with mean hydraulic residence times of 13 h in the first tank and 17 h in the second the highly variable influent flow rate and the on off operation of the mbr lead to intermittent flow into the bac filter the bac filter column material pvc granular activated carbon gac chemviron f 400 is operated with a mean empty bed contact time ebct of 112 min and a mean hydraulic loading rate of 0 4 m h the system has been monitored with both laboratory and online measurements for a period of more than two years table 1 the bac filter was operated for 550 days before the measurement campaign with online fcm was started corresponding to 5900 treated empty bed volumes the mbr retains pathogens we obtained more than 5 5 log10 removal of enterococcus with the mbr further the mbr degrades organic carbon and nitrifies ammonium to nitrate the bac removes the residual organic carbon and is operated with gravity driven down flow and without backwashing for this study bac influent samples were taken from the water at the top of the filter bed and effluent samples from the effluent pipe material pe hd as indicated in figure 1 2 2 turbidity turbidity was measured with a turbimax cus52d endress hauser this is a sensor for drinking and process waters with a detection limit of 0 0015 fnu formazin nephelometric unit and therefore suitable for low turbidity measurements the sensor was installed directly in the up flow pipe d 63 mm after the bac photo in supporting information s1 1 the sensor measures a data point every 5 s all data points 0 fnu and 2 fnu or differing more than 0 03 fnu from the moving average over 15 data points were considered to be outliers some 3 of the data points were labelled as outliers and were excluded from the data set 2 3 automated online flow cytometry 2 3 1 measurements over a period of two weeks the effluent of the bac was analyzed every 5 minutes for total cell concentration tcc tcc was measured with a bd accuri c6 plus flow cytometer and the automation unit oncyt dofcm 200 oncyt switzerland as described previously besmer et al 2014 the samples were mixed with a fluorescent nucleic acid stain sybr green i final concentration 1 10 000 in tris buffer containing 50 mm sodium thiosulfate the mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 37 c and subsequently transferred to the flow cytometer for a measurement of 99 µl at a flow rate of 66 µl min after each sampling and measurement the staining module and the flow cytometer were rinsed with ultrapure water 2 3 2 data analysis data was analyzed with the customized software cyplot oncyt switzerland the density plots were visually inspected to exclude abnormal density plots from the data set a more detailed description of the abnormal density plots can be found in supporting information s 1 3 in total from 3995 data points 140 data points 4 were identified as outliers and removed from the data set 2 4 laboratory measurements laboratory measurements were taken to characterize one of the peak events in more detail the effluent of the bac was sampled first every 5 minutes and afterwards every 15 minutes an influent sample was taken for every fourth effluent sample 2 4 1 flow cytometry samples for conventional flow cytometry were taken in autoclaved glassware samples were fixed with glutaraldehyde final concentration 0 1 and formaldehyde final concentration 0 01 and kept in the dark at 4 c until analysis tcc and intact cell concentration icc were measured with a cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa at a flow rate of 60 µl min for 30 s tcc was measured with sybr green i stain final concentration 1 10 000 in tris buffer and for icc propidium iodide pi was added final concentration 6 µm all samples were measured in triplicate the tcc measured with conventional flow cytometry were also compared to tcc measured with online flow cytometry supporting information s 1 4 both show the same trends but differ somewhat in the absolute numbers measured 2 4 2 legionella pneumophila legiolert idexx laboratories usa was used to quantify the most probable number mpn of legionella pneumophila in the water samples following the nonpotable water protocol provided by the manufacturer samples were processed within 4 h after sampling 2 4 3 pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa was detected with gsp sigma aldrich selective agar with addition of penicillin g fluka i e benzylpenicillin sodium a 1 1000 dilution with nanopure water was used for filtration and the membrane filters on the agar plates were incubated at 28 c for 24 29 5 h after incubation the number of colony forming units cfus that had grown on the filter were counted no further confirmatory assays were performed all glassware used was autoclaved samples were processed within 4 h after sampling and all samples were taken in duplicate 2 4 4 total organic carbon toc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l kyoto japan within 24 h after sampling and the samples were kept at 4 c until analysis all glassware used was muffled at 450 c for 4 h 2 5 model model calculations were performed to test whether hypothesized continuous bacterial detachment in the bac filter is compatible with observations we hypothesized that continuous bacterial detachment during periods of stagnation leads to an accumulation of cells in the bulk water of the bac filter and that these are washed out when flow starts 2 5 1 hydraulic the bac filter was modelled as a series of ideal reactors the water volume on top of the filter bed was modelled as a completely mixed tank with variable volume the bac filter was modelled as a series of completely stirred tank reactors cstrs to represent a plug flow reactor pfr with dispersion the volume at the bottom of the filter bed was modelled as a single cstr and that of the pipe to the measurement and sampling point was modelled as a pfr the flow through the bac qout was calculated from the pressure changes measured on top of the filter bed the details for the calculations can be found in supporting information s 1 5 the only fitted parameter number of cstrs to represent pfr was determined from visual comparison of the hydraulic model and a tracer test using nacl supporting information s 1 5 3 2 5 2 detachment in this study we modelled the detachment of cells as a function of biomass

are discussed in this publication one with a constant kd and the other with a higher kd during times with flow and a lower kd during stagnation the coefficients were determined by visual comparison of the measured and the calculated tcc concentrations the focus was on i the peak height and ii the baseline tcc values the coefficients determined for the models are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 stagnation leads to increased turbidity and tcc highly variable inflow to the greywater system and the operation of the mbr led to intermittent flow to the bac this intermittent flow led to periods with stagnant water in the bac filter when flow resumed after stagnation both turbidity and total cell concentration tcc showed increased values in the bac effluent figure 2 the effluent concentrations in tcc and turbidity then gradually decreased to the values measured before stagnation these data show that after stagnation cells were washed out from the bac tcc was constant during periods with stagnant water indicating no growth in the stagnant water in the pipe after the bac tcc and turbidity followed the same pattern with peaks after stagnation data from two weeks of online measurements show strong statistically significant p 0 05 correlation r2 0 84 between tcc and turbidity figure 3 nonetheless a single turbidity value cannot indicate the exact cell concentration 3 2 longer stagnation periods are linked to higher tcc in the effluent the longer the water stagnated prior to flow the higher were the measured tcc and turbidity after the flow through the filter started again as an example figure 4 depicts how for tcc both the peak height and the area below the peak were higher for longer stagnation periods therefore both the maximum concentration of bacteria and the total bacterial load were increased after stagnation figure 5 shows the area below the different peak events for turbidity and tcc for different stagnation times for all the peaks that occurred over a period of 15 days the area for each peak event is calculated as the integral between the peak curve and a baseline the baseline is defined as the mean value during the first 8 minutes after flow starts again the data clearly show that the area below the curve for both turbidity and tcc increased with stagnation duration the coefficients of determination r2 are 0 56 p 0 04 for turbidity and 0 59 p 0 02 for tcc 3 3 continuous detachment of cells from the bac simple model calculations were used to test the assumption of continuous cell detachment from the bac the measured cell concentration was compared with two model configurations both assuming that detachment always occurs i constant detachment independent of the flow and ii higher detachment during flow than during stagnation the model with higher detachment during times with flow than during periods of stagnation is able to represent the general patterns of measured cell concentrations figure 6 both the constant and varying detachment models present peaks with a slight delay compared to the measured data supporting information s 2 3 the model with constant detachment overestimates the maximum peak heights whereas that with two detachment rates is more accurate both models indicate that even a short decrease in flow leads to increased cell concentration in the effluent afterwards the delay between start of flow and the peak maximum was caused by hydraulics the sampling and measuring location is not directly below the filter bed the model shows that during stagnation the tcc in the filter bed also increased due to continuous detachment during times of stagnation these cells were then washed out of the filter when flow started again 3 4 relevance for hygiene of the reuse water detachment of cells from the bac filter can also be detected in data from turbidity measurements to assess the water quality during the increased turbidity for hygiene relevant parameters one peak event was sampled for tcc icc toc l pneumophila and p aeruginosa figure 7 the washout of water that had stagnated in different locations of the system is shown over time in figure 7a the hydraulic model that was used to calculate washout is presented in supporting information s 1 5 when the flow started water that had stagnated after the bac was sampled first over time the proportion of water that had stagnated in the filter bed increased in the flow this proportion reached its maximum at the same time that the peak values for tcc and turbidity were reached when a higher proportion of the water that either stagnated on top of the filter bed or was fresh mbr permeate reached the sampling location tcc decreased again to previously observed values we therefore concluded that the water that stagnated in the filter bed had the highest tcc and turbidity the influent concentration for tcc was constant during the whole sampling period showing that the changes in the effluent were caused by processes in the filter itself and not processes in the pipes before as also observed by zhang et al 2015 the effluent tcc was higher than the influent concentration over the whole period indicating microbial growth in the bac filter the turbidity during the sampled peak event showed the typical pattern as observed for previous peak curves indicating that the more frequent sampling did not influence the observed effluent water quality significantly the influent turbidity was not measured on the day of more frequent sampling but previous measurements had shown that the influent turbidity had an mean of 0 05 sd 0 02 fnu and is thus lower than the effluent turbidity at on mean 0 23 fnu sd 0 06 the ratio between intact and total cell concentration did not change significantly between influent and effluent both influent and effluent showed a decrease in the fraction of intact cells around 1 5 h after flow onset the lowest ratio occurred after the peak in tcc was measured less than 1 h after the turbidity peak the ratio increased again to values similar to those observed at the beginning of the sampling throughout the whole measurement period a significant removal on average 68 of organic carbon was observed during the peak event of tcc no increase in toc in the effluent was measured in contrast the toc effluent concentrations were slightly lower during this period the toc in the influent did not change significantly over the 4 h of sampling the curves measured for the opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa look comparable no increase in presumptive positive concentrations was observed for either from the influent to the effluent of the bac filter also no increase was observed with the increased tcc the highest concentrations 1490 mpn l and 15500 cfu 100ml for presumptive positive l pneumophila and p aeruginosa respectively were measured in the water that stagnated on top of the filter bed p aeruginosa also showed a high cell concentration in the sample that stagnated in the effluent pipe prior to sampling whereas this was not the case for l pneumophila overall only turbidity and icc correlated significantly with tcc measured in the effluent further there was a negative correlation between toc and icc r 0 39 the correlation matrix is given in supporting information s 2 4 4 discussion 4 1 stagnation leads to increased turbidity and tcc in biofilters organic carbon is degraded and thus microbial growth is to be expected not all these cells accumulate in the filter and instead most of the bacteria are washed out of the filter leading to higher cell concentrations in the effluent than in the influent of the bac velten et al 2011 a sudden increase in flow velocity and thus shear stress or intermittent flow conditions have been shown to lead to increased bacterial concentration in the effluent of gacs besmer and hammes 2016 zhang et al 2015 therefore we were not surprised to observe increased cell concentration after periods with stagnation in the effluent of our treatment system hence even though the mbr degrades a substantial portion of the organic carbon enough nutrients remain to support subsequent growth afterwards therefore the questions are not whether growth occurs but where the remaining carbon is degraded whether most of the bacteria grow in biofilter pipes or storage tanks and whether the growth is problematic from a water quality perspective for example due to increased pathogen concentrations a biofilter allows more spatially concentrated growth which provides more opportunities for controlling and monitoring growth and detachment such monitoring might for instance be used to initiate the recirculation of water of insufficient quality data from the bac filter effluent showed a strong correlation between turbidity and total cell concentration this is somewhat unusual because most systems incorporate a wide variety of turbidity causing materials farrell et al 2018 here the ultrafiltration membrane s pore size of 0 04 µm retains most materials captured by turbidity measurements including bacteria all the cells and other turbidity causing material can therefore be assumed to originate from the pipes between the mbr and the bac and from the bac filter itself an sem microscopy analysis of the water at peak turbidity showed very few particles other than cells a few gac silicate and chalk particles were observed in the bac effluent supporting information s 2 1 however the number of particles was too low to explain the increase in turbidity moreover from an experiment with a dilution series of a bacterial pure culture we confirmed that turbidity correlated well with total cell concentration at the concentrations we observed here data shown in supporting information s 2 2 these additional measurements can explain the strong correlation of turbidity with tcc after the bac we therefore particularly recommend the use of turbidity sensors in treatment systems with membranes as an easy way to monitor growth and detachment in a biofilter concentrating growth and therefore detachment spatially in a biofilter allows a turbidity sensor to monitor these processes an unexpected change in turbidity caused for example by growth during stagnation or breakthrough of bacteria through the filter can be used as a warning signal for process failure and should be followed by a closer investigation on whether the water is still safe for reuse which type of sensors can best detect changes in water quality and process failures depends on the system that is monitored 4 2 longer stagnation periods are linked to higher tcc in the effluent typically engineered biofilters are designed to be operated without water stagnating in the filter therefore little research has been published about the effects of stagnation on the effluent water quality of bacs these publications have focused on the overall removal performance of organic carbon and how stagnation influences the biological activity and the sorption capacity on the filter but have not studied short term fluctuations hess et al 2020 mckie et al 2019 other systems with regular change between flow and stagnation include building plumbing lautenschlager et al 2010 and drinking water systems with intermittent supply bautista de los santos et al 2019 studies in building plumbing have shown that the longer the stagnation and the more biofilm in the pipe the higher is the cell concentration in the effluent after stagnation lautenschlager et al 2010 proctor 2017 a deterioration in water quality is also to be expected in intermittent water supply after water stagnates and sometimes pipes even run dry due to interrupted water supply kumpel and nelson 2016 therefore we were not surprised to observe increased tcc and turbidity in the effluent of a biofilter nevertheless there are also important differences in pipe systems cell concentration did not further increase for stagnation times longer than 12 hours lautenschlager et al 2010 but in the bac peak cell concentration continued to increase with stagnation time despite the similarities in the systems differences between pipes and biofilters could also influence the detachment of bacteria such as the surface to volume ratio bédard et al 2018 and the flow conditions picioreanu et al 2001 4 3 continuous detachment of cells from the bac the fact that higher cell concentrations were measured in the effluent after longer stagnation indicates that cells detach continuously even during periods without flow a model with continuous detachment of cells in the bac and higher detachment during periods with flow than during stagnation can explain these peak events the results of this study suggest that a combination of continuous detachment of cells from the biofilm and increased detachment caused by shear stress during times with flow lead to peaks in cell concentrations after stagnation a possible explanation could be that the biofilm in the bac adapted to the regular interruption of flow choi and morgenroth 2003 douterelo et al 2013 manuel et al 2009 and therefore the change of shear conditions did not lead to a significant sloughing off of biofilm at the beginning of the flow period continuous detachment of cells has also been identified as the main cause for the high cell concentration in the first flush of other systems with regularly occurring stagnation besmer and hammes 2016 however for systems where stagnation is a rare event and the biofilm is not adapted to sudden changes in flow conditions changing shear stress is considered an important cause of biofilm detachment paul et al 2012 4 4 relevance for hygiene of the reuse water water quality is influenced by the location at which water stagnates in the system biofilter or polyethylene pipe tcc and turbidity were highest in the water that stagnated in the filter bed by contrast organic carbon was lowest in the water that stagnated in the bac the water that stagnated in the filter bed had a much longer residence time in the filter bed 480 min instead of typically 30 min and therefore more of the organic carbon was degraded yet constructing a bac more than tenfold larger to reach a tenfold longer retention time would only increase the toc removal from an average of 68 to the observed maximum of 75 the water quality did not deteriorate in terms of toc due to stagnation in the bac the microbial communities on biofilters for water treatment play an important role in shaping the microbial community of the effluent water pinto et al 2012 this study focused on two opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa and on the extent to which the bac promotes their growth and hence the degree to which detachment of biofilm is detrimental to the hygienic quality of the reuse water l pneumophila and p aeruginosa concentrations are potentially critical to safe water reuse blanky et al 2017 coronel olivares et al 2011 however these pathogens are mentioned very few times in water reuse frameworks e g spanish regulation for water reuse pathogen concentrations in all the samples of the influent and effluent of the bac are high for any intended reuse involving direct contact with users the values measured during this one peak event were above or just below regulatory values therefore these pathogens should not be neglected when assessing the safety of the water for reuse the high concentration in the influent of the bac shows that these opportunistic pathogens grow before the bac in the pipes between the membrane and the bac consequently if growth after the membrane cannot be prevented a disinfection step is necessary after the bac to ensure the hygienic quality of the reuse water the highest values for both pathogens were measured in the water that stagnated in front of the bac filter further studies are needed to show how stagnation in the pipes between the membrane and the bac filter influences the growth of these opportunistic pathogens the numbers do not change for either pathogen because of the bac treatment meaning that they grow not in the filter itself but in the pipes and tubes between the membrane and the bac legionella has been shown to grow in biofilms with a ph in the range from 5 to 8 5 epa 2016 the temperature range in the bac of 21 c to 23 c is quite low considering legionella prefer temperatures between 35 c and 42 c rhoads et al 2016 in contrast p aeruginosa can grow optimally at temperatures between 10 c and 42 c and at low nutrient concentrations bédard et al 2016 hence this pathogen is well adapted to growth in the bac filter nevertheless both the finding that the concentrations in the bac effluent are not higher in the effluent than in the influent and that the peak in tcc does not correlate with increased pathogen numbers are strong indicators that the biofilter is not a hotspot for the growth of these opportunistic pathogens therefore in our case the bac is not of concern for the growth of these opportunistic pathogens after stagnation in the bac a deterioration in water quality was observed in terms of cell concentration and turbidity but it is important to note that the increased cell concentration is not related to the pathogens investigated in this study or to an increase in effluent toc concentrations hence stagnation does not lead to a deterioration of the parameters relevant to ensuring the hygiene of reuse water nevertheless increased turbidity can lead to decreased disinfection performance for example with uv disinfection farrell et al 2018 guidelines from the world health organization suggest that turbidity values above 0 2 ntu can negatively influence disinfection performance world health organization 2017 results such as ours that show a clear pattern of turbidity between 0 2 and 1 fnu should therefore be taken into consideration when a disinfection step is designed to ensure sufficient disinfection at all times and to prevent any negative impacts of increased turbidity on performance 5 conclusion this study presents four main conclusions highly variable flow into household scale greywater treatment systems leads to periods with stagnant water after stagnation increased turbidity and cell concentrations are measured in the effluent of the bac stagnation does not lead to an increase in opportunistic pathogens in the effluent showing that the bac is not a hotspot for the growth of opportunistic pathogens l pneumophila and p aeruginosa therefore no additional measures are necessary to exclude the first water after stagnation from reuse after the bac turbidity correlates strongly with cell concentrations therefore turbidity can be used as a proxy for increased cell concentrations and unexpected fluctuations can be an indication of process failure the extent and fluctuations of increased cell concentrations and turbidity are consistent with a model that assumes that the rate of continuous detachment in the bac is higher during periods with flow than during stagnation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

19943,despite their potential in heating supply systems thus far high temperature aquifer thermal energy storages ht ates currently lack widespread application reducing the potential risks by improving the predictability of hydrogeochemical processes accelerated or initiated at elevated temperatures might promote the development of this technology therefore we report the results of a short term hot water infiltration field test with subsurface temperatures above 70 c along with associated laboratory batch tests at 10 40 and 70 c for 28 sediment samples to determine their usability for geochemical prediction most groundwater components had lower maximal concentrations and smaller concentration ranges in field samples compared to the batch tests this indicates that the strongest geochemical effects observed in laboratory tests with sufficient site specific sediment samples will likely be attenuated at the field scale a comparison of field measurements with predicted concentration ranges based on temperature induced relative concentration changes from the batch tests revealed that the predictive power was greatest where the hot infiltrated water had cooled least and the strongest geochemical effects occurred the batch test based predictions showed the best accordance with field data for components with significant temperature induced concentration changes related to ion exchange and de sorption processes however accurate prediction of concentration changes based on other processes e g mineral dissolution and downstream reversals in concentrations

predictability 1 introduction seasonal high temperature aquifer thermal energy storages ht ates in urban areas have the potential to be a key technology in the transformation of the heating sector energy system away from the use of fossil fuels henning and palzer 2012 however thus far the wider application of ates systems with temperatures above 50 c has been hampered by technical financial social political and legal risks fleuchaus et al 2020 one aspect that causes potential technical or legal issues is the various hydrogeochemical processes accelerated or initiated by elevated temperatures of up to 90 c and the induced changes to the flow regime bauer et al 2013 jenne et al 1992 this includes processes associated with operational issues such as i accelerated corrosion andersson 1990 jenne et al 1992 ii the precipitation of carbonates griffioen and appelo 1993 and fe and mn hydr oxides andersson 1990 willemsen 1990 that can cause scaling within heat exchangers pipes and in and around wells iii the formation of a separate gas phase lüders et al 2016 that can block pipes or parts of the near well pore space and iv the dissolution of amorphous silica and silicates at increased temperatures arning et al 2006 m bonte et al 2013b holm et al 1987 that can precipitate when the water is cooled in the surface installations during heat recovery gunnarsson and arnórsson 2005 there are also processes associated with potential changes in groundwater quality such as i the release of dissolved organic carbon doc and associated redox processes bonte et al 2013a brons et

elements and heavy metals relevant for administrative approval lüders et al 2020 previous ht ates field tests installed in depths varying from below 10 to above 200 m below ground surface bgs have mainly focussed only on processes that potentially damage the ates operation itself as well as on technical solutions to prevent these processes andersson 1990 jenne et al 1992 molz et al 1981 opel et al 2014 perlinger et al 1987 ueckert and baumann 2019 initial hydrogeochemical effects with potential environmental consequences relevant for administrative approval bonte et al 2011 hähnlein et al 2013 possemiers et al 2014 and observations of geochemical effects downstream of the infiltration well have not been in focus of ht ates field tests so far furthermore all the aforementioned studies focus either on laboratory investigations or on field observations thus whether laboratory investigations with site material and water can yield reliable predictions regarding temperature dependent initial hydrogeochemical effects at the aquifer scale is largely undetermined therefore this work combines a short term hot water infiltration field test with temperatures of up to 78 c with preceding laboratory batch tests for 28 sediment samples from the field test site essential questions investigated by this approach include which initial component specific temperature dependent geochemical effects observed in the hot water infiltration field test can be predicted by the laboratory investigations and to what extent how does the geochemical heterogeneity of the sediments affect variances in geochemical behaviour at the laboratory and field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 testum field test site the testum field test site is located near wittstock brandenburg germany 53 11 40 n 12 30 18 e on an abandoned airfield subsurface exploration during an earlier co2 injection test on the same site a few metres away peter et al 2012 showed that the shallow subsurface consists of typical

electric conductivity ec and a hydraulic profiling tool hpt an area featuring a 9 m thick sandy layer 6 15 m bgs overlaid by a 2 3 m thick cohesive layer was chosen for the hot water infiltration test see also heldt et al 2021 keller et al 2021 groundwater head measurements between 2 9 and 3 5 m bgs showed that the sandy layer used for infiltration is confined locally groundwater flowed in west

screened at 5 partial 7 5 10 5 13 5 and 17 m bgs were installed with sonic drilling see fig 1 for a map of the field tests monitoring network this resulted in 71 groundwater monitoring points distributed over 17 wells 2 2 laboratory experiments 2 2 1 sediment and water procurement and characterisation before installing the monitoring wells 100 kg of sediment samples from 0 to 18 m bgs were obtained from nine different bore holes at positions u01 u12 c05 c06 c07 d03 d04 d09 and mp002 fig 1 by either macro core or sonic drilling geoprobe systems salina kansas us macro core drilling yields sediment samples with minimal physical and chemical disturbance epa 1997 in contrast sonic drilling can cause elevated temperatures at the drill core interface and thus might potentially affect temperature dependent geochemical behaviour in subsequent laboratory investigations however there were no noticeable deviations in the temperature induced geochemical effects of the different sediment samples depending on the used drilling technique wherefore no further differentiation regarding the drilling technique was made each half metre drill core consisting of on average 1733 g sediment was mixed and split into three parts 1 a 400 g individual sediment sample specific to the respective well location and half metre depth range 2 half of the remaining sediment was mixed to a homogenised composite sample of the infiltration layer and 3 the rest was kept in the drill cores as backup material the individual sediment samples were used to investigate the heterogeneity in hydrogeochemical behaviour at elevated temperatures the homogenised composite sample of the infiltration layer was used for geochemical characterisation with triplicates table 1 and for further laboratory investigations with a higher sediment demand not part of this study all sediment samples were stored under argon atmosphere in refrigerators at 10 c until further use the water used for the laboratory experiments was repeatedly pumped from the extraction well and well 004 fig 1 and stored at 10 c in a refrigerator in gas tight bags pet al pe composite to avoid gas exchange with the atmosphere table 2 sediment samples from the same wells but from the low permeable layers above and below the target aquifer utilised for the hot water infiltration have been investigated in a separate study meier zu beerentrup and dahmke 2021 2 2 2 batch tests batch tests were used to determine the heterogeneity in hydrogeochemical behaviour of individual sediment samples at elevated temperatures and to consider the observed variance for the subsequent predictive calculations section 2 5 due to their low sample volume requirements sediment samples n 28 from the sandy aquifer section into which the hot water was infiltrated 6 15 m bgs were tempered for one week at 60 rpm in a shaking chamber to 10 and 40 c and in a custom build heating chamber on a shaker to 70 c for each of the 84 batches 40 g of sediment and 80 ml of site water were filled into 200 ml hdpe vials sediment samples from c d and u wells with site water from extraction well u00 or 100 ml glass vials sediment samples from mp002 drill core with site water from well 004 in an argon filled glove box table 2 to avoid oxygen intrusion the vials were closed with hdpe screw caps or aluminium crimp caps with butyl septa respectively the potential degassing of co2 while filling the vials cannot be prevented with this procedure to identify concentration changes induced by the vial material blank tests with both vial materials and site water but without sediment were applied at each temperature see table a 3 in the supplementary material due to the high ratio between the concentrations resulting from the releases from the blank vials versus the respective mean concentration increase in the sediment batch tests for sidiss with the glass vials up to 1 31 and non purgeable organic carbon npoc with the hdpe vials up to 0 81 only the data from the sediment batch tests with the other vial material were used for further data evaluation for these two components after one week the vials were reopened and the water was separated from the sediment using 7 µm cellulose round filters and then filled into the analytical vials section 2 4 2 3 short term hot water infiltration field test to identify the geochemical effects of elevated temperatures the initial hydrogeochemical state and natural variations in the target aquifer were characterised in six baseline sampling campaigns conducted between october 2018 and april 2019 224 183 128 93 64 and 28 days before the start of the hot water infiltration fig a 1 over the whole monitoring period from autumn 2018 to summer 2019 the groundwater heads increased by up to 40 cm similarly in all the different monitoring wells thus there are no indications for significant changes in the hydraulic gradient or the groundwater flow direction over time hot water infiltration started on the 23rd of may 2019 and finished on the 29th of may 2019 a submersible pump pumped cold water from extraction well u00 into a cold water buffer tank there the water was covered with argon to avoid oxygen intrusion however concomitant equilibration of co2 between the water phase and the argon coverage may have facilitated subsequent carbonate precipitation at elevated temperatures from the cold water buffer tank the water was pumped through a plate heat exchanger where it was heated to approximately 85 c then into a hot water buffer tank where the hot water could degas to minimise potential tube or well clogging by gas bubbles to eliminate traces of the organic contaminant trichloroethylene tce table 2 fig a 1 the formed gas phase was dissipated over an activated carbon filter before being released from the hot water buffer tank the water flowed by gravity at 14 5 l min into the infiltration well towards the end of the hot water infiltration the infiltration rate decreased to below 1 l min see heldt et al 2021 presumably due to clogging of tubes and the well screen caused by a combination of transported fines from the extraction well precipitates and gas bubbles in total 86 m³ of 75 c hot water was infiltrated over a period of 4 5 days water extraction and infiltration superimposed the natural hydraulic conditions around the respective wells during operation but the induced hydraulic signal faded away within a few hours data not shown subsequently eight sampling campaigns 4 12 15 20 33 48 68 and 104 days after the start of infiltration were conducted to monitor the hydrogeochemical effects in the post hot water infiltration phase in each monitoring campaign water samples were taken from 40 to 70 monitoring points 3 to 5 per well to minimise hydraulic effects of the sampling campaigns groundwater samples from the 2 inch wells were retrieved with low pumping rates of 4 l min by submersible pumps mp1 grundfos gmbh erkrath germany or whale submersible electric galley pump munster simms engineering ltd bangor northern ireland the water samples from the different screened depths in the 2 inch wells 7 8 10 11 and 13 14 m bgs were separated by using packers above and below the pump submerged to the respective monitoring depths the water then flowed through a pvc tube into a mixing cell where probes for the on site parameters see 2 4 were installed to pump groundwater from the cmt wells into the mixing cell 100 ml min peristaltic pumps stainless steel capillaries and viton pumping tubes were utilised which allowed to minimise intrusion of oxygen despite a relatively long residence time in the pumping system in both setups water samples for the analytical vials see 2 4 were taken at a three way valve directly before the mixing cell

field test based on laboratory investigations the concentration changes between the laboratory batch tests at 10 40 and 70 c were used to predict temperature dependent potential concentration changes in the hot water infiltration field test first the component specific relative concentration changes between the batch tests at increased temperatures of 40 and 70 c and the reference batch tests at 10 c were calculated for all 28 sediment samples and plotted against temperature as shown for v in fig a 2 relative changes were chosen over absolute values as they allow for better consideration of different base concentration levels then the 0th 25th 50th 75th and 100th percentile of the 28 component specific relative concentration changes between 10 and 40 c and 40 and 70 c were approximated by linear or exponential regression functions whether linear or exponential regression functions were applied for a component was determined by the higher coefficient of determination for the median concentrations 50th percentile over the whole temperature range from 10 to 40 and 70 c the two temperature ranges were calculated separately to prevent over or underestimations of concentrations around the temperatures actually investigated in the laboratory batch tests while enabling the prediction of concentrations in between to calculate well and depth specific potential concentration changes the corresponding baseline concentrations and temperature measurements completed the equations as shown in eqs a 1 and a 2 this procedure resulted in a component specific potential concentration range calculated from the heterogeneity of the sediment samples investigated in the laboratory batch tests linked with the baseline concentrations and the temperatures measured in the hot water infiltration field test 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical effects in laboratory experiments overall temperature induced geochemical effects in the laboratory tests followed the pattern expected from previous studies for the main groundwater constituents an increase in temperature caused a release of organic carbon brons et al 1991 jesußek et al 2013a silica and potassium arning et al 2006 holm et al 1987 whereas concentrations of inorganic carbon calcium and magnesium decreased griffioen and appelo 1993 fig 2 a despite the elevated npoc concentrations microbial catalysed redox reactions appeared to be limited within the one week sediment water contact time as expected from lag phases of microbial growth mellefont and ross 2003 this resulted in negligible effects on median concentrations of redox sensitive parameters such as nitrate and sulphate also the median concentrations of trace elements and heavy metals mostly behaved as expected from the literature increasing concentrations with increasing temperature were observed for monovalent cations li and tl and those components likely present as oxyanions e g v as se and mo concentrations of divalent cations e g co ni and zn rather decreased m bonte et al 2013b lüders et al 2020 fig 2b unlike afore cited studies concentrations of cu and al increased in several sediment samples at 70 c most of the components which showed elevated concentrations at increased temperatures also demonstrated a greater concentration variation at 40 and even more at 70 c compared to 10 c e g sidiss li v cr as se and sb a similar wider scattering of concentrations at higher temperatures has also been reported by m bonte et al 2013b and lüders et al 2020 taken together the small scale heterogeneity in groundwater chemistry at ambient temperatures observed in the baseline monitoring for the hot water infiltration test fig 4 fig a 1 can be expected to increase when temperatures rise this would result in not only shifted but also wider concentration ranges at elevated temperatures 3 2 effects of the hot water infiltration field test on aquifer hydrochemistry 3 2 1 temporal evolution of induced temperature changes the infiltration of the hot water caused elevated temperatures up to 70 c in close proximity to the infiltration well higher temperatures at the top of the aquifer than at the bottom fig 3 can be attributed to temperature induced vertical convection as shown by coupled numerical simulations heldt et al 2021 with local variations in hydraulic permeability see hpt logs in fig 1 contributing to spatial variations around the first monitoring campaign 4 5 days after the start of the hot water infiltration maximal temperatures of 72 c were recorded at the monitoring points 7 5 m bgs in wells c05 and d01 1 1 5 m away from the infiltration well see fig 1 for positions in monitoring wells c04 c08 d03 d04 and d06 all 3 4 m away from the infiltration well the highest temperatures 30 41 c at 7 5 m bgs were recorded around the second monitoring campaign 12 13 days after infiltration start the monitoring wells further downstream d08 d09 d10 6 5 m away from the infiltration well showed the highest temperatures of 14 15 c around the 5th and 6th monitoring campaigns 48 68 days after the start of the infiltration a more detailed insight into temporal and spatial evolution of temperatures is presented in heldt et al 2021 3 2 2 overview of geochemical effects induced by hot water infiltration to determine the geochemical effects induced by the hot water infiltration the average concentrations including standard deviations in wells around and downstream from the infiltration well were compared for the baseline period and the first first month and second from second month onwards post infiltration periods these average concentrations represent several monitoring wells and campaigns and therefore the effects of a mixture of reached temperatures however increased concentrations of no2 k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl u and ch4 during the post infiltration period s can be attributed to the elevated temperatures as they exceeded the natural variations during baseline monitoring and the potential mixing effects of original and infiltrated water fig 4 for all components apart from no2 and ch4 which were not detected and u which was not significantly affected the trend of increasing concentration with increasing temperature is also apparent in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 conversely not all expected concentration changes apparent in the batch tests e g for co were obvious and distinguishable from water mixing in the field measurements the decreasing cl concentrations and increasing u concentrations in the field measurements fig 4 do not fit the expectations based on the laboratory batch tests fig 2 and cannot be fully explained by water mixing processes between original and infiltrated water and therefore for now must be attributed to an unidentified process beside the quantitatively limited concentration changes of no2 and ch4 15 µmol l there were no indications of an intensification of microbially catalysed redox processes in the field measurements this fits with expectations as elevated temperatures were sustained only for a couple of days and is also supported by the observation of only minor temperature induced changes in the microbial community keller et al 2021 3 2 3 reversibility of concentration changes in the field test in ates systems geochemical reversibility characterises how aquifer hydrogeochemistry affected by elevated temperatures returns to initial conditions when temperatures decrease a around downstream of the hot well during hot water infiltration and the storage period b due to heat extraction between hot water recovery and water re infiltration into the cold well and c after termination of ates operation to investigate how far the geochemical effects of elevated temperatures persist maximal concentrations of k sidiss li v as mo and se that all showed increased concentrations near the infiltration well were observed downstream with increasing distance from the infiltration well tmax 78 c maximal temperatures decreased from 73 to 41 c and down to 15 c at 1 m d01 3 m d03 and 6 5 m d09 from the well respectively similar behaviour was observed for the maximal concentrations of li v as mo and se as they returned to values within or near the geogenic range fig 5 thus the field test data validated the rapid concentration changes with declining temperatures for components which concentration changes are related to temperature dependent ion exchange and de sorption processes e g li v as mo and se fig 5 as has been shown in previous laboratory lüders et al 2020 and modelling bonte et al 2014 studies as expected reversal concentration changes related to mineral dissolution and precipitation sidiss and k were slower in case of longer sustained elevated temperatures induced reductive dissolution of fe and mn hydr oxides may reduce sorption capacity and thus reversibility bonte et al 2013a lüders et al 2020 oxidative dissolution to a relevant extent is unlikely in this field test as the oxygen concentration of the infiltrated water 0 9 mg l fig 4 was below the median oxygen concentrations in all monitored depths in the baseline monitoring fig a 1 which also indicated a rather oxidised state of the sediment however in settings with larger oxygen infiltration also oxidative dissolution reactions might play a role further in a cyclic heat storage operation groundwater constituents released at elevated temperatures will partly also be extracted with the hot water and fixated around the cold well after reinfiltration as modelled by bonte et al 2014 or in potential mineral precipitates e g in the surface installations thus the overall effect on the re distribution of released groundwater constituents is controlled by the interplay of the aforementioned processes and requires further research 3 3 direct comparison of concentrations between the laboratory batch tests and the field test for a primary comparison of concentrations between the field and the laboratory data at high temperatures the data from the batch tests at 70 c and monitoring points sampled at temperatures 55 c were directly compared the comparison of data from monitoring points sampled between 25 and 55 c and associated batch tests at 40 c is in the supplementary information fig a 3 after the five day hot water infiltration five monitoring points all from the central monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 which are within a 1 5 m radius around the infiltration well fit this criterion the maximal concentrations of components in the field samples 55 c were within or below the concentration range of the laboratory batch tests at 70 c for 24 of 31 components all but npoc tic no3 sidiss co ba and tl overall environmentally relevant concentration increases of most ancillary components seemed to be well represented moreover despite the larger temperature range of the field samples 59 72 c the field data concentration range was smaller than the laboratory data concentration range for 26 of 31 components all but npoc co ni ba and tl fig 6 both aspects are plausible as the sediment samples investigated in the batch tests originated from a wider area than the three central monitoring wells fig 1 thus within the central hot zone around the infiltration well the water may have only been in contact with a limited range of sedimentary compositions another possible explanation for this observation may also lie in the flow path of the water from the infiltration until the respective monitoring well the water can encounter sediments of slightly different compositions which potentially counterbalances the strongest effects both explanations indicate that considering a preferably wide variety of individual small scale sediment samples in laboratory tests might serve as a safety buffer for concentrations expectable on the field scale 3 4 comparison of field concentrations with the predicted concentration range from laboratory batch tests with focus on the initial concentration changes caused by the highest temperatures attained in the field test the predictive power of the laboratory batch tests was evaluated temporally by the first monitoring campaign after hot water infiltration and spatially by the three central monitoring wells nearest to the infiltration well c05 c07 and d01 each with three sampled depths overall 33 and 68 of the concentrations of main and ancillary groundwater components measured in these wells respectively were between the 0th and 100th percentile of the predicted concentration range based on the temperature induced concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests fig 7 see fig a 2 for explanation with 43 and 40 of concentrations of main and ancillary components laying below the 50th percentile respectively there appeared to be a slight overall underestimation of concentrations by the laboratory based predictions to determine whether the temperature during monitoring had an effect on the agreement between measured concentrations and the predicted concentration range the comparison between measured and predicted concentrations was broken down to the individual monitoring points of the wells c05 c07 d01 and d03 n 12 including their respective sampling temperatures thereby the overall accordance between measured and predicted concentrations was greatest where the hot infiltrated water had cooled least prior to monitoring fig 8 a the laboratory batch tests yielded the best results in terms of predictive power when the hottest temperature and thus the largest change in concentration occurred suggesting that the target infiltration temperature could be utilised as a basis for predicting the maximal expected temperature induced concentration changes on the on hand maximal expectable concentration changes could be used as input parameters for scenario calculation that estimate the attenuated concentration changes in the wider surroundings as e g shown in lüders et al 2020 on the other hand the maximal expectable concentrations of environmentally relevant groundwater components are important for administrative approval procedures furthermore components with increased concentrations at elevated temperatures k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl and u also had a higher proportion of concentrations above the 100th percentile of predicted concentrations the further temperatures declined fig 8b which implies a retarded adaption of concentrations to decreasing temperatures despite the similar trend for main and ancillary components there is a significant gap in the accordance between these groups fig 8a indicating different behaviour of individual groups of components to address this the underlying data of fig 7 was broken down to the individual groundwater constituents fig 9 from the main groundwater components the measured concentrations of mg2 tic ca2 no3 na k cl so4 2 and sidiss were within the predicted concentration range for less than 50 of the monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 considering the data in figs 2 4 and 6 three distinct groups of these components can be identified for na cl no3 and so4 2 with comparatively small temperature dependent concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 concentration changes due to mixing of infiltrated water fig 4 with residual water from around the infiltration well probably exceeded any potential temperature related concentration changes concentrations of tic ca2 mg2 and sr that were predominantly affected by temperature dependent precipitation of carbonates griffioen and appelo 1993 reddy and nancollas 1976 behave differently to reach the target infiltration temperatures of 75 to 80 c temperatures in the surface installations heat exchanger tubes and tanks must be even higher and reached temperatures between 80 and 90 c this had no impact on geochemical processes that demand sediment water contact though mineral precipitation processes related to elevated temperatures can be affected therefore the higher temperatures before infiltration probably caused stronger carbonate precipitation than expected based on the logged in aquifer temperatures which is not considered in the predicted concentration range calculations concentrations of tic ca2 and mg2 in the extracted water table 2 deviated from the values around the infiltration well in the baseline monitoring fig 4 fig a 1 adding the mixing of the different waters as an additional source of uncertainty sidiss tl and to a lesser extent k showed increasing concentrations at elevated temperatures in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 that were also visible in the field data fig 4 however the sidiss and k concentrations declined slower than other components when temperatures decreased fig 5 and sidiss concentrations measured in the monitoring wells exceeded those observed in the laboratory tests fig 6 the conducted batch tests seem to slightly underestimate concentration changes for silica potassium and thallium substituting potassium in silicates shaw 1952 which is probably related to mineral dissolution of potassium bearing silicates and amorphous silica being the underlying release processes arning et al 2006 m bonte et al 2013b overall ancillary components showed a better agreement between measured and predicted concentrations than the main components ion exchange is the controlling process for most ancillary components m bonte et al 2013b lüders et al 2020 therefore their temperature induced concentration changes are apparently more directly affected by elevated temperatures and relatively less by auxiliary effects such as water mixing mineral precipitation and dissolution however the concentrations of the ancillary components measured in the monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 that were within the predicted concentration ranges to more than 50 from cd to ni in fig 9 were rather in the upper range 50th to 100th percentile of predicted concentrations fig 9 this indicates a slight underestimation of their concentration changes by the conducted batch tests u cu tl nh4 sr and sn showed an accordance between measured and predicted concentrations of less than 50 for the referred monitoring wells fig 9 in contrast to most other component concentrations u cu nh4 and sn were changing erratically rather than gradually over time starting from the baseline monitoring thus the actual effect of elevated temperatures on concentrations of these components as well as their predictability remains uncertain 4 conclusions a short term hot water infiltration field test for simulating the hydrogeochemical effects caused by an initial heating phase of a ht ates system led to temperatures above 70 c near the infiltration well frequent sampling of 17 monitoring wells tracked hydrochemical changes with high spatial and temporal resolution enabling an evaluation of the predictive power of laboratory batch tests conducted with 28 individual sediment samples from the field test site at 10 40 and 70 c in monitoring wells around the hot water infiltration well elevated temperatures caused increased concentrations of no2 k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl u and ch4 changes in other groundwater constituents were either indistinguishable from the concentration range observed during baseline monitoring or from mixing effects of infiltrated and original water o2 npoc nh4 no3 so4 2 na mg2 ca2 fediss mndiss al co ni cu zn sr cd sn pb and tce a direct comparison with the laboratory batch test data identified the following the trend of increasing concentrations with increasing temperature in the field measurements of the aforementioned components except for no2 ch4 and u is as predicted by the laboratory batch tests conversely not all concentration changes expected from the batch tests were observed in the field measurements partly due to superimposition by water mixing in the field the maximal concentrations in field measurements above 55 c were within or below the concentration range in the laboratory batch tests at 70 c for 24 out of 31 components all but npoc tic no3 sidiss co ba and tl furthermore for 26 out of 31 viewed components the concentration ranges in the batch tests at 70 c were larger than the concentration ranges measured in the five monitoring points sampled at temperatures above 55 c for this field test site the concentration changes observed in the laboratory tests were attenuated at the field scale a comparison of field measurements from the three central monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 with predicted concentration ranges based on the temperature induced relative concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests revealed the following overall agreement of field measurements with the predicted concentration ranges is better for components that showed pronounced temperature induced concentration changes related to ion exchange and de sorption processes which is true for most environmentally relevant ancillary groundwater components the conducted batch tests are less suitable for predicting temperature induced concentration changes related to mineral dissolution the accordance of the field measurements with predicted concentration ranges is greatest where the least cooling between the hot water infiltration and the sampling occurred indicating a retarded adaption of concentrations to decreasing temperatures that the maximal temperature induced concentration changes of many ancillary components can be well predicted that the target infiltration temperature of the hot water can be used to estimate maximal expectable concentration changes this procedure for component specific predictions of potential concentration changes induced by elevated temperatures is suitable for components related to ion exchange and de sorption processes in the vicinity of a hot water infiltration thus utilising the maximal expected temperatures allows prediction of maximal expectable concentration changes for most of the environmentally relevant ancillary groundwater components however as temperatures decline with distance to the infiltration well most of the surrounding aquifer will only be exposed to attenuated concentration changes both aspects will play a major role in authorisation procedures from a geochemical point of view successive shifts in the redox state towards stronger reducing conditions and associated concentration changes in redox sensitive components as expected from prolonged high subsurface temperatures and their predictability at the field scale were not investigated here the same applies for cyclic operation apart from the initial heating phase simulating the operating phase of a subsurface heat storage and its induced bio geochemical effects thus both aspects are in focus of consecutive investigations finally predicting the geochemically affected space around ates systems also requires future association of laboratory

19943,despite their potential in heating supply systems thus far high temperature aquifer thermal energy storages ht ates currently lack widespread application reducing the potential risks by improving the predictability of hydrogeochemical processes accelerated or initiated at elevated temperatures might promote the development of this technology therefore we report the results of a short term hot water infiltration field test with subsurface temperatures above 70 c along with associated laboratory batch tests at 10 40 and 70 c for 28 sediment samples to determine their usability for geochemical prediction most groundwater components had lower maximal concentrations and smaller concentration ranges in field samples compared to the batch tests this indicates that the strongest geochemical effects observed in laboratory tests with sufficient site specific sediment samples will likely be attenuated at the field scale a comparison of field measurements with predicted concentration ranges based on temperature induced relative concentration changes from the batch tests revealed that the predictive power was greatest where the hot infiltrated water had cooled least and the strongest geochemical effects occurred the batch test based predictions showed the best accordance with field data for components with significant temperature induced concentration changes

predictability 1 introduction seasonal high temperature aquifer thermal energy storages ht ates in urban areas have the potential to be a key technology in the transformation of the heating sector energy system away from the use of fossil fuels henning and palzer 2012 however thus far the wider application of ates systems with temperatures above 50 c has been hampered by technical financial social political and legal risks fleuchaus et al 2020 one aspect that causes potential technical or legal issues is the various hydrogeochemical processes accelerated or initiated by elevated temperatures of up to 90 c and the induced changes to the flow regime bauer et al 2013 jenne et al 1992 this includes processes associated with operational issues such as i accelerated corrosion andersson 1990 jenne et al 1992 ii the precipitation of carbonates griffioen and appelo 1993 and fe and mn hydr oxides andersson 1990 willemsen 1990 that can cause scaling within heat exchangers pipes and in and around wells iii the formation of a separate gas phase lüders et al 2016 that can block pipes or parts of the near well pore space and iv the dissolution of amorphous silica and silicates at increased temperatures arning et al 2006 m bonte et al 2013b holm et al 1987 that can precipitate when the water is cooled in the surface installations during heat recovery gunnarsson and arnórsson 2005 there are also processes associated with potential changes in groundwater quality such as i the release of dissolved organic carbon doc and associated redox processes bonte et al 2013a brons et

elements and heavy metals relevant for administrative approval lüders et al 2020 previous ht ates field tests installed in depths varying from below 10 to above 200 m below ground surface bgs have mainly focussed only on processes that potentially damage the ates operation itself as well as on technical solutions to prevent these processes andersson 1990 jenne et al 1992 molz et al 1981 opel et al 2014 perlinger et al 1987 ueckert and baumann 2019 initial hydrogeochemical effects with potential environmental consequences relevant for administrative approval bonte et al 2011 hähnlein et al 2013 possemiers et al 2014 and observations of geochemical effects downstream of the infiltration well have not been in focus of ht ates field tests so far furthermore all the aforementioned studies focus either on laboratory investigations or on field observations thus whether laboratory investigations with site material and water can yield reliable predictions regarding temperature dependent initial hydrogeochemical effects at the aquifer scale is largely undetermined therefore this work combines a short term hot water infiltration field test with temperatures of up to 78 c with preceding laboratory batch tests for 28 sediment samples from the field test site essential questions investigated by this approach include which initial component specific temperature dependent geochemical effects observed in the hot water infiltration field test can be predicted by the laboratory investigations and to what extent how does the geochemical heterogeneity of the sediments affect variances in geochemical behaviour at the laboratory and field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 testum field test site the testum field test site is located near wittstock brandenburg germany 53 11 40 n 12 30 18 e on an abandoned airfield subsurface exploration during an earlier co2 injection test on the same site a few metres away peter et al 2012 showed that the shallow subsurface consists of typical northern german glacio fluviatile quaternary sediments with alternating layers of sandy and cohesive sediments of variable thickness based on further drill logs and geophysical investigation with an electric conductivity ec and a hydraulic profiling tool hpt an area featuring a 9 m thick sandy layer 6 15 m bgs overlaid by a 2 3 m thick cohesive layer was chosen for the hot water infiltration test see also heldt et al 2021 keller et al 2021 groundwater head measurements between 2 9 and 3 5 m bgs showed that the sandy layer used for infiltration is confined locally groundwater flowed in west southwest direction with a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 0011 and a mean groundwater flow velocity of 0 09 m d heldt et al 2021 for setting up the test field one 2 extraction and one 2 infiltration

screened at 5 partial 7 5 10 5 13 5 and 17 m bgs were installed with sonic drilling see fig 1 for a map of the field tests monitoring network this resulted in 71 groundwater monitoring points distributed over 17 wells 2 2 laboratory experiments 2 2 1 sediment and water procurement and characterisation before installing the monitoring wells 100 kg of sediment samples from 0 to 18 m bgs were obtained from nine different bore holes at positions u01 u12 c05 c06 c07 d03 d04 d09 and mp002 fig 1 by either macro core or sonic drilling geoprobe systems salina kansas us macro core drilling yields sediment samples with minimal physical and chemical disturbance epa 1997 in contrast sonic drilling can cause elevated temperatures at the drill core interface and thus might potentially affect temperature dependent geochemical behaviour in subsequent laboratory investigations however there were no noticeable deviations in the temperature induced geochemical effects of the different sediment samples depending on the used drilling technique wherefore no further differentiation regarding the drilling technique was made each half metre drill core consisting of on average 1733 g sediment was mixed and split into three parts 1 a 400 g individual sediment sample specific to the respective well location and half metre depth range 2 half of the remaining sediment was mixed to a homogenised composite sample of the infiltration layer and 3 the rest was kept in the drill cores as backup material the individual sediment samples were used to investigate the heterogeneity in hydrogeochemical behaviour at elevated temperatures the homogenised composite sample of the infiltration layer was used for geochemical characterisation with triplicates table 1 and for further laboratory investigations with a higher sediment demand not part of this study all sediment samples were stored under argon atmosphere in refrigerators at 10 c until further use the water used for the laboratory experiments was repeatedly pumped from the extraction well and well 004 fig 1 and stored at 10 c in a refrigerator in gas tight bags pet al pe composite to avoid gas exchange with the atmosphere table 2 sediment samples from the same wells but from the low permeable layers above and below the target aquifer utilised for the hot water infiltration have been investigated in a separate study meier zu beerentrup and dahmke 2021 2 2 2 batch tests batch tests were used to determine the heterogeneity in hydrogeochemical behaviour of individual sediment samples at elevated temperatures and to consider the observed variance for the subsequent predictive calculations section 2 5 due to their low sample volume requirements sediment samples n 28 from the sandy aquifer section into which the hot water was infiltrated 6 15 m bgs were tempered for one week at 60 rpm in a shaking chamber to 10 and 40 c and in a custom build heating chamber on a shaker to 70 c for each of the 84 batches 40 g of sediment and 80 ml of site water were filled into 200 ml hdpe vials sediment samples from c d and u wells with site water from extraction well u00 or 100 ml glass vials sediment samples from mp002 drill core with site water from well 004 in an argon filled glove box table 2 to avoid oxygen intrusion the vials were closed with hdpe screw caps or aluminium crimp caps with butyl septa respectively the potential degassing of co2 while filling the vials cannot be prevented with this procedure to identify concentration changes induced by the vial material blank tests with both vial materials and site water but without sediment were applied at each temperature see table a 3 in the supplementary material due to the high ratio between the concentrations resulting from the releases from the blank vials versus the respective mean concentration increase in the sediment batch tests for sidiss with the glass vials up to 1 31 and non purgeable organic carbon npoc with the hdpe vials up to 0 81 only the data from the sediment batch tests with the other vial material were used for further data evaluation for these two components after one week the vials were reopened and the water was separated from the sediment using 7 µm cellulose round filters and then filled into the analytical vials section 2 4 2 3 short term hot water infiltration field test to identify the geochemical effects of elevated temperatures the initial hydrogeochemical state and natural variations in the target aquifer were characterised in six baseline sampling campaigns conducted between october 2018 and april 2019 224 183 128 93 64 and 28 days before the start of the hot water infiltration fig a 1 over the whole monitoring period from autumn 2018 to summer 2019 the groundwater heads increased by up to 40 cm similarly in all the different monitoring wells thus there are no indications for significant changes in the hydraulic gradient or the groundwater flow direction over time hot water infiltration started on the 23rd of may 2019 and finished on the 29th of may 2019 a submersible pump pumped cold water from extraction well u00 into a cold water buffer tank there the water was covered with argon to avoid oxygen intrusion however concomitant equilibration of co2 between the water phase and the argon coverage may have facilitated subsequent carbonate precipitation at elevated temperatures from the cold water buffer tank the water was pumped through a plate heat exchanger where it was heated to approximately 85 c then into a hot water buffer tank where the hot water could degas to minimise potential tube or well clogging by gas bubbles to eliminate traces of the organic contaminant trichloroethylene tce table 2 fig a 1 the formed gas phase was dissipated over an activated carbon filter before being released from the hot water buffer tank the water flowed by gravity at 14 5 l min into the infiltration well towards the end of the hot water infiltration the infiltration rate decreased to below 1 l min see heldt et al 2021 presumably due to clogging of tubes and the well screen caused by a combination of transported fines from the extraction well precipitates and gas bubbles in total 86 m³ of 75 c hot water was infiltrated over a period of 4 5 days water extraction and infiltration superimposed the natural hydraulic conditions around the respective wells during operation but the induced hydraulic signal faded away within a few hours data not shown subsequently eight sampling campaigns 4 12 15 20 33 48 68 and 104 days after the start of infiltration were conducted to monitor the hydrogeochemical effects in the post hot water infiltration phase in each monitoring campaign water samples were taken from 40 to 70 monitoring points 3 to 5 per well to minimise hydraulic effects of the sampling campaigns groundwater samples from the 2 inch wells were retrieved with low pumping rates of 4 l min by submersible pumps mp1 grundfos gmbh erkrath germany or whale submersible electric galley pump munster simms engineering ltd bangor northern ireland the water samples from the different screened depths in the 2 inch wells 7 8 10 11 and 13 14 m bgs were separated by using packers above and below the pump submerged to the respective monitoring depths the water then flowed through a pvc tube into a mixing cell where probes for the on site parameters see 2 4 were installed to pump groundwater from the cmt wells into the mixing cell 100 ml min peristaltic pumps stainless steel capillaries and viton pumping tubes were utilised which allowed to minimise intrusion of oxygen despite a relatively long residence time in the pumping system in both setups water samples for the analytical vials see 2 4 were taken at a three way valve directly before the mixing cell

field test based on laboratory investigations the concentration changes between the laboratory batch tests at 10 40 and 70 c were used to predict temperature dependent potential concentration changes in the hot water infiltration field test first the component specific relative concentration changes between the batch tests at increased temperatures of 40 and 70 c and the reference batch tests at 10 c were calculated for all 28 sediment samples and plotted against temperature as shown for v in fig a 2 relative changes were chosen over absolute values as they allow for better consideration of different base concentration levels then the 0th 25th 50th 75th and 100th percentile of the 28 component specific relative concentration changes between 10 and 40 c and 40 and 70 c were approximated by linear or exponential regression functions whether linear or exponential regression functions were applied for a component was determined by the higher coefficient of determination for the median concentrations 50th percentile over the whole temperature range from 10 to 40 and 70 c the two temperature ranges were calculated separately to prevent over or underestimations of concentrations around the temperatures actually investigated in the laboratory batch tests while enabling the prediction of concentrations in between to calculate well and depth specific potential concentration changes the corresponding baseline concentrations and temperature measurements completed the equations as shown in eqs a 1 and a 2 this procedure resulted in a component specific potential concentration range calculated from the heterogeneity of the sediment samples investigated in the laboratory batch tests linked with the baseline concentrations and the temperatures measured in the hot water infiltration field test 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical effects in laboratory experiments overall temperature induced geochemical effects in the laboratory tests followed the pattern expected from previous studies for the main groundwater constituents an increase in temperature caused a release of organic carbon brons et al 1991 jesußek et al 2013a silica and potassium arning et al 2006 holm et al 1987 whereas concentrations of inorganic carbon calcium and magnesium decreased griffioen and appelo 1993 fig 2 a despite the elevated npoc concentrations microbial catalysed redox reactions appeared to be limited within the one week sediment water contact time as expected from lag phases of microbial growth mellefont and ross 2003 this resulted in negligible effects on median concentrations of redox sensitive parameters such as nitrate and sulphate also the median concentrations of trace elements and heavy metals mostly behaved as expected from the literature increasing concentrations with increasing temperature were observed for monovalent cations li and tl and those components likely present as oxyanions e g v as se and mo concentrations of divalent cations e g co ni and zn rather decreased m bonte et al 2013b lüders et al 2020 fig 2b unlike afore cited studies concentrations of cu and al increased in several sediment samples at 70 c most of the components which showed elevated concentrations at increased temperatures also demonstrated a greater concentration variation at 40 and even more at 70 c compared to 10 c e g sidiss li v cr as se and sb a similar wider scattering of concentrations at higher temperatures has also been reported by m bonte et al 2013b and lüders et al 2020 taken together the small scale heterogeneity in groundwater chemistry at ambient temperatures observed in the baseline monitoring for the hot water infiltration test fig 4 fig a 1 can be expected to increase when temperatures rise this would result in not only shifted but also wider concentration ranges at elevated temperatures 3 2 effects of the hot water infiltration field test on aquifer hydrochemistry 3 2 1 temporal evolution of induced temperature changes the infiltration of the hot water caused elevated temperatures up to 70 c in close proximity to the infiltration well higher temperatures at the top of the aquifer than at the bottom fig 3 can be attributed to temperature induced vertical convection as shown by coupled numerical simulations heldt et al 2021 with local variations in hydraulic permeability see hpt logs in fig 1 contributing to spatial variations around the first monitoring campaign 4 5 days after the start of the hot water infiltration maximal temperatures of 72 c were recorded at the monitoring points 7 5 m bgs in wells c05 and d01 1 1 5 m away from the infiltration well see fig 1 for positions in monitoring wells c04 c08 d03 d04 and d06 all 3 4 m away from the infiltration well the highest temperatures 30 41 c at 7 5 m bgs were recorded around the second monitoring campaign 12 13 days after infiltration start the monitoring wells further downstream d08 d09 d10 6 5 m away from the infiltration well showed the highest temperatures of 14 15 c around the 5th and 6th monitoring campaigns 48 68 days after the start of the infiltration a more detailed insight into temporal and spatial evolution of temperatures is presented in heldt et al 2021 3 2 2 overview of geochemical effects induced by hot water infiltration to determine the geochemical effects induced by the hot water infiltration the average concentrations including standard deviations in wells around and downstream from the infiltration well were compared for the baseline period and the first first month and second from second month onwards post infiltration periods these average concentrations represent several monitoring wells and campaigns and therefore the effects of a mixture of reached temperatures however increased concentrations of no2 k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl u and ch4 during the post infiltration period s can be attributed to the elevated temperatures as they exceeded the natural variations during baseline monitoring and the potential mixing effects of original and infiltrated water fig 4 for all components apart from no2 and ch4 which were not detected and u which was not significantly affected the trend of increasing concentration with increasing temperature is also apparent in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 conversely not all expected concentration changes apparent in the batch tests e g for co were obvious and distinguishable from water mixing in the field measurements the decreasing cl concentrations and increasing u concentrations in the field measurements fig 4 do not fit the expectations based on the laboratory batch tests fig 2 and cannot be fully explained by water mixing processes between original and infiltrated water and therefore for now must be attributed to an unidentified process beside the quantitatively limited concentration changes of no2 and ch4 15 µmol l there were no indications of an intensification of microbially catalysed redox processes in the field measurements this fits with expectations as elevated temperatures were sustained only for a couple of days and is also supported by the observation of only minor temperature induced changes in the microbial community keller et al 2021 3 2 3 reversibility of concentration changes in the field test in ates systems geochemical reversibility characterises how aquifer hydrogeochemistry affected by elevated temperatures returns to initial conditions when temperatures decrease a around downstream of the hot well during hot water infiltration and the storage period b due to heat extraction between hot water recovery and water re infiltration into the cold well and c after termination of ates operation to investigate how far the geochemical effects of elevated temperatures persist maximal concentrations of k sidiss li v as mo and se that all showed increased concentrations near the infiltration well were observed downstream with increasing distance from the infiltration well tmax 78 c maximal temperatures decreased from 73 to 41 c and down to 15 c at 1 m d01 3 m d03 and 6 5 m d09 from the well respectively similar behaviour was observed for the maximal concentrations of li v as mo and se as they returned to values within or near the geogenic range fig 5 thus the field test data validated the rapid concentration changes with declining temperatures for components which concentration changes are related to temperature dependent ion exchange and de sorption processes e g li v as mo and se fig 5 as has been shown in previous laboratory lüders et al 2020 and modelling bonte et al 2014 studies as expected reversal concentration changes related to mineral dissolution and precipitation sidiss and k were slower in case of longer sustained elevated temperatures induced reductive dissolution of fe and mn hydr oxides may reduce sorption capacity and thus reversibility bonte et al 2013a lüders et al 2020 oxidative dissolution to a relevant extent is unlikely in this field test as the oxygen concentration of the infiltrated water 0 9 mg l fig 4 was below the median oxygen concentrations in all monitored depths in the baseline monitoring fig a 1 which also indicated a rather oxidised state of the sediment however in settings with larger oxygen infiltration also oxidative dissolution reactions might play a role further in a cyclic heat storage operation groundwater constituents released at elevated temperatures will partly also be extracted with the hot water and fixated around the cold well after reinfiltration as modelled by bonte et al 2014 or in potential mineral precipitates e g in the surface installations thus the overall effect on the re distribution of released groundwater constituents is controlled by the interplay of the aforementioned processes and requires further research 3 3 direct comparison of concentrations between the laboratory batch tests and the field test for a primary comparison of concentrations between the field and the laboratory data at high temperatures the data from the batch tests at 70 c and monitoring points sampled at temperatures 55 c were directly compared the comparison of data from monitoring points sampled between 25 and 55 c and associated batch tests at 40 c is in the supplementary information fig a 3 after the five day hot water infiltration five monitoring points all from the central monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 which are within a 1 5 m radius around the infiltration well fit this criterion the maximal concentrations of components in the field samples 55 c were within or below the concentration range of the laboratory batch tests at 70 c for 24 of 31 components all but npoc tic no3 sidiss co ba and tl overall environmentally relevant concentration increases of most ancillary components seemed to be well represented moreover despite the larger temperature range of the field samples 59 72 c the field data concentration range was smaller than the laboratory data concentration range for 26 of 31 components all but npoc co ni ba and tl fig 6 both aspects are plausible as the sediment samples investigated in the batch tests originated from a wider area than the three central monitoring wells fig 1 thus within the central hot zone around the infiltration well the water may have only been in contact with a limited range of sedimentary compositions another possible explanation for this observation may also lie in the flow path of the water from the infiltration until the respective monitoring well the water can encounter sediments of slightly different compositions which potentially counterbalances the strongest effects both explanations indicate that considering a preferably wide variety of individual small scale sediment samples in laboratory tests might serve as a safety buffer for concentrations expectable on the field scale 3 4 comparison of field concentrations with the predicted concentration range from laboratory batch tests with focus on the initial concentration changes caused by the highest temperatures attained in the field test the predictive power of the laboratory batch tests was evaluated temporally by the first monitoring campaign after hot water infiltration and spatially by the three central monitoring wells nearest to the infiltration well c05 c07 and d01 each with three sampled depths overall 33 and 68 of the concentrations of main and ancillary groundwater components measured in these wells respectively were between the 0th and 100th percentile of the predicted concentration range based on the temperature induced concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests fig 7 see fig a 2 for explanation with 43 and 40 of concentrations of main and ancillary components laying below the 50th percentile respectively there appeared to be a slight overall underestimation of concentrations by the laboratory based predictions to determine whether the temperature during monitoring had an effect on the agreement between measured concentrations and the predicted concentration range the comparison between measured and predicted concentrations was broken down to the individual monitoring points of the wells c05 c07 d01 and d03 n 12 including their respective sampling temperatures thereby the overall accordance between measured and predicted concentrations was greatest where the hot infiltrated water had cooled least prior to monitoring fig 8 a the laboratory batch tests yielded the best results in terms of predictive power when the hottest temperature and thus the largest change in concentration occurred suggesting that the target infiltration temperature could be utilised as a basis for predicting the maximal expected temperature induced concentration changes on the on hand maximal expectable concentration changes could be used as input parameters for scenario calculation that estimate the attenuated concentration changes in the wider surroundings as e g shown in lüders et al 2020 on the other hand the maximal expectable concentrations of environmentally relevant groundwater components are important for administrative approval procedures furthermore components with increased concentrations at elevated temperatures k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl and u also had a higher proportion of concentrations above the 100th percentile of predicted concentrations the further temperatures declined fig 8b which implies a retarded adaption of concentrations to decreasing temperatures despite the similar trend for main and ancillary components there is a significant gap in the accordance between these groups fig 8a indicating different behaviour of individual groups of components to address this the underlying data of fig 7 was broken down to the individual groundwater constituents fig 9 from the main groundwater components the measured concentrations of mg2 tic ca2 no3 na k cl so4 2 and sidiss were within the predicted concentration range for less than 50 of the monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 considering the data in figs 2 4 and 6 three distinct groups of these components can be identified for na cl no3 and so4 2 with comparatively small temperature dependent concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 concentration changes due to mixing of infiltrated water fig 4 with residual water from around the infiltration well probably exceeded any potential temperature related concentration changes concentrations of tic ca2 mg2 and sr that were predominantly affected by temperature dependent precipitation of carbonates griffioen and appelo 1993 reddy and nancollas 1976 behave differently to reach the target infiltration temperatures of 75 to 80 c temperatures in the surface installations heat exchanger tubes and tanks must be even higher and reached temperatures between 80 and 90 c this had no impact on geochemical processes that demand sediment water contact though mineral precipitation processes related to elevated temperatures can be affected therefore the higher temperatures before infiltration probably caused stronger carbonate precipitation than expected based on the logged in aquifer temperatures which is not considered in the predicted concentration range calculations concentrations of tic ca2 and mg2 in the extracted water table 2 deviated from the values around the infiltration well in the baseline monitoring fig 4 fig a 1 adding the mixing of the different waters as an additional source of uncertainty sidiss tl and to a lesser extent k showed increasing concentrations at elevated temperatures in the laboratory batch tests fig 2 that were also visible in the field data fig 4 however the sidiss and k concentrations declined slower than other components when temperatures decreased fig 5 and sidiss concentrations measured in the monitoring wells exceeded those observed in the laboratory tests fig 6 the conducted batch tests seem to slightly underestimate concentration changes for silica potassium and thallium substituting potassium in silicates shaw 1952 which is probably related to mineral dissolution of potassium bearing silicates and amorphous silica being the underlying release processes arning et al 2006 m bonte et al 2013b overall ancillary components showed a better agreement between measured and predicted concentrations than the main components ion exchange is the controlling process for most ancillary components m bonte et al 2013b lüders et al 2020 therefore their temperature induced concentration changes are apparently more directly affected by elevated temperatures and relatively less by auxiliary effects such as water mixing mineral precipitation and dissolution however the concentrations of the ancillary components measured in the monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 that were within the predicted concentration ranges to more than 50 from cd to ni in fig 9 were rather in the upper range 50th to 100th percentile of predicted concentrations fig 9 this indicates a slight underestimation of their concentration changes by the conducted batch tests u cu tl nh4 sr and sn showed an accordance between measured and predicted concentrations of less than 50 for the referred monitoring wells fig 9 in contrast to most other component concentrations u cu nh4 and sn were changing erratically rather than gradually over time starting from the baseline monitoring thus the actual effect of elevated temperatures on concentrations of these components as well as their predictability remains uncertain 4 conclusions a short term hot water infiltration field test for simulating the hydrogeochemical effects caused by an initial heating phase of a ht ates system led to temperatures above 70 c near the infiltration well frequent sampling of 17 monitoring wells tracked hydrochemical changes with high spatial and temporal resolution enabling an evaluation of the predictive power of laboratory batch tests conducted with 28 individual sediment samples from the field test site at 10 40 and 70 c in monitoring wells around the hot water infiltration well elevated temperatures caused increased concentrations of no2 k sidiss li v cr as se mo sb ba tl u and ch4 changes in other groundwater constituents were either indistinguishable from the concentration range observed during baseline monitoring or from mixing effects of infiltrated and original water o2 npoc nh4 no3 so4 2 na mg2 ca2 fediss mndiss al co ni cu zn sr cd sn pb and tce a direct comparison with the laboratory batch test data identified the following the trend of increasing concentrations with increasing temperature in the field measurements of the aforementioned components except for no2 ch4 and u is as predicted by the laboratory batch tests conversely not all concentration changes expected from the batch tests were observed in the field measurements partly due to superimposition by water mixing in the field the maximal concentrations in field measurements above 55 c were within or below the concentration range in the laboratory batch tests at 70 c for 24 out of 31 components all but npoc tic no3 sidiss co ba and tl furthermore for 26 out of 31 viewed components the concentration ranges in the batch tests at 70 c were larger than the concentration ranges measured in the five monitoring points sampled at temperatures above 55 c for this field test site the concentration changes observed in the laboratory tests were attenuated at the field scale a comparison of field measurements from the three central monitoring wells c05 c07 and d01 with predicted concentration ranges based on the temperature induced relative concentration changes in the laboratory batch tests revealed the following overall agreement of field measurements with the predicted concentration ranges is better for components that showed pronounced temperature induced concentration changes related to ion exchange and de sorption processes which is true for most environmentally relevant ancillary groundwater components the conducted batch tests are less suitable for predicting temperature induced concentration changes related to mineral dissolution the accordance of the field measurements with predicted concentration ranges is greatest where the least cooling between the hot water infiltration and the sampling occurred indicating a retarded adaption of concentrations to decreasing temperatures that the maximal temperature induced concentration changes of many ancillary components can be well predicted that the target infiltration temperature of the hot water can be used to estimate maximal expectable concentration changes this procedure for component specific predictions of potential concentration changes induced by elevated temperatures is suitable for components related to ion exchange and de sorption processes in the vicinity of a hot water infiltration thus utilising the maximal expected temperatures allows prediction of maximal expectable concentration changes for most of the environmentally relevant ancillary groundwater components however as temperatures decline with distance to the infiltration well most of the surrounding aquifer will only be exposed to attenuated concentration changes both aspects will play a major role in authorisation procedures from a geochemical point of view successive shifts in the redox state towards stronger reducing conditions and associated concentration changes in redox sensitive components as expected from prolonged high subsurface temperatures and their predictability at the field scale were not investigated here the same applies for cyclic operation apart from the initial heating phase simulating the operating phase of a subsurface heat storage and its induced bio geochemical effects thus both aspects are in focus of consecutive investigations finally predicting the geochemically affected space around ates systems also requires future association of laboratory data characterising potentially delayed or incomplete reversibility of heat induced concentration changes with the evolution of temperatures at the field scale funding this study is part of the testum

19944,loss of basic utilities such as drinking water and electricity distribution were sustained for months in the aftermath of hurricane maria s hm landfall in puerto rico pr in september 2017 the goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions this study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following hm across nine drinking water systems dwss in pr and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of hm associated disturbance followed by recovery in addition to monitoring water chemistry the samples were subjected to culture independent targeted and non targeted microbial analysis including quantitative pcr qpcr and genome resolved metagenomics the qpcr results showed that residual disinfectant was the major driver of bacterial concentrations in tap water with marked decrease in concentrations from early to late sampling timepoints while mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any sampling locations and timepoints genetic material from leptospira and legionella pneumophila were transiently detected in a few sampling locations the majority of metagenome assembled genomes mags recovered from these samples were not associated with pathogens and were consistent with bacterial community members routinely detected in dwss further whole metagenome level comparisons between drinking water samples collected in this study with samples from other full scale dws indicated no significant deviation from expected community membership of the drinking water microbiome overall our results suggest that disruptions due to hm did not result in significant and sustained deterioration of biological quality of drinking water at our study sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water quality hurricane maria metagenomics qpcr genome resolved metagenomics introduction a 2015 report on the safe drinking water act violations in puerto rico pr indicated high levels of contaminants such as volatile organic compounds voc total coliform bacteria and disinfection by products dbps impacted around 70 of the islands population nrdc 2017 this report recommended investment in drinking water systems dwss including treatment distribution system upgrade and maintenance and source water protection such investments are also important across the us as the water infrastructure continues to age asce 2017 and water quality violations are being increasingly reported allaire et al 2018 further complicating the issue of providing regulation compliant water while relying on an aging water infrastructure is the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events estrada et al 2015 goodess 2012 in the year 2017 alone hurricanes harvey irma and maria hm caused widespread damages and were categorized as historic billion dollar disasters in the us noaa ncei 2020 the resiliency of dwss during these extreme events is particularly important as lack of access to safe drinking water may result in further detrimental health impacts natural disasters can contaminate source waters impacting proper treatment distribution and ultimately affect consumer health ashbolt 2015 exum et al 2018 previous studies have highlighted water quality degradation associated with extreme weather events like hurricanes schwab et al measured concentrations of fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci in tap and surface waters following hurricane katrina and did not recover any of the bacterial indicators in tap water samples irrespective of chlorine residual concentration schwab et al 2007 a recent study on the impacts of hurricane harvey on water quality from two dwss in texas highlighted that source water quality and water demand and their relationship to water age strongly impacted microbial communities and influenced the time for recovery landsman et al 2019 similarly a amplicon sequencing based study carried out in st thomas post hurricane irma and hm revealed that the microbial community structure in rain cisterns coastal stations and surface runoff waters was dramatically different between sampling sites with fecal indicator bacteria fib detected in cisterns used as household water supply jiang et al 2020 hm classified as a category 4 hurricane impacted 3 million people in pr loss of basic utilities i e water cellular coverage and electricity was associated with remoteness category kishore et al 2018 water services generally recovered quickly in densely populated areas while remote areas either recovered quickly or months later however electricity services took longer to recover irrespective of remoteness category even when water services were restored intermittent water supply was common due to unreliable electrical supply this could potentially degrade water quality via stagnation and loss of disinfectant residual intrusion and backflows bautista de los santos et al 2019 boil advisories and point of use chlorination were in place after water services resumed and were reported by the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa through mid january 2018 exum et al 2018 previously lin et al lin et al 2020 provided insights into metals micropollutants and molecular toxicity of pre and post hm drinking water samples in pr and showed the impact of hm on chemical water quality suggesting that trace metals were potential drivers of cumulative risk from drinking water additionally keenum et al keenum et al 2021 characterized five unregulated small scale dws and one large prasa dws in pr six months after hm the authors used targeted culture and molecular based analyses i e quantitative pcr qpcr 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and demonstrated similar microbial communities and concentrations of opportunistic premises plumbing pathogens oppps compared to those reported in the continental us in our study we also aim to evaluate the microbial water quality in the aftermath of hm however unlike keenum et al keenum et al 2021 we conducted a recurrent sampling campaign beginning in december 2017 spanning nine locations across pr for a duration of a year despite the magnitude of hm in pr there hasn t been a large effort to characterize microbial water quality to date there have been two reports focused on chemical contamination lin et al 2020 warren 2019 and two including this one on microbial composition keenum et al 2021 of dwss on the island these studies are essential to establish relationships sampling infrastructure and methodologies needed to respond to future storms as well as to communicate risk and execute corrective actions to decrease exposure risk and unwanted health outcomes thus our goals were 1 to utilize an extended spatial temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in drinking water microbiome were indicative of disturbance followed by recovery 2 if this disturbance recovery dynamic was associated with presence of potential pathogens 3 whether potential pathogen presence was persistent or transient and finally 4 whether microbial composition of pr drinking water was consistent with or deviated significantly from other drinking water systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water sampling and water quality analyses nine sampling locations were chosen across different geographic locations in pr fig 1 the choice of the sampling locations drinking water systems was based on 1 accessibility and 2 geographic distribution the sites represent locations that were consistently accessible throughout the sampling timeframe in the immediate aftermath of hm s landfall the island s entire power grid was inoperable resulting in potable water distribution losses in all sampling sites and most of the island despite varying degree of damages at the sites e g electricity water distribution road

concentrations were associated with water quality parameters particularly total chlorine concentrations water quality parameters were recorded for each sampling location and timepoint fig 2a table s1 pca analyses was conducted to assess whether water chemistry varied spatially and or temporally nitrogen species were excluded from pca analyses as their concentrations were below detection limit at several locations timepoints and nitrate concentrations also strongly correlated with conductivity pearson s r 0 88 p 0 001 and phosphate concentrations pearson s r 0 47 p 0 001 no clear clustering of samples by location or timepoint was observed despite drinking water samples being obtained from variable source waters fig 2b for instance cay gua and man had higher mean and variable conductivities

timepoints all samples except timepoint 1 in sju had total chlorine concentrations below 3 mg l 1 fig 3b table s1 the negative relationship between bacterial load and chlorine concentration is particularly evident for sju and car where decreasing total chlorine concentration were associated with increased bacterial concentrations relatively stable chlorine concentrations correspond to stable bacterial concentrations and absence of chlorine shows high bacterial concentration respectively fig 3b not surprisingly these results suggest that maintaining chlorine residual is critically important for ensuring low bacterial concentrations which could be particularly challenging due to infrastructure damage from natural disasters some locations did exhibit significant variation in chlorine concentrations between december 2017 and february 2018 e g sju car hat with some of these variations associated with water main breaks e g car in december 2017 3 2 microbial communities and metagenomes of pr samples were similar to those seen in other drinking water systems based on total bacteria qpcr results and comparison to blanks a select number of samples per location were subjected to metagenomic sequencing n 33 fig 2c table s4 the initial three sampling points for all locations were sequenced unless their 16s rrna gene copy numbers were below or equal to their matched controls further any other sampling point 10 fold or higher 16s rrna gene copy numbers than the highest observed in the controls for corresponding timepoint was sequenced as well a total of 1 18 gb raw reads were generated after quality filtering and 1 16 gb reads were not mapped against univec resulting in less than 2 6 of the reads being discarded for the majority of samples n 31 only 2 samples i e hum 1 hum 2 retained less than 92 5 of the raw reads table s4 within sample diversity nd as assessed by nonpareil curves ranged from 15 33 to 19 16 fig 4 a table s5 these indices rely on redundancy of reads in a metagenome to estimate diversity of metagenome with higher nd corresponding to more diverse communities the nd values observed here are consistent with those seen in other chlorinated drinking water systems dai et al 2020 the spread of observed nd values within location was larger for gua hum and hat indicating higher temporal variation in diversity while low variability in nd values at car indicative of low temporal differences kruskal wallis test of nd by location reveal significant differences in the median of at least one of the groups p 0 05 however multiple hypothesis correction with dunn test did not identify any significant pairwise differences significant and positive correlations were observed between nd and ph at agu p 0 05 and nd and do at hum p 0 01 and significant negative correlations between hat diversity and log10 16s rrna ml 1 and cay diversity and nitrate p 0 05 for both locations the median nonpareil estimated sample coverage attributed to sequencing effort across all samples was 90 and the range from the samples 70 to 97 9 there were no time or location specific trends in variable coverage across samples the reads were subsequently assembled and scaffolds identified as potential contamination were removed as outlined in the materials and methods section a summary of statistics for the 9 co assemblies that were generated can be found in table s6 cat was used to annotate true scaffolds i e scaffolds retained post contamination analysis and coverage information allowed us to obtain per sample profiles fig 4b table s7 bacteria generally constituted the largest portion in the samples from sju car gua and cay with a mean relative abundance ra of 96 6 1 72 in contrast scaffolds of eukaryotic origin 18 5 19 5 and unclassified scaffolds 5 62 2 85 constituted a significant proportion of the community in man hat agu may and hum the ra of eukaryotic contigs is not consistent within locations suggesting high temporal variation of the eukaryotic fraction in the systems despite highest eukaryotic contigs ra at timepoint 1 for agu and may and timepoint 2 at hum water quality parameters at these sites had relatively low temporal variation on the other hand man had its highest ra at timepoint three when do and phosphate concentrations were higher than mean values in contrast with other sites with high contribution of eukaryotic contigs man water source is groundwater phosphate concentration is associated with source water type and treatment processes i e corrosion control douterelo et al douterelo et al 2018 compared metagenomic samples from sites with different source waters and saw dominance of bacteria and no significant differences in the ra of eukaryotes moreover inkinen et al inkinen et al 2019 correlated the presence of phosphate concentrations with active eukaryotes in a chlorinated groundwater dws in contrast with surface waters at the hat site the largest eukaryotic ra was seen at timepoint 1 consistent with highest chlorine concentration disinfection is a driver of microbial composition in dws and it likely reduced the contribution of bacterial community in these samples resulting in an observed increase in the ra of eukaryotes we further investigate the eukaryotic component of the microbial communities identified through cat with metaeuk figure s3 table s8 and s9 metaeuk based classification indicated that free living amoeba fla capable of supporting intracellular growth of opportunistic pathogens e g vermamoeba acanthamoeba etc were transiently detected at low ras at car man hat agu may cay and hum figure s4 table s9 waterborne parasites like giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected the coverage of scaffolds classified as bacteria was normalized by rpob gene coverage in the respective samples to assess the bacterial community fig 4c table s10 the proportion of bacterial scaffolds not classified beyond the domain level ranged from 9 20 to 24 80 and patterns were consistent within location similar to previous studies proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the majority of samples ranging from 27 31 to 90 07 with a mean of 64 2 16 6 for all samples actinobacteria and planctomycetes were also detected in all samples actinobacteria is another group that is regularly detected in tap water hull et al 2017 the actinobacterial composition of man hat agu may and cay tend to be higher relative to other locations with an average ra of 9 10 6 95 in these samples a mean 1 21 2 77 in other samples and a global 5 27 6 61 ra planctomycetes is present at a ra greater than 1 in 72 72 of samples but is predominant in car and agu with a mean ra of 13 41 15 08 and 20 58 7 24 respectively compared to a global average of 6 25 8 4 on average 81 2 9 61 of sample cumulative ra was not classified up to genus level the dominant classified genera were bradyrhizobium gemmata gemmatimonas hyphomicrobium methylobacterium mycobacterium novosphingobium pseudorhodoplanes and sphingomonas we further compared the metagenomic assemblies recovered from the nine pr samples to other dws not impacted by natural disasters i e undisturbed table s11 to assess if there were indications of significant deviation that could be attributed to hm there was no clear clustering of metagenomes as shown by pcoa ordination of pairwise mash distances including the nine co assemblies from pr and 52 co assemblies from other dws fig 5 a furthermore there was no statistical difference between pairwise mash distances grouped as pr vs other dws and other dws vs other dws using permutational t tests p 0 3 fig 5b this suggests that the differences in metagenomes between hm impacted and other dwss are similar to those observed between other dwss additionally complete linkage clustering indicated that sju man hat and agu and gua and cay clustered closely both within and between each other car did not cluster directly with another location and may and hum were similar but separate from the rest of the pr locations figure s5a the respective mash distances of early and late samples clustered identically as the previous analyses when leveraging coverage data and cat classification of scaffolds to subset scaffolds pertinent to these categories figure s5b c this indicates that the metagenomes from the samples collected in pr were largely consistent with what would be expected from drinking water samples irrespective of time of collection i e december 2017 or october 2018 3 3 opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens were ubiquitous and detected at low concentrations genera that contain pathogenic species i e legionella leptospira mycobacterium and pseudomonas were further investigated fig 6 a using cat annotations with additional support from kraken and or kaiju while monitoring of indicator organisms and residual chlorine is part of the emergency response in the aftermath of hurricanes patterson and adams 2011 challenges with regulatory compliance were common in pr prior to hm and testing laboratories remained non operational months after the hurricane further there was no systematic effort to monitor the prevalence of oppps e g legionella pseudomonas and ntm heavy rain and flooding can severely impact water sources and as a result distribution systems may increase the prevalence of pathogens in drinking water systems leading to potential health risks previous studies have reported the incidence of waterborne illnesses post hurricanes including diseases with legionella ntm and leptospira as causative agents maness 2019 shukla et al 2018 sutter and sosa pascual 2018 walker 2018 of the potential oppp genera legionella and mycobacterium were detected in most locations while pseudomonas was consistently detected in man hat and hum pathogenic leptospira was only detected in gua there were statistically significant wilcoxon test p 0 05 temporal differences in relative abundances of oppps for legionella in man mycobacterium in hat may gua and hum and pseudomonas in hat we used qpcr to quantify the abundance of legionella spp and mycobacterium spp while also conducting more targeted assays to detect and quantify the abundance of legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogenic species of the leptospira genus fig 6b mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any of the samples the mean concentration for legionella pneumophila legionella spp and mycobacterium spp in the samples was 0 71 7 03 and 1 65 copies ml 1 respectively mycobacterium spp were observed in all locations with a general frequency of detection of 61 11 mycobacterium spp were detected at every sampling timepoint in man gua and cay at very low concentrations 1 17 1 19 copies ml 1 while their concentrations were as high as 10 copies ml 1 at car and only detected in the first three timepoints consistent with metagenomic results legionella spp was widely observed across all sampling locations at a 44 44 frequency of detection with highest concentrations observed in sju car and gua legionella spp concentrations decreased from 5 and 12 copies ml 1 at sju and car respectively to non detects from december 2017 to october 2018 legionella spp thrive in warmer temperatures lesnik et al 2016 such as those in pr interestingly concentrations legionella spp and mycobacterium spp are several orders of magnitude lower that what has been published in literature huang et al 2021 isaac and sherchan 2020 ley et al 2020 liu et al 2019 i e 1 104 copies ml 1 a potential reason for this could be over chlorination in the systems which had been reported in the aftermath of hm brown et al 2018 including in early phase of sampling as this study showed the dota gene assay to target legionella pneumophila revealed low concentrations i e 0 72 0 61 copies ml 1 for sju and gua locations however in sju l pneumophila was detected only in timepoint 5 while being detected at gua at all timepoints this is consistent with observations from other dws where legionella pneumophila was detected at low frequency and low concentrations lu et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the lipl32 gene of pathogenic leptospira was not quantifiable but detected only in gua and at timepoints 1 and 4 i e 3 7 frequency the detection of leptospira at this location was consistent with the detection of the genus leptospira using metagenomics leptospira is not routinely reported in dws apart from the recent study by keenum et al keenum et al 2021 possibly due to the efficacy of routine disinfection practices in the elimination of this pathogen wynwood et al 2014 however its importance has been highlighted in rivers and creeks when used as drinking water without proper treatment particularly in situations of water scarcity such as hurricanes keenum et al 2021 truitt et al 2020 the presence of leptospira in gua is possibly exacerbated by the absence of residual chlorine at this location 3 4 a small fraction of recovered metagenome assembled genomes were associated with pathogens metagenomes were co assembled by location binned and manually refined with anvi o 105 bacterial mags were recovered after dereplication with drep and quality filtering for completeness greater than 50 and percent redundancy lower than 10 we identified one or more 16s rrna in 39 of the mags further we compared the differences in abundances between samples by accounting for mags read recruitment of these 37 of the mags were detected in a quarter or more of the samples fig 7 table s12 the pr mags were shared homology with 4 55 of a recently published jgi mag collection based on ani values ranging from 74 65 to 99 49 jgi mags ecosystem categories represent aquatic 36 75 human 31 31 terrestrial 6 5 built environment 5 03 and wastewater 5 environments in contrast the ecosystem distribution of the pr mags pairwise comparisons with jgi mags was comprised of aquatic 32 49 terrestrial 20 57 built environment 13 64 plants 12 5 and lab enrichment 4 95 habitats the aquatic ecosystem had the largest number of same species representation 20 of pr mags fig 7 with species boundaries level set at 83 cutoff threshold jain et al 2018 and included 2 jgi mags also recovered from dws despite this observation the jgi mag dataset suffers from lack of representation of mags assembled from dws habitats n 7 therefore a complimentary approach was used by mapping metagenomic reads from diverse ecosystems against the mags assembled in this study using the searchsra tool this analysis indicated that the aquatic ecosystem was found to be the top environmental association for 63 8 of our recovered mags the other top ecosystems were terrestrial 21 9 human 13 3 and mammal 1 0 associated environments fig 7 however if we consider the top four environments aquatic ecosystem category is represented in all of our mags there were statistically significant differences anova p 0 001 between the proportion of reads mapping from each ecosystem category mapping to the pr mags the only pairwise comparisons that were not statistically significant were terrestrial vs aquatic tukey s p 0 96 and mammals vs human environments tukey s p 0 06 additionally more than 13 of the aquatic ecosystem metagenomes were associated with dws altogether these analyses show that our mags are widely distributed in the environment but are largely associated with aquatic and dws associated environments the classification of resulting representative mags consisted of 64 8 proteobacteria followed by 14 3 cyanobacteria 12 4 planctomycetota and 3 81 actinobacteriota all of the actinobacteria mags were classified as mycobacterium more than 50 of the mags were not classified to genus level the most abundant genera among the mags included hyphomicrobium n 6 bradyrhizobium n 4 gemmata n 4 mycobacterium n 4 and porphyrobacter n 4 there was no relationship between environmental parameters and mag abundance as assessed by mantel statistic r 0 133 p 0 05 or constrained redundancy analyses three of the four mycobacterium mags were classified up to species level and correspond to mycobacterium gordonae mycobacterium paragordonae and mycobacterium phocaicum all of which have been recovered from drinking water systems previously and are associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals shachor meyouhas et al 2014 m gordonae was more abundant rpkm 2 27 2 77 and frequently detected 58 than m paragordonae rpkm 0 77 0 41 42 detection nevertheless their abundance and frequency of detection was higher than for m phocaicum rpkm 1 8 1 9 15 detection mycobacterium mags were not detected from sju and infrequently detected at car gua and hum a single pseudomonas mag was recovered and classified as pseudomonas alcaligenes this mag was only detected once and at the first timepoint at car hat agu and may at the man location it was detected in the initial and final timepoint and at higher abundance at the final timepoint pseudomonas alcaligenes carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes are considered opportunistic human pathogens and have been identified in previous literature characterizing drinking water systems particularly in chlorinated systems jia et al 2019 ma et al 2019 4 conclusion this study characterized the microbial communities of nine locations in the aftermath of severe hurricanes i e irma and maria in a spatial temporal yearlong survey using targeted and non targeted molecular methods our results highlight that maintaining a disinfectant residual helps manage microbial concentration at the taps yet sampling locations showed significant variation in the earlier timepoints the estimated bacterial concentrations based on 16s rrna gene abundance at the sampling locations were consistent with literature established values characterizing dwss and generally decreased over time additionally members of the microbial community were comparable to those found in other dwss which were not impacted by natural disasters regardless of the ubiquity of some targeted oppps such as legionella spp and mycobacterium spp they were present at low concentrations interestingly pathogenic leptospira was only detected at a single location and its presence could be associated with a lack of disinfectant residual at that site a small fraction of metagenome assembled genomes were associated with potential pathogens and other recovered mags represent previously reported taxa routinely found in drinking water systems altogether the water disruptions i e no water or intermittent supply that were sustained after hm did not have a significant impact on the microbiological quality of

19944,loss of basic utilities such as drinking water and electricity distribution were sustained for months in the aftermath of hurricane maria s hm landfall in puerto rico pr in september 2017 the goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions this study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following hm across nine drinking water systems dwss in pr and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of hm associated disturbance followed by recovery in addition to monitoring water chemistry the samples were subjected to culture independent targeted and non targeted microbial analysis including quantitative pcr qpcr and genome resolved metagenomics the qpcr results showed that residual disinfectant was the major driver of bacterial concentrations in tap water with marked decrease in concentrations from early to late sampling timepoints while mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any sampling locations and timepoints genetic material from leptospira and legionella pneumophila were transiently detected in a few sampling locations the majority of metagenome assembled genomes mags recovered from these samples were not associated with pathogens and were consistent with bacterial community members routinely detected in dwss further whole metagenome level comparisons between drinking water samples collected in this study with samples from other full scale dws indicated no significant deviation from expected community membership of the drinking water microbiome overall our results suggest that disruptions due to hm did not result in significant and sustained deterioration of biological quality of drinking water at our study sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water quality hurricane maria metagenomics qpcr genome resolved metagenomics introduction a 2015 report on the safe drinking water act violations in puerto rico pr indicated high levels of contaminants such as volatile organic compounds voc total coliform bacteria and disinfection by products dbps impacted around 70 of the islands population nrdc 2017 this report recommended investment in drinking water systems dwss including treatment distribution system upgrade and maintenance and source water protection such investments are also important across the us as the water infrastructure continues to age asce 2017 and water quality violations are being increasingly reported allaire et al 2018 further complicating the issue of providing regulation compliant water while relying on an aging water infrastructure is the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events estrada et al 2015 goodess 2012 in the year 2017 alone hurricanes harvey irma and maria hm caused widespread damages and were categorized as historic billion dollar disasters in the us noaa ncei 2020 the resiliency of dwss during these extreme events is particularly important as lack of access to safe drinking water may result in further detrimental health impacts natural disasters can contaminate source waters impacting proper treatment distribution and ultimately affect consumer health ashbolt 2015 exum et al 2018 previous studies have highlighted water quality degradation associated with extreme weather events like hurricanes schwab et al measured concentrations of fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci in tap and surface waters following hurricane katrina and did not recover any of the bacterial indicators in tap water samples irrespective of chlorine residual concentration schwab et al 2007 a recent study on the impacts of hurricane harvey on water quality from two dwss in texas highlighted that source water quality and water demand and their relationship to water age strongly impacted microbial communities and influenced the time for recovery landsman et al 2019 similarly a amplicon sequencing based study carried out in st thomas post hurricane irma and hm revealed that the microbial community structure in rain cisterns coastal stations and surface runoff waters was dramatically different between sampling sites with fecal indicator bacteria fib detected in cisterns used as household water supply jiang et al 2020 hm classified as a category 4 hurricane impacted 3 million people in pr loss of basic utilities i e water cellular coverage and electricity was associated with remoteness category kishore et al 2018 water services generally recovered quickly in densely populated areas while remote areas either recovered quickly or months later however electricity services took longer to recover irrespective of remoteness category even when water services were restored intermittent water supply was common due to unreliable electrical supply this could potentially degrade water quality via stagnation and loss of disinfectant residual intrusion and backflows bautista de los santos et al 2019 boil advisories and point of use chlorination were in place after water services resumed and were reported by the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa through mid january 2018 exum et al 2018 previously lin et al lin et al 2020 provided insights into metals micropollutants and molecular toxicity of pre and post hm drinking water samples in pr and showed the impact of hm on chemical water quality suggesting that trace metals were potential drivers of cumulative risk from drinking water additionally keenum et al keenum et al 2021 characterized five unregulated small scale dws and one large prasa dws in pr six months after hm the authors used targeted culture and molecular based analyses i e quantitative pcr qpcr 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and demonstrated similar microbial communities and concentrations of opportunistic premises plumbing pathogens oppps compared to those reported in the continental us in our study we also aim to evaluate the microbial water quality in the aftermath of hm however unlike keenum et al keenum et al 2021 we conducted a recurrent sampling campaign beginning in december 2017 spanning nine locations across pr for a duration of a year despite the magnitude of hm in pr there hasn t been a large effort to characterize microbial water quality to date there have been two reports focused on chemical contamination lin et al 2020 warren 2019 and two including this one on microbial composition keenum et al 2021 of dwss on the island these studies are essential to establish relationships sampling infrastructure and methodologies needed to respond to future storms as well as to communicate risk and execute corrective actions to decrease exposure risk and unwanted health outcomes thus our goals were 1 to utilize an extended spatial temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in drinking water microbiome were indicative of disturbance followed by recovery 2 if this disturbance recovery dynamic was associated with presence of potential pathogens 3 whether potential pathogen presence was persistent or transient and finally 4 whether microbial composition of pr drinking water was consistent with or deviated significantly from other drinking water systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water sampling and water quality analyses nine sampling locations were chosen across different geographic locations in pr fig 1 the choice of the sampling locations drinking water systems was based on 1 accessibility and 2 geographic distribution the sites represent locations that were consistently accessible throughout the sampling timeframe in the immediate aftermath of hm s landfall the island s entire power grid was inoperable resulting in potable water distribution losses in all sampling sites and most of the island despite varying degree of damages at the sites e g electricity water distribution road accessibility flooding the sites returned to operation in the order of weeks owing to their commercial service capabilities the sites abstraction source was surface waters for sju car hat agu may and hum and groundwater for man gua and cay tap water was flushed for 20 25 min during which time temperature and total chlorine were monitored to ensure stabilization indicating elimination of stagnant

reads pre processing genomic dna from selected samples were sent to university of illinois roy j carver biotechnology center ui rjcbc for library preparation using a low input dna kit nugen cat no 0344nb libraries were loaded into two sp lanes on a novaseq 6000 instrument with an output of 2 150 nt reads the prepared libraries included 33 samples and 3 pooled blanks i e filter blank reagent blank and water blank from all locations the raw reads obtained from ui rjcbc were processed with fastp chen et al 2018 v0 19 7 to remove homopolymer stretches using the following flags trim poly g trim poly x further trimmed reads were mapped with bwa mem li 2013 v0 7 12 against the univec database build 10 0 national center for biotechnology information 2016 to perform vector screening and retained unmapped paired reads subsequently nonpareil rodriguez r et al 2018 v3 303 was used on the quality filtered reads to estimate average community coverage and metagenomic dataset diversity using kmer algorithm with a kmer size of 20 and default parameters 2 5 metagenome assembly and mapping sample reads were co assembled based on each sampling location using metaspades nurk et al 2017 v 3 11 1 with the following flags meta t 16 phred offset 33 m 500 k 21 33 55 77 99 119 and further filtered to a minimum scaffold length of 500 bp reads from samples and controls i e extraction blank filter blank di water blank were mapped to co assemblies using bwa mem an approach similar to dai et al dai et al 2020 was used to remove potential contaminant scaffolds briefly bwa mem with flag f4 and f2 was used to map sample and control reads against co assemblies the bedtools quinlan and hall 2010 genomecov using flags g and d was used to calculate coverage and per base coverage using generated bam files relative abundances ra and normalized coverage deviation ncd were calculated for each scaffold with coverage and per base coverage information respectively scaffolds that were not detected in the blanks or for which sample ra was greater than the blank ra and the sample ncd was less than the blank ncd were considered true scaffolds and were used in downstream analyses all scaffolds that did not meet these criteria were considered contaminant scaffolds and removed from further analyses assembly statistics were obtained from quast gurevich et al 2013 5 0 2 to contextualize the metagenome assemblies with respect to other distribution systems assemblies from other drinking water systems considered unperturbed systems because samples were not associated with

statistical analyses were conducted in r and visualizations generated with ggplot2 wickham 2011 package pca analyses of water quality parameters were performed with centered and scaled data in r base prcomp linear regression models of log10 volume normalized 16s rrna gene copies against water quality parameters were fit using base r lm pearson correlation between log10 volume normalized 16s rrna

permutational hypothesis testing n iterations 10 000 of differences in group means between two groups was performed after up sampling group data to balance observations using upsample from the groupdata2 olsen 2021 package analyses of variance anova was performed with aov and followed up with post hoc tukey kramer testing using tukeyhsd in base r 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial concentrations were associated with water quality parameters particularly total chlorine concentrations water quality parameters were recorded for each sampling location and timepoint fig 2a table s1 pca analyses was conducted to assess whether water chemistry varied spatially and or temporally nitrogen species were excluded from pca analyses as their concentrations were below detection limit at several locations timepoints and nitrate concentrations also strongly correlated with conductivity pearson s r 0 88 p 0 001 and phosphate concentrations pearson s r 0 47 p 0 001 no clear clustering of samples by location or timepoint was observed despite drinking water samples being obtained from variable source waters fig 2b for instance cay gua and man had higher mean and variable conductivities compared to other locations which is consistent with source water type of these locations being groundwater phosphate on the other hand was relatively narrowly distributed across samples and in lower concentration compared to other dw systems gooddy et al 2015 with cay location consistently higher than other pr locations we quantified the abundance of 16s rrna genes in all samples as a measure of bacterial concentrations fig 2c volume normalized 16s rrna gene copies 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 ranged from 6 4 10 2 9 1 104 copies ml 1 independently regressing variables in the pca as descriptors of log10 16s rrna gene copies ml 1 for each location resulted in six significant p 0 05 linear models the goodness of fit for all models was relatively high with an average adjusted r2 of 0 704 0 062 and significant associations between log10 16s rrna ml 1 and do in car ph in hum temperature in car may and gua and toc in agu however regressing parameters against log10 16s rrna ml 1 for all locations only resulted in statistically significant associations with temperature adj r2 0 067 p 0 05 and total chlorine adj r2 0 227 p 0 001 a multiple linear regression model with all water quality parameters as descriptors of log10 16s rrna ml 1 n 51 indicated that total chlorine was the major driver associated with decreasing 16s rrna gene concentrations adj r2 0 28 p 0 001 fig 3 a table s3 chlorine concentrations measured in samples were comparable to those reported in other us studies stanish et al 2016 except for gua where it was either below detection limit bdl or very low for all timepoints all samples except timepoint 1 in sju had total chlorine concentrations below 3 mg l 1 fig 3b table s1 the negative relationship between bacterial load and chlorine concentration is particularly evident for sju and car where decreasing total chlorine concentration were associated with increased bacterial concentrations relatively stable chlorine concentrations correspond to stable bacterial concentrations and absence of chlorine shows high bacterial concentration respectively fig 3b not surprisingly these results suggest that maintaining chlorine residual is critically important for ensuring low bacterial concentrations which could be particularly challenging due to infrastructure damage from natural disasters some locations did exhibit significant variation in chlorine concentrations between december 2017 and february 2018 e g sju car hat with some of these variations associated with water main breaks e g car in december 2017 3 2 microbial communities and metagenomes of pr samples were similar to those seen in other drinking water systems based on total bacteria qpcr results and comparison to blanks a select number of samples per location were subjected to metagenomic sequencing n 33 fig 2c table s4 the initial three sampling points for all locations were sequenced unless their 16s rrna gene copy numbers were below or equal to their matched controls further any other sampling point 10 fold or higher 16s rrna gene copy numbers than the highest observed in the controls for corresponding timepoint was sequenced as well a total of 1 18 gb raw reads were generated after quality filtering and 1 16 gb reads were not mapped against univec resulting in less than 2 6 of the reads being discarded for the majority of samples n 31 only 2 samples i e hum 1 hum 2 retained less than 92 5 of the raw reads table s4 within sample diversity nd as assessed by nonpareil curves ranged from 15 33 to 19 16 fig 4 a table s5 these indices rely on redundancy of reads in a metagenome to estimate diversity of metagenome with higher nd corresponding to more diverse communities the nd values observed here are consistent with those seen in other chlorinated drinking water systems dai et al 2020 the spread of observed nd values within location was larger for gua hum and hat indicating higher temporal variation in diversity while low variability in nd values at car indicative of low temporal differences kruskal wallis test of nd by location reveal significant differences in the median of at least one of the groups p 0 05 however multiple hypothesis correction with dunn test did not identify any significant pairwise differences significant and positive correlations were observed between nd and ph at agu p 0 05 and nd and do at hum p 0 01 and significant negative correlations between hat diversity and log10 16s rrna ml 1 and cay diversity and nitrate p 0 05 for both locations the median nonpareil estimated sample coverage attributed to sequencing effort across all samples was 90 and the range from the samples 70 to 97 9 there were no time or location specific trends in variable coverage across samples the reads were subsequently assembled and scaffolds identified as potential contamination were removed as outlined in the materials and methods section a summary of statistics for the 9 co assemblies that were generated can be found in table s6 cat was used to annotate true scaffolds i e scaffolds retained post contamination analysis and coverage information allowed us to obtain per sample profiles fig 4b table s7 bacteria generally constituted the largest portion in the samples from sju car gua and cay with a mean relative abundance ra of 96 6 1 72 in contrast scaffolds of eukaryotic origin 18 5 19 5 and unclassified scaffolds 5 62 2 85 constituted a significant proportion of the community in man hat agu may and hum the ra of eukaryotic contigs is not consistent within locations suggesting high temporal variation of the eukaryotic fraction in the systems despite highest eukaryotic contigs ra at timepoint 1 for agu and may and timepoint 2 at hum water quality parameters at these sites had relatively low temporal variation on the other hand man had its highest ra at timepoint three when do and phosphate concentrations were higher than mean values in contrast with other sites with high contribution of eukaryotic contigs man water source is groundwater phosphate concentration is associated with source water type and treatment processes i e corrosion control douterelo et al douterelo et al 2018 compared metagenomic samples from sites with different source waters and saw dominance of bacteria and no significant differences in the ra of eukaryotes moreover inkinen et al inkinen et al 2019 correlated the presence of phosphate concentrations with active eukaryotes in a chlorinated groundwater dws in contrast with surface waters at the hat site the largest eukaryotic ra was seen at timepoint 1 consistent with highest chlorine concentration disinfection is a driver of microbial composition in dws and it likely reduced the contribution of bacterial community in these samples resulting in an observed increase in the ra of eukaryotes we further investigate the eukaryotic component of the microbial communities identified through cat with metaeuk figure s3 table s8 and s9 metaeuk based classification indicated that free living amoeba fla capable of supporting intracellular growth of opportunistic pathogens e g vermamoeba acanthamoeba etc were transiently detected at low ras at car man hat agu may cay and hum figure s4 table s9 waterborne parasites like giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected the coverage of scaffolds classified as bacteria was normalized by rpob gene coverage in the respective samples to assess the bacterial community fig 4c table s10 the proportion of bacterial scaffolds not classified beyond the domain level ranged from 9 20 to 24 80 and patterns were consistent within location similar to previous studies proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the majority of samples ranging from 27 31 to 90 07 with a mean of 64 2 16 6 for all samples actinobacteria and planctomycetes were also detected in all samples actinobacteria is another group that is regularly detected in tap water hull et al 2017 the actinobacterial composition of man hat agu may and cay tend to be higher relative to other locations with an average ra of 9 10 6 95 in these samples a mean 1 21 2 77 in other samples and a global 5 27 6 61 ra planctomycetes is present at a ra greater than 1 in 72 72 of samples but is predominant in car and agu with a mean ra of 13 41 15 08 and 20 58 7 24 respectively compared to a global average of 6 25 8 4 on average 81 2 9 61 of sample cumulative ra was not classified up to genus level the dominant classified genera were bradyrhizobium gemmata gemmatimonas hyphomicrobium methylobacterium mycobacterium novosphingobium pseudorhodoplanes and sphingomonas we further compared the metagenomic assemblies recovered from the nine pr samples to other dws not impacted by natural disasters i e undisturbed table s11 to assess if there were indications of significant deviation that could be attributed to hm there was no clear clustering of metagenomes as shown by pcoa ordination of pairwise mash distances including the nine co assemblies from pr and 52 co assemblies from other dws fig 5 a furthermore there was no statistical difference between pairwise mash distances grouped as pr vs other dws and other dws vs other dws using permutational t tests p 0 3 fig 5b this suggests that the differences in metagenomes between hm impacted and other dwss are similar to those observed between other dwss additionally complete linkage clustering indicated that sju man hat and agu and gua and cay clustered closely both within and between each other car did not cluster directly with another location and may and hum were similar but separate from the rest of the pr locations figure s5a the respective mash distances of early and late samples clustered identically as the previous analyses when leveraging coverage data and cat classification of scaffolds to subset scaffolds pertinent to these categories figure s5b c this indicates that the metagenomes from the samples collected in pr were largely consistent with what would be expected from drinking water samples irrespective of time of collection i e december 2017 or october 2018 3 3 opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens were ubiquitous and detected at low concentrations genera that contain pathogenic species i e legionella leptospira mycobacterium and pseudomonas were further investigated fig 6 a using cat annotations with additional support from kraken and or kaiju while monitoring of indicator organisms and residual chlorine is part of the emergency response in the aftermath of hurricanes patterson and adams 2011 challenges with regulatory compliance were common in pr prior to hm and testing laboratories remained non operational months after the hurricane further there was no systematic effort to monitor the prevalence of oppps e g legionella pseudomonas and ntm heavy rain and flooding can severely impact water sources and as a result distribution systems may increase the prevalence of pathogens in drinking water systems leading to potential health risks previous studies have reported the incidence of waterborne illnesses post hurricanes including diseases with legionella ntm and leptospira as causative agents maness 2019 shukla et al 2018 sutter and sosa pascual 2018 walker 2018 of the potential oppp genera legionella and mycobacterium were detected in most locations while pseudomonas was consistently detected in man hat and hum pathogenic leptospira was only detected in gua there were statistically significant wilcoxon test p 0 05 temporal differences in relative abundances of oppps for legionella in man mycobacterium in hat may gua and hum and pseudomonas in hat we used qpcr to quantify the abundance of legionella spp and mycobacterium spp while also conducting more targeted assays to detect and quantify the abundance of legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa and pathogenic species of the leptospira genus fig 6b mycobacterium avium and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any of the samples the mean concentration for legionella pneumophila legionella spp and mycobacterium spp in the samples was 0 71 7 03 and 1 65 copies ml 1 respectively mycobacterium spp were observed in all locations with a general frequency of detection of 61 11 mycobacterium spp were detected at every sampling timepoint in man gua and cay at very low concentrations 1 17 1 19 copies ml 1 while their concentrations were as high as 10 copies ml 1 at car and only detected in the first three timepoints consistent with metagenomic results legionella spp was widely observed across all sampling locations at a 44 44 frequency of detection with highest concentrations observed in sju car and gua legionella spp concentrations decreased from 5 and 12 copies ml 1 at sju and car respectively to non detects from december 2017 to october 2018 legionella spp thrive in warmer temperatures lesnik et al 2016 such as those in pr interestingly concentrations legionella spp and mycobacterium spp are several orders of magnitude lower that what has been published in literature huang et al 2021 isaac and sherchan 2020 ley et al 2020 liu et al 2019 i e 1 104 copies ml 1 a potential reason for this could be over chlorination in the systems which had been reported in the aftermath of hm brown et al 2018 including in early phase of sampling as this study showed the dota gene assay to target legionella pneumophila revealed low concentrations i e 0 72 0 61 copies ml 1 for sju and gua locations however in sju l pneumophila was detected only in timepoint 5 while being detected at gua at all timepoints this is consistent with observations from other dws where legionella pneumophila was detected at low frequency and low concentrations lu et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the lipl32 gene of pathogenic leptospira was not quantifiable but detected only in gua and at timepoints 1 and 4 i e 3 7 frequency the detection of leptospira at this location was consistent with the detection of the genus leptospira using metagenomics leptospira is not routinely reported in dws apart from the recent study by keenum et al keenum et al 2021 possibly due to the efficacy of routine disinfection practices in the elimination of this pathogen wynwood et al 2014 however its importance has been highlighted in rivers and creeks when used as drinking water without proper treatment particularly in situations of water scarcity such as hurricanes keenum et al 2021 truitt et al 2020 the presence of leptospira in gua is possibly exacerbated by the absence of residual chlorine at this location 3 4 a small fraction of recovered metagenome assembled genomes were associated with pathogens metagenomes were co assembled by location binned and manually refined with anvi o 105 bacterial mags were recovered after dereplication with drep and quality filtering for completeness greater than 50 and percent redundancy lower than 10 we identified one or more 16s rrna in 39 of the mags further we compared the differences in abundances between samples by accounting for mags read recruitment of these 37 of the mags were detected in a quarter or more of the samples fig 7 table s12 the pr mags were shared homology with 4 55 of a recently published jgi mag collection based on ani values ranging from 74 65 to 99 49 jgi mags ecosystem categories represent aquatic 36 75 human 31 31 terrestrial 6 5 built environment 5 03 and wastewater 5 environments in contrast the ecosystem distribution of the pr mags pairwise comparisons with jgi mags was comprised of aquatic 32 49 terrestrial 20 57 built environment 13 64 plants 12 5 and lab enrichment 4 95 habitats the aquatic ecosystem had the largest number of same species representation 20 of pr mags fig 7 with species boundaries level set at 83 cutoff threshold jain et al 2018 and included 2 jgi mags also recovered from dws despite this observation the jgi mag dataset suffers from lack of representation of mags assembled from dws habitats n 7 therefore a complimentary approach was used by mapping metagenomic reads from diverse ecosystems against the mags assembled in this study using the searchsra tool this analysis indicated that the aquatic ecosystem was found to be the top environmental association for 63 8 of our recovered mags the other top ecosystems were terrestrial 21 9 human 13 3 and mammal 1 0 associated environments fig 7 however if we consider the top four environments aquatic ecosystem category is represented in all of our mags there were statistically significant differences anova p 0 001 between the proportion of reads mapping from each ecosystem category mapping to the pr mags the only pairwise comparisons that were not statistically significant were terrestrial vs aquatic tukey s p 0 96 and mammals vs human environments tukey s p 0 06 additionally more than 13 of the aquatic ecosystem metagenomes were associated with dws altogether these analyses show that our mags are widely distributed in the environment but are largely associated with aquatic and dws associated environments the classification of resulting representative mags consisted of 64 8 proteobacteria followed by 14 3 cyanobacteria 12 4 planctomycetota and 3 81 actinobacteriota all of the actinobacteria mags were classified as mycobacterium more than 50 of the mags were not classified to genus level the most abundant genera among the mags included hyphomicrobium n 6 bradyrhizobium n 4 gemmata n 4 mycobacterium n 4 and porphyrobacter n 4 there was no relationship between environmental parameters and mag abundance as assessed by mantel statistic r 0 133 p 0 05 or constrained redundancy analyses three of the four mycobacterium mags were classified up to species level and correspond to mycobacterium gordonae mycobacterium paragordonae and mycobacterium phocaicum all of which have been recovered from drinking water systems previously and are associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals shachor meyouhas et al 2014 m gordonae was more abundant rpkm 2 27 2 77 and frequently detected 58 than m paragordonae rpkm 0 77 0 41 42 detection nevertheless their abundance and frequency of detection was higher than for m phocaicum rpkm 1 8 1 9 15 detection mycobacterium mags were not detected from sju and infrequently detected at car gua and hum a single pseudomonas mag was recovered and classified as pseudomonas alcaligenes this mag was only detected once and at the first timepoint at car hat agu and may at the man location it was detected in the initial and final timepoint and at higher abundance at the final timepoint pseudomonas alcaligenes carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes are considered opportunistic human pathogens and have been identified in previous literature characterizing drinking water systems particularly in chlorinated systems jia et al 2019 ma et al 2019 4 conclusion this study characterized the microbial communities of nine locations in the aftermath of severe hurricanes i e irma and maria in a spatial temporal yearlong survey using targeted and non targeted molecular methods our results highlight that maintaining a disinfectant residual helps manage microbial concentration at the taps yet sampling locations showed significant variation in the earlier timepoints the estimated bacterial concentrations based on 16s rrna gene abundance at the sampling locations were consistent with literature established values characterizing dwss and generally decreased over time additionally members of the microbial community were comparable to those found in other dwss which were not impacted by natural disasters regardless of the ubiquity of some targeted oppps such as legionella spp and mycobacterium spp they were present at low concentrations interestingly pathogenic leptospira was only detected at a single location and its presence could be associated with a lack of disinfectant residual at that site a small fraction of metagenome assembled genomes were associated with potential pathogens and other recovered mags represent previously reported taxa routinely found in drinking water systems altogether the water disruptions i e no water or intermittent supply that were sustained after hm did not have a significant impact on the microbiological quality of
