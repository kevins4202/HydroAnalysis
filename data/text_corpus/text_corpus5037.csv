25185,bijar protected area bpa is suffering from land use change and livestock grazing since 1977 the number of main species ovis orientalis gmelini living in bpa has reduced from 2000 to 435 in order to study the wild animal life wal risk of bpa a fuzzy model in geographical information system gis environment and remote sensing was utilized the seven selected input indices for the model were bpa conversion rate natural resource population density population growth rate social status security threat and livelihood status bpa conversion rate was obtained based on landsat 8 satellite images of 2016 and agricultural area maps of bpa villages the weight and fuzzy rules ranges of the sub indices were created based on an expert opinion survey questionnaire developed according to the related literature sub indices were union in vector format in the gis environment to acquire the main indices and they were overly in raster format based on fuzzy membership functions to obtain the wal risk in three levels of high moderate and low results showed that the areas with high risk were i agricultural lands ii lands that underwent use change rangelands to agricultural lands iii areas with a large number of livestock iv areas within the proximity to roads and v areas far from the protected stations from the results it can be concluded that low level of livelihood low number of protective stations and weak protective regulations are the main reasons behind increasing wal risk in bpa keywords gis indices satellite images rangelands questionnaire conversion rate 1 introduction human activity is the main risk for wildlife and has resulted in habitat destruction in the last decades one of the intensifying conversion efforts for protecting both biodiversity and natural areas is through establishing protected areas pas macura et al 2015 pullin et al 2013 pas now cover 14 6 of land surface globally and to some extent they have been able to conserve biodiversity by preventing incompatible land use watson et al 2014 however conversion success in the pas is far from guaranteed due to their small and isolated areas armsworth et al 2011 their little economic potential joppa and pfaff 2009 their poor representation of species e g iojă et al 2010 jackson and gaston 2008 and dynamic threats of their ecosystems araújo et al 2011 additionally increasing human populations in the villages located in pas and settlements along the borders of pas have increased the human wildlife conflict wittemyer et al 2008 young et al 2010 there are some indices that can compromise ecological integrity of pas such as increasing visitation sarmento and berger 2017 land use changes martinuzzi et al 2015 sieber et al 2013 population densities and livelihood status vedeld et al 2012 and hunting pattiselanno and lubis 2014 pattiselanno and lubis 2014 showed that trade was the main reason for hunting mammals and birds in the abun district of tambrauw regency at the bird s head peninsula of papua indonesia they found that meal consumption of the people in their study area mostly contained wild meat wild pig and rusa deer rather than fish animal products vegetables and noodles vedeld et al 2012 explained that income inequality is one of the reasons that aggravate resource use conflict in the mikumi national park tanzania risk assessment of ecosystem is a useful method to show what indices could cause harm to ecosystem many researchers have studied application of risk assessment for the conservation of different ecosystems such as ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in soils tang et al 2017 ecological risk assessment of xenobiotics grechi et al 2016 identification of representative vulnerable fish species for pesticide risk assessment ibrahim et al 2014 and performing quantitative microbial risk assessments whelan et al 2014 comprehensive data on ecological social and economical variables are needed for risk assessment analysis geographical information system gis can be used for analysis of occurrence probability intensity and frequency data of risk types related to economic social and ecological processes recently remote sensing has been utilized as a reliable and inexpensive tool to observe some ecological data such as modeling wetland water quality amanollahi et al 2017 land surface temperature fallahi et al 2018 land use change habitat extent habitat condition species diversity nagendra et al 2013 and track anthropogenic activities and their impacts on biodiversity in marine protected areas kachelriess et al 2014 gis and remote sensing were integrated by dimitriou and zacharias 2010 to identify land use change impact on the riparian area of protected wetland risk assessment is mostly achieved using different models natural phenomena modeling is challenging because ecosystem is a fuzzy system with vague boundaries and some data are difficult to measure spatially in ecological process straskraba and mauersberger 1988 fuzzy logic with boundary imprecision or vagueness has developed as an important method in environment risk modeling sarkar et al 2016 chen et al 2010 mazzorana and fuchs 2010 fuzzy logic model has been applied in investigating pas for different aims such as studying the vulnerability of an ecosystem to fire semeraro et al 2016 measuring the insecurity index of species diaz gomez et al 2013 and increasing the flexibility of protected areas to future climate change prato 2012 sarkar et al 2016 developed a fuzzy model in the gis environment and integrated it with remote sensing for wetland risk assessment they tried to identify the areas with varying intensity of wetland conversion risk within east kolkata wetland area they used remote sensing tool to identify land use change during 2013 and 2014 the eight input indices of fuzzy model were canal proximity population density livelihood status wetlands conversion rate road proximity population growth rate social status and infrastructure status while the output was wetland conversion risk they found that fuzzy based risk assessment model was able to show the different levels of wetland risk zones regarding the mentioned problems of pas risk assessment of these ecosystems seems necessary to take appropriate conservation and management measures the above mentioned studies indicated that no risk assessment has been conducted on pas which may be because pas are often under strict conversion regulations and there is no harmful human activity in these areas however in recent years there have been reports of land use change such as rangelands conversion to agricultural land decreasing number of animal species cross road and decreasing vegetation density in bijar protected area bpa in western iran accordingly the present study was conducted with the aim of wild animal life wal risk assessment of bpa in order to identify areas with various wal risks using remote sensing and fuzzy model 2 method 2 1 study area bpa is located 15 km to the northwest from bijar city in the northeast of kurdistan province fig 1 it is positioned between the geographical longitude 47 25 8 to 47 51 4 east and latitudes 35 59 5 53 to 36 12 9 25 north fig 1 the bpa area is about 31 612 ha approximately half of the area has a slope of less than 12 and the highest and lowest altitudes in the area are 2145 m and 1532 m respectively mammals fish reptiles birds and amphibians are the wildlife species of bpa hosseini et al 2013 studied on diversity and frequency of wildlife in bpa they found that the hyena hyaena hyaena badger meles meles wild boar sus scrofs wild sheep ovis orientalis gmelini jackal canis aureus fox vulpes volpes wolf canis lupus and rabbit lepus capensis were the dominant forms of wildlife in bpa wild sheep ovis orientalis gmelini is the important species of bpa based on the rangelands canopy cover hosseini et al 2013 selected the three secure location including poor good and fair ecological conditions with 29 1 72 and 41 5 canopy cover respectively fig 2 hosseini et al 2013 emphasized that compared with fair ecological conditions good ecological conditions have a higher successional stage but sequentially these conditions are not in climax in iran mostly there is no climax for vegetation and a good ecological condition is the best condition for ranges a poor ecological condition has a lower successional stage and is typically covered with shrubs they described that ephedra major and amygdalus lysioides had the highest canopy cover in the rangelands with a poor ecological condition bromus tomentellus and ferola sp had the highest canopy cover in a good rangelands condition and festuca ovina bromus tomentellus and amygdalus lysioides had the highest canopy cover in rangelands with a fair ecological condition in bpa they found no differences of vegetation diversity species richness and vegetation cover evenness among the three ecological conditions they described that the wildlife richness and wildlife diversity indexes were high in the fair and poor ecological conditions they showed that the wildlife diversity in the rangelands with good and fair ecological conditions were the lowest and highest respectively lack of brushes cover used for camouflage by wildlife species was the main reason of decreasing wildlife diversity in the good area they found that the main reason of the highest frequency of wild sheep and boar in the rangelands with fair ecological condition was the different vegetation types including grasses shrubs and forbs they showed that the rangelands with a poor ecological condition due to high density of shrubs sunny and warm slopes with poor range had higher frequency of wildlife especially for wild sheep compared with that in the good area they described that the high altitude covered by snow in the winter and open area of rangelands were the main reasons of low wild sheep frequency and lack of a permanent river was the main reason of low boar frequency in the rangelands with a good ecological condition for other animal species firouz 2009 showed that brushes were the main habitats of rabbits villages and the area around them were the main habitat of jackals where they found food such as garbage and human food waste valleys and hole of rocks were the main habitat of hyaena where they could hide and follow the predators to scavenge their hunting 2 2 selection and generation of risk assessment indicators risk assessment indicators were obtained based on the available literature and an expert opinion survey questionnaire the questionnaire was distributed in two stages among experienced experts at the environmental protected agency of kurdistan province and professors at university of kurdistan the first phase involved endorsement of the indicators while in the second phase the final indicators were weighted based on their impact on wal risk consequently seven indices were selected namely bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate livelihood status natural resource security threats and social status effect of dust storms conversion over bpa species and biodiversity could not be estimated using the current data moreover access to facilities such as schools telephone and drinking water in the study area were the same and sources creating pollution such as cement plants landfills and fish breeding pools were far away from bpa therefore these factors had no effect on the wal risk in bpa and were not considered in the study table 1 shows the weight values of the selected indicators for risk assessment of wal in bpa as table 1 shows the highest weight values 0 27 were obtained for bpa conservation rate and security threat indicators the lowest weight values 0 06 were acquired for population indicators that is population density and population growth rate indicators there were no significant changes for the weight values of population indicators and social status to develop a fuzzy model for wal risk assessment all the data and layers should be raster based sub indices including arable land unemployment rate livestock literacy rate and population density and growth rate were converted to raster based images using inverse distant weight idw method for all layers a cell size of 30 m was selected one of the assumptions of idw is that each entry point should have a local impact that decreases with distance this weighting method eq 1 is smooth comprehensible and relatively precise in a wide range of conditions 1 p i j 1 g p j d i j n j 1 g 1 d i j n where pi is the property at location i pj is the property at measured location j dij is the distance from i to j g is the number of measured location and n is the inverse distance weighting power all the indices in the fuzzy model were standardized in the fuzzy model for all indices a trapezoidal membership function was used with three sub regions of high moderate and low in a gis environment 2 2 1 conversion rate of bpa land use change of pas such as deforestation urbanization and agricultural expansion reduce the available habitats and cause decline in the biodiversity of pas parks and harcourt 2002 fischer et al 2006 fleishman et al 2011 davis and hansen 2011 sieber et al 2013 martinuzzi et al 2015 the study area consisted of both rangelands and agricultural lands a part of the agricultural lands had been degraded these lands used to be rangelands in the past remote sensing was used to measure the land use change in the study area in this region rain fed farming method is exploited in which the land lies fallow for a year and is farmed in the following year so to identify the agricultural lands the image of operational land imager oli sensor of the landsat 8 for 9 june 2016 was utilized three bands of image consisting of bands 6 5 and 4 were combined to make false composition amanollahi et al 2016 the supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was employed for the classification of land use into two categories namely agriculture and rangelands the kappa index was 86 3 sun et al 2009 agricultural lands and land use change of rangelands to agricultural lands were recognized using comparison results of image classification and agricultural lands map of study area provided by natural resource and watershed organization of kurdistan province the impact range of cultivated land agricultural lands and degraded rangelands on wal was measured with a 100 meter buffer the values obtained indicate that the effect of agricultural lands and degraded rangelands on the protected areas was 0 15 and 0 27 respectively the reason for the higher value of degraded rangelands is that human agriculture has been going on for ages causing minimal damage to this area with human beings and wal co existing peacefully together however the wal territory has diminished which has increased the risk for wal the rangelands of the region are also faced with different risks in terms of their elevations 1532 2140 m these rangelands are divided into two categories of below and over 1800 m with slopes also divided into two categories of below and over 15 agriculture is practiced in the region with an altitude of below 1800 m but rangelands with altitudes of above 1800 m with any slope range are faced with lower risks for their wal additionally rangelands in elevations below 1800 m with slopes of below 15 and over 15 indicate values of 0 1 and 0 08 respectively due to the higher possibility of rangelands with lower slopes to be converted to agricultural lands to obtain the index of conversion rate of bpa a combination of 3 layers of agricultural lands rangelands and degraded rangelands was used after applying the weights the three layers were overlaid using union operations in a gis environment in order to define the membership function of bpa conversion rate impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range 0 0 1 was regarded as low 0 09 0 23 as moderate and 0 21 0 27 as high 2 2 2 natural resource natural resources such as rangelands canopy cover spring and different types of vegetation including forbs shrubs and grasses have effect on wildlife risk daniel et al 1993 clementh 1993 smith et al 1996 al khalifa et al 2012 the composite indices of the natural resources impact on wal were calculated based on the sub indices of land cover and springs eq 2 2 n r w n r w l c w s where nr is the composite index of the natural resources wnr is the weight of the composite index of natural resources 0 15 and wlc and ws are the sub indices of land cover and springs required for wal respectively the water required for wal is provided by the springs in the area in order to investigate their effect buffers of 1 3 and 5 km around each of them were used they were given weights of 0 1375 0 275 and 0 55 respectively one of the objectives of the study was to determine the sub index of land cover density the weights of 0 45 0 225 and 0 1125 were given to low density semi coniferous and dense rangelands respectively finally all weights of the sub indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 15 the scale of the index ranged between 0 and 0 15 which would indicate the status of the natural resources in the region to define the membership function of the natural resources impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range from 0 to 0 058 was considered low 0 054 to 0 108 moderate and 0 088 to 0 15 high 2 2 3 population density high population growth rate around the pas have negative effect on wildlife biodiversity wittemyer et al 2008 population density of bpa was obtained from the population and surface area in hectare based on the census of 2015 eq 3 population data were collected from the governorate of kurdistan province population density was plotted on a map the idw method was used to obtain a raster based map 3 population density population size surface area the map obtained from the interpolation method was divided into three classes the weights of 0 06 0 03 and 0 015 were allocated to high moderate and low density in the unit of area respectively the index weight varied from 0 015 to 0 06 to define the membership function of population density impact on the wal in the fuzzy domain the low level was defined from 0 015 to 0 018 the moderate level from 0 006 to 0 036 and the high level from 0 024 to 0 06 2 2 4 population growth rate high population density around the pas decreased wildlife biodiversity young et al 2010 the population growth rate of bpa was derived from birth and mortality data from the population census in 2015 eq 4 information related to the number of births and deaths was obtained from the bijar general health center based on these data a raster based map was created using idw 4 population growth rate number of births b number of deaths d population size p x 100 the obtained map of the interpolation method was divided into three classes the weights of 0 06 0 03 and 0 015 were assigned to high moderate and low growth rates respectively the index weight varied from 0 015 to 0 06 to define the membership function of population growth rate impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range of 0 015 0 01 was considered low 0 003 0 033 moderate and 0 018 0 06 high 2 2 5 livelihood state low livelihood status was found by vedeld et al 2012 as one of the reasons of human wildlife conflict the composite index of livelihood state of bpa was calculated using the sub indices of agricultural land per capita unemployment rate and livestock respectively eq 5 5 l s w l s w c a w u r w l where ls is the composite index of livelihood status wls is the weight of the composite livelihood index 0 11 wca wur and wl are the weights given to the sub indices of agricultural land per capita unemployment rate and livestock in relation to livelihood handicrafts and the use of rangeland sub products were also investigated but since the people in this region are not dependent on this index these variables were excluded the first sub index was agricultural land per capita which was obtained from the following equation eq 6 6 agricultural land per capita surface area of agricultural land population size agricultural land per capita is derived from the division of the area of the region into square meters by region then the idw method was used to obtain the raster map the map was ranked in 3 classes the weights were 0 35 0 175 and 0 0875 respectively based on the maximum average and minimum per capita respectively agricultural land per capita was derived by dividing the surface area of the region in square meters m2 into the population size then the idw method was used to obtain a raster based map the map was categorized into 3 parts the weights of 0 35 0 175 and 0 0875 were assigned to high moderate and low categories of agricultural land per capita respectively the sub index of unemployment rate was obtained by the following equation eq 7 7 unemployment rate employed unemployed unemployed 100 information about this sub index was obtained from the provincial governorate the idw method was used to obtain an unemployment map the map was categorized into three parts which were obtained from weighting 0 28 as high 0 14 as moderate and 0 07 as low unemployment rates after collecting data on the number of livestock from the natural resources bureau of kurdistan province the idw method was used to obtain the sub index of livestock the map was divided into three categories with weights of 0 37 0 185 and 0 0925 assigned to high moderate and low rates of livestock respectively finally all weights of the sub indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 11 the scale of livelihood index ranged from 0 007 to 0 0946 indicating the livelihood of the region to define membership function of livelihood state impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range of 0 007 0 056 was regarded as high 0 051 0 074 as moderate and 0 07 0 0946 as low 2 2 6 social status sarkar et al 2016 used the indicator of social status for risk assessment of wetland area vodouhe et al 2010 showed that the educational level literacy rate has a positive effect on the behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within pendjari national park in order to obtain the social status index of bpa the sub indices of literacy rate the dependence of rural construction on natural resources and also the dependence on nature for fuel supplies were investigated inasmuch as this region is not dependent on natural resources for fuel and construction the two sub indices were eliminated and social status index only consisted of literacy rate information about literacy rate was taken from the provincial governorate of kurdistan based on the 2015 census this sub index was obtained using the following equation eq 8 8 literacy rate literate population population size of 6 year olds and above 100 the data were keyed in layers to gis software layer and transformed to raster based layers using the idw method the results were classified into three categories and weights of 0 08 0 04 and 0 02 were allocated to high medium and low rates respectively the index scale varied from 0 02 to 0 08 indicating the social status of the people in the area to define the membership function of social status impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range 0 02 0 043 was considered to be high 0 032 0 065 to be moderate and 0 054 0 08 to be low 2 2 7 security threat the composite indices of security threat in bpa were based on sub indices of distance from residential areas guette et al 2018 population centers protective station distance proximity to roads donazar et al 2018 barber et al 2014 gas transmission line previous pastoral fires aretano et al 2015 moreira et al 2009 and mines in the region eq 9 guette et al 2018 concluded that human activity around the protected area leads to isolation of more and more portions of this area parsons et al 2016 showed allowing hunting in protected areas increased wildlife risk donazar et al 2018 found that high traffic intensity of roads in protected areas reduced richness of wild animals barber et al 2014 reported that increased proximity to transportation networks led to deforestation and increased the risk of wildlife in protected area aretano et al 2015 and moreira et al 2009 showed that uncontrolled hunting of animals for their fir can destroy natural ecosystem 9 s t w s t w v w p w r w g w f w e where st is the composite index of security threat wst is the weight of the composite index of security threat 0 27 wv is the weight of the distance from residential areas and population centers wp is the weight of the sub index of protective stations distance wr is the weight of the sub index of proximity to roads wg is the weight of the gas transmission line wf is the weight of the pastoral fires and we is the weight of the mines the histories of hunting and diseases were also investigated no considerable hunting of animals was recorded in this region moreover timely vaccination prevented the people in the region from mortality due to illnesses the prevalent disease in the region was foot and mouth disease that had been caused by domestic animals and had timely been controlled and prevented from transmission to evaluate the effect of all the sub indices of this layer they were buffered and then given weights for the sub indices of distance from residential districts and population centers village distance 2 and 3 km buffers were used with weights of 0 34 and 0 17 respectively the sub index of protective post distance was investigated using 3 and 5 km buffers with weights of 0 276 and 0 138 negative weights were given due to the fact that other sub indices could have an additional effect on risk but protective post distance is a positive factor and has a negative effect on risk the next sub index was the road distance which is obtained from 1 and 3 km buffers around the roads weights of 0 352 and 0 176 respectively were given to them in the southwest of the region a gas transmission line crossed the area whose effect on risk was measured using 200 and 500 meter buffers with weights of 0 153 and 0 0765 based on experts recommendation in addition the transmission line consisted of a station on the pipeline but because it was located outside the area it was not taken into account another sub index of security is the outbreak of pastoral fires for obtaining the data related to rangeland fires between 2011 and 2016 landsat tm satellite imagery was used for 2011 while oli was used for 2013 onward the false color combination of 5 4 and 3 was created for tm sensor and 6 5 and 4 for oli sensor images in envi software version 4 8 and the fire areas were digitized in the gis environment in these color combinations fire is indicated by purple color the burned areas were weighed with 0 115 whereas other areas were indicated by 0 mines are another sub index of security the effect of the region s mines on risk was estimated using a buffer of 3 and 5 km 0 2 and 0 1 wt in the end the weights of all the indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 27 the security threat index varied from 0 079 to 0 186 which indicated the security situation in the region in order to define the membership function of security threat impact on wal the index was considered in the fuzzy domain of 0 079 to 0 04 low 0 039 0 1 moderate and 0 091 to 0 186 high 2 3 fuzzy inference system fuzzy inference system fis which is also referred to as fuzzy expert system or fuzzy rule based system is a well established and efficient instrument for simulating systems and using model inputs for drawing inferences fuzzy mamdani method is a well known fuzzy inference technique that is frequently used by researchers yanar and akyurek 2003 it offers a useful and functional technique for simulating human knowledge and experience in the process of making decisions or classifying information mamdani 1977 another model used for risk assessment and habitat suitability is machine learning model garzon et al 2006 fuzzy logic modeling has superiority over machine learning model owing to its capability to transmit uncertainty and to model imprecise and qualitative data unexplained behavior of the network and no specific rule for determining the model structure are additional shortcomings of machine learning model fis includes four main stages bojadziev and bojadziev 2007 sami et al 2014 1 fuzzification the stage involves using a membership grade or a value between 0 and 1 to transform data into a fuzzy set which is a classified group labeled with variables such as high good and near 2 rule evaluation at this stage each rule is defined by combining the membership values by three main operators of and or and not 3 inference of results this stage involves producing qualified outcomes based on the weight or strength of the rules 4 defuzzification at this stage the outcomes which are qualified are aggregated in order to generate crisp output center of maximum com center of area coa and mean of maximum mom include some of defuzzification methods which are frequently applied mamdani method was used in the current study following this method the researchers computed the output by using the max min relational composition the trapezoidal membership functions of indices are shown in fig 3 the negative impact of the indices including bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate and security threat on wal risk and the positive impact of the indices including natural resource social status and livelihood status suggest that regions with high and moderate bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate and security threat and low rate of natural resource social status and livelihood status are more likely to increase the wal risk in bpa the rules for mapping the area with high risk were constructed based on the above description the regions with high and moderate bpa conversion rate population density and the regions with moderate population growth rate social status and security threat and the regions with low and moderate rate of natural resource and livelihood status have a moderate wal risk in bpa the regions with low bpa conversion rate population density security threat population growth rate and the regions with high rate of social status natural resource and livelihood status have a low wal risk in bpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 conversion rate of bpa the land use map of bpa based on classification of landsat 8 image on 9 june 2016 is shown in fig 4 rangelands with 12 782 3 ha was obtained higher values among the other land use areas table 2 rangelands with elevations of below 1800 m and slopes of below 15 were 2943 6 ha that had higher potential to convert to agricultural land compared with the other rangelands of bpa fig 4 land use change from rangelands to agricultural lands was 5771 05 ha table 2 in bpa it showed that more than 18 of bpa was degraded by human activity which increased the wal risk in the study area the number of the main species ovis orientalis gmelini living in bpa has reduced from 2000 to 435 since 1977 most of pa areas are located in high elevations with high slope ranges and far from the population center and road crossing mas 2005 joppa and pfaff 2009 however there are a lot of villages in bpa and only 20 of its area is higher than 1800 m which may be the reason for high rates of land use change in this area mekonen et al 2017 showed that land use change for agriculture activity and development of population centers decrease natural areas and cause extinction of species of wildlife that use these areas as their habitats de fries et al 2005 described that the habitat fragmentation and its loss around the pas increase the isolation of pas and human activity impacts in the pas kiboro and kiboro 2016 explained that illegal hunt destruction of habitat death from famine and hunger are factors affecting wildlife population 3 2 natural resource status of bpa the effect of natural resources on wal in bpa is shown in fig 5 a natural resource sub indices are vegetation cover density and springs that have a downside effect on wal risk besides its nutritional value vegetation cover is important for wildlife for providing shelter as fig 5a shows the high positive impact of natural resource index on wal was observed in the central and northern parts of bpa which are rangelands in recent years the increase in livestock has contributed to the utilization of natural resources using rangelands for grazing livestock and using springs for their drinking which have increased the pressure on wal of bpa woodroffe et al 2005 and dowie 2011 showed that the conflict between human activity and wildlife is one of the most challenging issues for wildlife conservation around the world peterson et al 2010 and white and ward 2011 describe that increasing human activity leads to rivalry between people and wildlife over shared resources including crop raiding livestock predation and property damage which can finally result in killing wildlife 3 3 security threat status of bpa the highest security level is around the protective stations there are four protective stations in bpa and the more the distance from them the less the security level thus the highest security threat impact is observed in the northern western and south western parts of bpa fig 5b one of the main sub indices of security threat is road crossing from bpa developing countries such as iran need to develop transport infrastructure for the development of mineral and energy resources new road network is often created in the wildlife corridors migration routes and seasonal movement pattern of wildlife laurance et al 2009 laurance and balmford 2013 roads have a major impact on wildlife mortality groot bruinderink and hazebroek 1996 wild animals migration routes are blocked by these roads and their infrastructure wilcove 2008 in addition roads affect the genetics physiology behavior abundance and dynamics of wildlife population benitez lopez et al 2010 distribution of invasive and alien species along the road clements et al 2014 and habitat fragmentation kang et al 2016 spellerberg and morrison 1998 3 4 livelihood status of bpa the sub indices of livelihood index which are agricultural lands per capita unemployment rate and livestock had an incremental effect on wal risk in bpa farmland use and grazing livestock are the most common ways in which people use bpa these people have no other source of income high unemployment rate and high population of livestock in the study area caused a high pressure on the wal therefore except some of the central and northern parts in most parts of the study area wildlife is affected by the livelihood fig 5c varying definitions of environmental security are available but what most of them share is whether people have enough food water and natural resources to sustain gore et al 2016 protective activities can also undermine livelihoods the role of pas as a means of controlling resources can be a direct cause of social instability which sometimes leads to conflict hammill 2006 described that for rural communities the creation of a pa often means limited access to livelihood or even compulsory displacement that can undermine economic security sarkar et al 2016 showed that the high level of risk in wetland areas is due to lack of livelihood sustainability status of residents 3 5 social status of bpa results of social index are shown in fig 5d social status had the lowest impact on wal in the central and north western areas whereas it had a highly negative impact on wal in the other parts fig 5d the low level of literacy among the population can increase the negative impact on wal such as degradation of rangelands to agricultural lands and value of existing wildlife in bpa increasing the literacy rate indicates better access to school amenities and better socio economic situation increase in the participation of marginalized residents in pas management reduced conflict between people and wal and change in the lifestyles of people who are not directly dependent on the resources 3 6 population density rate in the bpa as shown in fig 5e except some eastern parts of the study area population density had a low impact on the other areas that is the result of the decrease in population density in bpa fig 5e this result is not consistent with that of a similar study by masanja 2014 who showed that increasing human population caused increasing hunting of wildlife increasing the use of natural resources and increasing the negative impact on the ecosystem it seem people have migrated to cities because of the lack of sufficient facilities in the villages around and in bpa but due to lack of proper jobs in the cities they still hold on to their farming and livestock 3 7 population growth status of bpa the highest population growth rate impact was acquired for the western parts of the study area as shown in fig 5f the other parts are under moderate and low pressure of population growth rate this result is not consistent with that of cincotta et al 2000 who described that population growth is one of the major issues for management of pas and has led to increased use of natural resources bilsborrow 2002 showed that population growth causes conversion of rangelands into agricultural land which destroys ecosystem and natural habitats as described in section 3 6 lack of sufficient facilities in bpa villages is the main reason that people leave the area 3 8 risk zone map of bpa categorization of risk zones of bpa is shown in fig 6 central to northern north eastern and south western parts as well as some areas in the eastern strait were the areas with the highest risk central to southern north eastern and some parts in the eastern strait were the areas with the lowest risk moderate risk areas were small and only observed in the west and south east the periphery of the area experienced the highest risk as it was where the agricultural land rural areas large numbers of livestock and road crossing abound and as this area was far from protective stations in bpa there is an overgrazing of livestock in the rangelands which caused a reduction in the canopy cover of rangelands in a short period on the other hand limiting the access of local communities to the natural resources of pas that play an important role in their livelihood may help to preserve biodiversity in the short term but may not be able to sustain in the long term andrade and rhodes 2012 4 conclusion although it is very difficult to measure the exact effect of human activities on the wal risk our fuzzy risk assessment model mapped the various levels of wal risk in bpa results of this study demonstrated that agricultural and changing rangelands to agricultural area extremely increase wal risk in bpa additionally the results indicate that land use change can continue despite the decline of human population it may be due to low level of livelihood in the study area that encourages the farmers to make more income by changing the rangelands to agricultural areas thus our study provides evidence to support that decreasing human population does not decrease the human pressures on wal risk in iran illegal degradation of rangelands and changing them to agricultural areas have been a serious problem and conservation measures have proved insufficient to deter it rangeland areas have continued to decline since the rangelands nationalization law was promulgated in 1963 based on this law the management of rangelands was transferred from private to governmental agencies as the human activities are dynamic any changes in them such as road construction and rangeland degradation within or near bpa can affect the risk level in it thus there is need to re evaluate the model and indicators to acquire the accurate result from time to time the wal risk model based on fuzzy approach developed in this study provides an opportunity to identify the zones with different levels of the wal risk and can be applied to other pas for the risk estimation finally it seems essential to increase the number of protective stations while livelihood status of human population is needed to decrease the wal risk in bpa acknowledgements we thankdr vahid nimehchisalem from the department of english faculty of

25185,bijar protected area bpa is suffering from land use change and livestock grazing since 1977 the number of main species ovis orientalis gmelini living in bpa has reduced from 2000 to 435 in order to study the wild animal life wal risk of bpa a fuzzy model in geographical information system gis environment and remote sensing was utilized the seven selected input indices for the model were bpa conversion rate natural resource population density population growth rate social status security threat and livelihood status bpa conversion rate was obtained based on landsat 8 satellite images of 2016 and agricultural area maps of bpa villages the weight and fuzzy rules ranges of the sub indices were created based on an expert opinion survey questionnaire developed according to the related literature sub indices were union in vector format in the gis environment to acquire the main indices and they were overly in raster format based on fuzzy membership functions to obtain the wal risk in three levels of high moderate and low results showed that the areas with high risk were i agricultural lands ii lands that underwent use change rangelands to agricultural lands iii areas with a large number of livestock iv areas within the proximity to roads and v areas far from the protected stations from the results it can be concluded that low level of livelihood low number of protective stations and weak protective regulations are the main reasons behind increasing wal risk in bpa keywords gis indices satellite images rangelands questionnaire conversion rate 1 introduction human activity is the main risk for wildlife and has resulted in habitat destruction in the last decades one of the intensifying conversion efforts for protecting both biodiversity and natural areas is through establishing protected areas pas macura et al 2015 pullin et al 2013 pas now cover 14 6 of land surface globally and to some extent they have been able to conserve biodiversity by preventing incompatible land use watson et al 2014 however conversion success in the pas is far from guaranteed due to their small and isolated areas armsworth et al 2011 their little economic potential joppa and pfaff 2009 their poor representation of species e g iojă et al 2010 jackson and gaston 2008 and dynamic threats of their ecosystems araújo et al 2011 additionally increasing human populations in the villages located in pas and settlements along the borders of pas have increased the human wildlife conflict wittemyer et al 2008 young et al 2010 there are some indices that can compromise ecological integrity of pas such as increasing visitation sarmento and berger 2017 land use changes martinuzzi et al 2015 sieber et al 2013 population densities and livelihood status vedeld et al 2012 and hunting pattiselanno and lubis 2014 pattiselanno and lubis 2014 showed that trade was the main reason for hunting mammals and birds in the abun district of tambrauw regency at the bird s head peninsula of papua indonesia they found that meal consumption of the people in their study area mostly contained wild meat wild pig and rusa deer rather than fish animal products vegetables and noodles vedeld et al 2012 explained that income inequality is one of the reasons that aggravate resource use conflict in the mikumi national park tanzania risk assessment of ecosystem is a useful method to show what indices could cause harm to ecosystem many researchers have studied application of risk assessment for the conservation of different ecosystems such as ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in soils tang et al 2017 ecological risk assessment of xenobiotics grechi et al 2016 identification of representative vulnerable fish species for pesticide risk assessment ibrahim et al 2014 and performing quantitative microbial risk assessments whelan et al 2014 comprehensive data on ecological social and economical variables are needed for risk assessment analysis geographical information system gis can be used for analysis of occurrence probability intensity and frequency data of risk types related to economic social and ecological processes recently remote sensing has been utilized as a reliable and inexpensive tool to observe some ecological data such as modeling wetland water quality amanollahi et al 2017 land surface temperature fallahi et al 2018 land use change habitat extent habitat condition species diversity nagendra et al 2013 and track anthropogenic activities and their impacts on biodiversity in marine protected areas kachelriess et al 2014 gis and remote sensing were integrated by dimitriou and zacharias 2010 to identify land use change impact on the riparian area of protected wetland risk assessment is mostly achieved using different models natural phenomena modeling is challenging because ecosystem is a fuzzy system with vague boundaries and some data are difficult to measure spatially in ecological process straskraba and mauersberger 1988 fuzzy logic with boundary imprecision or vagueness has developed as an important method in environment risk modeling sarkar et al 2016 chen et al 2010 mazzorana and fuchs 2010 fuzzy logic model has been applied in investigating pas for different aims such as studying the vulnerability of an ecosystem to fire semeraro et al 2016 measuring the insecurity index of species diaz gomez et al 2013 and increasing the flexibility of protected areas to future climate change prato 2012 sarkar et al 2016 developed a fuzzy model in the gis environment and integrated it with remote sensing for wetland risk assessment they tried to identify the areas with varying intensity of wetland conversion risk within east kolkata wetland area they used remote sensing tool to identify land use change during 2013 and 2014 the eight input indices of fuzzy model were canal proximity population density livelihood status wetlands conversion rate road proximity population growth rate social status and infrastructure status while the output was wetland conversion risk they found that fuzzy based risk assessment model was able to show the different levels of wetland risk zones regarding the mentioned problems of pas risk assessment of these ecosystems seems necessary to take appropriate conservation and management measures the above mentioned studies indicated that no risk assessment has been conducted on pas which may be because pas are often under strict conversion regulations and there is no harmful human activity in these areas however in recent years there have been reports of land use change such as rangelands conversion to agricultural land decreasing number of animal species cross road and decreasing vegetation density in bijar protected area bpa in western iran accordingly the present study was conducted with the aim of wild animal life wal risk assessment of bpa in order to identify areas with various wal risks using remote sensing and fuzzy model 2 method 2 1 study area bpa is located 15 km to the northwest from bijar city in the northeast of kurdistan province fig 1 it is positioned between the geographical longitude 47 25 8 to 47 51 4 east and latitudes 35 59 5 53 to 36 12 9 25 north fig 1 the bpa area is about 31 612 ha approximately half of the area has a slope of less than 12 and the highest and lowest altitudes in the area are 2145 m and 1532 m respectively mammals fish reptiles birds and amphibians are the wildlife species of bpa hosseini et al 2013 studied on diversity and frequency of wildlife in bpa they found that the hyena hyaena hyaena badger meles meles wild boar sus scrofs wild sheep ovis orientalis gmelini jackal canis aureus fox vulpes volpes wolf canis lupus and rabbit lepus capensis were the dominant forms of wildlife in bpa wild sheep ovis orientalis gmelini is the important species of bpa based on the rangelands canopy cover hosseini et al 2013 selected the three secure location including poor good and fair ecological conditions with 29 1 72 and 41 5 canopy cover respectively fig 2 hosseini et al 2013 emphasized that compared with fair ecological conditions good ecological conditions have a higher successional stage but sequentially these conditions are not in climax in iran mostly there is no climax for vegetation and a good ecological condition is the best condition for ranges a poor ecological condition has a lower successional stage and is typically covered with shrubs they described that ephedra major and amygdalus lysioides had the highest canopy cover in the rangelands with a poor ecological condition bromus tomentellus and ferola sp had the highest canopy cover in a good rangelands condition and festuca ovina bromus tomentellus and amygdalus lysioides had the highest canopy cover in rangelands with a fair ecological condition in bpa they found no differences of vegetation diversity species richness and vegetation cover evenness among the three ecological conditions they described that the wildlife richness and wildlife diversity indexes were high in the fair and poor ecological conditions they showed that the wildlife diversity in the rangelands with good and fair ecological conditions were the lowest and highest respectively lack of brushes cover used for camouflage by wildlife species was the main reason of decreasing wildlife diversity in the good area they found that the main reason of the highest frequency of wild sheep and boar in the rangelands with fair ecological condition was the different vegetation types including grasses shrubs and forbs they showed that the rangelands with a poor ecological condition due to high density of shrubs sunny and warm slopes with poor range had higher frequency of wildlife especially for wild sheep compared with that in the good area they described that the high altitude covered by snow in the winter and open area of rangelands were the main reasons of low wild sheep frequency and lack of a permanent river was the main reason of low boar frequency in the rangelands with a good ecological condition for other animal species firouz 2009 showed that brushes were the main habitats of rabbits villages and the area around them were the main habitat of jackals where they found food such as garbage and human food waste valleys and hole of rocks were the main habitat of hyaena where they could hide and follow the predators to scavenge their hunting 2 2 selection and generation of risk assessment indicators risk assessment indicators were obtained based on the available literature and an expert opinion survey questionnaire the questionnaire was distributed in two stages among experienced experts at the environmental protected agency of kurdistan province and professors at university of kurdistan the first phase involved endorsement of the indicators while in the second phase the final indicators were weighted based on their impact on wal risk consequently seven indices were selected namely bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate livelihood status natural resource security threats and social status effect of dust storms conversion over bpa species and biodiversity could not be estimated using the current data moreover access to facilities such as schools telephone and drinking water in the study area were the same and sources creating pollution such as cement plants landfills and fish breeding pools were far away from bpa therefore these factors had no effect on the wal risk in bpa and were not considered in the study table 1 shows the weight values of the selected indicators for risk assessment of wal in bpa as table 1 shows the highest weight values 0 27 were obtained for bpa conservation rate and security threat indicators the lowest weight values 0 06 were acquired for population indicators that is population density and population growth rate indicators there were no significant changes for the weight values of population indicators and social status to develop a fuzzy model for wal risk assessment all the data and layers should be raster based sub indices including arable land unemployment rate livestock literacy rate and population density and growth rate were converted to raster based images using inverse distant weight idw method for all layers a cell size of 30 m was selected one of the assumptions of idw is that each entry point should have a local impact that decreases with distance this weighting method eq 1 is smooth comprehensible and relatively precise in a wide range of conditions 1 p i j 1 g p j d i j n j 1 g 1 d i j n where pi is the property at location i pj is the property at measured location j dij is the distance from i to j g is the number of measured location and n is the inverse distance weighting power all the indices in the fuzzy model were standardized in the fuzzy model for all indices a trapezoidal membership function was used with three sub regions of high moderate and low in a gis environment 2 2 1 conversion rate of bpa land use change of pas such as deforestation urbanization and agricultural expansion reduce the available habitats and cause decline in the biodiversity of pas parks and harcourt 2002 fischer et al 2006 fleishman et al 2011 davis and hansen 2011 sieber et al 2013 martinuzzi et al 2015 the study area consisted of both rangelands and agricultural lands a part of the agricultural lands had been degraded these lands used to be rangelands in the past remote sensing was used to measure the land use change in the study area in this region rain fed farming method is exploited in which the land lies fallow for a year and is farmed in the following year so to identify the agricultural lands the image of operational land imager oli sensor of the landsat 8 for 9 june 2016 was utilized three bands of image consisting of bands 6 5 and 4 were combined to make false composition amanollahi et al 2016 the supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was employed for the classification of land use into two categories namely agriculture and rangelands the kappa index was 86 3 sun et al 2009 agricultural lands and land use change of rangelands to agricultural lands were recognized using comparison results of image classification and agricultural lands map of study area provided by natural resource and watershed organization of kurdistan province the impact range of cultivated land agricultural lands and degraded rangelands on wal was measured with a 100 meter buffer the values obtained indicate that the effect of agricultural lands and degraded rangelands on the protected areas was 0 15 and 0 27 respectively the reason for the higher value of degraded rangelands is that human agriculture has been going on for ages causing minimal damage to this area with human beings and wal co existing peacefully together however the wal territory has diminished which has increased the risk for wal the rangelands of the region are also faced with different risks in terms of their elevations 1532 2140 m these rangelands are divided into two categories of below and over 1800 m with slopes also divided into two categories of below and over 15 agriculture is practiced in the region with an altitude of below 1800 m but rangelands with altitudes of above 1800 m with any slope range are faced with lower risks for their wal additionally rangelands in elevations below 1800 m with slopes of below 15 and over 15 indicate values of 0 1 and 0 08 respectively due to the higher possibility of rangelands with lower slopes to be converted to agricultural lands to obtain the index of conversion rate of bpa a combination of 3 layers of agricultural lands rangelands and degraded rangelands was used after applying the weights the three layers were overlaid using union operations in a gis environment in order to define the membership function of bpa conversion rate impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range 0 0 1 was regarded as low 0 09 0 23 as moderate and 0 21 0 27 as high 2 2 2 natural resource natural resources such as rangelands canopy cover spring and different types of vegetation including forbs shrubs and grasses have effect on wildlife risk daniel et al 1993 clementh 1993 smith et al 1996 al khalifa et al 2012 the composite indices of the natural resources impact on wal were calculated based on the sub indices of land cover and springs eq 2 2 n r w n r w l c w s where nr is the composite index of the natural resources wnr is the weight of the composite index of natural resources 0 15 and wlc and ws are the sub indices of land cover and springs required for wal respectively the water required for wal is provided by the springs in the area in order to investigate their effect buffers of 1 3 and 5 km around each of them were used they were given weights of 0 1375 0 275 and 0 55 respectively one of the objectives of the study was to determine the sub index of land cover density the weights of 0 45 0 225 and 0 1125 were given to low density semi coniferous and dense rangelands respectively finally all weights of the sub indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 15 the scale of the index ranged between 0 and 0 15 which would indicate the status of the natural resources in the region to define the membership function of the natural resources impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range from 0 to 0 058 was considered low 0 054 to 0 108 moderate and 0 088 to 0 15 high 2 2 3 population density high population growth rate around the pas have negative effect on wildlife biodiversity wittemyer et al 2008 population density of bpa was obtained from the population and surface area in hectare based on the census of 2015 eq 3 population data were collected from the governorate of kurdistan province population density was plotted on a map the idw method was used to obtain a raster based map 3 population density population size surface area the map obtained from the interpolation method was divided into three classes the weights of 0 06 0 03 and 0 015 were allocated to high moderate and low density in the unit of area respectively the index weight varied from 0 015 to 0 06 to define the membership function of population density impact on the wal in the fuzzy domain the low level was defined from 0 015 to 0 018 the moderate level from 0 006 to 0 036 and the high level from 0 024 to 0 06 2 2 4 population growth rate high population density around the pas decreased wildlife biodiversity young et al 2010 the population growth rate of bpa was derived from birth and mortality data from the population census in 2015 eq 4 information related to the number of births and deaths was obtained from the bijar general health center based on these data a raster based map was created using idw 4 population growth rate number of births b number of deaths d population size p x 100 the obtained map of the interpolation method was divided into three classes the weights of 0 06 0 03 and 0 015 were assigned to high moderate and low growth rates respectively the index weight varied from 0 015 to 0 06 to define the membership function of population growth rate impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range of 0 015 0 01 was considered low 0 003 0 033 moderate and 0 018 0 06 high 2 2 5 livelihood state low livelihood status was found by vedeld et al 2012 as one of the reasons of human wildlife conflict the composite index of livelihood state of bpa was calculated using the sub indices of agricultural land per capita unemployment rate and livestock respectively eq 5 5 l s w l s w c a w u r w l where ls is the composite index of livelihood status wls is the weight of the composite livelihood index 0 11 wca wur and wl are the weights given to the sub indices of agricultural land per capita unemployment rate and livestock in relation to livelihood handicrafts and the use of rangeland sub products were also investigated but since the people in this region are not dependent on this index these variables were excluded the first sub index was agricultural land per capita which was obtained from the following equation eq 6 6 agricultural land per capita surface area of agricultural land population size agricultural land per capita is derived from the division of the area of the region into square meters by region then the idw method was used to obtain the raster map the map was ranked in 3 classes the weights were 0 35 0 175 and 0 0875 respectively based on the maximum average and minimum per capita respectively agricultural land per capita was derived by dividing the surface area of the region in square meters m2 into the population size then the idw method was used to obtain a raster based map the map was categorized into 3 parts the weights of 0 35 0 175 and 0 0875 were assigned to high moderate and low categories of agricultural land per capita respectively the sub index of unemployment rate was obtained by the following equation eq 7 7 unemployment rate employed unemployed unemployed 100 information about this sub index was obtained from the provincial governorate the idw method was used to obtain an unemployment map the map was categorized into three parts which were obtained from weighting 0 28 as high 0 14 as moderate and 0 07 as low unemployment rates after collecting data on the number of livestock from the natural resources bureau of kurdistan province the idw method was used to obtain the sub index of livestock the map was divided into three categories with weights of 0 37 0 185 and 0 0925 assigned to high moderate and low rates of livestock respectively finally all weights of the sub indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 11 the scale of livelihood index ranged from 0 007 to 0 0946 indicating the livelihood of the region to define membership function of livelihood state impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range of 0 007 0 056 was regarded as high 0 051 0 074 as moderate and 0 07 0 0946 as low 2 2 6 social status sarkar et al 2016 used the indicator of social status for risk assessment of wetland area vodouhe et al 2010 showed that the educational level literacy rate has a positive effect on the behavior of local communities towards conservation of biodiversity within pendjari national park in order to obtain the social status index of bpa the sub indices of literacy rate the dependence of rural construction on natural resources and also the dependence on nature for fuel supplies were investigated inasmuch as this region is not dependent on natural resources for fuel and construction the two sub indices were eliminated and social status index only consisted of literacy rate information about literacy rate was taken from the provincial governorate of kurdistan based on the 2015 census this sub index was obtained using the following equation eq 8 8 literacy rate literate population population size of 6 year olds and above 100 the data were keyed in layers to gis software layer and transformed to raster based layers using the idw method the results were classified into three categories and weights of 0 08 0 04 and 0 02 were allocated to high medium and low rates respectively the index scale varied from 0 02 to 0 08 indicating the social status of the people in the area to define the membership function of social status impact on wal in the fuzzy domain the range 0 02 0 043 was considered to be high 0 032 0 065 to be moderate and 0 054 0 08 to be low 2 2 7 security threat the composite indices of security threat in bpa were based on sub indices of distance from residential areas guette et al 2018 population centers protective station distance proximity to roads donazar et al 2018 barber et al 2014 gas transmission line previous pastoral fires aretano et al 2015 moreira et al 2009 and mines in the region eq 9 guette et al 2018 concluded that human activity around the protected area leads to isolation of more and more portions of this area parsons et al 2016 showed allowing hunting in protected areas increased wildlife risk donazar et al 2018 found that high traffic intensity of roads in protected areas reduced richness of wild animals barber et al 2014 reported that increased proximity to transportation networks led to deforestation and increased the risk of wildlife in protected area aretano et al 2015 and moreira et al 2009 showed that uncontrolled hunting of animals for their fir can destroy natural ecosystem 9 s t w s t w v w p w r w g w f w e where st is the composite index of security threat wst is the weight of the composite index of security threat 0 27 wv is the weight of the distance from residential areas and population centers wp is the weight of the sub index of protective stations distance wr is the weight of the sub index of proximity to roads wg is the weight of the gas transmission line wf is the weight of the pastoral fires and we is the weight of the mines the histories of hunting and diseases were also investigated no considerable hunting of animals was recorded in this region moreover timely vaccination prevented the people in the region from mortality due to illnesses the prevalent disease in the region was foot and mouth disease that had been caused by domestic animals and had timely been controlled and prevented from transmission to evaluate the effect of all the sub indices of this layer they were buffered and then given weights for the sub indices of distance from residential districts and population centers village distance 2 and 3 km buffers were used with weights of 0 34 and 0 17 respectively the sub index of protective post distance was investigated using 3 and 5 km buffers with weights of 0 276 and 0 138 negative weights were given due to the fact that other sub indices could have an additional effect on risk but protective post distance is a positive factor and has a negative effect on risk the next sub index was the road distance which is obtained from 1 and 3 km buffers around the roads weights of 0 352 and 0 176 respectively were given to them in the southwest of the region a gas transmission line crossed the area whose effect on risk was measured using 200 and 500 meter buffers with weights of 0 153 and 0 0765 based on experts recommendation in addition the transmission line consisted of a station on the pipeline but because it was located outside the area it was not taken into account another sub index of security is the outbreak of pastoral fires for obtaining the data related to rangeland fires between 2011 and 2016 landsat tm satellite imagery was used for 2011 while oli was used for 2013 onward the false color combination of 5 4 and 3 was created for tm sensor and 6 5 and 4 for oli sensor images in envi software version 4 8 and the fire areas were digitized in the gis environment in these color combinations fire is indicated by purple color the burned areas were weighed with 0 115 whereas other areas were indicated by 0 mines are another sub index of security the effect of the region s mines on risk was estimated using a buffer of 3 and 5 km 0 2 and 0 1 wt in the end the weights of all the indices were summed up and multiplied by the weight of the index 0 27 the security threat index varied from 0 079 to 0 186 which indicated the security situation in the region in order to define the membership function of security threat impact on wal the index was considered in the fuzzy domain of 0 079 to 0 04 low 0 039 0 1 moderate and 0 091 to 0 186 high 2 3 fuzzy inference system fuzzy inference system fis which is also referred to as fuzzy expert system or fuzzy rule based system is a well established and efficient instrument for simulating systems and using model inputs for drawing inferences fuzzy mamdani method is a well known fuzzy inference technique that is frequently used by researchers yanar and akyurek 2003 it offers a useful and functional technique for simulating human knowledge and experience in the process of making decisions or classifying information mamdani 1977 another model used for risk assessment and habitat suitability is machine learning model garzon et al 2006 fuzzy logic modeling has superiority over machine learning model owing to its capability to transmit uncertainty and to model imprecise and qualitative data unexplained behavior of the network and no specific rule for determining the model structure are additional shortcomings of machine learning model fis includes four main stages bojadziev and bojadziev 2007 sami et al 2014 1 fuzzification the stage involves using a membership grade or a value between 0 and 1 to transform data into a fuzzy set which is a classified group labeled with variables such as high good and near 2 rule evaluation at this stage each rule is defined by combining the membership values by three main operators of and or and not 3 inference of results this stage involves producing qualified outcomes based on the weight or strength of the rules 4 defuzzification at this stage the outcomes which are qualified are aggregated in order to generate crisp output center of maximum com center of area coa and mean of maximum mom include some of defuzzification methods which are frequently applied mamdani method was used in the current study following this method the researchers computed the output by using the max min relational composition the trapezoidal membership functions of indices are shown in fig 3 the negative impact of the indices including bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate and security threat on wal risk and the positive impact of the indices including natural resource social status and livelihood status suggest that regions with high and moderate bpa conversion rate population density population growth rate and security threat and low rate of natural resource social status and livelihood status are more likely to increase the wal risk in bpa the rules for mapping the area with high risk were constructed based on the above description the regions with high and moderate bpa conversion rate population density and the regions with moderate population growth rate social status and security threat and the regions with low and moderate rate of natural resource and livelihood status have a moderate wal risk in bpa the regions with low bpa conversion rate population density security threat population growth rate and the regions with high rate of social status natural resource and livelihood status have a low wal risk in bpa 3 results and discussion 3 1 conversion rate of bpa the land use map of bpa based on classification of landsat 8 image on 9 june 2016 is shown in fig 4 rangelands with 12 782 3 ha was obtained higher values among the other land use areas table 2 rangelands with elevations of below 1800 m and slopes of below 15 were 2943 6 ha that had higher potential to convert to agricultural land compared with the other rangelands of bpa fig 4 land use change from rangelands to agricultural lands was 5771 05 ha table 2 in bpa it showed that more than 18 of bpa was degraded by human activity which increased the wal risk in the study area the number of the main species ovis orientalis gmelini living in bpa has reduced from 2000 to 435 since 1977 most of pa areas are located in high elevations with high slope ranges and far from the population center and road crossing mas 2005 joppa and pfaff 2009 however there are a lot of villages in bpa and only 20 of its area is higher than 1800 m which may be the reason for high rates of land use change in this area mekonen et al 2017 showed that land use change for agriculture activity and development of population centers decrease natural areas and cause extinction of species of wildlife that use these areas as their habitats de fries et al 2005 described that the habitat fragmentation and its loss around the pas increase the isolation of pas and human activity impacts in the pas kiboro and kiboro 2016 explained that illegal hunt destruction of habitat death from famine and hunger are factors affecting wildlife population 3 2 natural resource status of bpa the effect of natural resources on wal in bpa is shown in fig 5 a natural resource sub indices are vegetation cover density and springs that have a downside effect on wal risk besides its nutritional value vegetation cover is important for wildlife for providing shelter as fig 5a shows the high positive impact of natural resource index on wal was observed in the central and northern parts of bpa which are rangelands in recent years the increase in livestock has contributed to the utilization of natural resources using rangelands for grazing livestock and using springs for their drinking which have increased the pressure on wal of bpa woodroffe et al 2005 and dowie 2011 showed that the conflict between human activity and wildlife is one of the most challenging issues for wildlife conservation around the world peterson et al 2010 and white and ward 2011 describe that increasing human activity leads to rivalry between people and wildlife over shared resources including crop raiding livestock predation and property damage which can finally result in killing wildlife 3 3 security threat status of bpa the highest security level is around the protective stations there are four protective stations in bpa and the more the distance from them the less the security level thus the highest security threat impact is observed in the northern western and south western parts of bpa fig 5b one of the main sub indices of security threat is road crossing from bpa developing countries such as iran need to develop transport infrastructure for the development of mineral and energy resources new road network is often created in the wildlife corridors migration routes and seasonal movement pattern of wildlife laurance et al 2009 laurance and balmford 2013 roads have a major impact on wildlife mortality groot bruinderink and hazebroek 1996 wild animals migration routes are blocked by these roads and their infrastructure wilcove 2008 in addition roads affect the genetics physiology behavior abundance and dynamics of wildlife population benitez lopez et al 2010 distribution of invasive and alien species along the road clements et al 2014 and habitat fragmentation kang et al 2016 spellerberg and morrison 1998 3 4 livelihood status of bpa the sub indices of livelihood index which are agricultural lands per capita unemployment rate and livestock had an incremental effect on wal risk in bpa farmland use and grazing livestock are the most common ways in which people use bpa these people have no other source of income high unemployment rate and high population of livestock in the study area caused a high pressure on the wal therefore except some of the central and northern parts in most parts of the study area wildlife is affected by the livelihood fig 5c varying definitions of environmental security are available but what most of them share is whether people have enough food water and natural resources to sustain gore et al 2016 protective activities can also undermine livelihoods the role of pas as a means of controlling resources can be a direct cause of social instability which sometimes leads to conflict hammill 2006 described that for rural communities the creation of a pa often means limited access to livelihood or even compulsory displacement that can undermine economic security sarkar et al 2016 showed that the high level of risk in wetland areas is due to lack of livelihood sustainability status of residents 3 5 social status of bpa results of social index are shown in fig 5d social status had the lowest impact on wal in the central and north western areas whereas it had a highly negative impact on wal in the other parts fig 5d the low level of literacy among the population can increase the negative impact on wal such as degradation of rangelands to agricultural lands and value of existing wildlife in bpa increasing the literacy rate indicates better access to school amenities and better socio economic situation increase in the participation of marginalized residents in pas management reduced conflict between people and wal and change in the lifestyles of people who are not directly dependent on the resources 3 6 population density rate in the bpa as shown in fig 5e except some eastern parts of the study area population density had a low impact on the other areas that is the result of the decrease in population density in bpa fig 5e this result is not consistent with that of a similar study by masanja 2014 who showed that increasing human population caused increasing hunting of wildlife increasing the use of natural resources and increasing the negative impact on the ecosystem it seem people have migrated to cities because of the lack of sufficient facilities in the villages around and in bpa but due to lack of proper jobs in the cities they still hold on to their farming and livestock 3 7 population growth status of bpa the highest population growth rate impact was acquired for the western parts of the study area as shown in fig 5f the other parts are under moderate and low pressure of population growth rate this result is not consistent with that of cincotta et al 2000 who described that population growth is one of the major issues for management of pas and has led to increased use of natural resources bilsborrow 2002 showed that population growth causes conversion of rangelands into agricultural land which destroys ecosystem and natural habitats as described in section 3 6 lack of sufficient facilities in bpa villages is the main reason that people leave the area 3 8 risk zone map of bpa categorization of risk zones of bpa is shown in fig 6 central to northern north eastern and south western parts as well as some areas in the eastern strait were the areas with the highest risk central to southern north eastern and some parts in the eastern strait were the areas with the lowest risk moderate risk areas were small and only observed in the west and south east the periphery of the area experienced the highest risk as it was where the agricultural land rural areas large numbers of livestock and road crossing abound and as this area was far from protective stations in bpa there is an overgrazing of livestock in the rangelands which caused a reduction in the canopy cover of rangelands in a short period on the other hand limiting the access of local communities to the natural resources of pas that play an important role in their livelihood may help to preserve biodiversity in the short term but may not be able to sustain in the long term andrade and rhodes 2012 4 conclusion although it is very difficult to measure the exact effect of human activities on the wal risk our fuzzy risk assessment model mapped the various levels of wal risk in bpa results of this study demonstrated that agricultural and changing rangelands to agricultural area extremely increase wal risk in bpa additionally the results indicate that land use change can continue despite the decline of human population it may be due to low level of livelihood in the study area that encourages the farmers to make more income by changing the rangelands to agricultural areas thus our study provides evidence to support that decreasing human population does not decrease the human pressures on wal risk in iran illegal degradation of rangelands and changing them to agricultural areas have been a serious problem and conservation measures have proved insufficient to deter it rangeland areas have continued to decline since the rangelands nationalization law was promulgated in 1963 based on this law the management of rangelands was transferred from private to governmental agencies as the human activities are dynamic any changes in them such as road construction and rangeland degradation within or near bpa can affect the risk level in it thus there is need to re evaluate the model and indicators to acquire the accurate result from time to time the wal risk model based on fuzzy approach developed in this study provides an opportunity to identify the zones with different levels of the wal risk and can be applied to other pas for the risk estimation finally it seems essential to increase the number of protective stations while livelihood status of human population is needed to decrease the wal risk in bpa acknowledgements we thankdr vahid nimehchisalem from the department of english faculty of

25186,occupancy models allow assessing species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection as with any statistical models occupancy models rely on several assumptions amongst which i there should be no unmodelled heterogeneity in the detection probability and ii the species should not be detected when absent from a site in other words there should be no false positives e g due to misidentification in the real world these two assumptions are often violated to date models accounting simultaneously for both detection heterogeneity and false positives are yet to be developed here we first show how occupancy models with false positives can be formulated as hidden markov models hmm second benefiting from the hmm framework flexibility we extend models with false positives to account for heterogeneity with finite mixtures first using simulations we demonstrate that as the level of heterogeneity increases occupancy models accounting for both heterogeneity and misidentification perform better in terms of bias and precision than models accounting for misidentification only next we illustrate the implementation of our new model to a real case study with grey wolves canis lupus in france we demonstrate that heterogeneity in wolf detection false negatives is mainly due to a heterogeneous sampling effort across space in addition to providing a novel modeling formulation this work illustrates the flexibility of hmm framework to formulate complex ecological models and relax important assumptions that are not always likely to hold in particular we show how to decompose the model structure in several simple components in a way that provides much clearer ecological interpretation abbreviations mmo model accounting for misidentification only mmh model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity in the detection probabilities mms model accounting for misidentification only and sampling effort as a covariate on the detection probability mmhs model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity in the detection probabilities and sampling effort as a covariate on the detection probabilities keywords occupancy models detection heterogeneity species imperfect detection false positives finite mixture models 1 introduction occupancy models mackenzie et al 2006 are commonly used to infer species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection bailey et al 2014 guillera arroita 2017 these models rely on species detections and non detections recorded during surveys repeated across time and across several spatial sampling units sites as with any statistical models inferences made from occupancy analyses heavily rely on several assumptions that should be checked and validated mackenzie et al 2003 2006 although in reality this is rarely done see however mackenzie et al 2004 warton et al 2017 here we focus on two important assumptions first there should be no unmodelled heterogeneity in species detection in other words all heterogeneity should be accounted for with covariates if ignored heterogeneity in detection leads to underestimating occupancy royle and nichols 2003 royle 2006 detection heterogeneity can be due to a heterogeneous sampling effort in space louvrier et al 2018 variation in animal abundance royle and nichols 2003 or variation in site characteristics mackenzie et al 2011 often site level covariates can be measured on the field and incorporated in occupancy models to account for detection heterogeneity however unexplained variation may remain or measuring the relevant covariates may simply be impossible in the field when we suspect substantial unmodelled heterogeneity to occur we should consider modeling it either with continuous latent variables through normally distributed site random effects e g gimenez et al 2014 modelling heterogeneity using normally distributed random effect has long been studied in the field of theoretical biology e g perc 2011 alternatively modelling heterogeneity can be done using finite mixtures in finite mixture models a latent variable is defined to assign sites to a mixture components i e groups of heterogeneity characterized by specific parameters royle 2006 pledger and phillpot 2008 while heterogeneity in detection probability using mixture models has been long studied in the capture recapture cr literature review in gimenez et al 2017 less attention has been given to this issue in occupancy models gimenez et al 2014 miller et al 2015 a second important assumption of occupancy models is that the species should not be detected when absent from a site i e no false positives false positives occur when the species of interest is detected at sites where it did not occur usually as a result of misidentification miller et al 2013 several studies have underlined the importance of accounting for false positives on species distribution royle and link 2006 miller et al 2011 2013 chambert et al 2015 ignoring false positives and counting them as true positives causes important biases such as overestimating occupancy and colonization probabilities and underestimating extinction probability royle and link 2006 mcclintock et al 2010 miller et al 2011 2013 developed static and dynamic occupancy models that accommodate both false negatives and false positives as example of applications these models have been used to estimate occurrence of amphibians miller et al 2011 bats clement et al 2014 and several large vertebrates in india pillay et al 2014 as well as occurrence dynamics of wolves in montana miller et al 2013 while several studies have accounted for heterogeneity in occupancy models with false positives by using site level covariates mcclintock et al 2010 ferguson et al 2015 miller 2015 methods that simultaneously account for both unmodelled heterogeneity through finite mixtures and false positives have yet to be developed here we fill this gap and illustrate the use of hidden markov modelling hmm framework as a powerful tool for further developments aiming at relaxing occupancy models assumptions standard occupancy models can be formulated as hmms describing two time series running in parallel the first time series captures the dynamics of the latent states with the state process following a markovian sequence e g site occupied vs unoccupied the other time series models the observation process consisting in detections conditional on the underlying but possibly unknown states gimenez et al 2014 the originality of our approach is twofold first we show how occupancy models with false positives can be formulated as hmms second benefiting from the hmm framework flexibility we extend models with false positives to account for unmodelled heterogeneity using a finite mixture approach to assess the performance of our approach we performed a simulation study comparing parameter bias and precision in a model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity vs a model accounting for misidentification only to do so we considered scenarios with an increasing level of heterogeneity in the probability of false positive detection we also used a case study on the grey wolves canis lupus distribution in france to illustrate implementation of the method in a real world scenario our objectives were i to investigate how detection heterogeneity when ignored affects the accuracy of occupancy estimation and ii assess the extent at which this heterogeneity might be explained by sampling effort variability across space 2 methods in the statistical literature there are three main problems of interest when using hmm rabiner 1989 in what follows we review each of these problems in the context of occupancy models in the evaluation problem we ask what the probability that the observations are generated by our model is see section 2 1 in the decoding problem we ask what the most likely state sequence in the model that produced the observations is see section 2 5 in the learning problem we ask how we should adjust the model parameters to maximize the likelihood see section 2 3 2 1 hmm formulation of occupancy models with misidentification occupancy models can be viewed as hmm whereby the ecological states are considered as partially hidden states i e imperfectly observed gimenez et al 2014 occupancy models incorporating false positives can also be framed within this approach the hmm formulation allows flexibility in the model formulation by decomposing the occupancy approach into simpler steps the hmm formulation allows better understanding of the ecological and observation processes to account for false positives we followed the multi season dynamic model formulation of miller et al 2013 for occupied sites three observations can be made i an unambiguous detection which is a true detection that has been validated ii an ambiguous detection which is also a true detection but that could not be validated and iii no detection at unoccupied sites by definition unambiguous detections cannot occur thus only two possible observations can be made an ambiguous detection which in this case is a false positive detection due to species misidentification or no detection the parameters of interest are ψ1 the probability of initial occupancy the probability of local extinction ε and of colonization γ the probability of correctly detecting the species at an occupied site p11 the probability to falsely detect the species at an unoccupied site p10 and the probability b to classify a true positive detection as unambiguous miller et al 2011 the specification of a hmm is divided in three steps the vector of initial state probabilities the matrix of transition probabilities linking states between successive sampling occasions and the matrix of observation probabilities linking observations and states at a given occasion gimenez et al 2014 we define zi k the latent state of a site i during the primary occasion e g season or year k at the first primary occasion k 1 a site can only be in one of two states unoccupied or occupied with probabilities in the vector of initial state probabilities ψ u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 then the states are distributed as a first order markov chain governed by a transition matrix of the form t u n o c c u p i e d a t k o c c u p i e d a t k u n o c c u p i e d a t k 1 1 γ ε o c c u p i e d a t k 1 γ 1 ε where rows describe states at occasion k in and columns describe states at k 1 next we describe the observation process which is conditional on occupancy states we define yi j k the observation of a site i during the secondary occasion e g visit or survey j during the primary occasion k for unoccupied sites unambiguous detections yi j k 1 do not occur while ambiguous detections yi j k 2 or no detections yi j k 0 may occur for occupied sites unambiguous detections ambiguous detections and no detection can all occur for the sake of clarity it is more convenient to write the observation process as the product of two matrices the first matrix summarizes the detection state process conditional on occupancy state rows unoccupied and occupied at k columns describe the following intermediate latent detection states no detection true positive detection and false positive detection p u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d n o d e t e c t i o n 1 p 10 1 p 11 t r u e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n 0 p 11 f a l s e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n p 10 0 it is important to keep in mind that the true underlying state i e false or true positive of the detections is unknown at this stage of the modeling we are still dealing with latent state not with actual data the second matrix then summarizes the classification of a true positive detection as unambiguous or ambiguous with probability b and 1 b respectively in this matrix rows represent the above intermediate latent detection states no detection true positive detection false positive detection while columns correspond to actual observations data i e no detection yi j k 0 unambiguous detection yi j k 1 and ambiguous detection yi j k 2 n o d e t e c t i o n b t r u e p o s i t i v e

by definition false detections can only occur in the form of ambiguous detection this last process only deals with the classification of true detection as certain or ambiguous depending on the level of confidence in the observation the overall observation process can then be written in the form of a simple matrix product o pb which gives o u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d n o d e t e c t i o n

could be specified as survey specific j season specific k site specific i or any combination of these effects we can then write the general probability of any detection history h such as p h f i r s t p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n ψ d o y 1 1 1 t 0 d o y 2 1 1 t 0 d o y j 1 1 s e c o n d p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n t d o y 1 2 1 t 0 d o y 2 2 1 t 0 d o y j 2 1 l a s t p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n t d o y 1 k 1 t 0 d o y 2 k 1 t 0 d o y j k 1 1 n where for the sake of simplicity we have dropped the index i for site d θ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to the elements of the arbitrary vector θ o yj k is the column vector corresponding to the observation y at the secondary occasion j during primary occasion k a 0 is the transition matrix with ε γ 0 and 1 n is the column vector of n ones with n the number of occupancy states the likelihood is then the product of the probabilities of all the site histories zucchini et al 2016 in our study on wolves we focused on static single season models such that extinction and colonization events do not occur the probability of any site history h can thus be simplified to p h ψ d o y 1 1 t 0 d o y 2 1 t 0 d o y j 1 2 2 occupancy model with heterogeneity in the detection probability we now show how to incorporate site to site i e spatial heterogeneity in the detection process through the addition of a probabilistic process that assigns any site to a finite number of latent classes royle 2006 miller et al 2015 for the sake of clarity here we only consider two classes of heterogeneity class a and b but more classes could easily be considered like group effects membership to a heterogeneity class is a constant feature of a site i e it does not change over time so the assignation process occurs at the first modelling step describing initial states π c l a s s a c l a s s b π 1 π where π respectively 1 π is the probability for any site to be assigned to class a resp to class b this is the main difference with the model described above the following processes and the associated parameters remain the same except that parameters are now allowed to vary according to the two classes of sites we now define four occupancy states occupied a occupied b unoccupied a and unoccupied b in terms of model parameters in addition to π we now have ψ1a resp ψ1b the probability of initial occupancy for sites of class a resp b ε a resp ε b the probability of local extinction for sites of class a resp b and γ a resp γ b the probability of local colonization for sites of class a resp b pa11 resp pb11 the probability of correctly detecting the species at an occupied site of class a resp b pa10 resp pb10 the probability to falsely detect the species at an unoccupied site a and the probability b to classify a true positive detection as unambiguous miller et al 2011 the next process describes whether a site is initially occupied or not but now conditionally on the site s class membership a or b the pattern matrix that links class membership to the four class specific occupancy states is φ c l a s s a c l a s s b u n o c c u p i e d a 1 ψ 1 a 0 u n o c c u p i e d b 0 1 ψ 1 b o c c u p i e d a ψ 1 a 0 o c c u p i e d b 0 ψ 1 b here rows correspond to the two conditioning states class a and class b and columns represent all possible initial states unoccupied a unoccupied b occupied a and occupied b in columns the final vector of initial state probabilities is therefore the product of the row vector of class assignment proportions and the matrix of occupancy probabilities ψ π φ because we were interested in incorporating heterogeneity in the detection process only here we assume ψ 1 a ψ 1 b ψ 1 the state transition process remains the same but is distinguished according to the two heterogeneity classes a and b this leads us to define the following matrix for state transition from k to k 1 t u n o c c u p i e d a k u n o c c u p i e d b k o c c u p i e d a k o c c u p i e d b k

independently at a sites and b sites as above rows describe occupancy states while columns represent intermediate latent detection states not detection true positive detection false positive detection p u n o c c u p i e d a u n o c c u p i e d b o c c u p i e d a o c c u p i e d b n o d e t e c t i o n 1 p a 10 1 p b 10 1 p a 11 1 p b 11 t r u e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n 0 0 p a 11 p b 11 f a l s e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n p a 10 p b 10 0 0 finally the matrix describing the classification process of true positives as unambiguous or ambiguous detections remains unchanged see matrix b above overall the observation process can be described by the matrix product o p b with the occupancy states in rows and the observations in columns o u n o c c u p i e d a u n o c c u p i e

in the rest of this paper we focus on static single season models so that ε a ε b γ a γ b 0 2 3 implementation occupancy models formulated as hmms can be implemented in the software e surge choquet et al 2009 which allows for the decomposition of the observation and state processes in multiple steps providing more flexible and often more easily interpretable parameterization gimenez et al 2014 we provide in appendix a and appendix b two detailed step by step procedure to implement occupancy models accounting for false positives with and without heterogeneity in e surge we also refer to the e surge manual choquet and nogue 2011 as well as choquet 2008 and choquet et al 2009 for additional details we also provide in appendix c and appendix d the r r core team 2013 codes to fit the models described above 2 4 simulations we conducted a simulation study to assess performance of two models one accounting for misidentification only and one accounting for both misidentification and heterogeneity first we simulated occupancy data including both unambiguous and ambiguous detections assuming two classes of heterogeneity for false positive probability p10 to characterize and compare heterogeneity among the scenarios considered we define a heterogeneity coefficient as η σ ² μ 1 μ with the mean value of the heterogeneity parameter μ π pa10 1 π pb10 and the variance between components σ² π pa10 μ ² 1 π pb10 μ ² dorazio and royle 2003 cubaynes et al 2012 we considered three scenarios with increasing heterogeneity coefficient by varying parameters π and pb10 table 1 other parameters were held constant pa10 was set at 0 1 the initial occupancy probability ψ1 was set at 0 8 probabilities of true positive pa11 and pb11 were both set at 0 5 and b was set at 0 7 for all simulation runs we used 100 sites with 3 and 10 occasions for each scenario we simulated s 200 datasets and for each dataset fitted both models simulation and analyses were done in the software r see appendix c and appendix d we compared the two models performance using averaged aic differences calculated from the 200 repeated runs we chose the aic because it has been shown to be effective at selecting the number of classes in finite mixture capture recapture models cubaynes et al 2012 for each model we also calculated the relative bias defined as 1 s s 1 s θ ˆ s θ θ and root mean square error rmse for occupancy probability estimates 1 s s 1 s θ ˆ s θ ² we performed a second simulation study considering the same form and levels of heterogeneity but applied to the true detection parameter p11 instead of the false positive detections parameter p10 we tested three scenarios with increasing heterogeneity coefficient by varying parameters π and pb11 every other aspect of this simulation study was the same as in the first simulation study appendix e 2 5 application wolf data to illustrate use of our model accounting for both misidentification and heterogeneity we analyzed wolves detection non detection data collected in france during the year 2013 louvrier et al 2018 signs of presence of the species such as tracks scats prey remains dead wolves camera trap photos or sightings are being collected thanks to a network of professional and non professional observers duchamp et al 2012 the data consisted of 250 unambiguous detections 54 ambiguous detections and 12540 non detections spread over a grid of 3211 10 10 km cells fig 1 to respect the closure assumption sites were visited between december and march which corresponds to a period between the two peaks of dispersal events in spring and fall mech and boitani 2010 in a previous study we found that variability in occupancy probabilities was mostly explained by site s altitude while detection probability was primarily driven by sampling effort defined as the number of observers per site and per year louvrier et al 2018 here we compared four different models all of which included altitude as a covariate on occupancy parameter a first model accounted for misidentification only without heterogeneity in the detection process mmo a second model accounted for misidentification with heterogeneity in both detection probabilities mmh in the last model we accounted for some detection heterogeneity using the sampling effort covariate on both p11 and p10 mms instead of including a finite mixture heterogeneity process sampling effort was indeed quite heterogeneous across space with areas around the alps subject to much higher sampling effort than the rest of the study area we expected sampling effort to capture most of the heterogeneity in the detection parameters which would translate in close aic values for mmh and mms and a lower aic value for mmo finally we fitted a fourth model including both the finite mixture process for unobserved heterogeneity and the sampling effort covariate mmhs this last model allowed assessing the relative fraction of heterogeneity due to sampling effort using the parameter estimates from mmh we finally built a map depicting the estimated assigned classes of heterogeneity for the 3211 sites of the study area this was done with the viterbi algorithm rouan et al 2009 an approach that allows estimation of latent states from hmms although the bayes theorem could be used in this situation where no time series structure is involved the viterbi algorithm is a general approach that can be used in a dynamic occupancy framework 3 results 3 1 simulations results from the simulations with 10 occasions showed that when heterogeneity in false positive probability increased coefficient η going from 0 24 to 0 53 the δaic between mmo and mmh δaic aicmmo aicmmh increased from 6 66 10 23 23 55 to 45 59 7 21 83 97 while both models showed low rmse in terms of occupancy estimation mmh clearly outperformed mmo as heterogeneity increased mmo produced increasingly biased parameters when heterogeneity increased while the bias in mmh always remained low table 1 we found similar results when we considered heterogeneity in the true detection probability p11 mmh clearly outperformed mmo in terms of aic bias and rmse as heterogeneity increased the bias for mmo did not increase but remained important across the range of heterogeneity coefficients appendix e finally with 3 occasions mmh appeared to perform worse than mmo highlighting the need to consider a minimal sampling effort to distinguish false positives and heterogeneity appendix f 3 2 wolf case study we found evidence for heterogeneity in the detection process table 2 with mmo having a much larger aic 2209 49 value than mmh 2084 14 most of this heterogeneity was explained by spatial variation in sampling effort as suggested by the fact that mms had a lower aic value 2071 51 than mmh but even after accounting for sampling effort there remained some unobserved heterogeneity as evidenced by the fact that mmhs still had a lower aic value 1953 26 than mms overall all four models estimated a low occupancy probability table 2 all four models estimated a very low probability of false positive detection p10 fig 2 mmhs estimated that for 70 of sites p10 was equal to zero while for the remaining 30 p10 strongly increased with sampling effort mms results also suggested that p10 strongly increased with sampling effort according to mmh 81 of the sites had a value of p10 similar to the one estimated from mmo for the remaining 19 p10 was equal to zero indicating that virtually no false positive errors occurred at these sites as we could expect both mms and mmhs results suggested that true detection probability p11 strongly increases with sampling effort for both classes of sites mmh estimated p11 quite low at around 0 04 0 02 0 06 for 81 of the sites and high in 19 of the sites fig 3 finally the sites with high detectability corresponded to sites with high sampling effort fig 4 4 discussion while heterogeneity in detection probability has long been studied in the capture recapture literature review in gimenez et al 2017 less attention has been given to this issue in occupancy modeling miller et al 2015 we developed single static and multi season dynamic occupancy models that account for both heterogeneity and false positives benefiting from the flexibility of hmm frameworks to decompose a complex likelihood structure in multiple simpler components more amenable to biological interpretation zucchini et al 2016 using simulations we showed that when ignored detection heterogeneity induces biases in occupancy estimators on a case study on wolves we also found that finite mixture models of detection could be used to capture part of the heterogeneity due to variable sampling efforts we note that although such mixture models are very useful to account for unobserved detection heterogeneity the associated parameters remain difficult to interpret gimenez et al 2017 4 1 advantages of the hmm framework the hmm formulation of occupancy models provides a great flexibility in the way detection heterogeneity and misidentification can be specified first the hmm formulation provides a straightforward mean to modelling the ecological and the observation processes separately pradel 2005 besides each process can be split in multiple steps that match exactly the underlying relevant ecological or observation events making the modeling exercise and interpretation more intuitive to the biologist this latter feature has been illustrated in several capture recapture studies pradel 2005 sanz aguilar et al 2011 avril et al 2012 but it is fairly new for occupancy models gimenez et al 2014 in this study we focused on issues of heterogeneity in the detection process but the framework provided can equally be used to model heterogeneity in occupancy probabilities gimenez et al 2014 we may also allow a site to change heterogeneity status by introducing a transition parameter from class a to class b pradel 2009 gimenez et al 2012 this model could be useful in the wolf case study to accommodate an increase in sampling effort over time and the possibility for some sites with low detectability to get a higher detectability the use of finite mixtures allows capturing relevant levels of heterogeneity without the need to include a large number of explanatory covariates it is however important to keep in mind that parameter redundancy can become an issue as we add more classes of heterogeneity and or choose to apply finite mixtures on several parameters gimenez et al 2014 for instance if we wanted to consider classes of heterogeneity for all parameter occupancy true detection and false detection our model could quickly become too complex gimenez et al 2014 if parameter redundancy is suspected it could be assessed using the methods that have been developed for this purpose choquet and cole 2012 4 2 simulations we considered three scenarios in which the heterogeneity coefficient increased with the proportion of sites of class a and the probability of false positive detections in sites b as expected models ignoring heterogeneity produced biased and imprecise occupancy estimates when heterogeneity was actually increasing those results are the same whether heterogeneity occurs in probabilities of false positive detections or true detections previous studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating covariates when available on the true positive probability to avoid underestimating occupancy parameters miller et al 2015 in absence of measurable candidate covariates we recommend using the finite mixture approach described in this paper an alternative to finite mixtures is to consider a site random effect gimenez et al 2014 an advantage of finite mixture models is that they can easily be fitted in a frequentist or a bayesian framework in contrast site random effects are naturally fitted in a bayesian framework but at the cost of higher computational burden in the frequentist framework site random effects require a specific non trivial treatment of the likelihood e g gimenez and choquet 2010 4 3 wolf case study we found strong evidence of among site heterogeneity in the detection probability of wolves this heterogeneity was mostly explained by spatial variation in sampling effort as expected the probability of true positive detection increased with sampling effort in this study more sampling effort occurs at the core of the species distribution around the alps and in the north eastern part of france fig 1 this variable effort is explained by the fact that in france the first recolonizing wolves were detected in the alps before they started spreading out valière et al 2003 average values of detection parameters estimated by the mmh were close to the average values estimated by the mms and the mmhs highlighting the similarities between these models however the mmh and mms provided slightly different estimates of occupancy probability aic comparison between these two models revealed that sampling effort explains most of the variation in detection probabilities a previous study louvrier et al 2018 had also found strong support for this covariate and the authors had shown that ignoring the effect of sampling effort leads to underestimating occupancy probabilities especially at sites with low effort results from the mmhs confirm this hypothesis as the estimate of occupancy probability was close to the one provided by the mms sampling effort is thus an important covariate to account for but the fact that mmhs had the lowest aic suggests that some unobserved detection heterogeneity remains if sampling effort cannot easily be measured models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity could be used as an alternative to control for detection variability and avoid estimation biases such an approach should prove especially useful for analyses of opportunistic monitoring data collected by large networks of citizens which rely on protocols that rarely include explicit measures of sampling effort the fact that the estimated probability of false positive detection was low suggests that the continuous training over the years of the observers of the network duchamp et al 2012 has been efficient the low value of the false positive detection could also mean that the filtering process of observations was effective part of this filtering process consisted in rejecting detections that could be identified as false positives to avoid noise in the data we can conclude that most false positives may very well have already been rejected during this filtering process based on this fact and the value of the probability to classify a true detection as unambiguous b we could conclude that most of the ambiguous data were actually true positive detections which could be considered as unambiguous detections and analyzed with standard occupancy models however running the model accounting for false positives would still be a necessary step to ensure that false positive probability is extremely low before we decide to treat ambiguous data as true detections in our wolf study winter observations consisted mostly of tracks found in the snow scats carcasses and camera trap photographs duchamp et al 2012 which were all observations that could easily be verified however on the colonization front a larger proportion of detections consisted of visual sightings and because these types of data could not be verified they were therefore classified as ambiguous here integrating these ambiguous data is especially interesting because it brings new information about the wolf distribution on the colonization front these data could thus provide new insights in the context of managing an expanding protected species where new identified sites could help understanding the processes underlying the recolonization of wolves guillera arroita et al 2015 we found from the viterbi algorithm that the sites having the higher true positive probability were those where the sampling effort was high however the fact that the estimated number of sites of class b from the viterbi algorithm is lower than what the mmh estimated can be due to the low value of the occupancy probability this low occupancy estimate can lead to a greater uncertainty in assessing the class of a site rouan et al 2009 despite this fact it is possible to see the link between sampling effort and the two classes of heterogeneity sites belonging to the heterogeneity class a which were primarily found on the colonization front of the species louvrier et al 2018 had a lower detection probability p11 than sites of class b this strongly suggests that the species is less likely to be detected on the colonization front where new conflicts with human activities can arise in conclusion we recommend devoting efforts in the monitoring process to minimize heterogeneity across sites and possibly identifying and measuring covariates that may affect detection probability such as the sampling effort if not possible we recommend using occupancy models accounting for detection heterogeneity if covariates possibly explaining site to site variation cannot be measured in the field the hmm formulation we propose allows an easy implementation of these models data accessibility we provide the scripts to simulate the data in the

25186,occupancy models allow assessing species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection as with any statistical models occupancy models rely on several assumptions amongst which i there should be no unmodelled heterogeneity in the detection probability and ii the species should not be detected when absent from a site in other words there should be no false positives e g due to misidentification in the real world these two assumptions are often violated to date models accounting simultaneously for both detection heterogeneity and false positives are yet to be developed here we first show how occupancy models with false positives can be formulated as hidden markov models hmm second benefiting from the hmm framework flexibility we extend models with false positives to account for heterogeneity with finite mixtures first using simulations we demonstrate that as the level of heterogeneity increases occupancy models accounting for both heterogeneity and misidentification perform better in terms of bias and precision than models accounting for misidentification only next we illustrate the implementation of our new model to a real case study with grey wolves canis lupus in france we demonstrate that heterogeneity in wolf detection false negatives is mainly due to a heterogeneous sampling effort across space in addition to providing a novel modeling formulation this work illustrates the flexibility of hmm framework to formulate complex ecological models and relax important assumptions that are not always likely to hold in particular we show how to decompose the model structure in several simple components in a way that provides much clearer ecological interpretation abbreviations mmo model accounting for misidentification only mmh model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity in the detection probabilities mms model accounting for misidentification only and sampling effort as a covariate on the detection probability mmhs model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity in the detection probabilities and sampling effort as a covariate on the detection probabilities keywords occupancy models detection heterogeneity species imperfect detection false positives finite mixture models 1 introduction occupancy models mackenzie et al 2006 are commonly used to infer species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection bailey et al 2014 guillera arroita 2017 these models rely on species detections and non detections recorded during surveys repeated across time and across several spatial sampling units sites as with any statistical models inferences made from occupancy analyses heavily rely on several assumptions that should be checked and validated mackenzie et al 2003 2006 although in reality this is rarely done see however mackenzie et al 2004 warton et al 2017 here we focus on two important assumptions first there should be no unmodelled heterogeneity in species detection in other words all heterogeneity should be accounted for with covariates if ignored heterogeneity in detection leads to underestimating occupancy royle and nichols 2003 royle 2006 detection heterogeneity can be due to a heterogeneous sampling effort in space louvrier et al 2018 variation in animal abundance royle and nichols 2003 or variation in site characteristics mackenzie et al 2011 often site level covariates can be measured on the field and incorporated in occupancy models to account for detection heterogeneity however unexplained variation may remain or measuring the relevant covariates may simply be impossible in the field when we suspect substantial unmodelled heterogeneity to occur we should consider modeling it either with continuous latent variables through normally distributed site random effects e g gimenez et al 2014 modelling heterogeneity using normally distributed random effect has long been studied in the field of theoretical biology e g perc 2011 alternatively modelling heterogeneity can be done using finite mixtures in finite mixture models a latent variable is defined to assign sites to a mixture components i e groups of heterogeneity characterized by specific parameters royle 2006 pledger and phillpot 2008 while heterogeneity in detection probability using mixture models has been long studied in the capture recapture cr literature review in gimenez et al 2017 less attention has been given to this issue in occupancy models gimenez et al 2014 miller et al 2015 a second important assumption of occupancy models is that the species should not be detected when absent from a site i e no false positives false positives occur when the species of interest is detected at sites where it did not occur usually as a result of misidentification miller et al 2013 several studies have underlined the importance of accounting for false positives on species distribution royle and link 2006 miller et al 2011 2013 chambert et al 2015 ignoring false positives and counting them as true positives causes important biases such as overestimating occupancy and colonization probabilities and underestimating extinction probability royle and link 2006 mcclintock et al 2010 miller et al 2011 2013 developed static and dynamic occupancy models that accommodate both false negatives and false positives as example of applications these models have been used to estimate occurrence of amphibians miller et al 2011 bats clement et al 2014 and several large vertebrates in india pillay et al 2014 as well as occurrence dynamics of wolves in montana miller et al 2013 while several studies have accounted for heterogeneity in occupancy models with false positives by using site level covariates mcclintock et al 2010 ferguson et al 2015 miller 2015 methods that simultaneously account for both unmodelled heterogeneity through finite mixtures and false positives have yet to be developed here we fill this gap and illustrate the use of hidden markov modelling hmm framework as a powerful tool for further developments aiming at relaxing occupancy models assumptions standard occupancy models can be formulated as hmms describing two time series running in parallel the first time series captures the dynamics of the latent states with the state process following a markovian sequence e g site occupied vs unoccupied the other time series models the observation process consisting in detections conditional on the underlying but possibly unknown states gimenez et al 2014 the originality of our approach is twofold first we show how occupancy models with false positives can be formulated as hmms second benefiting from the hmm framework flexibility we extend models with false positives to account for unmodelled heterogeneity using a finite mixture approach to assess the performance of our approach we performed a simulation study comparing parameter bias and precision in a model accounting for misidentification and heterogeneity vs a model accounting for misidentification only to do so we considered scenarios with an increasing level of heterogeneity in the probability of false positive detection we also used a case study on the grey wolves canis lupus distribution in france to illustrate implementation of the method in a real world scenario our objectives were i to investigate how detection heterogeneity when ignored affects the accuracy of occupancy estimation and ii assess the extent at which this heterogeneity might be explained by sampling effort variability across space 2 methods in the statistical literature there are three main problems of interest when using hmm rabiner 1989 in what follows we review each of these problems in the context of occupancy models in the evaluation problem we ask what the probability that the observations are generated by our model is see section 2 1 in the decoding problem we ask what the most likely state sequence in the model that produced the observations is see section 2 5 in the learning problem we ask how we should adjust the model parameters to maximize the likelihood see section 2 3 2 1 hmm formulation of occupancy models with misidentification occupancy models can be viewed as hmm whereby the ecological states are considered as partially hidden states i e imperfectly observed gimenez et al 2014 occupancy models incorporating false positives can also be framed within this approach the hmm formulation allows flexibility in the model formulation by decomposing the occupancy approach into simpler steps the hmm formulation allows better understanding of the ecological and observation processes to account for false positives we followed the multi season dynamic model formulation of miller et al 2013 for occupied sites three observations can be made i an unambiguous detection which is a true detection that has been validated ii an ambiguous detection which is also a true detection but that could not be validated and iii no detection at unoccupied sites by definition unambiguous detections cannot occur thus only two possible observations can be made an ambiguous detection which in this case is a false positive detection due to species misidentification or no detection the parameters of interest are ψ1 the probability of initial occupancy the probability of local extinction ε and of colonization γ the probability of correctly detecting the species at an occupied site p11 the probability to falsely detect the species at an unoccupied site p10 and the probability b to classify a true positive detection as unambiguous miller et al 2011 the specification of a hmm is divided in three steps the vector of initial state probabilities the matrix of transition probabilities linking states between successive sampling occasions and the matrix of observation probabilities linking observations and states at a given occasion gimenez et al 2014 we define zi k the latent state of a site i during the primary occasion e g season or year k at the first primary occasion k 1 a site can only be in one of two states unoccupied or occupied with probabilities in the vector of initial state probabilities ψ u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 then the states are distributed as a first order markov chain governed by a transition matrix of the form t u n o c c u p i e d a t k o c c u p i e d a t k u n o c c u p i e d a t k 1 1 γ ε o c c u p i e d a t k 1 γ 1 ε where rows describe states at occasion k in and columns describe states at k 1 next we describe the observation process which is conditional on occupancy states we define yi j k the observation of a site i during the secondary occasion e g visit or survey j during the primary occasion k for unoccupied sites unambiguous detections yi j k 1 do not occur while ambiguous detections yi j k 2 or no detections yi j k 0 may occur for occupied sites unambiguous detections ambiguous detections and no detection can all occur for the sake of clarity it is more convenient to write the observation process as the product of two matrices the first matrix summarizes the detection state process conditional on occupancy state rows unoccupied and occupied at k columns describe the following intermediate latent detection states no detection true positive detection and false positive detection p u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d n o d e t e c t i o n 1 p 10 1 p 11 t r u e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n 0 p 11 f a l s e p o s i t i v e d e t e c t i o n p 10 0 it is important to keep in mind that the true underlying state i e false or true positive of the detections is unknown at this stage of the modeling we are still dealing with latent state not with actual data the second matrix then summarizes the classification of a true positive detection as unambiguous or ambiguous with probability b and 1 b respectively in this matrix rows represent the above intermediate latent detection states no detection true positive detection false positive detection while columns correspond to actual observations data i e no detection yi j k 0 unambiguous detection yi j k 1 and ambiguous detection yi j k 2 n o d e t e c t i o n b t r u e p o s i t i v e

by definition false detections can only occur in the form of ambiguous detection this last process only deals with the classification of true detection as certain or ambiguous depending on the level of confidence in the observation the overall observation process can then be written in the form of a simple matrix product o pb which gives o u n o c c u p i e d o c c u p i e d n o d e t e c t i o n

could be specified as survey specific j season specific k site specific i or any combination of these effects we can then write the general probability of any detection history h such as p h f i r s t p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n ψ d o y 1 1 1 t 0 d o y 2 1 1 t 0 d o y j 1 1 s e c o n d p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n t d o y 1 2 1 t 0 d o y 2 2 1 t 0 d o y j 2 1 l a s t p r i m a r y o c c a s i o n t d o y 1 k 1 t 0 d o y 2 k 1 t 0 d o y j k 1 1 n where for the sake of simplicity we have dropped the index i for site d θ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to the elements of the arbitrary vector θ o yj k is the column vector corresponding to the observation y at the secondary occasion j during primary occasion k a 0 is the transition matrix with ε γ 0 and 1 n is the column vector of n ones with n the number of occupancy states the likelihood is then the product of the probabilities of all the site histories zucchini et al 2016 in our study on wolves we focused on static single season models such that extinction and colonization events do not occur the probability of any site history h can thus be simplified to p h ψ d o y 1 1 t 0 d o y 2 1 t 0 d o y j 1 2 2 occupancy model with heterogeneity in the detection probability we now show how to incorporate site to site i e spatial heterogeneity in the detection process through the addition of a probabilistic process that assigns any site to a finite number of latent classes royle 2006 miller et al 2015 for the sake of clarity here we only consider two classes of heterogeneity class a and b but more classes could easily be considered like group effects membership to a heterogeneity class is a constant feature of a site i e it does not change over time so the assignation process occurs at the first modelling step describing initial states π c l a s s a c l a s s b π 1 π where π respectively 1 π is the probability for any site to be assigned to class a resp to class b this is the main difference with the model described above the following processes and the associated parameters remain the same except that parameters are now allowed to vary according to the two classes of sites we now define four occupancy states occupied a occupied b unoccupied a and unoccupied b in terms of model parameters in addition to π we now have ψ1a resp ψ1b the probability of initial occupancy for sites of class a resp b ε a resp ε b the probability of local extinction for sites of class a resp b and γ a resp γ b the probability of local colonization for sites of class a resp b pa11 resp pb11 the probability of correctly detecting the species at an occupied site of class a resp b pa10 resp pb10 the probability to falsely detect the species at an unoccupied site a and the probability b to classify a true positive detection as unambiguous miller et al 2011 the next process describes whether a site is initially occupied or not but now conditionally on the site s class membership a or b the pattern matrix that links class membership to the four class specific occupancy states is φ c l a s s a c l a s s b u n o c c u p i e d a 1 ψ 1 a 0 u n o c c u p i e d b 0 1 ψ 1 b o c c u p i e d a ψ 1 a 0 o c c u p i e d b 0 ψ 1 b here rows correspond to the two conditioning states class a and class b and columns represent all possible initial states unoccupied a unoccupied b occupied a and occupied b in columns the final vector of initial state probabilities is therefore the product of the row vector of class assignment proportions and the matrix of occupancy probabilities ψ π φ because we were interested in incorporating heterogeneity in the detection process only here we assume ψ 1 a ψ 1 b ψ 1 the state transition process remains the same but is distinguished according to the two heterogeneity classes a and b this leads us to define the following matrix for state transition from k to k 1 t u n o c c u p i e d a k u n o c c u p i e d b k o c c u p i e d a k o c c u p i e d b k

independently at a sites and b sites as above rows describe occupancy states while columns represent intermediate latent detection states not detection true positive detection false positive detection

in the rest of this paper we focus on static single season models so that ε a ε b γ a γ b 0 2 3 implementation occupancy models formulated as hmms can be implemented in the software e surge choquet et al 2009 which allows for the decomposition of the observation and state processes in multiple steps providing more flexible and often more easily interpretable parameterization gimenez et al 2014 we provide in appendix a and appendix b two detailed step by step procedure to implement occupancy models accounting for false positives with and without heterogeneity in e surge we also refer to the e surge manual choquet and nogue 2011 as well as choquet 2008 and choquet et al 2009 for additional details we also provide in appendix c and appendix d the r r core team 2013 codes to fit the models described above 2 4 simulations we conducted a simulation study to assess performance of two models one accounting for misidentification only and one accounting for both misidentification and heterogeneity first we simulated occupancy data including both unambiguous and ambiguous detections assuming two classes of heterogeneity for false positive probability p10 to characterize and compare heterogeneity among the scenarios considered we define a heterogeneity coefficient as η σ ² μ 1 μ with the mean value of the heterogeneity parameter μ π pa10 1 π pb10 and the variance between components σ² π pa10 μ ² 1 π pb10 μ ² dorazio and royle 2003 cubaynes et al 2012 we considered three scenarios with increasing heterogeneity coefficient by varying parameters π and pb10 table 1 other parameters were held constant pa10 was set at 0 1 the initial occupancy probability ψ1 was set at 0 8 probabilities of true positive pa11 and pb11 were both set at 0 5 and b was set at 0 7 for all simulation runs we used 100 sites with 3 and 10 occasions for each scenario we simulated s 200 datasets and for each dataset fitted both models simulation and analyses were done in the software r see appendix c and appendix d we compared the two models performance using averaged aic differences calculated from the 200 repeated runs we chose the aic because it has been shown to be effective at selecting the number of classes in finite mixture capture recapture models cubaynes et al 2012 for each model we also calculated the relative bias defined as 1 s s 1 s θ ˆ s θ θ and root mean square error rmse for occupancy probability estimates 1 s s 1 s θ ˆ s θ ² we performed a second simulation study considering the same form and levels of heterogeneity but applied to the true detection parameter p11 instead of the false positive detections parameter p10 we tested three scenarios with increasing heterogeneity coefficient by varying parameters π and pb11 every other aspect of this simulation study was the same as in the first simulation study appendix e 2 5 application wolf data to illustrate use of our model accounting for both misidentification and heterogeneity we analyzed wolves detection non detection data collected in france during the year 2013 louvrier et al 2018 signs of presence of the species such as tracks scats prey remains dead wolves camera trap photos or sightings are being collected thanks to a network of professional and non professional observers duchamp et al 2012 the data consisted of 250 unambiguous detections 54 ambiguous detections and 12540 non detections spread over a grid of 3211 10 10 km cells fig 1 to respect the closure assumption sites were visited between december and march which corresponds to a period between the two peaks of dispersal events in spring and fall mech and boitani 2010 in a previous study we found that variability in occupancy probabilities was mostly explained by site s altitude while detection probability was primarily driven by sampling effort defined as the number of observers per site and per year louvrier et al 2018 here we compared four different models all of which included altitude as a covariate on occupancy parameter a first model accounted for misidentification only without heterogeneity in the detection process mmo a second model accounted for misidentification with heterogeneity in both detection probabilities mmh in the last model we accounted for some detection heterogeneity using the sampling effort covariate on both p11 and p10 mms instead of including a finite mixture heterogeneity process sampling effort was indeed quite heterogeneous across space with areas around the alps subject to much higher sampling effort than the rest of the study area we expected sampling effort to capture most of the heterogeneity in the detection parameters which would translate in close aic values for mmh and mms and a lower aic value for mmo finally we fitted a fourth model including both the finite mixture process for unobserved heterogeneity and the sampling effort covariate mmhs this last model allowed assessing the relative fraction of heterogeneity due to sampling effort using the parameter estimates from mmh we finally built a map depicting the estimated assigned classes of heterogeneity for the 3211 sites of the study area this was done with the viterbi algorithm rouan et al 2009 an approach that allows estimation of latent states from hmms although the bayes theorem could be used in this situation where no time series structure is involved the viterbi algorithm is a general approach that can be used in a dynamic occupancy framework 3 results 3 1 simulations results from the simulations with 10 occasions showed that when heterogeneity in false positive probability increased coefficient η going from 0 24 to 0 53 the δaic between mmo and mmh δaic aicmmo aicmmh increased from 6 66 10 23 23 55 to 45 59 7 21 83 97 while both models showed low rmse in terms of occupancy estimation mmh clearly outperformed mmo as heterogeneity increased mmo produced increasingly biased parameters when heterogeneity increased while the bias in mmh always remained low table 1 we found similar results when we considered heterogeneity in the true detection probability p11 mmh clearly outperformed mmo in terms of aic bias and rmse as heterogeneity increased the bias for mmo did not increase but remained important across the range of heterogeneity coefficients appendix e finally with 3 occasions mmh appeared to perform worse than mmo highlighting the need to consider a minimal sampling effort to distinguish false positives and heterogeneity appendix f 3 2 wolf case study we found evidence for heterogeneity in the detection process table 2 with mmo having a much larger aic 2209 49 value than mmh 2084 14 most of this heterogeneity was explained by spatial variation in sampling effort as suggested by the fact that mms had a lower aic value 2071 51 than mmh but even after accounting for sampling effort there remained some unobserved heterogeneity as evidenced by the fact that mmhs still had a lower aic value 1953 26 than mms overall all four models estimated a low occupancy probability table 2 all four models estimated a very low probability of false positive detection p10 fig 2 mmhs estimated that for 70 of sites p10 was equal to zero while for the remaining 30 p10 strongly increased with sampling effort mms results also suggested that p10 strongly increased with sampling effort according to mmh 81 of the sites had a value of p10 similar to the one estimated from mmo for the remaining 19 p10 was equal to zero indicating that virtually no false positive errors occurred at these sites as we could expect both mms and mmhs results suggested that true detection probability p11 strongly increases with sampling effort for both classes of sites mmh estimated p11 quite low at around 0 04 0 02 0 06 for 81 of the sites and high in 19 of the sites fig 3 finally the sites with high detectability corresponded to sites with high sampling effort fig 4 4 discussion while heterogeneity in detection probability has long been studied in the capture recapture literature review in gimenez et al 2017 less attention has been given to this issue in occupancy modeling miller et al 2015 we developed single static and multi season dynamic occupancy models that account for both heterogeneity and false positives benefiting from the flexibility of hmm frameworks to decompose a complex likelihood structure in multiple simpler components more amenable to biological interpretation zucchini et al 2016 using simulations we showed that when ignored detection heterogeneity induces biases in occupancy estimators on a case study on wolves we also found that finite mixture models of detection could be used to capture part of the heterogeneity due to variable sampling efforts we note that although such mixture models are very useful to account for unobserved detection heterogeneity the associated parameters remain difficult to interpret gimenez et al 2017 4 1 advantages of the hmm framework the hmm formulation of occupancy models provides a great flexibility in the way detection heterogeneity and misidentification can be specified first the hmm formulation provides a straightforward mean to modelling the ecological and the observation processes separately pradel 2005 besides each process can be split in multiple steps that match exactly the underlying relevant ecological or observation events making the modeling exercise and interpretation more intuitive to the biologist this latter feature has been illustrated in several capture recapture studies pradel 2005 sanz aguilar et al 2011 avril et al 2012 but it is fairly new for occupancy models gimenez et al 2014 in this study we focused on issues of heterogeneity in the detection process but the framework provided can equally be used to model heterogeneity in occupancy probabilities gimenez et al 2014 we may also allow a site to change heterogeneity status by introducing a transition parameter from class a to class b pradel 2009 gimenez et al 2012 this model could be useful in the wolf case study to accommodate an increase in sampling effort over time and the possibility for some sites with low detectability to get a higher detectability the use of finite mixtures allows capturing relevant levels of heterogeneity without the need to include a large number of explanatory covariates it is however important to keep in mind that parameter redundancy can become an issue as we add more classes of heterogeneity and or choose to apply finite mixtures on several parameters gimenez et al 2014 for instance if we wanted to consider classes of heterogeneity for all parameter occupancy true detection and false detection our model could quickly become too complex gimenez et al 2014 if parameter redundancy is suspected it could be assessed using the methods that have been developed for this purpose choquet and cole 2012 4 2 simulations we considered three scenarios in which the heterogeneity coefficient increased with the proportion of sites of class a and the probability of false positive detections in sites b as expected models ignoring heterogeneity produced biased and imprecise occupancy estimates when heterogeneity was actually increasing those results are the same whether heterogeneity occurs in probabilities of false positive detections or true detections previous studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating covariates when available on the true positive probability to avoid underestimating occupancy parameters miller et al 2015 in absence of measurable candidate covariates we recommend using the finite mixture approach described in this paper an alternative to finite mixtures is to consider a site random effect gimenez et al 2014 an advantage of finite mixture models is that they can easily be fitted in a frequentist or a bayesian framework in contrast site random effects are naturally fitted in a bayesian framework but at the cost of higher computational burden in the frequentist framework site random effects require a specific non trivial treatment of the likelihood e g gimenez and choquet 2010 4 3 wolf case study we found strong evidence of among site heterogeneity in the detection probability of wolves this heterogeneity was mostly explained by spatial variation in sampling effort as expected the probability of true positive detection increased with sampling effort in this study more sampling effort occurs at the core of the species distribution around the alps and in the north eastern part of france fig 1 this variable effort is explained by the fact that in france the first recolonizing wolves were detected in the alps before they started spreading out valière et al 2003 average values of detection parameters estimated by the mmh were close to the average values estimated by the mms and the mmhs highlighting the similarities between these models however the mmh and mms provided slightly different estimates of occupancy probability aic comparison between these two models revealed that sampling effort explains most of the variation in detection probabilities a previous study louvrier et al 2018 had also found strong support for this covariate and the authors had shown that ignoring the effect of sampling effort leads to underestimating occupancy probabilities especially at sites with low effort results from the mmhs confirm this hypothesis as the estimate of occupancy probability was close to the one provided by the mms sampling effort is thus an important covariate to account for but the fact that mmhs had the lowest aic suggests that some unobserved detection heterogeneity remains if sampling effort cannot easily be measured models accounting for unobserved heterogeneity could be used as an alternative to control for detection variability and avoid estimation biases such an approach should prove especially useful for analyses of opportunistic monitoring data collected by large networks of citizens which rely on protocols that rarely include explicit measures of sampling effort the fact that the estimated probability of false positive detection was low suggests that the continuous training over the years of the observers of the network duchamp et al 2012 has been efficient the low value of the false positive detection could also mean that the filtering process of observations was effective part of this filtering process consisted in rejecting detections that could be identified as false positives to avoid noise in the data we can conclude that most false positives may very well have already been rejected during this filtering process based on this fact and the value of the probability to classify a true detection as unambiguous b we could conclude that most of the ambiguous data were actually true positive detections which could be considered as unambiguous detections and analyzed with standard occupancy models however running the model accounting for false positives would still be a necessary step to ensure that false positive probability is extremely low before we decide to treat ambiguous data as true detections in our wolf study winter observations consisted mostly of tracks found in the snow scats carcasses and camera trap photographs duchamp et al 2012 which were all observations that could easily be verified however on the colonization front a larger proportion of detections consisted of visual sightings and because these types of data could not be verified they were therefore classified as ambiguous here integrating these ambiguous data is especially interesting because it brings new information about the wolf distribution on the colonization front these data could thus provide new insights in the context of managing an expanding protected species where new identified sites could help understanding the processes underlying the recolonization of wolves guillera arroita et al 2015 we found from the viterbi algorithm that the sites having the higher true positive probability were those where the sampling effort was high however the fact that the estimated number of sites of class b from the viterbi algorithm is lower than what the mmh estimated can be due to the low value of the occupancy probability this low occupancy estimate can lead to a greater uncertainty in assessing the class of a site rouan et al 2009 despite this fact it is possible to see the link between sampling effort and the two classes of heterogeneity sites belonging to the heterogeneity class a which were primarily found on the colonization front of the species louvrier et al 2018 had a lower detection probability p11 than sites of class b this strongly suggests that the species is less likely to be detected on the colonization front where new conflicts with human activities can arise in conclusion we recommend devoting efforts in the monitoring process to minimize heterogeneity across sites and possibly identifying and measuring covariates that may affect detection probability such as the sampling effort if not possible we recommend using occupancy models accounting for detection heterogeneity if covariates possibly explaining site to site variation cannot be measured in the field the hmm formulation we propose allows an easy implementation of these models data accessibility we provide the scripts to simulate the data in the

25187,we implement a simple hydrodynamical model to study the behavioural swimming tilt angle of open swimbladder fish for this purpose we analysed the force stability which act upon a fish swimming horizontally at a constant velocity furthermore the open swimbladder compression at depth is modelled by boyle s law with these our model gives us an analytical solution relating depth with body tilt angle and velocity an interesting result that surges from steady horizontal swimming is that the body tilt decreases with velocity almost like v 1 moreover we provide an expression for the tilting as function of depth that asymptotically yields the maximum tilt angle additionally by introducing the assumption of constant swimming power we can relate the swimming velocity to the tilting we also show that the hydrodynamical influence of a temperature gradient produced by a thermocline does not seem to affect fish tilting significantly finally we obtain reasonable results by comparing our hydrodynamics solutions with acoustic observations and simulations obtained from of target strength simulations of argentine anchovy engraulis anchoita keywords hydrodynamic analytical model fish tilt angle acoustic target strength physostomous fish 1 introduction the study control and protection of marine ecological resources is carried out in part by in situ acoustic measurements therefore in order to achieve a deeper understanding of marine environment it is necessary to generate more accurate measurements and at the same time acoustic models that correctly interpret the data obtained in hazen and horne 2003 it has been shown that the acoustic measurements of fish are strongly influenced by the angle of swimming more than by size consequently it would be of importance to estimate the swim tilt from a hydrodynamic model dependent on observable variables such as depth or swim speed and anatomical parameters such as swimbladder volume fins area etc teleost fish use their swimbladders to regulate buoyancy regarding this they could be divided into two groups physoclists with a closed swimbladder and physostomes with an open swimbladder morrissey et al 2016 gilles 1991 the physoclist fish has a gas secretion system connected to its bloodstream system through which it can adjust the swimbladder pressure and volume thus allowing it to keep close to neutral buoyancy for different depths on the other hand the physostomous fish that posses a more primitive morphology are incapable of refilling their swimbladders like physoclist instead their swimbladders only seem to be refilled by gulping atmospheric air from the surface blaxter and hunter 1982 blaxter and batty 1984 brawn 1962 it is well known regarding ecological acoustics that the primary reflection of acoustic energy happens at the swimbladder foote 1980a b moreover fish with swimbladders that are comparable or longer than the wavelength are acoustically directive thus small changes in the tilt of the fish can affect significantly the measured target strength ts db re 1 m 2 indeed an incorrect estimation of behavioural tilt angle distribution may spoil the determination of biomass from echoenergy integration the variation of ts as a function of tilt angle has been extensively studied foote 1980a b huse and ona 1996 nakken and olsen 1977 mcquinn and winger 2003 prario et al 2015 kang et al 2005 on the other hand it was suggested that negatively buoyant fishes may opt for a positive body tilt during steady horizontal swimming as a behavioural mechanism to avoid sinking huse and ona 1996 he and wardlet 1986 wilga and lauder 2000 in turn in strand et al 2005 they discussed the energy saving obtained through fish swimming tilt angle by physoclist fish the theoretical modelling of fish target strength involves previous knowledge of fish behaviour i e the tilt angle distribution of fish this is necessary to properly average target strength functions over a certain tilt angle distribution however this knowledge is obtained with considerable difficulty since direct observations of fish swimming tilt angle are rather scarce this is particularly so when ts models aim is to provide a deeper insight into the acoustical scattering of the organisms in the wild which in turn constitutes a major concern for acoustic assessment surveys in this respect we aim to develop a simple model of the fish swimming that can be used to estimate the expected tilt angle adopted by a specific fish species we took into consideration the influence of certain external factors concerning fish behaviour and we concentrate on the particular example of physostomous fish which because of the way it regulates buoyancy frequently performs vertical migrations in the water column and hence is exposed to a significant variation of hydrostatic pressure and the consequential effects on its buoyancy conditions the specific anatomy of fish is taken into account in order to provide an approximate but more realistic source for estimating the average tilt angle of fish in this way we expect to narrow the subjectivity usually associated to the selection of fish tilt angle pdf s for averaging ts functions several authors have studied fish swimming focusing particularly on the hydrodynamics of undulatory propulsion generation sfakiotakis et al 1999 shadwick and lauder 2006 today the preferred simple analytical model of fish swimming kinematics is sir j lighthill s elongated body theory lighthill 1960 1971 which is based on addition of forces due to the lateral acceleration and deceleration of the body as it undulates from side to side our main goal is to develop a simple model to estimate the behavioural tilt angle of physostomous fish in turn this may be easily extended to physoclists and negative buoyant fish without swimbladder specifically we have chosen simplified swimming behaviour by assuming a steady horizontal trajectory in contrast to other swimming strategies like glide and rise which may be adopted for deeper depths huse and ona 1996 tanaka et al 2001 with this treatment we are not intended in giving a comprehensive cover of fish swimming instead we are interested in developing a new model of swimming tilt angle by studying simple hydrodynamics of the body and the pectoral fins independently of the propulsion movements and thrust generation so as to obtain general results within a few parameters with this approach we shall obtain analytical expressions for the tilt angle of fish swimming that may offer a wider insight and should be easily applicable to a variety of species however the model still suffers from lack of validation with experimental e g flume tank experiments and in situ optical data by means of physiological and hydrodynamical arguments we will try to shed some insight on the relation between the tilt angle the swimming depth and the swim velocity of physostomous fish that suffer loss of buoyancy because of swimbladder compression with depth this will help on the construction of simulations of individual ts and volume scattering of fish schools we are presenting the paper in the following manner in section 2 we are introducing the hydrodynamical model from which we obtain a simplified equation relating the tilting angle with depth and swimming velocity in turn we add a constant swimming power hypothesis which yields a tilting dependence due to velocity additionally we take into consideration the effects of the presence of a thermocline in the model in section 3 we test our model against acoustic data and simulations of ts argentine anchovy engraulis anchoita finally in section 5 we discuss the results and submit our conclusions 2 the hydrodynamical model we are studying the hydrodynamic vertical stability of a fish swimming at a stationary velocity and depth for this purpose we consider the different forces acting upon the fish components fins body etc in this approach we will ignore constraints introduced by bioenergetic costs and the efficiency of buoyancy regulation during swimming this last common bioenergetics framework has been modelled by strand et al 2005 for physoclists by including the trade offs between the swimbladder regulation and the hydrodynamics forces furthermore fish are self propelled by undulatory movements thus it is hard to separate thrust generation from their inherited drag forces schultz and webb 2002 however if we assume that these movements are confined to a reduced portion of the posterior fish body and or the caudal fin then we can approximate the fish body as a rigid body indeed in such cases we can consider that the fish body behaves in a hydrodynamic manner similar to a torpedo shaped body travelling with a definite tilt angle jorgensen 1973 evans 2003 in this way we take into consideration the simplification that the interactions between the fluid and the fish body are independent of the thrust generating undulatory movements such simplified approach was also chosen by strand et al 2005 2 1 forces during stationary swimming in fig 1 we summarized the forces acting upon the fish while swimming horizontally with a velocity v in body length per second ℓ s and tilt θ in degree the thrust force t all forces in newtons n is the consequence of the propulsion obtained from the specific fish swimming mode in the carangiform and the thunniform swimming modes the thrust is obtained from the body and caudal fin thrown into a wave with as much as up to one half wavelength along the length of body webb 1975 indeed we expect that our study may only be limited to these undulatory modes on the other hand swimming with stationary velocity and depth determines particular behaviour or swimming strategy given by stationaries tilt and thrust other swimming strategies can be studied where the tilt and thrust are not constant videler 1993 taylor et al 2010 sfakiotakis et al 1999 the apparent weight w is a force that always appears on submerged bodies which is the resultant between the archimedes force and the weight of the fish this force changes with depth as the swimbladder compresses if the fish has negative apparent weight at the surface with w pointing upwards it means that floats on water then in order to gain depth it will need to nose downwards with a negative tilt angle eventually at a certain depth the average fish density equals the water density reaching the neutral buoyant depth however this is an unstable point since below of this depth w changes sign pointing downwards and the fish starts to sink then for the fish to swim at a constant depth this positive apparent weight should be compensated by some other vertical forces essentially there will be two kinds lift forces and the vertical component of the thrust force for a swimming tilt angle hydrodynamical lift l while swimming may be obtained mainly from pectoral fins acting as hydrofoils and from body lift additionally hovering behaviour may be used but in this case the fish is not moving and cannot be combined with the other forces finally the drag forces d that always oppose to the flow direction manifest as pressure drag and friction drag there is an extensive bibliography on the study of the hydrodynamics and aerodynamics acting either on biological creatures or engineering systems webb 1975 1988 vogel 1996 norberg 1990 faa 2012 mcneill 1982 the steady motion assumption implies that all forces balance thus there is no acceleration from newton laws we obtain 1 l w t sin θ 0 2 t cos θ d 0 where θ is the angle between oblique thrust t and horizontal velocity v we can combine both equations to get 3 w l d tan θ in this paper we shall keep as simple as possible and we shall ignore the moments stability analysis however a more detailed study on particular fish species should incorporate this issue 2 2 swimbladder and body compression some of the strategies of nature to achieve buoyancy are the lipid or oil reservoirs in the fish flesh which help to reduce the averaged fish density ρ b all densities in kg m 3 shadwick and lauder 2006 alexander 1990 in turn other fish posses the gas filled swimbladder organ that aims to the same purpose we shall consider that the open swimbladder follows boyle s law contraction rate gorska and ona 2003 nero et al 2004 which means that 4 v sb z v sb 0 1 ρ g p 0 z 1 where z in m is the depth below water surface v sb z is the swimbladder volume at a depth z with v sb 0 v sb 0 ρ is the water density g in m s 2 is the gravity acceleration and p 0 in n m 2 is the atmospheric pressure at sea level moreover we assume that the mean flesh density is practically constant in spite of the swimbladder contraction with the depth thus the loss of volume by the swimbladder is followed by an equal loss of external volume in the fish body v sb z v sb 0 v b z v b 0 where v b z is the volume of the entire fish at depth z using these considerations we obtain an expression for the apparent weight depth dependence 5 w z ρ b ρ g v b 0 v sb 0 ρ g v sb 0 1 z z 1 where ρ b is the mean fish density and z p 0 ρ g 10 m is a reference depth at which the swimbladder shrinks to half the volume from the sea level value v sb 0 thus the apparent weight increases hyperbolically from 6 w 0 ρ b ρ g v b 0 ρ b g v sb 0 at sea level z 0 to deep values where the swimbladder is totally collapsed 7 w ρ b ρ g v b 0 v sb 0 for z z the difference between these values is w w 0 ρ g v sb 0 we can further define the neutral buoyancy depth z n obtained from the condition w z n 0 it is easy to see that 8 z n z w 0 w as a consequence when the fish flesh is denser than the sea water w 0 and then in order to obtain positive buoyancy w 0 0 2 3 tilting depth dependence by combining eq 3 with 5 we obtain 9 z θ v z 1 f θ v f 0 1 where we have defined 10 f θ v d θ v tan θ l θ v ρ g v sb 0 v 2 f 1 θ 11 f 0 ρ b ρ 1 v b 0 v sb 0 1 eqs 9 11 are the main results of the paper they give the depth at which the forces on the fish balance for a steady horizontal swimming with velocity v and tilting θ in appendix a we present some expressions for the estimation of d and l forces and we discuss the validity of the factorization v 2 f 1 θ in eq 10 it is not possible though to obtain an exact analytical expression θ θ z v from eq 9 still we have checked that f 1 θ behaves practically like a quadratic function in the range of studied parameters therefore by keeping to order θ 2 in the power expansion of f 1 θ we obtain 12 f 1 θ 1 2 g v sb 0 2 s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 θ c a p θ 2 where the parameters in the expansion are detailed in appendix a using eqs 9 12 we can solve the tilting angle depth dependence 13 θ z v s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 a p c 1 2 g v sb 0 a p c s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 2 ρ b ρ 1 v b 0 v sb 0 1 z z z 1 v 2 1 in fig 2 we compare the functions z θ from the exact expression eq 9 solid line with the approximation from eq 13 dashed line for swimming velocities v ℓ s 1 0 1 5 2 0 and fish flesh density ρ b kg m 3 1060 we also assumed absence of lift from pectoral fins k 0 thus all the hydrodynamic lift comes from body lift the parameters used from now on correspond to a representative specimen of argentine anchovy and they are given in the table of section 3 1 unless stated otherwise we remark that the approximation is good within a maximum error of about 1 for v 1 ℓ s firstly we can identify that for a fish flesh density ρ b 1060 kg m 3 neutral buoyancy is achieved near the sea surface indeed all constant velocity curves will generally meet at z z n because nevertheless the velocity and to keep horizontal swimming at that depth there is no need of any lift forces hence the body tilting will remain zero of course this situation occurs whenever there is no lift happening at the pectoral fins or any asymmetry in the body shape that can either generate any lift force at zero angle of attack it is immediate to see that the tilting θ increases with depth to a maximum asymptotic value θ max as z z the value of θ max is given by this last expression without the z dependent term the tilting decreases at an approximate rate v 1 as could be seen in eq 13 this happens because the main contribution comes from θ 2 term in eq 12 that belongs to the planform area of the fish this result is in concordance with experimental fits θ v v 1 14 obtained for trout in webb 1993 through flume tanks experiments in this way the faster the fish swims the less tilt it needs to achieve stability because at faster movement the lift forces grow allowing to reach the body stability with less tilt fig 2 he and wardlet 1986 svendsen et al 2005 otherwise the tilting will be enhanced for denser fishes because an extra component of vertical thrust is needed to cancel the extra weight this should be evident in fig 3 where tilting curves are plotted for different densities ρ b kg m 3 1050 1060 1070 and v ℓ s 1 0 thus we can see how for more negative buoyant fish the body tilt angle of attack at the sea surface increases in particular for a flesh density 1050 kg m 3 the buoyancy at surface is positive because the averaged density of the fish including the swimbladder is lower than the water density in this case the fish should either swim with negative tilt or lose some air of the swimbladder to keep stable in fig 3 we see that the curve cannot reach the surface even if swimming with negative tilt angle this means that there is no hydrodynamic solution for the fish to maintain a horizontal swim under such circumstances anyway the fish could either shift to oblique swimming to reach sea surface or use negative angle of attack of pectoral fins to achieve the needed negative lift this situation becomes clear in fig 4 in this case we considered pectoral fins lift k 2 π so for negative angles the tilt curve could reach z 0 2 4 constant swimming power assumption the swimming power developed by the fish is p tv cos θ thus by using eq 2 we get p dv and by assuming a constant swimming power csp we can obtain an equation that relates the horizontal velocity with the tilt angle 14 d θ v v d 0 v 0 v 0 cte where we have established a constant power defined by the reference value θ 0 and its reference velocity v 0 the maximum horizontal velocity this expression introduces a restriction between the behavioural variables θ and v that is explicitly independent of the depth z it is also important to note that given that the drag coefficient depends on the velocity see appendix a this equation is transcendental in v and should be solved by numerical methods as we can see in the right plot of fig 5 the maximum velocity is obtained for θ 0 where all the power developed is spent on moving whilst when swimming with tilt angle a fraction of the power is used to keep at a certain depth previously we discussed in section 2 3 that there exists an asymptotic θ max v for z θ v in eq 13 in the csp context this corresponds with an asymptotic decrease of the horizontal velocity with the depth up to a minimum v min see left plot of fig 5 in turn the velocity also decays monotonically with the body tilt as in wilga and lauder 2000 nowroozi et al 2009 svendsen et al 2005 webb 1975 in the right plot of fig 5 we marked the intersections of the curves v θ with the curve θ max v that determine the asymptotic minimum velocities v min for given v 0 in the csp model therefore the curves to the right of the intersection points have no physical sense the recordings made for herrings at night by huse and ona 1996 support our results in this case instead of increasing swimming speed the fish adopted a swimming tilt angle strategy moreover the observed velocities were slower at deeper depths and vice versa we would like to remark that we are considering a stationary horizontal swimming strategy and that another swimming strategy e g glide and rise could give slower or faster velocities than this model 2 5 effects of other environmental factors the thermocline in this section we consider the effects on fish buoyancy that could be triggered by a sharp change in physical parameters of water column the particular case of a strong temperature gradient is analyzed but similar results could be expected by strong gradients on the salinity and thus affecting water density in a similar way from eq 13 it can be seen that the fish tilt angle depends on both physiological and environmental sets of parameters as examples of the first set are the body area a the flesh density ρ b the swimbladder volume on surface v sb 0 etc we consider these parameters constant for a specific fish specimen in the second set are for example the water density ρ and water viscosity μ both of which are temperature dependent talley et al 2011 ioc 2010 the region of higher vertical temperature gradient in the column of seawater is called the thermocline at this place the temperature decreases rapidly from the mixed layer temperature roughly that of surface water to the colder deep water temperature we want to quantify how much fish tilt swim would be affected from the hydrodynamics by the variation of the environmental parameters with temperature although the water density and the water viscosity change with the temperature in the usual thermocline temperature range the viscosity variation introduces negligible changes in the final result see discussion of c in a 1 1 hence the primarily temperature contribution will come from the change in the water density in fig 6 we plot the effects of a thermocline at z 40 m with a temperature variation from t 1 20 c to t 2 10 c the values of depth and themperature gradient of the thermocline have been obtained form madirolas et al 2017 we observe that a small drop in the tilting δ θ 1 is produced by this temperature gradient in the same way we presume that the variations in the salinity will not be considerable in this respect we consider that a change of tilting of the order of 1 is small in comparison with the error from the behavioural component of the tilt swimming that we do not consider here for example in fréon and misund 1999 the authors mention that physiological changes are produced when fishes go through the thermocline they detect a drastic decrease of cardiac rhythm when fish carries out vertical excursion such decrease will bring a variation in swimming speed and possibly a variation in the swim tilt to accommodate the new buoyancy condition however the cause of this change is not hydrodynamic but physiological we call the behavioural component of the tilt swimming to this type of phenomena and they are not considered in the present hydrodynamic model also we can imagine that the horizontal steady swimming strategy could shift to another swimming strategy when going through the thermocline this change may again occur because of behavioural reasons and not only from hydrodynamical effects certainly a change in the swimming strategy may introduce bigger changes in the fish tilting than the thermocline effect on the horizontal steady swimming for example if the fish chooses different swimming strategies for different depths or times of the day huse and ona 1996 paoletti and mahadevan 2014 for the aforementioned we conclude that the presence of such a thermocline will not introduce significant changes in the tilting of hydrodynamic origin 3 an example with argentine anchovy in this section we shall study the previous implications for a particular fish argentine anchovy we are particularly interested in this fish because recently in madirolas et al 2017 there were reported in situ target strenght ts measurements where they suggested an increasing body tilting behaviour with depth furthermore they suggested a tilting vs depth behaviour by simulating theoretical ts functions for some scenarios of swimbladder contraction and tilt angle distributions we wish to compare the predicted ts obtained from psm simulations with the in situ acoustic measurements in doing so we will use the tilt angle obtained from the hydrodynamic model as input for the mean tilt of simulated average ts we next give the parameters used in the hydrodynamic model to calculate the tilt angle from eqs 9 or 13 3 1 hydrodynamic model parameters some of the parameters used in the present example correspond to the ones in madirolas et al 2017 obtained from x ray tomography for a representative specimen on the other hand we choose standard representative values for the seawater parameters table 1 we adopted the value κ 0 which implies that we are not considering lift generated by the pectoral fins l f 0 moreover this means the absence of any drag of the fins d f d i 0 see appendix a the choice of this parameter was made for simplicity reasons given that there are no measurements of κ for this fish some typical values of κ range between π and 2 π in particular for slender aerofoils like naca 2306 6306 etc with κ 1 4 π or naca 6506 with κ 1 2 π jacobs et al 1935 hoerner and borst 1975 if such lift fins contributions are included we found that the tilt drops about 5 the difficulty of determining the value of this parameter resides primarily on the fact that it depends strongly on the fish behaviour there is a wide range of possible fin movements some fishes are able to control every fin ray separately they can deform the fins or retract them or rotate the rays at willing videler 1993 indeed this correction appears to be meaningful thus it would be interesting to orient some future investigations in this direction 3 2 comparative with acoustic data authors in madirolas et al 2017 obtained an experimental curve for average acoustic backscattering strength ts for the nighttime scattering layer of argentine anchovy 15 ts exp ℓ z 31 3 log ℓ 79 6 4 74 log 1 z 10 furthermore they used a prolate spheroidal model psm prario et al 2015 to simulate the variation of the average ts with depth z for a distribution function with mean tilt θ and standard deviation sd in that opportunity the anatomy of the anchovy swimbladder was obtained from x ray computed tomography ct scanning in this work we repeated the same runs of the psm simulations with the same parameters table 2 as used in madirolas et al 2017 in this sense we considered coherent contributions of the three backscattering sources the dual chambered swimbladder and the anchovy body the ts outputs were averaged over the tilt angle through a gaussian window with mean θ and standard deviation sd a detail discussion of the ts simulations is given in appendix b if we assume that anchovies are neutrally buoyant near the surface and considering the loss of buoyancy with depth due to swimbladder compression a reasonable interpretation of these simulations with the experimental data is that the mean tilt angle increases with depth indeed this is a swimming strategy chosen by fish to avoid sinking in this work we deduced using a hydrodynamic picture some expressions that can give quantitative estimations for these tilt changes with depth variations with these ideas we combined the hydrodynamical model of tilted swimming with the psm simulations in this sense we considered that the hydrodynamical prediction of eqs 9 or 13 for θ z v would correspond with the statistical mean tilt angle θ in fig 7 we show the results of evolving θ with the hydrodynamic equations for horizontal velocities v ℓ s 1 5 2 2 5 and using sd 20 at first sight when comparing with the experimental function and assuming that the dispersion in the tilt angle does not change the simulations would imply that there is a slight decay in the velocity when the tilt changes such conclusion is reasonable in the fact that when tilting some of the power of swimming is spent propelling water downwards on the other side using sd 10 we can see in fig 8 left plot that the experimental curve is much more compatible with such simulation at deeper depths 30 m these results are improved when considering csp in the simulations right plot to conclude we observe that for shallower depths the hydrodynamics curves are compatible with acoustic data for sd 20 while for deeper depths the tendencies agree with a more polarized swimming sd 10 15 we shall interpret this situation in terms of the change of the swimming stability with the depth if we introduce a small perturbation δ θ from an equilibrium tilt θ with v constant the corresponding change in the drag δ d and the lift δ l shall increase for bigger θ thus for the fish to recover the equilibrium it will need a stronger δ t for bigger θ we show this effect in fig 9 where we can observe that the derivative of the thrust t computed from eq 2 it increases practically in the considered tilt range yet there may exist a range of small angles where the derivative is negative sourced by the drag term proportional to c cos 3 θ see eq 25 which all the same appears to be residual 4 discussion in spite of the substantial influence that fish tilted swimming have on the acoustic backscatter response direct observations of fish swimming tilt angle are rather scarce in this way the add on of the present hydrodynamical model to ts simulations can be used to perform a more physically realistic acoustic modelling the present model arises from an attempt to optimize the relation between the simplicity of its formulation and the generality of results we obtained an analytical model that is applicable to physostomous fish more specifically to thunniform and carangiform swimmers eq 13 we highlight the advantage that analytical models show in which the action and relevance of the variables and parameters involved can be explicitly identified due to the simplicity of the model we cannot expect to be accurate but rather approximate trying to rescue the principal factors that dominate dynamics however this fact is not a relevant problem necessarily because tilted swimming usually has a behavioural component not considered in the hydrodynamical model that increases the standard deviation beyond what would be physically expected making unnecessary more accuracy it is a physical fact that a swimming fish generates vortices in its wake rosen 1959 webb 1975 müller et al 1997 shadwick et al 1999 lauder and drucker 2002 so it follows that individuals in a school swimming behind each other will encounter vortices from the propulsive wakes of preceding members indeed fish in schools can benefit from altered flows using two distinct though not mutually exclusive mechanisms flow refuging and harnessing energy from vortex capture these mechanisms can theoretically increase the thrust of an individual by tens of percentages without additional energy expenditure nevertheless such schooling altered flows will in principle break down any predictability derived from the steady flow assumption of individual fish discussed in the present work in fact much less is known about effects of hydrodynamics that deviate from steady conditions numerous field and laboratory studies have shown that fish can reduce locomotory costs by exploiting turbulence generated by water moving past physical structures or by the propulsive movements of other fishes breder 1965 weihs 1973 herskin and steffensen 1998 hinch and rand 1998 liao et al 2003b under these circumstances turbulence may be considered a feature of the hydrodynamic environment that is a benefit rather than a constraint by the way observations of individual positions in a school have provided useful information but still almost no hydrodynamic or physiological data exist to evaluate the hypothesis that fish can increase swimming performance by taking advantage of the wake of other members liao 2007 we remark then that our hydrodynamical model in general will not be applicable for compact fish schools where the presence of altered flows and vortices dominate the water dynamics in spite of this it could happen that disperse slow moving fish flocks will minimize the presence of turbulence allowing for our predictions to be appropriate yet first our model should be tested and validated against direct observations of individual fish before trying to extend it to fish schools this is a new theoretical treatment and so still suffers from lack of validation with experimental e g flume tank experiments and in situ optical data however as a first approach this validation may also be carried out by numerical simulations that model the complete hydrodynamic picture for example this can be applied for thunniform and carangiform swimmers sfakiotakis et al 1999 by introducing the hydrostatics of the open swimbladder we do expect that corrections may indeed appear to our framework when including the undulatory phenomenology the thrust generation and the swimming bio energetics all the same there are experimental reports that support our results in he and wardlet 1986 svendsen et al 2005 nowroozi et al 2009 they obtained experimental curves that show a decresing of tilt angle with velocity in agree with eq 13 webb 1993 obtain an empirical fitting that relate tilt angle and swimming velocity according to θ v 1 14 0 41 for steelhead trout this result is compatible with our prediction θ v 1 of eq 13 finally we predict a decrease in the swimming velocity and an increase of tilt angle of horizontally swimming fish that are suitable with the observations of norwegian herring made by huse and ona 1996 we emphasize that our model is a simplification and therefore has left out some important effects our results should be interpreted as mean values that coincide with fish that under certain conditions have an average behaviour or swimming strategy that is related to steady horizontal swimming this hydrodynamical model is not applicable when fish deviate significantly from this behaviour indeed other swimming strategies would surely involve other dynamic equations maybe involving accelerations and oblique trajectories a natural generalization of the model should include a rigorous estimation of significant parameters such as κ in the lift fins the incorporation of the hydrodynamic aspects of the modes swimming propulsion as well as the comparison of results between different swimming strategies this last point will be the subject of our next project 5 conclusions we implemented from first principles a model for physostomus fish that describes the relation between hydrodynamical forces and body tilt during stationary swimming velocity at certain depth to study swimming stability we took into account thrust drag and lift forces and the apparent weight the last depends on swimbladder volume for which we adopted boyle s law to describe compression at depth taking these considerations into account we obtained an analytical expression for depth as a function of body tilting and swimming velocity these last variables have a hydrodynamical component considered in the model and a behavioural component that is not considered we found that in rather general conditions for fixed tilting θ swimming depth z changes hyperbolically as v 2 moreover we obtained a useful approximate expression eq 13 for fish tilting as a function of depth and the swimming velocity that behaves like v 1 hence for faster swimming the fish will need less body tilting for a fixed z to the contrary more dense fish will need more body tilting to cancel out the extra weight additionally from eq 13 one can identify for each swimming velocity a maximum tilt θ max when z z 10 m we analysed hydrodynamic changes that a thermocline would produce in fish swimming behaviour in spite of the presence of the temperature gradient we found that the effects of the thermocline with body tilt are small δ θ 1 for δ t 10 c thus we concluded that the thermocline does not affect fish tilting of hydrodynamic origin significantly however there could be changes of tilt swimming of behavioural origin not contemplated in the hydrodynamical model the knowledge of body tilt distribution for fish is of utmost importance for fisheries acoustics given that backscattering strength is mainly originated at the exposed fish area we tested the present hydrodynamical model and the hypothesis of constant swimming power csp against in situ ts measurements and simulated data for argentine anchovy madirolas et al 2017 in that case they commented that the lack of the observed ts with depth could not be explained by swimbladder compression only suggesting a behavioural tilting thus in this work we associated this difference with a quantitative combination of swimbladder compression and body tilting excursion with depth by means of hydrodynamic arguments from the comparison between the acoustic observation with the psm simulations combined with the mean tilt angle prediction from the hydrodynamic model we found that body tilting standard deviation may show a slight decreasing trend with depth unless a different swimming strategy is selected we gave an interpretation of these results in terms of stability acknowledgements we wish to thank adrian madirolas inidep for providing us the psm simulated data needed to compare to our model for useful discussions in fisheries acoustics and the hospitality we received at inidep we are also grateful with guido bacino conicet for discussions and help in oceanography and constanza brasesco conicet for manuscript corrections appendix a hydrodynamic forces in this appendix we shall consider analytical expressions for the drag d and lift l forces in fig 10 we plotted generic solutions for the total d and l that we encountered all through the paper as we can observe for small tilt angles the drag force dominates the lift but for bigger θ they both grow becoming comparable a 1 lift force the lift l is produced by the dynamic effect of the water acting on the fish it appears when an object changes the direction of flow of the water this force is the hydrodynamic force orthogonal to the swimming direction it helps to swim at a certain depth by stabilizing with the negative buoyant force reaching to supply up to half of the force necessary to avoid sinking nowroozi et al 2009 we shall consider two sources of lift force from the pectoral fins l f and from the fish body l b thus the total lift is given by 16 l l b l f 1 2 ρ v 2 a r c lb s r c lf where a r and s r are the reference areas of the body and the fins respectively and c lb and c lf are dimensionless lift coefficients that relate the fluid variables ρ and v to the lift force on the body and the fins respectively a 1 1 body lift jorgensen 1973 obtained some heuristic and theoretical formulas for predicting hydrodynamic forces on a streamlined body in terms of the angle of attack the original formulas give the axial c a and normal c n coefficients with respect to the fish length yet for our calculations we need the lift and drag coefficients so we performed a rotation of the coordinate system at an angle θ so as to relate c a and c n with c l and c d thus for the lift coefficient we obtain 17 c lb c n cos θ c a sin θ c v a a r cos 2 θ sin θ c s a s a r sin 2 θ cos θ cos θ 2 c v a p a r sin 2 θ cos θ where c s is usually referred to as the apparent mass factor that depends on the ratio l r in our case c s 1 for streamlined bodies a s is the area of the body stern a r is the reference area a p is the planform area of the fish body the maximum projected area a is the body or wetted area note that the global factor a r 1 will simplify with the factor a r in eq 16 c is the total axial drag at zero angle of attack which is composed by friction and pressure contributions to estimate the value of the friction through the coefficient c fric we need to express it in terms of the reynolds number webb 1975 defined by 18 r ℓ ρ ℓ v μ where ρ is the water density ℓ is the fish large v the fish velocity and μ the water viscosity essentially there are three types of flows depending on the reynolds number with their respective functions of the friction coefficient webb 1975 19 c f r i c b 1 33 r ℓ 1 2 l a m i n a r 0 072 r ℓ 1 5 1700 r ℓ 1 t r a n s i t i o n a l 0 072 r ℓ 1 5 t u r b u l e n t these formulas give an estimation of the friction coefficient in the laminar transitional and turbulent flow regimes respectively the change of the laminar to transitional regimes is governed by a reynolds number around 5 10 5 in our case r ℓ 10 4 therefore we shall work in the laminar regime on the other hand for streamlined bodies the pressure component can be related to the friction coefficient and to the ratio between the maximum diameter 2 r and the length ℓ 20 c press b c fric b g 2 r ℓ where g x 1 5 x 3 2 7 x 3 with these expressions we can define the total axial drag as 21 c c fric b c press b c fric b 1 g c is the cross flow drag coefficient for a finite cylinder section we shall use the empirical formula c v η 1 10 r n 2 3 proposed by white white 1991 and vogel vogel 1996 with a normal reynolds number r n θ r 2 r sin θ 2 r ρ v sin θ μ we have introduced the correction factor η for finite cylinder in the formula which in our case 0 82 jorgensen 1973 we have tested that in the range of reynolds number of interest the variation of c with the velocity introduces minimal changes to the final result thus we keep a constant coefficient slightly bigger than η 22 c v c η the first term in 17 corresponds to lift generated by a finite body stern area and may in general be small for streamlined fishes the second term produces a small negative lift coming from the frontal area of the head lastly in general the third term produces most of the lift that comes from the longitudinal body area exposed to cross flow when tilting is present these three terms are shown in the left plot of fig 11 while in the right plot we compare the angular dependence of body and fins lift a 1 2 fins lift we shall use for the fins the usual simplified expression for hydrofoils webb 1975 23 c lf κ sin α with α the angle of attack with respect to the flow direction and κ a constant that depends on the form of the fins for a hydrofoil there exists a critical angle α crit for which above of this value the flow becomes strongly distorted and the value of c l rapidly decays in this situation it is said that the hydrofoil stalls in this work we shall consider that the fish can control the stall situation by changing the angle of attack of the pectoral fins in this sense we assume that α θ for θ α crit π 10 while for θ α crit then α α crit and the coefficient remains almost constant in a way that maximizes the lift force of the fins 1 1 indeed a simpler assumption would be to consider a constant lift coefficient that maximizes the lift force c lf κ sin α crit see fig 11 a 2 drag force the drag d is the resistance force caused by the motion of a body through a fluid the drag force always opposes to the fish velocity we shall study the drag on the pectoral fins acting as hydrofoils and on the rest of the body these are also given by a similar expression as for the lift force 24 d d b d f 1 2 ρ v 2 a r c db s r c df d i where c db and c df are the body and fins drag coefficients respectively and d i is the induced drag that we shall analyse later in this section a 2 1 body drag analogously to how the body lift coefficient was written the body drag coefficient is related to c a and c n in the following way 25 c db c n sin θ c a cos θ c s a s a r sin 2 θ sin θ cos θ 2 c a p a r sin 3 θ c a a r cos 3 θ the coefficients c s c and c were defined previously in the body lift section these three terms are shown in the left plot of fig 12 while in the right plot we compare the angular dependence of body and fins drag a 2 2 fins drag the drag of the fins will be given by the sum of three terms the friction d fric f and pressure drag d press f which speak of the direct interaction of the fluid on the fins and the induced drag d i which comes whenever lift is present at hydrofoils the first two terms will have a friction c fric f and a pressure component c press f defined by a reynolds number calculated with the fins chord c and span b thus we write 26 d fric f d press f 1 2 ρ v 2 4 bc c fric f 2 bc sin θ c press f where the area 4 bc corresponds to the total wetted area of both pectoral fins while 2 bc sin θ is the area frontal to the flow direction for an angle of attack α θ moreover we have assumed that the contribution of the transversal area of the fins is negligible the magnitude of the pressure coefficient for a hydrofoil can be approximately related to the thickness ratio τ webb 1975 27 c press f c press f 0 0056 0 01 τ 0 1 τ 2 where c press f is the pressure component associated to the relative camber webb 1975 for our calculations we shall assume that the fins thickness ratio is very small τ 1 and that the camber is small also thus c press f 0 0056 furthermore we obtain that the pressure drag on the pectoral fins will be much smaller than the friction drag 2 2 for a flat plate normal to the incident flow the drag force is mostly from pressure forces and then it is independent of r ℓ however this corresponds to a critical situation where the fish fins would have an angle of attack α 90 which we consider a rather odd situation for steady swimming the third drag term is a consequence of the work that the hydrofoil makes on the fluid to push it downwards thus d i is associated to the reaction of giving kinetic energy to the fluid by the fins we have used an estimate given by momentum jet theory norberg 1990 28 d i 2 π b 2 ρ v 2 l f 2 using expression 24 we can deduce a coefficient c d i c l 2 ar where ar b 2 s f is the aspect ratio given by the relation between the fin span and the fin area a 3 demonstration of the factorization v 2 f 1 θ let us consider the expression d θ v tan θ l θ v of eq 10 if we take into account the corresponding term c of l b and the respective of d b they cancel each other furthermore as we discussed in a 1 1 we can consider a constant c if we additionally consider that the viscous and pressure drag contribution from the fins is negligible and the remaining lift and drag terms are all proportional to v 2 then we can factorize a global factor as in eq 10 appendix b prolate spheroidal acoustic model psm the far field backscattered sound wave of individual fish is defined at linear order through the coherent sum of the backscattering amplitude functions of swimbladder f sb soft spheroid and fish body f b fluid spheroid prario et al 2015 argentine anchovy posses a dual chambered swimbladder thus for the simulation we considered the contribution of both independent sources madirolas et al 2017 the total backscattering cross section is then computed as 29 σ bs f sb 1 e 2 i c 0 c 1 k δ 1 f sb 2 e 2 i c 0 c 2 k δ 2 f b 2 with sound velocities inside the swimbladder chambers c 1 c 2 the coherent sum of the sources is performed by the complex nature of backscattering functions moreover exponential phase factors are important because they account for the spatial displacements between the spheroids centers in the psm picture the fish body parts are approximated by equivalent spheroids therefore backscattering functions are expanded in prolate spheroidal functions so as to easily fulfil with the boundary conditions moreover anchovy morphometry was obtained by madirolas et al 2017 from ct scanning in the present work we repeated the same modelling parameters see table 2 these consisted on assuming that the widths of soft spheroids are such that the measured dorsal area of swimbladder chambers coincide with that of their equivalent spheroids also the lengths of the soft spheroids would be equal to the corresponding swimbladder chamber on the other side the width of the fluid spheroid was chosen so as to keep the same volume with the fish body while lengths stayed equal in order to study the vertical ts variations we assumed boyle s law for volume changes of the swimbladder chambers with hydrostatic pressure however swimbladder contractions could be anisotropic thus we adopted the following equations to describe changes in the gas filled spheroids dimensions gorska and ona 2003 30 a sb z a sb 0 1 z z α 31 ℓ sb z ℓ sb 0 1 z z β where a sb 0 and ℓ sb 0 are the spheroids diameter and length at sea surface respectively moreover to comply with boyle s law the exponents should satisfy the constraint equation 2 α β 1 isotropic compression then implies α β 1 3 while pure transverse compression is achieved for α 1 2 and β 0 all simulations were carried out using pure transverse compression that as was suggested by madirolas et al 2017 would be compatible with a tilted swimming behaviour of anchovies with depth in this same work they identified that an isotropic compression yields incompatible results while there exists a marginal intermediate compression scenario α 0 37 and β 0 26 that would indicate no tilting behaviour at all at the moment these exponents are fairly unknown for argentine anchovy however for instance herring morphometry of the swimbladder compression with varying pressure was examined using magnetic resonance imaging by fässler et al 2009 in this sense to completely validate the present framework analogous experiments should be carried out for anchovies in the future in fig 13 we plotted ts outputs for three different depths z m 0 10 and 40 obtained from psm simulations it can be seen that the ts function is peaked at θ 5 because we used a 5 inclination of the swimbladder longitudinal axis relative to the fish body length to compare with experimental fits we averaged the simulated backscattering cross sections over the tilt angle the averaging was done through a gaussian window with mean θ and standard deviation sd in fig 14 we plotted points for depths z m 0 10 20 30 40 50 of averaged ts for sd 20 left plot and sd 10 right plot and for mean angles θ 10 0 10 15 20 in addition the curves are best fits to the two parameter function ts sim θ sd z a θ sd 10 γ θ sd log 1 z 10 we note that the fitting parameters a and γ will depend solely on the averaging variables θ and sd as a reference we included the experimental fit function ts exp l z with l 14 7 cm as going to deeper depths this function intersects different simulation curves ts sim 
25187,we implement a simple hydrodynamical model to study the behavioural swimming tilt angle of open swimbladder fish for this purpose we analysed the force stability which act upon a fish swimming horizontally at a constant velocity furthermore the open swimbladder compression at depth is modelled by boyle s law with these our model gives us an analytical solution relating depth with body tilt angle and velocity an interesting result that surges from steady horizontal swimming is that the body tilt decreases with velocity almost like v 1 moreover we provide an expression for the tilting as function of depth that asymptotically yields the maximum tilt angle additionally by introducing the assumption of constant swimming power we can relate the swimming velocity to the tilting we also show that the hydrodynamical influence of a temperature gradient produced by a thermocline does not seem to affect fish tilting significantly finally we obtain reasonable results by comparing our hydrodynamics solutions with acoustic observations and simulations obtained from of target strength simulations of argentine anchovy engraulis anchoita keywords hydrodynamic analytical model fish tilt angle acoustic target strength physostomous fish 1 introduction the study control and protection of marine ecological resources is carried out in part by in situ acoustic measurements therefore in order to achieve a deeper understanding of marine environment it is necessary to generate more accurate measurements and at the same time acoustic models that correctly interpret the data obtained in hazen and horne 2003 it has been shown that the acoustic measurements of fish are strongly influenced by the angle of swimming more than by size consequently it would be of importance to estimate the swim tilt from a hydrodynamic model dependent on observable variables such as depth or swim speed and anatomical parameters such as swimbladder volume fins area etc teleost fish use their swimbladders to regulate buoyancy regarding this they could be divided into two groups physoclists with a closed swimbladder and physostomes with an open swimbladder morrissey et al 2016 gilles 1991 the physoclist fish has a gas secretion system connected to its bloodstream system through which it can adjust the swimbladder pressure and volume thus allowing it to keep close to neutral buoyancy for different depths on the other hand the physostomous fish that posses a more primitive morphology are incapable of refilling their swimbladders like physoclist instead their swimbladders only seem to be refilled by gulping atmospheric air from the surface blaxter and hunter 1982 blaxter and batty 1984 brawn 1962 it is well known regarding ecological acoustics that the primary reflection of acoustic energy happens at the swimbladder foote 1980a b moreover fish with swimbladders that are comparable or longer than the wavelength are acoustically directive thus small changes in the tilt of the fish can affect significantly the measured target strength ts db re 1 m 2 indeed an incorrect estimation of behavioural tilt angle distribution may spoil the determination of biomass from echoenergy integration the variation of ts as a function of tilt angle has been extensively studied foote 1980a b huse and ona 1996 nakken and olsen 1977 mcquinn and winger 2003 prario et al 2015 kang et al 2005 on the other hand it was suggested that negatively buoyant fishes may opt for a positive body tilt during steady horizontal swimming as a behavioural mechanism to avoid sinking huse and ona 1996 he and wardlet 1986 wilga and lauder 2000 in turn in strand et al 2005 they discussed the energy saving obtained through fish swimming tilt angle by physoclist fish the theoretical modelling of fish target strength involves previous knowledge of fish behaviour i e the tilt angle distribution of fish this is necessary to properly average target strength functions over a certain tilt angle distribution however this knowledge is obtained with considerable difficulty since direct observations of fish swimming tilt angle are rather scarce this is particularly so when ts models aim is to provide a deeper insight into the acoustical scattering of the organisms in the wild which in turn constitutes a major concern for acoustic assessment surveys in this respect we aim to develop a simple model of the fish swimming that can be used to estimate the expected tilt angle adopted by a specific fish species we took into consideration the influence of certain external factors concerning fish behaviour and we concentrate on the particular example of physostomous fish which because of the way it regulates buoyancy frequently performs vertical migrations in the water column and hence is exposed to a significant variation of hydrostatic pressure and the consequential effects on its buoyancy conditions the specific anatomy of fish is taken into account in order to provide an approximate but more realistic source for estimating the average tilt angle of fish in this way we expect to narrow the subjectivity usually associated to the selection of fish tilt angle pdf s for averaging ts functions several authors have studied fish swimming focusing particularly on the hydrodynamics of undulatory propulsion generation sfakiotakis et al 1999 shadwick and lauder 2006 today the preferred simple analytical model of fish swimming kinematics is sir j lighthill s elongated body theory lighthill 1960 1971 which is based on addition of forces due to the lateral acceleration and deceleration of the body as it undulates from side to side our main goal is to develop a simple model to estimate the behavioural tilt angle of physostomous fish in turn this may be easily extended to physoclists and negative buoyant fish without swimbladder specifically we have chosen simplified swimming behaviour by assuming a steady horizontal trajectory in contrast to other swimming strategies like glide and rise which may be adopted for deeper depths huse and ona 1996 tanaka et al 2001 with this treatment we are not intended in giving a comprehensive cover of fish swimming instead we are interested in developing a new model of swimming tilt angle by studying simple hydrodynamics of the body and the pectoral fins independently of the propulsion movements and thrust generation so as to obtain general results within a few parameters with this approach we shall obtain analytical expressions for the tilt angle of fish swimming that may offer a wider insight and should be easily applicable to a variety of species however the model still suffers from lack of validation with experimental e g flume tank experiments and in situ optical data by means of physiological and hydrodynamical arguments we will try to shed some insight on the relation between the tilt angle the swimming depth and the swim velocity of physostomous fish that suffer loss of buoyancy because of swimbladder compression with depth this will help on the construction of simulations of individual ts and volume scattering of fish schools we are presenting the paper in the following manner in section 2 we are introducing the hydrodynamical model from which we obtain a simplified equation relating the tilting angle with depth and swimming velocity in turn we add a constant swimming power hypothesis which yields a tilting dependence due to velocity additionally we take into consideration the effects of the presence of a thermocline in the model in section 3 we test our model against acoustic data and simulations of ts argentine anchovy engraulis anchoita finally in section 5 we discuss the results and submit our conclusions 2 the hydrodynamical model we are studying the hydrodynamic vertical stability of a fish swimming at a stationary velocity and depth for this purpose we consider the different forces acting upon the fish components fins body etc in this approach we will ignore constraints introduced by bioenergetic costs and the efficiency of buoyancy regulation during swimming this last common bioenergetics framework has been modelled by strand et al 2005 for physoclists by including the trade offs between the swimbladder regulation and the hydrodynamics forces furthermore fish are self propelled by undulatory movements thus it is hard to separate thrust generation from their inherited drag forces schultz and webb 2002 however if we assume that these movements are confined to a reduced portion of the posterior fish body and or the caudal fin then we can approximate the fish body as a rigid body indeed in such cases we can consider that the fish body behaves in a hydrodynamic manner similar to a torpedo shaped body travelling with a definite tilt angle jorgensen 1973 evans 2003 in this way we take into consideration the simplification that the interactions between the fluid and the fish body are independent of the thrust generating undulatory movements such simplified approach was also chosen by strand et al 2005 2 1 forces during stationary swimming in fig 1 we summarized the forces acting upon the fish while swimming horizontally with a velocity v in body length per second ℓ s and tilt θ in degree the thrust force t all forces in newtons n is the consequence of the propulsion obtained from the specific fish swimming mode in the carangiform and the thunniform swimming modes the thrust is obtained from the body and caudal fin thrown into a wave with as much as up to one half wavelength along the length of body webb 1975 indeed we expect that our study may only be limited to these undulatory modes on the other hand swimming with stationary velocity and depth determines particular behaviour or swimming strategy given by stationaries tilt and thrust other swimming strategies can be studied where the tilt and thrust are not constant videler 1993 taylor et al 2010 sfakiotakis et al 1999 the apparent weight w is a force that always appears on submerged bodies which is the resultant between the archimedes force and the weight of the fish this force changes with depth as the swimbladder compresses if the fish has negative apparent weight at the surface with w pointing upwards it means that floats on water then in order to gain depth it will need to nose downwards with a negative tilt angle eventually at a certain depth the average fish density equals the water density reaching the neutral buoyant depth however this is an unstable point since below of this depth w changes sign pointing downwards and the fish starts to sink then for the fish to swim at a constant depth this positive apparent weight should be compensated by some other vertical forces essentially there will be two kinds lift forces and the vertical component of the thrust force for a swimming tilt angle hydrodynamical lift l while swimming may be obtained mainly from pectoral fins acting as hydrofoils and from body lift additionally hovering behaviour may be used but in this case the fish is not moving and cannot be combined with the other forces finally the drag forces d that always oppose to the flow direction manifest as pressure drag and friction drag there is an extensive bibliography on the study of the hydrodynamics and aerodynamics acting either on biological creatures or engineering systems webb 1975 1988 vogel 1996 norberg 1990 faa 2012 mcneill 1982 the steady motion assumption implies that all forces balance thus there is no acceleration from newton laws we obtain 1 l w t sin θ 0 2 t cos θ d 0 where θ is the angle between oblique thrust t and horizontal velocity v we can combine both equations to get 3 w l d tan θ in this paper we shall keep as simple as possible and we shall ignore the moments stability analysis however a more detailed study on particular fish species should incorporate this issue 2 2 swimbladder and body compression some of the strategies of nature to achieve buoyancy are the lipid or oil reservoirs in the fish flesh which help to reduce the averaged fish density ρ b all densities in kg m 3 shadwick and lauder 2006 alexander 1990 in turn other fish posses the gas filled swimbladder organ that aims to the same purpose we shall consider that the open swimbladder follows boyle s law contraction rate gorska and ona 2003 nero et al 2004 which means that 4 v sb z v sb 0 1 ρ g p 0 z 1 where z in m is the depth below water surface v sb z is the swimbladder volume at a depth z with v sb 0 v sb 0 ρ is the water density g in m s 2 is the gravity acceleration and p 0 in n m 2 is the atmospheric pressure at sea level moreover we assume that the mean flesh density is practically constant in spite of the swimbladder contraction with the depth thus the loss of volume by the swimbladder is followed by an equal loss of external volume in the fish body v sb z v sb 0 v b z v b 0 where v b z is the volume of the entire fish at depth z using these considerations we obtain an expression for the apparent weight depth dependence 5 w z ρ b ρ g v b 0 v sb 0 ρ g v sb 0 1 z z 1 where ρ b is the mean fish density and z p 0 ρ g 10 m is a reference depth at which the swimbladder shrinks to half the volume from the sea level value v sb 0 thus the apparent weight increases hyperbolically from 6 w 0 ρ b ρ g v b 0 ρ b g v sb 0 at sea level z 0 to deep values where the swimbladder is totally collapsed 7 w ρ b ρ g v b 0 v sb 0 for z z the difference between these values is w w 0 ρ g v sb 0 we can further define the neutral buoyancy depth z n obtained from the condition w z n 0 it is easy to see that 8 z n z w 0 w as a consequence when the fish flesh is denser than the sea water w 0 and then in order to obtain positive buoyancy w 0 0 2 3 tilting depth dependence by combining eq 3 with 5 we obtain 9 z θ v z 1 f θ v f 0 1 where we have defined 10 f θ v d θ v tan θ l θ v ρ g v sb 0 v 2 f 1 θ 11 f 0 ρ b ρ 1 v b 0 v sb 0 1 eqs 9 11 are the main results of the paper they give the depth at which the forces on the fish balance for a steady horizontal swimming with velocity v and tilting θ in appendix a we present some expressions for the estimation of d and l forces and we discuss the validity of the factorization v 2 f 1 θ in eq 10 it is not possible though to obtain an exact analytical expression θ θ z v from eq 9 still we have checked that f 1 θ behaves practically like a quadratic function in the range of studied parameters therefore by keeping to order θ 2 in the power expansion of f 1 θ we obtain 12 f 1 θ 1 2 g v sb 0 2 s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 θ c a p θ 2 where the parameters in the expansion are detailed in appendix a using eqs 9 12 we can solve the tilting angle depth dependence 13 θ z v s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 a p c 1 2 g v sb 0 a p c s f k a s 5 η a p r 2 r 2 3 2 ρ b ρ 1 v b 0 v sb 0 1 z z z 1 v 2 1 in fig 2 we compare the functions z θ from the exact expression eq 9 solid line with the approximation from eq 13 dashed line for swimming velocities v ℓ s 1 0 1 5 2 0 and fish flesh density ρ b kg m 3 1060 we also assumed absence of lift from pectoral fins k 0 thus all the hydrodynamic lift comes from body lift the parameters used from now on correspond to a representative specimen of argentine anchovy and they are given in the table of section 3 1 unless stated otherwise we remark that the approximation is good within a maximum error of about 1 for v 1 ℓ s firstly we can identify that for a fish flesh density ρ b 1060 kg m 3 neutral buoyancy is achieved near the sea surface indeed all constant velocity curves will generally meet at z z n because nevertheless the velocity and to keep horizontal swimming at that depth there is no need of any lift forces hence the body tilting will remain zero of course this situation occurs whenever there is no lift happening at the pectoral fins or any asymmetry in the body shape that can either generate any lift force at zero angle of attack it is immediate to see that the tilting θ increases with depth to a maximum asymptotic value θ max as z z the value of θ max is given by this last expression without the z dependent term the tilting decreases at an approximate rate v 1 as could be seen in eq 13 this happens because the main contribution comes from θ 2 term in eq 12 that belongs to the planform area of the fish this result is in concordance with experimental fits θ v v 1 14 obtained for trout in webb 1993 through flume tanks experiments in this way the faster the fish swims the less tilt it needs to achieve stability because at faster movement the lift forces grow allowing to reach the body stability with less tilt fig 2 he and wardlet 1986 svendsen et al 2005 otherwise the tilting will be enhanced for denser fishes because an extra component of vertical thrust is needed to cancel the extra weight this should be evident in fig 3 where tilting curves are plotted for different densities ρ b kg m 3 1050 1060 1070 and v ℓ s 1 0 thus we can see how for more negative buoyant fish the body tilt angle of attack at the sea surface increases in particular for a flesh density 1050 kg m 3 the buoyancy at surface is positive because the averaged density of the fish including the swimbladder is lower than the water density in this case the fish should either swim with negative tilt or lose some air of the swimbladder to keep stable in fig 3 we see that the curve cannot reach the surface even if swimming with negative tilt angle this means that there is no hydrodynamic solution for the fish to maintain a horizontal swim under such circumstances anyway the fish could either shift to oblique swimming to reach sea surface or use negative angle of attack of pectoral fins to achieve the needed negative lift this situation becomes clear in fig 4 in this case we considered pectoral fins lift k 2 π so for negative angles the tilt curve could reach z 0 2 4 constant swimming power assumption the swimming power developed by the fish is p tv cos θ thus by using eq 2 we get p dv and by assuming a constant swimming power csp we can obtain an equation that relates the horizontal velocity with the tilt angle 14 d θ v v d 0 v 0 v 0 cte where we have established a constant power defined by the reference value θ 0 and its reference velocity v 0 the maximum horizontal velocity this expression introduces a restriction between the behavioural variables θ and v that is explicitly independent of the depth z it is also important to note that given that the drag coefficient depends on the velocity see appendix a this equation is transcendental in v and should be solved by numerical methods as we can see in the right plot of fig 5 the maximum velocity is obtained for θ 0 where all the power developed is spent on moving whilst when swimming with tilt angle a fraction of the power is used to keep at a certain depth previously we discussed in section 2 3 that there exists an asymptotic θ max v for z θ v in eq 13 in the csp context this corresponds with an asymptotic decrease of the horizontal velocity with the depth up to a minimum v min see left plot of fig 5 in turn the velocity also decays monotonically with the body tilt as in wilga and lauder 2000 nowroozi et al 2009 svendsen et al 2005 webb 1975 in the right plot of fig 5 we marked the intersections of the curves v θ with the curve θ max v that determine the asymptotic minimum velocities v min for given v 0 in the csp model therefore the curves to the right of the intersection points have no physical sense the recordings made for herrings at night by huse and ona 1996 support our results in this case instead of increasing swimming speed the fish adopted a swimming tilt angle strategy moreover the observed velocities were slower at deeper depths and vice versa we would like to remark that we are considering a stationary horizontal swimming strategy and that another swimming strategy e g glide and rise could give slower or faster velocities than this model 2 5 effects of other environmental factors the thermocline in this section we consider the effects on fish buoyancy that could be triggered by a sharp change in physical parameters of water column the particular case of a strong temperature gradient is analyzed but similar results could be expected by strong gradients on the salinity and thus affecting water density in a similar way from eq 13 it can be seen that the fish tilt angle depends on both physiological and environmental sets of parameters as examples of the first set are the body area a the flesh density ρ b the swimbladder volume on surface v sb 0 etc we consider these parameters constant for a specific fish specimen in the second set are for example the water density ρ and water viscosity μ both of which are temperature dependent talley et al 2011 ioc 2010 the region of higher vertical temperature gradient in the column of seawater is called the thermocline at this place the temperature decreases rapidly from the mixed layer temperature roughly that of surface water to the colder deep water temperature we want to quantify how much fish tilt swim would be affected from the hydrodynamics by the variation of the environmental parameters with temperature although the water density and the water viscosity change with the temperature in the usual thermocline temperature range the viscosity variation introduces negligible changes in the final result see discussion of c in a 1 1 hence the primarily temperature contribution will come from the change in the water density in fig 6 we plot the effects of a thermocline at z 40 m with a temperature variation from t 1 20 c to t 2 10 c the values of depth and themperature gradient of the thermocline have been obtained form madirolas et al 2017 we observe that a small drop in the tilting δ θ 1 is produced by this temperature gradient in the same way we presume that the variations in the salinity will not be considerable in this respect we consider that a change of tilting of the order of 1 is small in comparison with the error from the behavioural component of the tilt swimming that we do not consider here for example in fréon and misund 1999 the authors mention that physiological changes are produced when fishes go through the thermocline they detect a drastic decrease of cardiac rhythm when fish carries out vertical excursion such decrease will bring a variation in swimming speed and possibly a variation in the swim tilt to accommodate the new buoyancy condition however the cause of this change is not hydrodynamic but physiological we call the behavioural component of the tilt swimming to this type of phenomena and they are not considered in the present hydrodynamic model also we can imagine that the horizontal steady swimming strategy could shift to another swimming strategy when going through the thermocline this change may again occur because of behavioural reasons and not only from hydrodynamical effects certainly a change in the swimming strategy may introduce bigger changes in the fish tilting than the thermocline effect on the horizontal steady swimming for example if the fish chooses different swimming strategies for different depths or times of the day huse and ona 1996 paoletti and mahadevan 2014 for the aforementioned we conclude that the presence of such a thermocline will not introduce significant changes in the tilting of hydrodynamic origin 3 an example with argentine anchovy in this section we shall study the previous implications for a particular fish argentine anchovy we are particularly interested in this fish because recently in madirolas et al 2017 there were reported in situ target strenght ts measurements where they suggested an increasing body tilting behaviour with depth furthermore they suggested a tilting vs depth behaviour by simulating theoretical ts functions for some scenarios of swimbladder contraction and tilt angle distributions we wish to compare the predicted ts obtained from psm simulations with the in situ acoustic measurements in doing so we will use the tilt angle obtained from the hydrodynamic model as input for the mean tilt of simulated average ts we next give the parameters used in the hydrodynamic model to calculate the tilt angle from eqs 9 or 13 3 1 hydrodynamic model parameters some of the parameters used in the present example correspond to the ones in madirolas et al 2017 obtained from x ray tomography for a representative specimen on the other hand we choose standard representative values for the seawater parameters table 1 we adopted the value κ 0 which implies that we are not considering lift generated by the pectoral fins l f 0 moreover this means the absence of any drag of the fins d f d i 0 see appendix a the choice of this parameter was made for simplicity reasons given that there are no measurements of κ for this fish some typical values of κ range between π and 2 π in particular for slender aerofoils like naca 2306 6306 etc with κ 1 4 π or naca 6506 with κ 1 2 π jacobs et al 1935 hoerner and borst 1975 if such lift fins contributions are included we found that the tilt drops about 5 the difficulty of determining the value of this parameter resides primarily on the fact that it depends strongly on the fish behaviour there is a wide range of possible fin movements some fishes are able to control every fin ray separately they can deform the fins or retract them or rotate the rays at willing videler 1993 indeed this correction appears to be meaningful thus it would be interesting to orient some future investigations in this direction 3 2 comparative with acoustic data authors in madirolas et al 2017 obtained an experimental curve for average acoustic backscattering strength ts for the nighttime scattering layer of argentine anchovy 15 ts exp ℓ z 31 3 log ℓ 79 6 4 74 log 1 z 10 furthermore they used a prolate spheroidal model psm prario et al 2015 to simulate the variation of the average ts with depth z for a distribution function with mean tilt θ and standard deviation sd in that opportunity the anatomy of the anchovy swimbladder was obtained from x ray computed tomography ct scanning in this work we repeated the same runs of the psm simulations with the same parameters table 2 as used in madirolas et al 2017 in this sense we considered coherent contributions of the three backscattering sources the dual chambered swimbladder and the anchovy body the ts outputs were averaged over the tilt angle through a gaussian window with mean θ and standard deviation sd a detail discussion of the ts simulations is given in appendix b if we assume that anchovies are neutrally buoyant near the surface and considering the loss of buoyancy with depth due to swimbladder compression a reasonable interpretation of these simulations with the experimental data is that the mean tilt angle increases with depth indeed this is a swimming strategy chosen by fish to avoid sinking in this work we deduced using a hydrodynamic picture some expressions that can give quantitative estimations for these tilt changes with depth variations with these ideas we combined the hydrodynamical model of tilted swimming with the psm simulations in this sense we considered that the hydrodynamical prediction of eqs 9 or 13 for θ z v would correspond with the statistical mean tilt angle θ in fig 7 we show the results of evolving θ with the hydrodynamic equations for horizontal velocities v ℓ s 1 5 2 2 5 and using sd 20 at first sight when comparing with the experimental function and assuming that the dispersion in the tilt angle does not change the simulations would imply that there is a slight decay in the velocity when the tilt changes such conclusion is reasonable in the fact that when tilting some of the power of swimming is spent propelling water downwards on the other side using sd 10 we can see in fig 8 left plot that the experimental curve is much more compatible with such simulation at deeper depths 30 m these results are improved when considering csp in the simulations right plot to conclude we observe that for shallower depths the hydrodynamics curves are compatible with acoustic data for sd 20 while for deeper depths the tendencies agree with a more polarized swimming sd 10 15 we shall interpret this situation in terms of the change of the swimming stability with the depth if we introduce a small perturbation δ θ from an equilibrium tilt θ with v constant the corresponding change in the drag δ d and the lift δ l shall increase for bigger θ thus for the fish to recover the equilibrium it will need a stronger δ t for bigger θ we show this effect in fig 9 where we can observe that the derivative of the thrust t computed from eq 2 it increases practically in the considered tilt range yet there may exist a range of small angles where the derivative is negative sourced by the drag term proportional to c cos 3 θ see eq 25 which all the same appears to be residual 4 discussion in spite of the substantial influence that fish tilted swimming have on the acoustic backscatter response direct observations of fish swimming tilt angle are rather scarce in this way the add on of the present hydrodynamical model to ts simulations can be used to perform a more physically realistic acoustic modelling the present model arises from an attempt to optimize the relation between the simplicity of its formulation and the generality of results we obtained an analytical model that is applicable to physostomous fish more specifically to thunniform and carangiform swimmers eq 13 we highlight the advantage that analytical models show in which the action and relevance of the variables and parameters involved can be explicitly identified due to the simplicity of the model we cannot expect to be accurate but rather approximate trying to rescue the principal factors that dominate dynamics however this fact is not a relevant problem necessarily because tilted swimming usually has a behavioural component not considered in the hydrodynamical model that increases the standard deviation beyond what would be physically expected making unnecessary more accuracy it is a physical fact that a swimming fish generates vortices in its wake rosen 1959 webb 1975 müller et al 1997 shadwick et al 1999 lauder and drucker 2002 so it follows that individuals in a school swimming behind each other will encounter vortices from the propulsive wakes of preceding members indeed fish in schools can benefit from altered flows using two distinct though not mutually exclusive mechanisms flow refuging and harnessing energy from vortex capture these mechanisms can theoretically increase the thrust of an individual by tens of percentages without additional energy expenditure nevertheless such schooling altered flows will in principle break down any predictability derived from the steady flow assumption of individual fish discussed in the present work in fact much less is known about effects of hydrodynamics that deviate from steady conditions numerous field and laboratory studies have shown that fish can reduce locomotory costs by exploiting turbulence generated by water moving past physical structures or by the propulsive movements of other fishes breder 1965 weihs 1973 herskin and steffensen 1998 hinch and rand 1998 liao et al 2003b under these circumstances turbulence may be considered a feature of the hydrodynamic environment that is a benefit rather than a constraint by the way observations of individual positions in a school have provided useful information but still almost no hydrodynamic or physiological data exist to evaluate the hypothesis that fish can increase swimming performance by taking advantage of the wake of other members liao 2007 we remark then that our hydrodynamical model in general will not be applicable for compact fish schools where the presence of altered flows and vortices dominate the water dynamics in spite of this it could happen that disperse slow moving fish flocks will minimize the presence of turbulence allowing for our predictions to be appropriate yet first our model should be tested and validated against direct observations of individual fish before trying to extend it to fish schools this is a new theoretical treatment and so still suffers from lack of validation with experimental e g flume tank experiments and in situ optical data however as a first approach this validation may also be carried out by numerical simulations that model the complete hydrodynamic picture for example this can be applied for thunniform and carangiform swimmers sfakiotakis et al 1999 by introducing the hydrostatics of the open swimbladder we do expect that corrections may indeed appear to our framework when including the undulatory phenomenology the thrust generation and the swimming bio energetics all the same there are experimental reports that support our results in he and wardlet 1986 svendsen et al 2005 nowroozi et al 2009 they obtained experimental curves that show a decresing of tilt angle with velocity in agree with eq 13 webb 1993 obtain an empirical fitting that relate tilt angle and swimming velocity according to θ v 1 14 0 41 for steelhead trout this result is compatible with our prediction θ v 1 of eq 13 finally we predict a decrease in the swimming velocity and an increase of tilt angle of horizontally swimming fish that are suitable with the observations of norwegian herring made by huse and ona 1996 we emphasize that our model is a simplification and therefore has left out some important effects our results should be interpreted as mean values that coincide with fish that under certain conditions have an average behaviour or swimming strategy that is related to steady horizontal swimming this hydrodynamical model is not applicable when fish deviate significantly from this behaviour indeed other swimming strategies would surely involve other dynamic equations maybe involving accelerations and oblique trajectories a natural generalization of the model should include a rigorous estimation of significant parameters such as κ in the lift fins the incorporation of the hydrodynamic aspects of the modes swimming propulsion as well as the comparison of results between different swimming strategies this last point will be the subject of our next project 5 conclusions we implemented from first principles a model for physostomus fish that describes the relation between hydrodynamical forces and body tilt during stationary swimming velocity at certain depth to study swimming stability we took into account thrust drag and lift forces and the apparent weight the last depends on swimbladder volume for which we adopted boyle s law to describe compression at depth taking these considerations into account we obtained an analytical expression for depth as a function of body tilting and swimming velocity these last variables have a hydrodynamical component considered in the model and a behavioural component that is not considered we found that in rather general conditions for fixed tilting θ swimming depth z changes hyperbolically as v 2 moreover we obtained a useful approximate expression eq 13 for fish tilting as a function of depth and the swimming velocity that behaves like v 1 hence for faster swimming the fish will need less body tilting for a fixed z to the contrary more dense fish will need more body tilting to cancel out the extra weight additionally from eq 13 one can identify for each swimming velocity a maximum tilt θ max when z z 10 m we analysed hydrodynamic changes that a thermocline would produce in fish swimming behaviour in spite of the presence of the temperature gradient we found that the effects of the thermocline with body tilt are small δ θ 1 for δ t 10 c thus we concluded that the thermocline does not affect fish tilting of hydrodynamic origin significantly however there could be changes of tilt swimming of behavioural origin not contemplated in the hydrodynamical model the knowledge of body tilt distribution for fish is of utmost importance for fisheries acoustics given that backscattering strength is mainly originated at the exposed fish area we tested the present hydrodynamical model and the hypothesis of constant swimming power csp against in situ ts measurements and simulated data for argentine anchovy madirolas et al 2017 in that case they commented that the lack of the observed ts with depth could not be explained by swimbladder compression only suggesting a behavioural tilting thus in this work we associated this difference with a quantitative combination of swimbladder compression and body tilting excursion with depth by means of hydrodynamic arguments from the comparison between the acoustic observation with the psm simulations combined with the mean tilt angle prediction from the hydrodynamic model we found that body tilting standard deviation may show a slight decreasing trend with depth unless a different swimming strategy is selected we gave an interpretation of these results in terms of stability acknowledgements we wish to thank adrian madirolas inidep for providing us the psm simulated data needed to compare to our model for useful discussions in fisheries acoustics and the hospitality we received at inidep we are also grateful with guido bacino conicet for discussions and help in oceanography and constanza brasesco conicet for manuscript corrections appendix a hydrodynamic forces in this appendix we shall consider analytical expressions for the drag d and lift l forces in fig 10 we plotted generic solutions for the total d and l that we encountered all through the paper as we can observe for small tilt angles the drag force dominates the lift but for bigger θ they both grow becoming comparable a 1 lift force the lift l is produced by the dynamic effect of the water acting on the fish it appears when an object changes the direction of flow of the water this force is the hydrodynamic force orthogonal to the swimming direction it helps to swim at a certain depth by stabilizing with the negative buoyant force reaching to supply up to half of the force necessary to avoid sinking nowroozi et al 2009 we shall consider two sources of lift force from the pectoral fins l f and from the fish body l b thus the total lift is given by 16 l l b l f 1 2 ρ v 2 a r c lb s r c lf where a r and s r are the reference areas of the body and the fins respectively and c lb and c lf are dimensionless lift coefficients that relate the fluid variables ρ and v to the lift force on the body and the fins respectively a 1 1 body lift jorgensen 1973 obtained some heuristic and theoretical formulas for predicting hydrodynamic forces on a streamlined body in terms of the angle of attack the original formulas give the axial c a and normal c n coefficients with respect to the fish length yet for our calculations we need the lift and drag coefficients so we performed a rotation of the coordinate system at an angle θ so as to relate c a and c n with c l and c d thus for the lift coefficient we obtain 17 c lb c n cos θ c a sin θ c v a a r cos 2 θ sin θ c s a s a r sin 2 θ cos θ cos θ 2 c v a p a r sin 2 θ cos θ where c s is usually referred to as the apparent mass factor that depends on the ratio l r in our case c s 1 for streamlined bodies a s is the area of the body stern a r is the reference area a p is the planform area of the fish body the maximum projected area a is the body or wetted area note that the global factor a r 1 will simplify with the factor a r in eq 16 c is the total axial drag at zero angle of attack which is composed by friction and pressure contributions to estimate the value of the friction through the coefficient c fric we need to express it in terms of the reynolds number webb 1975 defined by 18 r ℓ ρ ℓ v μ where ρ is the water density ℓ is the fish large v the fish velocity and μ the water viscosity essentially there are three types of flows depending on the reynolds number with their respective functions of the friction coefficient webb 1975 19 c f r i c b 1 33 r ℓ 1 2 l a m i n a r 0 072 r ℓ 1 5 1700 r ℓ 1 t r a n s i t i o n a l 0 072 r ℓ 1 5 t u r b u l e n t these formulas give an estimation of the friction coefficient in the laminar transitional and turbulent flow regimes respectively the change of the laminar to transitional regimes is governed by a reynolds number around 5 10 5 in our case r ℓ 10 4 therefore we shall work in the laminar regime on the other hand for streamlined bodies the pressure component can be related to the friction coefficient and to the ratio between the maximum diameter 2 r and the length ℓ 20 c press b c fric b g 2 r ℓ where g x 1 5 x 3 2 7 x 3 with these expressions we can define the total axial drag as 21 c c fric b c press b c fric b 1 g c is the cross flow drag coefficient for a finite cylinder section we shall use the empirical formula c v η 1 10 r n 2 3 proposed by white white 1991 and vogel vogel 1996 with a normal reynolds number r n θ r 2 r sin θ 2 r ρ v sin θ μ we have introduced the correction factor η for finite cylinder in the formula which in our case 0 82 jorgensen 1973 we have tested that in the range of reynolds number of interest the variation of c with the velocity introduces minimal changes to the final result thus we keep a constant coefficient slightly bigger than η 22 c v c η the first term in 17 corresponds to lift generated by a finite body stern area and may in general be small for streamlined fishes the second term produces a small negative lift coming from the frontal area of the head lastly in general the third term produces most of the lift that comes from the longitudinal body area exposed to cross flow when tilting is present these three terms are shown in the left plot of fig 11 while in the right plot we compare the angular dependence of body and fins lift a 1 2 fins lift we shall use for the fins the usual simplified expression for hydrofoils webb 1975 23 c lf κ sin α with α the angle of attack with respect to the flow direction and κ a constant that depends on the form of the fins for a hydrofoil there exists a critical angle α crit for which above of this value the flow becomes strongly distorted and the value of c l rapidly decays in this situation it is said that the hydrofoil stalls in this work we shall consider that the fish can control the stall situation by changing the angle of attack of the pectoral fins in this sense we assume that α θ for θ α crit π 10 while for θ α crit then α α crit and the coefficient remains almost constant in a way that maximizes the lift force of the fins 1 1 indeed a simpler assumption would be to consider a constant lift coefficient that maximizes the lift force c lf κ sin α crit see fig 11 a 2 drag force the drag d is the resistance force caused by the motion of a body through a fluid the drag force always opposes to the fish velocity we shall study the drag on the pectoral fins acting as hydrofoils and on the rest of the body these are also given by a similar expression as for the lift force 24 d d b d f 1 2 ρ v 2 a r c db s r c df d i where c db and c df are the body and fins drag coefficients respectively and d i is the induced drag that we shall analyse later in this section a 2 1 body drag analogously to how the body lift coefficient was written the body drag coefficient is related to c a and c n in the following way 25 c db c n sin θ c a cos θ c s a s a r sin 2 θ sin θ cos θ 2 c a p a r sin 3 θ c a a r cos 3 θ the coefficients c s c and c were defined previously in the body lift section these three terms are shown in the left plot of fig 12 while in the right plot we compare the angular dependence of body and fins drag a 2 2 fins drag the drag of the fins will be given by the sum of three terms the friction d fric f and pressure drag d press f which speak of the direct interaction of the fluid on the fins and the induced drag d i which comes whenever lift is present at hydrofoils the first two terms will have a friction c fric f and a pressure component c press f defined by a reynolds number calculated with the fins chord c and span b thus we write 26 d fric f d press f 1 2 ρ v 2 4 bc c fric f 2 bc sin θ c press f where the area 4 bc corresponds to the total wetted area of both pectoral fins while 2 bc sin θ is the area frontal to the flow direction for an angle of attack α θ moreover we have assumed that the contribution of the transversal area of the fins is negligible the magnitude of the pressure coefficient for a hydrofoil can be approximately related to the thickness ratio τ webb 1975 27 c press f c press f 0 0056 0 01 τ 0 1 τ 2 where c press f is the pressure component associated to the relative camber webb 1975 for our calculations we shall assume that the fins thickness ratio is very small τ 1 and that the camber is small also thus c press f 0 0056 furthermore we obtain that the pressure drag on the pectoral fins will be much smaller than the friction drag 2 2 for a flat plate normal to the incident flow the drag force is mostly from pressure forces and then it is independent of r ℓ however this corresponds to a critical situation where the fish fins would have an angle of attack α 90 which we consider a rather odd situation for steady swimming the third drag term is a consequence of the work that the hydrofoil makes on the fluid to push it downwards thus d i is associated to the reaction of giving kinetic energy to the fluid by the fins we have used an estimate given by momentum jet theory norberg 1990 28 d i 2 π b 2 ρ v 2 l f 2 using expression 24 we can deduce a coefficient c d i c l 2 ar where ar b 2 s f is the aspect ratio given by the relation between the fin span and the fin area a 3 demonstration of the factorization v 2 f 1 θ let us consider the expression d θ v tan θ l θ v of eq 10 if we take into account the corresponding term c of l b and the respective of d b they cancel each other furthermore as we discussed in a 1 1 we can consider a constant c if we additionally consider that the viscous and pressure drag contribution from the fins is negligible and the remaining lift and drag terms are all proportional to v 2 then we can factorize a global factor as in eq 10 appendix b prolate spheroidal acoustic model psm the far field backscattered sound wave of individual fish is defined at linear order through the coherent sum of the backscattering amplitude functions of swimbladder f sb soft spheroid and fish body f b fluid spheroid prario et al 2015 argentine anchovy posses a dual chambered swimbladder thus for the simulation we considered the contribution of both independent sources madirolas et al 2017 the total backscattering cross section is then computed as 29 σ bs f sb 1 e 2 i c 0 c 1 k δ 1 f sb 2 e 2 i c 0 c 2 k δ 2 f b 2 with sound velocities inside the swimbladder chambers c 1 c 2 the coherent sum of the sources is performed by the complex nature of backscattering functions moreover exponential phase factors are important because they account for the spatial displacements between the spheroids centers in the psm picture the fish body parts are approximated by equivalent spheroids therefore backscattering functions are expanded in prolate spheroidal functions so as to easily fulfil with the boundary conditions moreover anchovy morphometry was obtained by madirolas et al 2017 from ct scanning in the present work we repeated the same modelling parameters see table 2 these consisted on assuming that the widths of soft spheroids are such that the measured dorsal area of swimbladder chambers coincide with that of their equivalent spheroids also the lengths of the soft spheroids would be equal to the corresponding swimbladder chamber on the other side the width of the fluid spheroid was chosen so as to keep the same volume with the fish body while lengths stayed equal in order to study the vertical ts variations we assumed boyle s law for volume changes of the swimbladder chambers with hydrostatic pressure however swimbladder contractions could be anisotropic thus we adopted the following equations to describe changes in the gas filled spheroids dimensions gorska and ona 2003 30 a sb z a sb 0 1 z z α 31 ℓ sb z ℓ sb 0 1 z z β where a sb 0 and ℓ sb 0 are the spheroids diameter and length at sea surface respectively moreover to comply with boyle s law the exponents should satisfy the constraint equation 2 α β 1 isotropic compression then implies α β 1 3 while pure transverse compression is achieved for α 1 2 and β 0 all simulations were carried out using pure transverse compression that as was suggested by madirolas et al 2017 would be compatible with a tilted swimming behaviour of anchovies with depth in this same work they identified that an isotropic compression yields incompatible results while there exists a marginal intermediate compression scenario α 0 37 and β 0 26 that would indicate no tilting behaviour at all at the moment these exponents are fairly unknown for argentine anchovy however for instance herring morphometry of the swimbladder compression with varying pressure was examined using magnetic resonance imaging by fässler et al 2009 in this sense to completely validate the present framework analogous experiments should be carried out for anchovies in the future in fig 13 we plotted ts outputs for three different depths z m 0 10 and 40 obtained from psm simulations it can be seen that the ts function is peaked at θ 5 because we used a 5 inclination of the swimbladder longitudinal axis relative to the fish body length to compare with experimental fits we averaged the simulated backscattering cross sections over the tilt angle the averaging was done through a gaussian window with mean θ and standard deviation sd in fig 14 we plotted points for depths z m 0 10 20 30 40 50 of averaged ts for sd 20 left plot and sd 10 right plot and for mean angles θ 10 0 10 15 20 in addition the curves are best fits to the two parameter function ts sim θ sd z a θ sd 10 γ θ sd log 1 z 10 we note that the fitting parameters a and γ will depend solely on the averaging variables θ and sd as a reference we included the experimental fit function ts exp l z with l 14 7 cm as going to deeper depths this function intersects different simulation curves ts sim

upstream molluscs midstream and zooplankton downstream carnivorous fish occupied the maximal tl of 2 95 3 50 due to the different trophic interactions of regional food webs the keystone groups shifted from odonate larvae in headwaters to piscivorous fish upstream midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary aquatic insects insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes

8 4 1 upstream and increased to the highest levels of 8 0 8 4 midstream before they decreased to 6 4 7 0 downstream the low tes along the river were limited mainly by the lack of carnivorous fish

and trophic statuses baird and ulanowicz 1993 therefore ecopath which provides multiple systematic indicators is suitable for studying the longitudinal heterogeneity of fluvial trophic networks with model outputs policymakers can recognise the developmental stage maturity stability and diversity of any aquatic system which satisfies the needs of stream river conservation and management pauly et al 2000 furthermore compared with studies of food web structures and energy flow networks undertaken in temperate zones exploration of aquatic ecosystems in the tropics subtropics is still limited because of the restricted geographic distribution of these ecosystems boyero et al 2009 dudgeon et al 2010 suggested that ecological notions e g faunal distribution trophic dynamics for northern temperate streams are inadequate for describing tropical streams for example due to the constant illumination and high water temperature lowland tropical streams are functionally more different from temperate streams than from their high altitude counterparts however except for duan et al 2009 and lin et al 2012 who simulated the energy flows in the pearl river estuary and chichiawan stream few ecopath models have been constructed for subtropical streams rivers thus further evidence of ecosystem properties and associated comparative analyses are needed located in a subtropical monsoon climate the east river is of great importance for power generation irrigation navigation and water supply in guangdong province the biotic and abiotic parameters of the east river including habitats water quality and species composition have been studied since 2012 to gain insight into the structure and functioning of large river ecosystems the specific objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the energy flows of food webs in six sections of the east river 2 estimate the major production and consumption flows in regional food webs 3 analyse the trophic interactions among functional groups and find the keystone groups 4 characterise the spatial differentiation of trophic efficiencies and ecosystem properties and 5 identify the potential anthropogenic disturbances that influence the energy transfer and maturity of the ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the east river is 562 km long and has a drainage area of 35 340 km2 with an annual average precipitation of 1750 mm and discharge of 32 4 billion m3 as the main source of potable water for hong kong 80 shenzhen dongguan and guangzhou the ecology and environment of the east river ecosystem are of the upmost importance to the sustainable development of the pearl river delta lee et al 2007 due to economic development over the past several decades the river basin has experienced rapid population growth and associated anthropogenic activities leading to drastic extraneous interferences from humans the main ecological stresses are 1 reclamation and bank hardening that cause habitat loss 2 increasing industrial and domestic sewage discharges and 3 sediment mining that destroys substrate wang et al 2008 field sampling was conducted four times a year during the rainy may and august and dry november and february seasons in 2012 2016 at the six main stem sites along the river fig 1 during each sampling event biotic e g species composition biomass and abiotic e g habitat characteristics data were collected concurrently and the samples of water detritus and stomach gut contents were analysed in the laboratory methods a1 a2 longitudinally there was a decrease in elevation velocity and dissolved oxygen do but an increase in channel width water depth discharge temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph values table b1 nitrogen concentrations were lower upstream and increased sharply midstream where non point source pollution was present from agricultural runoff in the downstream urban reaches the direct discharge of domestic sewage into the watercourse increased leading to higher ec and phosphorous concentrations notably near the industrialised zones around the river mouth extremely low do and the highest ec and nutrient concentrations were recorded indicating regional water pollution caused by raw sewage and industrial waste wadeable upstream sites 1 2 were in pristine upland areas with boulder and cobble substrates table b2 site 1 in the montane headwaters was bordered by eucalyptus forest and the riparian vegetation was dominated by littoral annual herbage at site 2 greater diversities of habitats and plants were supported by the wider channel and floodplain areas and the riverbed was covered with submerged hydrilla verticillata non wadeable sites 3 4 which have gravel and sand substrates were in the midstream foothills typical plants included submerged myriophyllum verticillatum and riparian bamboo forest downstream sites 5 6 with silt substrate have been largely affected by artificial engineering e g the channelised tributaries and reinforced banks resulting in the loss of riffles and floodplains limited by steep revetments and low water transparency few aquatic hydrophytes could be found except for the invasive floating eichhornia crassipes in the middle lower reaches the flow regimes and flood pulses were regulated by fengshu and jiantan dam resulting in a slower water velocity and greater depth with atrophic floodplains 2 2 modelling approach the basic condition considered for ecopath is that the energy inputs and outputs of all biomass compartments must be balanced two equations are used to parameterise an ecopath model christensen and walters 2004 the first equation describes the production of each group production catch predation mortality net migration biomass accumulation other mortality 1 p b i bi yi bj q b j dcji nmi bai q b i bi 1 eei where for prey i and predator j p b is production to biomass ratio b is biomass y is fisheries catch q b is consumption to biomass ratio dcji is the proportion of prey i in the diet composition of predator j nm is net migration rate ba is biomass accumulation rate ee is ecotrophic efficiency and 1 ee is mortality other than that from predation and fishing the second equation ensures energy balance within each functional group consumption production respiration unassimilated food 2 qi pi ri uci qi where for predator i q is consumption p is production r is respiration and uc is the unassimilated to consumption ratio for each functional group b and y were derived from the field sampling and surveys during 2012 2016 the prey items and their proportions in dc matrixes of predators were identified and quantified respectively in the laboratory the p b of producers and the import of detritus were determined in the field whereas p b q b and other input parameters e g respiration migration other mortality of fish and invertebrates were calculated after solving the set of linear equations see christensen et al 2008a b the input parameters of the six models were assumed to represent the mean and uncertainty of the ecological data collected during the past five years 2 3 data collection and input parameters the basic input parameters e g b p b q b uc for the six ecopath models are listed in table c1 the biomass of fish macroinvertebrates zooplankton algae hydrophytes and detritus was determined based on sampling along the river due to the different habitats between shallow streams and deep rivers two sets of methodologies were used method a2 at the upstream wadeable sites 1 2 all the functional groups were sampled across riffles runs and pools following the guidelines of barbour et al 1999 at the midstream downstream non wadeable sites 3 6 the groups were sampled in the main channels and nearshore zones 1 2 m depth following the guidelines of flotemersch et al 2006 for fish and invertebrate groups their input biomass was weighted by the proportion of the living habitat area to total reach area the p b q b and associated conversion coefficients were calculated according to the empirical formulae method a3 provided by christensen et al 2008b brey 1999 and kuns and sprules 2000 net production np and community respiration cr rates were derived from changes in do concentrations over time in the illuminated and darkened incubations of epiphytes and phytoplankton method a2 because both measurements reflect the oxygen turnover of the entire system including photoautotrophic and heterotrophic activities np and cr expressed production and respiration at the community level np had negative values if the oxygen consumption exceeded oxygen production by photosynthesis the oxygen production rates were converted to carbon fixation rates using a photosynthetic quotient of 1 2 mills and wilkinson 2009 to distinguish the components of bproducer and total primary production tpp the sum of np by all producers the chlorophyll a of phytoplankton and epiphytes were transformed to areal wet weights g m2 with related conversion coefficients method a3 2 4 diet composition and unassimilated consumption gravimetric and volumetric methods were combined to analyse the stomach or gut contents of fish and invertebrates method a4 for the six models the dc matrixes of predators and the species family composition of each fish invertebrate group are shown in tables c2 and c3 respectively twelve prey items including detritus d epiphytes e hydrophytes h phytoplankton t zooplankton z insect larvae i excluding odonate predators odonate larvae o gastropods g bivalves v annelids a shrimps s and fish f were identified to cluster the 84 fish species into 32 groups the principle that the combination of main prey contributed 50 to the dc of each fish species was followed to classify the prey oriented feeding groups the name of each fish group was defined and sorted according to the contribution of each prey for example pelteobagrus fulvidraco belonged to group sio because its dc consisted of shrimps insects odonates and other prey at values of 23 24 21 43 10 57 and 44 76 respectively invertebrates were classified based on behavioural and morphological features since their dcs were simple morse et al 1994 to reflect the holistic flows of production consumption and predation tables 2 and 3 the prey oriented fish feeding groups were integrated into carnivore piscivore f f s s s i s o s i o o invertivore insectivore i i o i v i s i g molluscivore v v d i a v omnivore i d g h i e e i h v v h v e d v a herbivore e e d h h d detritivore d d e d t and planktivore z t the invertebrate groups were integrated into aquatic insect larvae predator shredder scraper gatherer filterer mollusc gastropod bivalve decapod shrimp crab and annelid leech oligochaete polychaete according to the parameters provided by winberg 1956 welch 1968 benke and wallace 1980 lin et al 2007 and lin et al 2012 the uc rates of prey items were set as 20 35 60 and 70 for nekton e g fish shrimp macroinvertebrates e g insects molluscs algae particular organic matter and vascular plant debris organic sediment respectively the final uc values for each predator group were weighed by the relative proportion of each prey item in dc 2 5 model balancing and basic estimate ecological and thermodynamic rules were followed based on a series of logical constraints ee 1 0 1 gross efficiency 0 3 gross efficiency net efficiency respiration assimilation 1 and production respiration 1 odum 1969 christensen et al 2008a to balance the models the first attempt was made by evaluating whether the ee estimated in the model was 1 for each group for groups with ee 1 the annual mean values of biomass primary production and fisheries catch that were directly measured were left unchanged the input parameters derived from literature e g uc or estimated by empirical models e g p b q b were modified to conform to the constraints in addition the insufficient supply of prey i for predator j was adjusted by 1 reducing the proportion of prey i in the diets of predator j i e dcji within uncertainty intervals table c4 and 2 adding upstream imports when dcji values fell out of the acceptable ranges the uncertainty associated with the input values of the model was assessed based on the pedigree index which was 0 85 for each of the six models indicating a high level of credibility to avoid bias in the estimated values of different parameters the preliminary data were introduced into the ecoranger routine ecopath 5 1 version and ranges based on measured relative errors were introduced table c4 random input variables were drawn from a normal distribution for each basic parameter the process was repeated in order to generate a theoretical frequency distribution for each parameter using monte carlo simulations a total of 10 000 models were run and 200 fitting scenarios were selected to propagate uncertainty from inputs to synthetic indices with mean and standard deviation of input parameters estimated 2 6 ecosystem characteristics and network analysis the total system throughput tst and its four components including total consumption tq total respiration tr total flows into detritus and total exports were used as parameters to compare the size of entire trophic networks ulanowicz 2004 the tpp tr describes the maturity of the system and tpp tr values close to 1 indicate mature ecosystems odum 1971 ulanowicz 1986 the total biomass tst tb tst is used to assess the tb supported by the available energy and the estimated value tends to be low during the early phases of development and increases as the system matures mixed trophic impact mti which is the sum of positive impact pi and negative impact ni allows for the assessment of trophic interactions through measuring how changes in the biomass of a group affect the biomasses of other groups christensen and walters 2004 the keystoneness index ksi of a given group was determined as a function of both the estimated mti and its own biomass libralato et al 2006 the relative proportions of ni and pi in the estimated overall mtis were used to evaluate the bottom up vs top down effects of keystone groups on trophic cascades transfer efficiencies tes between successive discrete trophic levels tls were calculated as the ratio of the sum of exports plus the flow that was transferred from one tl to the next to the throughput of the concerned tl the system omnivory index soi measures the degree of food web omnivory by quantifying the distribution of feeding interactions among tls the connectance index ci is the ratio of the number of expressed links to the number of theoretically possible links soi and ci are used to 1 understand the capabilities of ecosystems to respond to natural and anthropic perturbations and 2 evaluate system maturity a food chain is expected to change from linear to web like as the system matures odum 1971 pauly et al 2000 however the complexity indicator soi is affected by the number configuration and weights of links rather than by food web structure whereas the topological indicator ci is significantly correlated with the number of groups used to define the food web libralato 2016 finn s cycling index fci which is the proportion of tst recycled in a system indicates a system s ability to maintain its structure and integrity through positive feedback odum 1971 christensen 1995 finn s mean path length fml and finn s straight through path length excluding detritus which account for the number of groups involved in a flow is a method of quantifying the length of each cycle disturbed systems are characterised by short and fast cycles while complex trophic structures have long and slow cycles thus low values of fci and fml indicate an immature or stressed system and a short food chain controlled by bottom up forces ascendency scaled by system throughput is a measure of system growth e g age size and network development e g organisation links the upper limit to ascendency is the development capacity and the difference between capacity and ascendency is the system overhead overhead reflects the system s reserved strength from which it can draw to mitigate the effects of unexpected perturbations monaco and ulanowicz 1997 thus a system with a high ascendency capacity a c ratio is developed and diversified in contrast a system with a high overhead capacity ratio is resilient and has strength in reserve 3 results 3 1 trophic levels and ecotrophic efficiency six mass balance flow diagrams are shown in fig 2 with groups at tls 2 50 listed in table d1 as top predators carnivorous fish which fed on small invertivorous fish palaemonid shrimps and odonate larvae occupied maximum tls of 2 95 3 50 see dc matrixes in table c2 planktivorous fish in group z which emerged in pelagic zones near the estuary and fed on copepods and malacostracan were at tls 2 96 3 12 invertivorous fish which fed on aquatic insect larvae e g diptera trichoptera elmidae soft shelled molluscs e g radix limnoperna and polychaetes e g nereidae were at tls 2 65 2 98 notably odonate and corydalid larvae which fed on chironomidae and baetidae were only the second invertebrate consumers to reach tls 2 31 2 85 prey i with ee 1 table d2 have insufficient yearly production for predator j which needs additional imports in dcji for producers the ees of epiphyte and hydrophyte increased continuously downstream and reached 0 99 at sites 5 6 for invertebrates the ees of insect scrapers and filterers that could only be sampled upstream reached 0 99 at site 2 the ees of insect shredders and gatherers reached 0 99 at site 3 however insect gatherers had ee of 0 99 at sites 4 6 as prey for carnivorous fish table c2 odonate larvae shrimps and small insectivorous fish e g groups i i v had ees of 0 99 at sites 4 6 generally the increasing ees of these groups corresponded to their decreasing biomass and production table 1 especially the insects that disappeared sharply down the river the short supply of insects influenced the mass balance at most sites while other groups only affected downstream 3 2 biomass and production the biomass b and production p of producer and consumer groups are shown in table 1 longitudinally bfish and pfish increased from site 1 0 36 g m2 0 38 g m2 year to site 6 8 5 g m2 17 g m2 year with the major contribution shifting from invertivores 46 upstream to herbivores 30 and omnivores 42 midstream and to detritivores 43 downstream binvertebrate and pinvertebrate which were 3 2 186 times higher than bfish and pfish first increased from site 1 9 6 g m2 53 g m2 year to site 2 43 g m2 186 g m2 year and then increased from site 3 7 9 g m2 28 g m2 year to site 6 27 g m2 303 g m2 year with the major contribution shifting from insects 53 upstream to molluscs 52 midstream and to molluscs 85 in b and zooplankton 57 in p downstream bproducer and tpp increased from site 1 2 7 g m2 286 g m2 year to site 5 14 g m2 4566 g m2 year and then decreased at site 6 8 5 g m2 2963 g m2 year similarly the sum of import and backflows to detritus which was 1 1 2 5 times higher than the tpp increased from sites 1 to 5 713 4910 g m2 year and decreased at site 6 3566 g m2 year the contribution of epiphytes to bproducer and tpp decreased from 96 at site 1 to 5 4 at site 6 whereas the contribution of phytoplankton increased from 3 7 at site 1 to 90 at site 6 with a midstream transition observed at site 3 the contribution of hydrophytes to tpp was low 6 64 however the extremely high bhydrophyte at sites 2 3 which contributed 53 72 of the local bproducer before it decreased to 3 7 at site 6 led to the highest bproducer recorded along the river 3 3 consumption predation and unutilised production the consumption q predation and unutilised production punutilised flowing back to detritus are shown in table 2 at sites 1 6 93 97 251 1812 g m2 year of the tq i e the sum of qfish and qinvertebrate was concentrated at tl ii followed by 3 3 7 2 17 114 g m2 year at tl iii and by 0 02 0 35 0 2 1 4 g m2 year at tl iv at tl v the tq of 0 019 g m2 year was extremely low 0 002 longitudinally qfish increased continuously from 6 9 g m2 year at site 1 to 117 g m2 year at site 6 qinvertebrate which was 4 8 184 times higher than qfish increased from 518 to 1528 g m2 year at sites 1 2 and then increased from 222 to 1162 g m2 year at sites 3 6 longitudinally since qinvertebrate contributed 83 to tq tq showed the same changing tendency as qinvertebrate and was determined by the contribution of insects 80 upstream molluscs 42 midstream and zooplankton 48 downstream detritus contributed the most 67 76 to predation at sites 1 6 followed by epiphytes 17 21 at sites 1 2 hydrophytes 8 1 at site 3 and phytoplankton 9 7 26 at sites 4 6 table 2 invertebrates contributed 3 8 7 2 of the predation and included primarily insects 53 99 at sites 1 3 molluscs 54 at site 4 and zooplankton 50 52 at sites 5 6 fish contributed only 0 01 0 38 to predation producers contributed the most 64 98 to punutilised and were determined by epiphytes at sites 1 2 97 and by phytoplankton at sites 3 6 75 the contribution of invertebrates to the punutilised was 1 3 13 which was determined by insects 74 at site 1 molluscs at sites 2 4 56 75 and zooplankton 60 64 at sites 5 6 notably at sites 1 6 51 99 of pinsect was utilised through predation however only 1 7 40 of pmollusc and 17 24 of pzooplankton were utilised through predation 3 4 keystoneness and mixed trophic impacts ksi and mti were used to represent the site specific trophic roles that groups play along the river figs 3 and 4 details in table d3 groups with the highest ksi exhibited longitudinal shifts from odonate larvae at site 1 to fish group f at sites 2 4 to zooplankton at site 5 and to phytoplankton at site 6 fig 3 groups with the strongest mti shifted from odonate larvae at sites 1 3 to fish group f at site 4 to zooplankton at site 5 and to fish groups d and v at site 6 table d3 groups with the strongest ni shifted from insect filterer at site 1 to fish group f at sites 2 4 and to fish group d at sites 5 6 at sites 1 2 odonate larvae had the strongest pi however at sites 3 6 the pi of detritus was the strongest followed by the pi of hydrophytes at site 3 of epiphytes at sites 4 5 and of phytoplankton at site 6 at each site the pi of detritus 2 84 4 39 was stronger than the total pi of producers 1 14 3 22 additionally groups that positively or negatively influenced most other groups were identified fig 4 generally detritus positively influenced 69 of groups at sites 1 6 followed by epiphytes 64 of groups at sites 1 4 and phytoplankton 63 of groups at sites 5 6 upstream gastropods and insect gatherers negatively influenced 75 of groups midstream gastropods bivalves insect gatherers and annelids negatively influenced 74 of groups downstream fish group d gastropods and bivalves negatively influenced 79 of groups at site 5 while fish group d gastropods and crabs negatively influenced 78 of groups at site 6 3 5 transfer efficiencies of lindeman spine as 99 9 of the throughput of energy flows was distributed at tls i v table 2 we focused on the tes of tls ii iv which determined the predominant transfer processes tes of tl ii iii and iv which were calculated from a combination of producers and detritus are shown in fig 5 the geometric mean tes though tls ii iv originating from producers from detritus and from the two combined were extremely low in headwaters 1 56 1 79 and 1 77 respectively at site 1 increased upstream 4 10 4 14 and 4 13 respectively at site 2 reached their highest levels midstream 8 39 8 19 and 8 24 respectively averaged for sites 3 4 and then decreased downstream 6 59 6 35 and 6 39 respectively averaged for sites 5 6 the te of tl ii was observed to be the highest 6 83 7 78 at sites 1 2 and then decreased to 5 74 6 70 at sites 3 4 and to 3 84 4 20 at sites 5 6 in contrast the te of tl iii was observed to be the lowest 1 53 2 60 at sites 1 2 and then increased and reached the highest levels of 8 10 8 99 at sites 3 4 before decreasing to 7 17 7 69 at sites 5 6 notably as the highest tl of the east river food web was 3 50 few energy flows could be transferred from tl iv to v by predation thus the te of tl iv had an extremely low value of 0 52 at site 1 and increased from 3 49 at site 2 to 9 47 11 0 at sites 3 6 due to the increased catch of carnivorous fish in the middle and lower reaches 3 6 ecosystem characteristics the indices of ecosystem theory and information are given in table 3 the tst increased from 1791 g m2 year to 10 953 g m2 year at sites 1 5 but decreased to 8605 g m2 year at site 6 indicating a longitudinal increase in system size with a decrease near the estuary the ratios of tpp tr and tpp tb increased from the lowest values of 1 27 and 10 3 respectively at site 2 to the highest values of 7 82 and 89 1 respectively at site 5 in contrast the tb tst ratio decreased from the highest value of 0 0223 at site 2 to the lowest values of 0 0047 at site 5 the connectance and diversity indices which fall in the scope of 0 245 0 380 and 1 68 1 96 respectively were the highest at site 2 and the lowest at site 6 in contrast as information and omnivory indices both the a c ratio and soi had the lowest values of 20 7 27 3 and 0 043 0 085 respectively at upstream sites 1 2 and the highest values of 41 4 44 3 and 0 125 0 130 respectively at midstream sites 3 4 as cycling indices the values of fci and fml which fall in the scope of 4 40 19 5 and 2 29 3 94 respectively were the highest at site 2 and the lowest at site 6 notably the difference between the fmls of 3 44 3 94 at sites 1 2 and the fmls of 2 29 2 90 at sites 3 6 was approximately 1 which means that a unit of the energy flow g m2 of upstream systems will be transferred almost 1 more step than that of midstream and downstream systems in addition the high fci and fml values at sites 1 2 indicated that the local system flows recycled a larger proportion 17 2 19 5 of material with longer cycles and residence time and thus more energy was retained within the upstream food webs 4 discussion 4 1 the highest trophic levels and limited ecotrophic efficiencies similar to the findings in other freshwater systems e g streams lakes reservoirs see darwall et al 2010 jia et al 2012 lin et al 2012 and villanueva et al 2008 carnivorous fish in the east river occupied the maximum tls of 3 0 3 5 which are lower than the tls of 4 0 reported in marine systems pauly et al 2000 heymans et al 2014 castellanos galindo et al 2017 indeed since invertivorous fish and odonate larvae were the only prey that reached tls 2 5 3 0 their proportions in the dc of carnivorous fish determined the upper limit to the tls of the local food web for example the tl of fish group f was 3 50 at site 2 due to the 67 3 invertivorous fish in dc whereas it was 3 24 at site 5 due to the 37 4 invertivorous fish in dc additionally with the exception of fish group z which emerged in the upper middle water layers downstream a lack of pelagic carnivorous fish in the east river also constrained the highest tl libralato et al 2006 heymans et al 2014 with ees close to 1 table d2 aquatic insect larvae insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes are limited prey sources that influence model balance through short supply christensen and walters 2004 upstream the yearly production of insect prey could still sustain the consumption of fish and odonate predators however due to the sharply decreased binsect and pinsect midstream insect prey e g gatherers shredders scrapers filterers were over consumed by odonate larvae and invertivorous fish in addition as binsect and pinsect further decreased while bcarnivore and qcarnivore increased downstream odonate larvae shrimp and small insectivorous fish became the prey in short supply which resulted in additional required imports to the dc matrix moreover the ees of epiphytes and hydrophytes increased continuously downstream and reached 0 99 near the estuary indicating their insufficient supply for the local gastropods and herbivorous fish e g groups h hd 4 2 basic energy supply production and consumption detritus was the most basic energy supply because 1 the sum of import and backflows to detritus was higher than the tpp 2 the predation on detritus was higher than that on any other group and 3 detritus had stronger pi and mti than did producers table d3 of producers epiphytes were the major contributor to bproducer and tpp in upstream riffles with cobble substratum however they were replaced by phytoplankton in downstream semi lentic waters with rich nutrients table b1 nevertheless both the ksi and pi of epiphytes were much higher than those of phytoplankton down the river except near the estuary where phytoplankton was heavily utilised by zooplankton and planktivorous fish compared with lacustrine and marine systems jia et al 2012 heymans et al 2016 our results indicated that independent of the production provided detritus and epiphytes played more significant trophic roles than did phytoplankton in fluvial systems as 92 of tq was concentrated at tl ii table 2 most energy flows in the east river were transferred through the short predator prey links at the food web bottom i e from detritus or producers at tl i to primary consumers at tl ii woodward and hildrew 2002 invertebrates rather than fish determined bpredator 76 ppredator 90 and tq 83 indicating the invertebrate centric food webs based on the spatial partitioning of functional groups predicted by the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 our results proved that both the consumption and secondary production of the fluvial energy networks were determined by aquatic insects upstream by molluscs midstream and by zooplankton downstream such longitudinal variation might be explained by the downstream changing physical conditions e g substratum velocity depth which determined the region specific faunal distribution and structure hynes 1970 4 3 keystone groups and their trophic impacts functional groups with the highest ksi shifted from odonate larvae upstream to fish group f midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary indicating differentiated trophic interactions in regional food webs in the upper middle reaches as predators at high tls odonate larvae and fish group f which had the highest ksi and the strongest mti exerted top down control through their predation effects libralato et al 2006 interestingly in contrast to the mti of fish group f within which ni contributed 65 pi contributed 71 to the mti of odonate larvae the main reason is that the predation of odonate larvae not only had direct ni on insects but also had indirect pi on molluscs by reducing their food competition with insects and primary producers by reducing the predation stress from insects however near the estuary keystone groups shifted from top predators to plankton at low tls in contrast to upstream where the strongest mti was determined by predation effects at site 5 zooplankton with the highest ksi had the strongest mti because of this group s ni food competition with primary consumers e g molluscs annelids and pi being utilised by planktivorous fish e g group z at site 6 the highest ksi of phytoplankton could be explained by this group s extensive pi as a basic prey supply for predators especially zooplankton and molluscs these downstream changes in ksi and mti suggested that the effects of predation competition and demand on prey decided which and where a group became keystone along the river cury et al 2000 at a temporal scale the shifts in the highest ksi from groups at high tls to groups at low tls indicated the transition from top down to bottom up control libralato et al 2006 this pattern was what we found in a longitudinal gradient along the east river one problem few studies have focused on is which group has the most extensive impacts on the other groups in number undoubtedly as basic prey detritus and producers had pi on most predators however an interesting finding is that although gastropods and bivalves had low ksi and weak mti they had ni on most groups the reasons are that 1 molluscs compete with other primary consumers on detritus and 2 except for the fragile radix and limnoperna which were utilised by fish groups containing g and v the hard shelled molluscs e g bellamya semisulcospira unio are indigestible for fish therefore the high bmollusc and pmollusc were underutilised through predation and flowed back to detritus downstream the ni of fish group d and crabs on most groups could be explained in the same way 4 4 longitudinal variation in transfer efficiencies along the east river the mean tes through tls ii iv were lower than those reported in other stream systems meyer and poepperl 2004 lin et al 2012 generally the low tes were caused by 1 a lack of carnivorous fish upstream 2 low predation on molluscs midstream and 3 an inefficient use of plankton downstream upstream the highest te of tl ii was due to the heavy predation of invertivorous fish and odonate larvae on aquatic insects however the lowest te of tl iii was due to the lack of carnivorous fish because of which pfish and p odonate at tl iii could not be transferred to tl iv midstream such conditions were improved by the increased bcarnivore and qcarnivore which increased both the predation flows from tls iii to iv and the mean tes originating from tl i nevertheless since midstream molluscs replaced upstream insects as the major contributor to ppredator the low predation on molluscs led to the decreased te of tl ii at sites 3 4 downstream although rich nutrients and slow velocity stimulated the increase in bproducer and tpp the inefficient use of molluscs and zooplankton further reduced the te of tl ii to its lowest level additionally compared with the high bplanktivore in lakes and reservoirs villanueva et al 2008 feroz khan and panikkar 2009 the low bplanktivore e g groups z t in the lower east river which might be caused by the dam blocks and fishing pressure lin et al 2007 led to the underutilisation of plankton and large amounts of backflows to detritus in other words as the supply exceeded the demand in the pelagic food web the energy could not be transferred to high tls and was stranded at tls iii christensen and walters 2004 as a result excess energy was recycled directly to the detritus pool leading to a decrease in cycling indices e g fml fcl and the te originating from detritus 4 5 the ecosystem maturity adjusted by network analysis a series of indices that signify the maturity of a system odum 1969 ulanowicz 2004 including flows e g low tpp tb high tb tst tpp tr close to 1 cycles e g high fci and fmi connectance e g high ci and diversity high shannon index showed that the transition area from the wadeable to non wadeable stream at site 2 was the most mature however the opposite trends of all these indices observed at sites 5 6 especially for those with tpp in the numerator indicated immature systems downstream ulanowicz 1986 with pristine habits e g widespread riffles and intact floodplains the mountain stream in headwaters conserved the high te of epiphyte insect fish food chain which promoted the systemic capacity to carry more energy flows e g tpp tst with less redundancy bren 1993 allan and castillo 2007 however the immaturity of the unban and industrial rivers was caused mainly by the excessive production of phytoplankton which degraded the system to the early developmental stage see odum 1969 an unexpected finding was that the indices of system organisation such as soi and a c odum 1969 exhibited patterns opposite those of the maturity indices which has also been found in comparisons of marine systems baird et al 1991 baird and ulanowicz 1993 as suggested by monaco and ulanowicz 1997 the low levels of soi and a c with short cycles were due to the stresses acting on the system this suggests that the trophic networks midstream were more organised or web like than those downstream which were disturbed by human activity however under harsh physical conditions e g high current velocity shallow water depth given the insect centric food webs with less fish groups dudgeon et al 2010 the lowest soi and a c of upstream systems should be attributed to natural selection rather than external stresses consequently we suggested that the less disturbed upstream systems were relatively mature but underdeveloped in organisation whereas the systems in the lower urban and industrial reaches were immature and stressed due to the anthropogenic interferences 5 conclusion longitudinally the ecosystem characteristics of the east river showed high spatial heterogeneity as the basic energy supply detritus played more important roles than did producers bpredator ppredator and tq were determined by aquatic insects upstream molluscs midstream and zooplankton downstream the keystone groups shifted from odonate larvae in headwaters to piscivorous fish upstream midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary as prey in short supply insects insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes which had ees 0 99 restrained model mass balance the lack of carnivorous fish upstream and the low predation on molluscs midstream and on zooplankton downstream led to the low tes of tls ii iii a series of indices showed that the pristine upstream ecosystems were relatively mature but underdeveloped in organisation however the disturbed downstream ecosystems were immature and stressed due to the

25188,to understand the longitudinal variation in the structure and functioning of large river ecosystems six ecopath models were constructed to exhibit the energy flows of aquatic food webs along the subtropical east river in china input parameters were primarily obtained from field data collected in 2012 2016 model outputs were estimated by network analysis longitudinally ecosystem characteristics of the east river had high spatial heterogeneity the biomass production and consumption of which 75 8 of each was distributed at trophic level tl ii were determined by aquatic insects upstream molluscs midstream and zooplankton downstream carnivorous fish occupied the maximal tl of 2 95 3 50 due to the different trophic interactions of regional food webs the keystone groups shifted from odonate larvae in headwaters to piscivorous fish upstream midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary aquatic insects insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes all of which had ecotrophic efficiencies 0 99 were critical groups that influenced mass balance through short prey supply the mean transfer efficiencies tes through tls iiiv had the lowest values of 1 8 4 1 upstream and increased to the highest levels of 8 0 8 4 midstream before they decreased to 6 4 7 0 downstream the low tes along the river were limited mainly by the lack of carnivorous fish upstream and the low predation on mollus and plankton midstream downstream a series of theory and information indices showed that the pristine upstream system was mature but underdeveloped in organisation in contrast the downstream systems in the urban and industrial reaches were immature and stressed in terms of excessive phytoplankton production and short cycling keywords ecopath food web trophic impacts keystone species system indice 1 introduction river ecosystems are influenced by regional climate geography and hydrology which in turn influence the distribution of organisms through reciprocal feedbacks humphries et al 2014 following the ecology of running waters hynes 1970 the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 flood pulse concept junk et al 1989 and riverine productivity model thorp and delong 1994 have summarised how rivers change biologically e g in species composition the distribution of functional groups autochthonous vs allochthonous organic matter from source to mouth accordingly downstream shifts in these living non living components of food webs and their internal predator prey links might determine region specific material supply and demand power and dietrich 2002 thorp et al 2006 which influences the energy flows throughout fluvial ecosystems however because of the geographic partitioning of biozonations in running waters it is difficult to integrate the ecological attributes of species or functional groups in discrete habitats allan and castillo 2007 additionally compared with closed and semi closed systems e g lake reservoir pond lagoon bay open rivers receive organic matter input from upper stream and riparian zones dudgeon 2000 leading to complex trophic interactions thus there are challenges in quantifying food web structures and in synthesising overall material energetic pathways and the trophic processes and dynamics of riverine ecosystems are less understood than their lacustrine and marine counterparts power and dietrich 2002 in particular absent from the literature are spatial comparisons of energy flow patterns and ecosystem properties from headwaters to estuaries to advance our understanding of river ecosystems it is essential to precisely sketch the trophic networks and use common indicators to evaluate system functioning christensen 1995 over the last three decades this gap has been reduced with the application of ecological modelling and a large body of standardised food web models colléter et al 2015 based on an approach proposed by polovina 1984 and further developed by christensen and pauly 1992 ecopath software which relies on straightforward mass balance constraints and non linear trophic interactions was originally used to assess marine fisheries currently although ecopath has been generalised to freshwater systems e g lakes reservoirs see villanueva et al 2008 darwall et al 2010 its use in large rivers which differ greatly in downstream hydrologic and topographical units has been less reported but see models built on headwater streams meyer and poepperl 2004 lin et al 2012 warren et al 2014 through network analysis of ecopath production consumption predation trophic impacts and ecotrophic transfer efficiency can be estimated to describe how energy flows in systems and the roles that groups play therein monaco and ulanowicz 1997 moreover a series of theory and information indices e g cycle connectance omnivory ascendency allow researchers to compare the properties of ecosystems with different sizes geographic locations and trophic statuses baird and ulanowicz 1993 therefore ecopath which provides multiple systematic indicators is suitable for studying the longitudinal heterogeneity of fluvial trophic networks with model outputs policymakers can recognise the developmental stage maturity stability and diversity of any aquatic system which satisfies the needs of stream river conservation and management pauly et al 2000 furthermore compared with studies of food web structures and energy flow networks undertaken in temperate zones exploration of aquatic ecosystems in the tropics subtropics is still limited because of the restricted geographic distribution of these ecosystems boyero et al 2009 dudgeon et al 2010 suggested that ecological notions e g faunal distribution trophic dynamics for northern temperate streams are inadequate for describing tropical streams for example due to the constant illumination and high water temperature lowland tropical streams are functionally more different from temperate streams than from their high altitude counterparts however except for duan et al 2009 and lin et al 2012 who simulated the energy flows in the pearl river estuary and chichiawan stream few ecopath models have been constructed for subtropical streams rivers thus further evidence of ecosystem properties and associated comparative analyses are needed located in a subtropical monsoon climate the east river is of great importance for power generation irrigation navigation and water supply in guangdong province the biotic and abiotic parameters of the east river including habitats water quality and species composition have been studied since 2012 to gain insight into the structure and functioning of large river ecosystems the specific objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the energy flows of food webs in six sections of the east river 2 estimate the major production and consumption flows in regional food webs 3 analyse the trophic interactions among functional groups and find the keystone groups 4 characterise the spatial differentiation of trophic efficiencies and ecosystem properties and 5 identify the potential anthropogenic disturbances that influence the energy transfer and maturity of the ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the east river is 562 km long and has a drainage area of 35 340 km2 with an annual average precipitation of 1750 mm and discharge of 32 4 billion m3 as the main source of potable water for hong kong 80 shenzhen dongguan and guangzhou the ecology and environment of the east river ecosystem are of the upmost importance to the sustainable development of the pearl river delta lee et al 2007 due to economic development over the past several decades the river basin has experienced rapid population growth and associated anthropogenic activities leading to drastic extraneous interferences from humans the main ecological stresses are 1 reclamation and bank hardening that cause habitat loss 2 increasing industrial and domestic sewage discharges and 3 sediment mining that destroys substrate wang et al 2008 field sampling was conducted four times a year during the rainy may and august and dry november and february seasons in 2012 2016 at the six main stem sites along the river fig 1 during each sampling event biotic e g species composition biomass and abiotic e g habitat characteristics data were collected concurrently and the samples of water detritus and stomach gut contents were analysed in the laboratory methods a1 a2 longitudinally there was a decrease in elevation velocity and dissolved oxygen do but an increase in channel width water depth discharge temperature electrical conductivity ec and ph values table b1 nitrogen concentrations were lower upstream and increased sharply midstream where non point source pollution was present from agricultural runoff in the downstream urban reaches the direct discharge of domestic sewage into the watercourse increased leading to higher ec and phosphorous concentrations notably near the industrialised zones around the river mouth extremely low do and the highest ec and nutrient concentrations were recorded indicating regional water pollution caused by raw sewage and industrial waste wadeable upstream sites 1 2 were in pristine upland areas with boulder and cobble substrates table b2 site 1 in the montane headwaters was bordered by eucalyptus forest and the riparian vegetation was dominated by littoral annual herbage at site 2 greater diversities of habitats and plants were supported by the wider channel and floodplain areas and the riverbed was covered with submerged hydrilla verticillata non wadeable sites 3 4 which have gravel and sand substrates were in the midstream foothills typical plants included submerged myriophyllum verticillatum and riparian bamboo forest downstream sites 5 6 with silt substrate have been largely affected by artificial engineering e g the channelised tributaries and reinforced banks resulting in the loss of riffles and floodplains limited by steep revetments and low water transparency few aquatic hydrophytes could be found except for the invasive floating eichhornia crassipes in the middle lower reaches the flow regimes and flood pulses were regulated by fengshu and jiantan dam resulting in a slower water velocity and greater depth with atrophic floodplains 2 2 modelling approach the basic condition considered for ecopath is that the energy inputs and outputs of all biomass compartments must be balanced two equations are used to parameterise an ecopath model christensen and walters 2004 the first equation describes the production of each group production catch predation mortality net migration biomass accumulation other mortality 1 p b i bi yi bj q b j dcji nmi bai q b i bi 1 eei where for prey i and predator j p b is production to biomass ratio b is biomass y is fisheries catch q b is consumption to biomass ratio dcji is the proportion of prey i in the diet composition of predator j nm is net migration rate ba is biomass accumulation rate ee is ecotrophic efficiency and 1 ee is mortality other than that from predation and fishing the second equation ensures energy balance within each functional group consumption production respiration unassimilated food 2 qi pi ri uci qi where for predator i q is consumption p is production r is respiration and uc is the unassimilated to consumption ratio for each functional group b and y were derived from the field sampling and surveys during 2012 2016 the prey items and their proportions in dc matrixes of predators were identified and quantified respectively in the laboratory the p b of producers and the import of detritus were determined in the field whereas p b q b and other input parameters e g respiration migration other mortality of fish and invertebrates were calculated after solving the set of linear equations see christensen et al 2008a b the input parameters of the six models were assumed to represent the mean and uncertainty of the ecological data collected during the past five years 2 3 data collection and input parameters the basic input parameters e g b p b q b uc for the six ecopath models are listed in table c1 the biomass of fish macroinvertebrates zooplankton algae hydrophytes and detritus was determined based on sampling along the river due to the different habitats between shallow streams and deep rivers two sets of methodologies were used method a2 at the upstream wadeable sites 1 2 all the functional groups were sampled across riffles runs and pools following the guidelines of barbour et al 1999 at the midstream downstream non wadeable sites 3 6 the groups were sampled in the main channels and nearshore zones 1 2 m depth following the guidelines of flotemersch et al 2006 for fish and invertebrate groups their input biomass was weighted by the proportion of the living habitat area to total reach area the p b q b and associated conversion coefficients were calculated according to the empirical formulae method a3 provided by christensen et al 2008b brey 1999 and kuns and sprules 2000 net production np and community respiration cr rates were derived from changes in do concentrations over time in the illuminated and darkened incubations of epiphytes and phytoplankton method a2 because both measurements reflect the oxygen turnover of the entire system including photoautotrophic and heterotrophic activities np and cr expressed production and respiration at the community level np had negative values if the oxygen consumption exceeded oxygen production by photosynthesis the oxygen production rates were converted to carbon fixation rates using a photosynthetic quotient of 1 2 mills and wilkinson 2009 to distinguish the components of bproducer and total primary production tpp the sum of np by all producers the chlorophyll a of phytoplankton and epiphytes were transformed to areal wet weights g m2 with related conversion coefficients method a3 2 4 diet composition and unassimilated consumption gravimetric and volumetric methods were combined to analyse the stomach or gut contents of fish and invertebrates method a4 for the six models the dc matrixes of predators and the species family composition of each fish invertebrate group are shown in tables c2 and c3 respectively twelve prey items including detritus d epiphytes e hydrophytes h phytoplankton t zooplankton z insect larvae i excluding odonate predators odonate larvae o gastropods g bivalves v annelids a shrimps s and fish f were identified to cluster the 84 fish species into 32 groups the principle that the combination of main prey contributed 50 to the dc of each fish species was followed to classify the prey oriented feeding groups the name of each fish group was defined and sorted according to the contribution of each prey for example pelteobagrus fulvidraco belonged to group sio because its dc consisted of shrimps insects odonates and other prey at values of 23 24 21 43 10 57 and 44 76 respectively invertebrates were classified based on behavioural and morphological features since their dcs were simple morse et al 1994 to reflect the holistic flows of production consumption and predation tables 2 and 3 the prey oriented fish feeding groups were integrated into carnivore piscivore f f s s s i s o s i o o invertivore insectivore i i o i v i s i g molluscivore v v d i a v omnivore i d g h i e e i h v v h v e d v a herbivore e e d h h d detritivore d d e d t and planktivore z t the invertebrate groups were integrated into aquatic insect larvae predator shredder scraper gatherer filterer mollusc gastropod bivalve decapod shrimp crab and annelid leech oligochaete polychaete according to the parameters provided by winberg 1956 welch 1968 benke and wallace 1980 lin et al 2007 and lin et al 2012 the uc rates of prey items were set as 20 35 60 and 70 for nekton e g fish shrimp macroinvertebrates e g insects molluscs algae particular organic matter and vascular plant debris organic sediment respectively the final uc values for each predator group were weighed by the relative proportion of each prey item in dc 2 5 model balancing and basic estimate ecological and thermodynamic rules were followed based on a series of logical constraints ee 1 0 1 gross efficiency 0 3 gross efficiency net efficiency respiration assimilation 1 and production respiration 1 odum 1969 christensen et al 2008a to balance the models the first attempt was made by evaluating whether the ee estimated in the model was 1 for each group for groups with ee 1 the annual mean values of biomass primary production and fisheries catch that were directly measured were left unchanged the input parameters derived from literature e g uc or estimated by empirical models e g p b q b were modified to conform to the constraints in addition the insufficient supply of prey i for predator j was adjusted by 1 reducing the proportion of prey i in the diets of predator j i e dcji within uncertainty intervals table c4 and 2 adding upstream imports when dcji values fell out of the acceptable ranges the uncertainty associated with the input values of the model was assessed based on the pedigree index which was 0 85 for each of the six models indicating a high level of credibility to avoid bias in the estimated values of different parameters the preliminary data were introduced into the ecoranger routine ecopath 5 1 version and ranges based on measured relative errors were introduced table c4 random input variables were drawn from a normal distribution for each basic parameter the process was repeated in order to generate a theoretical frequency distribution for each parameter using monte carlo simulations a total of 10 000 models were run and 200 fitting scenarios were selected to propagate uncertainty from inputs to synthetic indices with mean and standard deviation of input parameters estimated 2 6 ecosystem characteristics and network analysis the total system throughput tst and its four components including total consumption tq total respiration tr total flows into detritus and total exports were used as parameters to compare the size of entire trophic networks ulanowicz 2004 the tpp tr describes the maturity of the system and tpp tr values close to 1 indicate mature ecosystems odum 1971 ulanowicz 1986 the total biomass tst tb tst is used to assess the tb supported by the available energy and the estimated value tends to be low during the early phases of development and increases as the system matures mixed trophic impact mti which is the sum of positive impact pi and negative impact ni allows for the assessment of trophic interactions through measuring how changes in the biomass of a group affect the biomasses of other groups christensen and walters 2004 the keystoneness index ksi of a given group was determined as a function of both the estimated mti and its own biomass libralato et al 2006 the relative proportions of ni and pi in the estimated overall mtis were used to evaluate the bottom up vs top down effects of keystone groups on trophic cascades transfer efficiencies tes between successive discrete trophic levels tls were calculated as the ratio of the sum of exports plus the flow that was transferred from one tl to the next to the throughput of the concerned tl the system omnivory index soi measures the degree of food web omnivory by quantifying the distribution of feeding interactions among tls the connectance index ci is the ratio of the number of expressed links to the number of theoretically possible links soi and ci are used to 1 understand the capabilities of ecosystems to respond to natural and anthropic perturbations and 2 evaluate system maturity a food chain is expected to change from linear to web like as the system matures odum 1971 pauly et al 2000 however the complexity indicator soi is affected by the number configuration and weights of links rather than by food web structure whereas the topological indicator ci is significantly correlated with the number of groups used to define the food web libralato 2016 finn s cycling index fci which is the proportion of tst recycled in a system indicates a system s ability to maintain its structure and integrity through positive feedback odum 1971 christensen 1995 finn s mean path length fml and finn s straight through path length excluding detritus which account for the number of groups involved in a flow is a method of quantifying the length of each cycle disturbed systems are characterised by short and fast cycles while complex trophic structures have long and slow cycles thus low values of fci and fml indicate an immature or stressed system and a short food chain controlled by bottom up forces ascendency scaled by system throughput is a measure of system growth e g age size and network development e g organisation links the upper limit to ascendency is the development capacity and the difference between capacity and ascendency is the system overhead overhead reflects the system s reserved strength from which it can draw to mitigate the effects of unexpected perturbations monaco and ulanowicz 1997 thus a system with a high ascendency capacity a c ratio is developed and diversified in contrast a system with a high overhead capacity ratio is resilient and has strength in reserve 3 results 3 1 trophic levels and ecotrophic efficiency six mass balance flow diagrams are shown in fig 2 with groups at tls 2 50 listed in table d1 as top predators carnivorous fish which fed on small invertivorous fish palaemonid shrimps and odonate larvae occupied maximum tls of 2 95 3 50 see dc matrixes in table c2 planktivorous fish in group z which emerged in pelagic zones near the estuary and fed on copepods and malacostracan were at tls 2 96 3 12 invertivorous fish which fed on aquatic insect larvae e g diptera trichoptera elmidae soft shelled molluscs e g radix limnoperna and polychaetes e g nereidae were at tls 2 65 2 98 notably odonate and corydalid larvae which fed on chironomidae and baetidae were only the second invertebrate consumers to reach tls 2 31 2 85 prey i with ee 1 table d2 have insufficient yearly production for predator j which needs additional imports in dcji for producers the ees of epiphyte and hydrophyte increased continuously downstream and reached 0 99 at sites 5 6 for invertebrates the ees of insect scrapers and filterers that could only be sampled upstream reached 0 99 at site 2 the ees of insect shredders and gatherers reached 0 99 at site 3 however insect gatherers had ee of 0 99 at sites 4 6 as prey for carnivorous fish table c2 odonate larvae shrimps and small insectivorous fish e g groups i i v had ees of 0 99 at sites 4 6 generally the increasing ees of these groups corresponded to their decreasing biomass and production table 1 especially the insects that disappeared sharply down the river the short supply of insects influenced the mass balance at most sites while other groups only affected downstream 3 2 biomass and production the biomass b and production p of producer and consumer groups are shown in table 1 longitudinally bfish and pfish increased from site 1 0 36 g m2 0 38 g m2 year to site 6 8 5 g m2 17 g m2 year with the major contribution shifting from invertivores 46 upstream to herbivores 30 and omnivores 42 midstream and to detritivores 43 downstream binvertebrate and pinvertebrate which were 3 2 186 times higher than bfish and pfish first increased from site 1 9 6 g m2 53 g m2 year to site 2 43 g m2 186 g m2 year and then increased from site 3 7 9 g m2 28 g m2 year to site 6 27 g m2 303 g m2 year with the major contribution shifting from insects 53 upstream to molluscs 52 midstream and to molluscs 85 in b and zooplankton 57 in p downstream bproducer and tpp increased from site 1 2 7 g m2 286 g m2 year to site 5 14 g m2 4566 g m2 year and then decreased at site 6 8 5 g m2 2963 g m2 year similarly the sum of import and backflows to detritus which was 1 1 2 5 times higher than the tpp increased from sites 1 to 5 713 4910 g m2 year and decreased at site 6 3566 g m2 year the contribution of epiphytes to bproducer and tpp decreased from 96 at site 1 to 5 4 at site 6 whereas the contribution of phytoplankton increased from 3 7 at site 1 to 90 at site 6 with a midstream transition observed at site 3 the contribution of hydrophytes to tpp was low 6 64 however the extremely high bhydrophyte at sites 2 3 which contributed 53 72 of the local bproducer before it decreased to 3 7 at site 6 led to the highest bproducer recorded along the river 3 3 consumption predation and unutilised production the consumption q predation and unutilised production punutilised flowing back to detritus are shown in table 2 at sites 1 6 93 97 251 1812 g m2 year of the tq i e the sum of qfish and qinvertebrate was concentrated at tl ii followed by 3 3 7 2 17 114 g m2 year at tl iii and by 0 02 0 35 0 2 1 4 g m2 year at tl iv at tl v the tq of 0 019 g m2 year was extremely low 0 002 longitudinally qfish increased continuously from 6 9 g m2 year at site 1 to 117 g m2 year at site 6 qinvertebrate which was 4 8 184 times higher than qfish increased from 518 to 1528 g m2 year at sites 1 2 and then increased from 222 to 1162 g m2 year at sites 3 6 longitudinally since qinvertebrate contributed 83 to tq tq showed the same changing tendency as qinvertebrate and was determined by the contribution of insects 80 upstream molluscs 42 midstream and zooplankton 48 downstream detritus contributed the most 67 76 to predation at sites 1 6 followed by epiphytes 17 21 at sites 1 2 hydrophytes 8 1 at site 3 and phytoplankton 9 7 26 at sites 4 6 table 2 invertebrates contributed 3 8 7 2 of the predation and included primarily insects 53 99 at sites 1 3 molluscs 54 at site 4 and zooplankton 50 52 at sites 5 6 fish contributed only 0 01 0 38 to predation producers contributed the most 64 98 to punutilised and were determined by epiphytes at sites 1 2 97 and by phytoplankton at sites 3 6 75 the contribution of invertebrates to the punutilised was 1 3 13 which was determined by insects 74 at site 1 molluscs at sites 2 4 56 75 and zooplankton 60 64 at sites 5 6 notably at sites 1 6 51 99 of pinsect was utilised through predation however only 1 7 40 of pmollusc and 17 24 of pzooplankton were utilised through predation 3 4 keystoneness and mixed trophic impacts ksi and mti were used to represent the site specific trophic roles that groups play along the river figs 3 and 4 details in table d3 groups with the highest ksi exhibited longitudinal shifts from odonate larvae at site 1 to fish group f at sites 2 4 to zooplankton at site 5 and to phytoplankton at site 6 fig 3 groups with the strongest mti shifted from odonate larvae at sites 1 3 to fish group f at site 4 to zooplankton at site 5 and to fish groups d and v at site 6 table d3 groups with the strongest ni shifted from insect filterer at site 1 to fish group f at sites 2 4 and to fish group d at sites 5 6 at sites 1 2 odonate larvae had the strongest pi however at sites 3 6 the pi of detritus was the strongest followed by the pi of hydrophytes at site 3 of epiphytes at sites 4 5 and of phytoplankton at site 6 at each site the pi of detritus 2 84 4 39 was stronger than the total pi of producers 1 14 3 22 additionally groups that positively or negatively influenced most other groups were identified fig 4 generally detritus positively influenced 69 of groups at sites 1 6 followed by epiphytes 64 of groups at sites 1 4 and phytoplankton 63 of groups at sites 5 6 upstream gastropods and insect gatherers negatively influenced 75 of groups midstream gastropods bivalves insect gatherers and annelids negatively influenced 74 of groups downstream fish group d gastropods and bivalves negatively influenced 79 of groups at site 5 while fish group d gastropods and crabs negatively influenced 78 of groups at site 6 3 5 transfer efficiencies of lindeman spine as 99 9 of the throughput of energy flows was distributed at tls i v table 2 we focused on the tes of tls ii iv which determined the predominant transfer processes tes of tl ii iii and iv which were calculated from a combination of producers and detritus are shown in fig 5 the geometric mean tes though tls ii iv originating from producers from detritus and from the two combined were extremely low in headwaters 1 56 1 79 and 1 77 respectively at site 1 increased upstream 4 10 4 14 and 4 13 respectively at site 2 reached their highest levels midstream 8 39 8 19 and 8 24 respectively averaged for sites 3 4 and then decreased downstream 6 59 6 35 and 6 39 respectively averaged for sites 5 6 the te of tl ii was observed to be the highest 6 83 7 78 at sites 1 2 and then decreased to 5 74 6 70 at sites 3 4 and to 3 84 4 20 at sites 5 6 in contrast the te of tl iii was observed to be the lowest 1 53 2 60 at sites 1 2 and then increased and reached the highest levels of 8 10 8 99 at sites 3 4 before decreasing to 7 17 7 69 at sites 5 6 notably as the highest tl of the east river food web was 3 50 few energy flows could be transferred from tl iv to v by predation thus the te of tl iv had an extremely low value of 0 52 at site 1 and increased from 3 49 at site 2 to 9 47 11 0 at sites 3 6 due to the increased catch of carnivorous fish in the middle and lower reaches 3 6 ecosystem characteristics the indices of ecosystem theory and information are given in table 3 the tst increased from 1791 g m2 year to 10 953 g m2 year at sites 1 5 but decreased to 8605 g m2 year at site 6 indicating a longitudinal increase in system size with a decrease near the estuary the ratios of tpp tr and tpp tb increased from the lowest values of 1 27 and 10 3 respectively at site 2 to the highest values of 7 82 and 89 1 respectively at site 5 in contrast the tb tst ratio decreased from the highest value of 0 0223 at site 2 to the lowest values of 0 0047 at site 5 the connectance and diversity indices which fall in the scope of 0 245 0 380 and 1 68 1 96 respectively were the highest at site 2 and the lowest at site 6 in contrast as information and omnivory indices both the a c ratio and soi had the lowest values of 20 7 27 3 and 0 043 0 085 respectively at upstream sites 1 2 and the highest values of 41 4 44 3 and 0 125 0 130 respectively at midstream sites 3 4 as cycling indices the values of fci and fml which fall in the scope of 4 40 19 5 and 2 29 3 94 respectively were the highest at site 2 and the lowest at site 6 notably the difference between the fmls of 3 44 3 94 at sites 1 2 and the fmls of 2 29 2 90 at sites 3 6 was approximately 1 which means that a unit of the energy flow g m2 of upstream systems will be transferred almost 1 more step than that of midstream and downstream systems in addition the high fci and fml values at sites 1 2 indicated that the local system flows recycled a larger proportion 17 2 19 5 of material with longer cycles and residence time and thus more energy was retained within the upstream food webs 4 discussion 4 1 the highest trophic levels and limited ecotrophic efficiencies similar to the findings in other freshwater systems e g streams lakes reservoirs see darwall et al 2010 jia et al 2012 lin et al 2012 and villanueva et al 2008 carnivorous fish in the east river occupied the maximum tls of 3 0 3 5 which are lower than the tls of 4 0 reported in marine systems pauly et al 2000 heymans et al 2014 castellanos galindo et al 2017 indeed since invertivorous fish and odonate larvae were the only prey that reached tls 2 5 3 0 their proportions in the dc of carnivorous fish determined the upper limit to the tls of the local food web for example the tl of fish group f was 3 50 at site 2 due to the 67 3 invertivorous fish in dc whereas it was 3 24 at site 5 due to the 37 4 invertivorous fish in dc additionally with the exception of fish group z which emerged in the upper middle water layers downstream a lack of pelagic carnivorous fish in the east river also constrained the highest tl libralato et al 2006 heymans et al 2014 with ees close to 1 table d2 aquatic insect larvae insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes are limited prey sources that influence model balance through short supply christensen and walters 2004 upstream the yearly production of insect prey could still sustain the consumption of fish and odonate predators however due to the sharply decreased binsect and pinsect midstream insect prey e g gatherers shredders scrapers filterers were over consumed by odonate larvae and invertivorous fish in addition as binsect and pinsect further decreased while bcarnivore and qcarnivore increased downstream odonate larvae shrimp and small insectivorous fish became the prey in short supply which resulted in additional required imports to the dc matrix moreover the ees of epiphytes and hydrophytes increased continuously downstream and reached 0 99 near the estuary indicating their insufficient supply for the local gastropods and herbivorous fish e g groups h hd 4 2 basic energy supply production and consumption detritus was the most basic energy supply because 1 the sum of import and backflows to detritus was higher than the tpp 2 the predation on detritus was higher than that on any other group and 3 detritus had stronger pi and mti than did producers table d3 of producers epiphytes were the major contributor to bproducer and tpp in upstream riffles with cobble substratum however they were replaced by phytoplankton in downstream semi lentic waters with rich nutrients table b1 nevertheless both the ksi and pi of epiphytes were much higher than those of phytoplankton down the river except near the estuary where phytoplankton was heavily utilised by zooplankton and planktivorous fish compared with lacustrine and marine systems jia et al 2012 heymans et al 2016 our results indicated that independent of the production provided detritus and epiphytes played more significant trophic roles than did phytoplankton in fluvial systems as 92 of tq was concentrated at tl ii table 2 most energy flows in the east river were transferred through the short predator prey links at the food web bottom i e from detritus or producers at tl i to primary consumers at tl ii woodward and hildrew 2002 invertebrates rather than fish determined bpredator 76 ppredator 90 and tq 83 indicating the invertebrate centric food webs based on the spatial partitioning of functional groups predicted by the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 our results proved that both the consumption and secondary production of the fluvial energy networks were determined by aquatic insects upstream by molluscs midstream and by zooplankton downstream such longitudinal variation might be explained by the downstream changing physical conditions e g substratum velocity depth which determined the region specific faunal distribution and structure hynes 1970 4 3 keystone groups and their trophic impacts functional groups with the highest ksi shifted from odonate larvae upstream to fish group f midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary indicating differentiated trophic interactions in regional food webs in the upper middle reaches as predators at high tls odonate larvae and fish group f which had the highest ksi and the strongest mti exerted top down control through their predation effects libralato et al 2006 interestingly in contrast to the mti of fish group f within which ni contributed 65 pi contributed 71 to the mti of odonate larvae the main reason is that the predation of odonate larvae not only had direct ni on insects but also had indirect pi on molluscs by reducing their food competition with insects and primary producers by reducing the predation stress from insects however near the estuary keystone groups shifted from top predators to plankton at low tls in contrast to upstream where the strongest mti was determined by predation effects at site 5 zooplankton with the highest ksi had the strongest mti because of this group s ni food competition with primary consumers e g molluscs annelids and pi being utilised by planktivorous fish e g group z at site 6 the highest ksi of phytoplankton could be explained by this group s extensive pi as a basic prey supply for predators especially zooplankton and molluscs these downstream changes in ksi and mti suggested that the effects of predation competition and demand on prey decided which and where a group became keystone along the river cury et al 2000 at a temporal scale the shifts in the highest ksi from groups at high tls to groups at low tls indicated the transition from top down to bottom up control libralato et al 2006 this pattern was what we found in a longitudinal gradient along the east river one problem few studies have focused on is which group has the most extensive impacts on the other groups in number undoubtedly as basic prey detritus and producers had pi on most predators however an interesting finding is that although gastropods and bivalves had low ksi and weak mti they had ni on most groups the reasons are that 1 molluscs compete with other primary consumers on detritus and 2 except for the fragile radix and limnoperna which were utilised by fish groups containing g and v the hard shelled molluscs e g bellamya semisulcospira unio are indigestible for fish therefore the high bmollusc and pmollusc were underutilised through predation and flowed back to detritus downstream the ni of fish group d and crabs on most groups could be explained in the same way 4 4 longitudinal variation in transfer efficiencies along the east river the mean tes through tls ii iv were lower than those reported in other stream systems meyer and poepperl 2004 lin et al 2012 generally the low tes were caused by 1 a lack of carnivorous fish upstream 2 low predation on molluscs midstream and 3 an inefficient use of plankton downstream upstream the highest te of tl ii was due to the heavy predation of invertivorous fish and odonate larvae on aquatic insects however the lowest te of tl iii was due to the lack of carnivorous fish because of which pfish and p odonate at tl iii could not be transferred to tl iv midstream such conditions were improved by the increased bcarnivore and qcarnivore which increased both the predation flows from tls iii to iv and the mean tes originating from tl i nevertheless since midstream molluscs replaced upstream insects as the major contributor to ppredator the low predation on molluscs led to the decreased te of tl ii at sites 3 4 downstream although rich nutrients and slow velocity stimulated the increase in bproducer and tpp the inefficient use of molluscs and zooplankton further reduced the te of tl ii to its lowest level additionally compared with the high bplanktivore in lakes and reservoirs villanueva et al 2008 feroz khan and panikkar 2009 the low bplanktivore e g groups z t in the lower east river which might be caused by the dam blocks and fishing pressure lin et al 2007 led to the underutilisation of plankton and large amounts of backflows to detritus in other words as the supply exceeded the demand in the pelagic food web the energy could not be transferred to high tls and was stranded at tls iii christensen and walters 2004 as a result excess energy was recycled directly to the detritus pool leading to a decrease in cycling indices e g fml fcl and the te originating from detritus 4 5 the ecosystem maturity adjusted by network analysis a series of indices that signify the maturity of a system odum 1969 ulanowicz 2004 including flows e g low tpp tb high tb tst tpp tr close to 1 cycles e g high fci and fmi connectance e g high ci and diversity high shannon index showed that the transition area from the wadeable to non wadeable stream at site 2 was the most mature however the opposite trends of all these indices observed at sites 5 6 especially for those with tpp in the numerator indicated immature systems downstream ulanowicz 1986 with pristine habits e g widespread riffles and intact floodplains the mountain stream in headwaters conserved the high te of epiphyte insect fish food chain which promoted the systemic capacity to carry more energy flows e g tpp tst with less redundancy bren 1993 allan and castillo 2007 however the immaturity of the unban and industrial rivers was caused mainly by the excessive production of phytoplankton which degraded the system to the early developmental stage see odum 1969 an unexpected finding was that the indices of system organisation such as soi and a c odum 1969 exhibited patterns opposite those of the maturity indices which has also been found in comparisons of marine systems baird et al 1991 baird and ulanowicz 1993 as suggested by monaco and ulanowicz 1997 the low levels of soi and a c with short cycles were due to the stresses acting on the system this suggests that the trophic networks midstream were more organised or web like than those downstream which were disturbed by human activity however under harsh physical conditions e g high current velocity shallow water depth given the insect centric food webs with less fish groups dudgeon et al 2010 the lowest soi and a c of upstream systems should be attributed to natural selection rather than external stresses consequently we suggested that the less disturbed upstream systems were relatively mature but underdeveloped in organisation whereas the systems in the lower urban and industrial reaches were immature and stressed due to the anthropogenic interferences 5 conclusion longitudinally the ecosystem characteristics of the east river showed high spatial heterogeneity as the basic energy supply detritus played more important roles than did producers bpredator ppredator and tq were determined by aquatic insects upstream molluscs midstream and zooplankton downstream the keystone groups shifted from odonate larvae in headwaters to piscivorous fish upstream midstream to zooplankton downstream and to phytoplankton near the estuary as prey in short supply insects insectivorous fish epiphytes and hydrophytes which had ees 0 99 restrained model mass balance the lack of carnivorous fish upstream and the low predation on molluscs midstream and on zooplankton downstream led to the low tes of tls ii iii a series of indices showed that the pristine upstream ecosystems were relatively mature but underdeveloped in organisation however the disturbed downstream ecosystems were immature and stressed due to the excessive phytoplankton production acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the joint funds of the national natural science foundation of china no u1501235 and u1405234 and the

25189,tick borne diseases are increasing worldwide and have a progressively negative impact on human health the black legged tick ixodes scapularis is the known vector of several emerging tick borne diseases to effectively manage diseases requires enhanced knowledge of the interactions of the tick its hosts and the environment modeling approaches may offer a way to evaluate vector control strategies since it is impossible to conduct large scale experiments in natural settings therefore we created the first spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim that is designed from the perspective of the tick to examine the processes through which i scapularis populations are maintained using a two host wildlife community consisting of white footed mice peromyscus leucopus and white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus we parameterized our model so that i scapularis infestation rates for p leucopus are within the range of those reported in field studies once our model seib tim accurately simulated the interactions between i scapularis wildlife hosts and the environment we evaluated its robustness to parameter uncertainty using both global and local sensitivity analyses lastly we related changes in model parameters to i scapularis life history traits to understand how those changes affected the maintenance of i scapularis populations we found that of the model parameters we examined increasing mouse grooming by 10 reduced the total questing nymph population by 30 in ten years in addition a 10 reduction in deer grooming is capable of reducing the questing larvae population by 36 and questing nymph population by 35 this result indicates that management interventions aimed at decreasing the number of larval ticks that can successfully feed on mice in addition to targeting the reproductive stage of the ticks lifecycle can potentially reduce tick populations we therefore conclude that effective management efforts should be aimed at multiple stages in the ticks life cycle and enacted for the long term the maintenance of tick populations can be better understood and controlling mechanisms identified when incorporating information on all components of the tick life cycle into the model this seib tim model serves as the foundation for a more complex model with additional host species as well as tick borne pathogens keywords black legged tick individual based model ixodes scapularis tick borne disease 1 introduction tick borne diseases are increasing worldwide and have had a progressively negative impact on human health over the past century gaff and gross 2007 jones et al 2008 the black legged tick ixodes scapularis is the known vector of several emerging tick borne diseases including human babesiosis human anaplasmosis powassan virus and lyme disease spielman et al 1985 schwartz et al 1997 piesman and eisen 2008 to effectively manage the risk of contracting such diseases requires a better knowledge of the interactions of the tick their environment and the wildlife host community upon which they feed the wildlife host community is essential to the lifecycle of i scapularis therefore previous management efforts have sought to reduce human disease risk through the culling of wildlife thought to maintain i scapularis populations namely white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus wilson et al 1985 reducing deer populations in the attempt to disrupt the reproduction stage of the ticks life cycle is ineffective because adult ticks can obtain a blood meal from other wildlife hosts and each female tick can lay thousands of eggs deblinger et al 1993 rand et al 2003 more recently small rodents such as white footed mice peromyscus leucopus are being targeted by researchers e g tickproject org targeting small rodents has the potential to control tick populations because hosts for the juvenile stage of ticks can be a limiting factor van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 kurtenbach et al 2006 by understanding the factors that control interactions between wildlife host populations and the tick vector through novel strategies we can identify priorities for managing disease risk sandberg et al 1992 piesman and eisen 2008 one such strategy involves modeling which may be particularly useful especially since it is nearly impossible to perform large scale experimental studies of different management scenarios in natural settings van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 1998 wood et al 2014 explicitly modeling the interactions between the vector and wildlife community and decomposing the relative contributions of parameter changes to model output can help us to understand the factors that allow tick populations to propagate caraco et al 2002 dobson and stuart 2016 however previous models for vector borne diseases have tended to focus only on pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts while ignoring the population dynamics of the vector caraco et al 2002 most models that investigate tick and host population dynamics are state variable models taking the form of differential equations e g ogden et al 2005 wu et al 2010 maliyoni et al 2017 negative binomial e g tran and waller 2015 matrix models e g mount et al 1997 dobson and stuart 2016 and cellular automata e g madhav et al 2004 yet these models are limited in their ability to identify key factors in the ticks life cycle that influence population dynamics due to simplifying assumptions that reduce the number of processes in the model these include reducing the number of stages representing the life cycle of the tick vector characterizing individual tick behavior as homogeneous and ignoring the seasonal patterns of tick abundance van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 deelman et al 1996 caraco et al 2002 alternatively one could avoid these shortcomings by employing a bottom up approach and individual based modeling ibm grimm 1999 an ibm approach allows one to assign rules regarding the abiotic and biotic interactions between the ticks wildlife hosts and the environment to observe how they relate to the emergence of population dynamics lindsay et al 1999 several attempts using ibms have been promising yet computational challenges necessitated a reduction in detail so that ticks were not represented as individuals and host movements were simplified which excludes fundamental processes involved in the tick life cycle such as attachment rates to hosts as well as host grooming wang et al 2012 2016 to expand on previously developed ibms we designed a spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim that varies temperature i e microclimate across the environment does not aggregate ticks uses hourly time steps and incorporates life stage specific attachment rates we built our model for end users who may not have a lot of coding and modeling experience but have a need for simulation experiments that can mimic the habitat and wildlife host community composition unique to their study site for both simplicity and ease of use we chose to utilize an open source software package netlogo which has a user friendly interface wilensky 1999 we describe our model following the widely accepted comprehensive standard method for documentation of ibms grimm et al 2010 the scope of our model was to examine the processes through which two primary hosts p leucopus and o virginianus maintain i scapularis populations within a homogeneous northeast us forest we evaluated the general performance of the model regarding tick phenology before parameterizing the model by ensuring that i scapularis infestation rates for p leucopus were within the range of those seen in the field next we inspected the sensitivity of model parameters to evaluate the robustness of our model to parameter uncertainty finally we examined changes in parameters as they relate to i scapularis life history traits to identify important aspects of the ticks life cycle that may influence the maintenance of i scapularis populations 2 modeling description the spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim halsey and miller 2018 operates at the scale of the tick i scapularis and its interactions with the temperature of the surrounding environment as well as the wildlife hosts through which it obtains blood meals fig 1 2 1 purpose the purpose of the seib tim is to understand the relationships between i scapularis its hosts and the environment we do this by simulating these relationships in a way that is spatially and temporally realistic to the patterns of tick burdens observed in field studies in doing so we identify how changes in attachment and molting rates of the three life stages of i scapularis as well as host grooming rates influence questing tick density 2 2 entities state variables and scale the entities of the seib tim are ixodes tick agents representing larval nymphal and adult i scapularis small mammals representing p leucopus large mammals representing o virginianus and patches representing forest habitat the state variables for all entities are defined in table a 1 the seib tim is composed of an one hectare homogeneous forest habitat arranged on a 100 100 square grid with individual patches measuring 1 m2 the scale at which ticks interact with their environment the time step of the seib tim is 1 h 2 3 processes and scheduling the seib tim is constructed to match the ecology of i scapularis we divided our model into sub models that correspond with different behaviors of the tick as well as wildlife host movements the following sub models are executed once per time step in the given order representing the logical order of the lifespan of the tick pull temp dormancy development reproduction questing and feeding see sub model sections for details the last sub model host movement see section 2 9 7 also occurs once per time step and acts independently of the other sub models the order in which individual agents and patches execute a process is always randomized with state variables updated immediately after each operation fig 2 2 4 i scapularis life cycle ixodes scapularis has a two year life cycle which depends on blood meals from wildlife hosts for nutrition to transition through each of its post embryonic stages larva nymph and adult fish 1993 in the spring adult female ticks lay up to 3000 eggs which hatch into larvae in mid summer and after successfully obtaining a blood meal molt into nymphs before overwintering and questing i e searching for hosts to feed on the following year platt et al 1992 after nymphs obtain their blood meal they molt into adults in the fall at which time they obtain another blood meal and mate restarting the cycle the following year 2 5 design concepts 2 5 1 emergence total numbers of ixodes questing and feeding on any given host at any given time emerge from the combined behaviors of the agents ticks and hosts in response to the environment e g temperature 2 5 2 sensing ixodes tick agents can sense when an appropriate host is within one meter square of their location larvae and nymphs only feed on small mammals i e mice whereas adult ticks only feed on large mammals i e deer tälleklint and jaenson 1994 dobson and randolph 2011 ticks are also able to sense temperature which influences tick development as indicated by ambient temperature branagan 1973 calculated by degree days eq 1 mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 1 degree day t c minimum t c maximum 2 6 c 2 5 3 interaction interactions in the seib tim are restricted to tick host and tick environment 2 5 4 stochasticity daily temperature is calculated using a mean and standard deviation of temperature for the day therefore stochasticity is inherent in the temperature dependent actions of the model such as tick questing behavior and molting 2 5 5 observation at each time step the following information will be stored for each tick life stage larvae nymphs adults total number of ticks host specific tick infestation of each life stage to determine the threshold for which we could consider the simulated i scapularis population as representative of an established population we analyzed data on i scapularis infestation prevalence i e proportion of hosts infested and intensity i e average number of ticks from data collected on tick infestation rates over the past forty years halsey et al 2018 we used a mann whitney u non parametric test of group differences to determine whether there were differences in the prevalence and intensity of infestation of i scapularis on white footed mice and white tailed deer in recently invaded and established counties we created five groupings e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 where we categorized each data point as recently invaded or established based on the time since i scapularis was reported in the county for each grouping ex x is the cutoff for years since reported classified as recently invaded with the remaining later years classified as established 2 6 initial assumptions we made several assumptions in the seib tim based on our understanding of the important aspects of i scapularis life cycle larvae and nymphs are assumed only to attach to mice whereas adults only attach to deer dobson and randolph 2011 tälleklint and jaenson 1994 ticks are only able to molt if they feed to completion i e no partial feedings however we assume that 20 of ticks that are groomed off survive to resume questing and feed again cadenas et al 2007 in our model only temperature influences development times of i scapularis randolph and storey 1999 ogden et al 2005 leighton et al 2012 i scapularis is known to be sensitive to environmental conditions including temperature precipitation and humidity schauber et al 2005 killilea et al 2008 ogden et al 2006 ostfeld 2009 dhingra et al 2013 however the scope of our model is not to determine how weather variables influence tick populations rather we use temperature as a proxy to simulate tick development to understand how different aspects of the tick life cycle relate to population maintenance in our model we have a one hectare homogenous forest habitat and due to the small study area we do not assume edge effects horobik et al 2006 we chose to simulate a small study area due to only having a two host community this one hectare habitat size more accurately represents the host community composition whereas larger habitats necessitates the inclusion other species that can serve as wildlife hosts stafford and magnarelli 1993 allan et al 2003 brownstein et al 2005 in addition to isolate the aspects of the tick life cycle we chose to model only forest habitat which has both the highest rate of tick survival and is most likely to contribute to disease risk similar to wang et al 2012 we assume that wildlife hosts move within a set home range which is not dependent on the other hosts i e no territoriality or behavior avoidance wildlife hosts move once per time step and are not limited by the distance that they can move within their home range this results in wildlife host only being able to move 24 times a day a simplification and possible under representation of the movements within their activity range and potential contact with questing ticks wang et al 2012 all host populations are assumed to be at stable equilibria host density remains constant with no births deaths immigration or emigration happening within the habitat we do not incorporate sex differences among wildlife hosts regarding infestation rates but see ostfeld et al 1998 hamer et al 2012 we also assume that grooming efficacy i e the rate at which host remove ticks from their body is independent of sex and age of the host we chose not to explicitly include density dependent mortality in the form of a separate parameter instead using both grooming rate and attachment rate as a proxy mice are thought to be incapable of successfully grooming off attached ticks levin and fish 1998 and tick infestation level does not appear to affect the proportion of ticks that feed to completion hazler and ostfeld 1995 however we do constrain the maximum number of juvenile ticks per small mammal to 50 larvae or nymphs per host van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 1998 we initially sought to constrain the number of adult ticks to 100 dobson and randolph 2011 however in our model adult infestation never reached above 30 ticks per deer 2 7 initialization the seib tim initiates on january 1 a time when nymphs and adult ticks are dormant and overwintering platt et al 1992 initial model settings are 50 small mammals 2 deer and is based on density data per ha logiudice et al 2008 quality deer management association 2017 as well as 1500 overwintered nymphs 50 overwintered adults based on the mean number of feeding number of ticks per host usually found on each species halsey et al 2018 the justification for starting the model with two life stages larvae and nymphs is to simulate two cohorts of i scapularis as frequently observed in the wild fish 1993 hosts are randomly distributed throughout the environment 2 8 input data the inputs are the mean and standard deviation of daily temperature for the period 2010 2015 for connecticut us a key focal area of i scapularis as downloaded from the national climatic data center national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 2 9 sub models all model parameters are listed in table 1 2 9 1 pull temp this sub model operates only on patch entities for each square meter patch at hour 1 of each day the sub model will use the mean and standard deviation of the maximum and minimum temperature for the corresponding day to calculate the degree day eq 1 the degree day will be added to the patch state variable movingdd where the cmdd cumulative degree day holds the degree day for the last seven days this sub model also inserts the degree day into the patch state variable preovarr array an array that contains the average temperature for the last 17 days 2 9 2 dormanct the two year life cycle of i scapularis requires a period of dormancy over the winter fig 2b the procedure over winter changes the status to dormant for all ixodes agents once the mean cumulative degree day cmdd falls below 58 after the month of august mount et al 1997 the procedure awaken adults awaken nymphs and awaken larva changes the status of ixodes to questing once the mean cmdd increases to the threshold of 28 for adults 58 for nymphs and 110 for larvae 2 9 3 development this sub model operates on the ixodes tick agents which represent i scapularis fig 2c each ixodes agent is defined as either one of three life stages larva nymph or adult the first procedure of this sub model eggs to larvae creates ixodes with the larva life stage based on the number of eggs on a particular patch eggs are represented by a patch variable eggnum that keeps track of the number of eggs that were laid on that patch the second procedure harden cuticle represents the molting period from one life stage to the next one week for larva and nymphs and two weeks for adults mount et al 1997 the next procedure start questing asks the ixodes to change their status to questing the larva then enters the questing sub model see section 2 9 5 completion of a blood meal activates the procedure larvae to nymph to transition replete i e fed ixodes from the life stage larva into the life stage nymph based on the larva molting probability table 1 newly formed ixodes agents with the nymph status undergo a period of dormancy until the mean cmdd reaches the acceptable threshold for them to continue their life cycle in the following year incubate nymphs is a procedure representing the incubation period before replete nymphs transition to the adult life stage the next procedure nymph to adult uses the nymph molting probability to determine the likelihood that nymphs become adult ticks and in combination with procedure sex ratio assigns the sex of the ixodes based on a 50 50 probability any ixodes that are assigned to the male category dies all ixodes agents and the patch variable eggnum have a rate of mortality based on the number of weeks they have been in their current life stage and whether or not they are fed which is enacted by the procedure naturally die table 1 2 9 4 reproduction once female ixodes agents consume a blood meal and the mean cmdd reaches 28 the female begins a preoviposition period where their status becomes preoviposition indicating that there are getting ready to lay eggs fig 2e the number of eggs laid is dependent on the temperature for the past 17 days tracked by the patches in the pull temp sub model see section 2 9 1 once 17 days have passed since the adult female has started the preoviposition period the procedure female adult reproduce will be activated calculating the number of eggs the individual female will lay before dying table 1 2 9 5 questing the next procedure start questing asks the ixodes to change their status to questing from this point they can attach to any wildlife hosts that come within a one meter radius of their position 2 9 6 feed this sub model represents the process of i scapularis feeding on wildlife hosts fig 2d the feed ixodes procedure asks ixodes agents of any stage if their stage is questing and whether a wildlife host is within a meter radius of their position depending on if the tick is a juvenile or an adult the tick will attempt to attach to the host based on its corresponding attachment rate table 1 the next procedure detach ixodes removes the ixodes agent from a host once the agent has been attached to and feeding from a host for the specified amount of feeding time table 1 detachment involves updating the location of the ixodes agent to that of the attached wildlife host and setting the state variable replete to true the grooming procedure uses the grooming rates of wildlife host to remove feeding ixodes agents of the ixodes agents that are groomed off 80 die with the other 20 able to resume questing cadenas et al 2007 2 9 7 host movement this sub model represents the movements of the wildlife hosts mice and deer throughout the habitat using data on the minimum and maximum home ranges for mice and deer 0 05 0 07 ha and 216 345 ha respectively wolff 1985 dechen quinn et al 2013 with home ranges for each individual randomly chosen between those values each individual is allowed to randomly move once per time step within their home range if an agent reaches the edge of its home range it will face back towards the center of its home range 2 10 parameter estimation there are five unknown model parameters that have the potential to influence the number of ticks on hosts life stage specific tick attachment rate larvae nymph adult and nymph molting probability i e the success of nymph molting into adults and deer grooming i e the rate in which o virginianus removes feeding adult ticks to estimate model parameters we utilized the nlexperiment r package to determine the best parameter set via the evolutionary algorithm ea thiele et al 2014 evolutionary algorithms use evolutionary strategies such as selection and mutation on the parameters to find which combination of parameters best meets the defined criteria we chose to use categorical calibration where the criterion is a range of plausible values rather than a single mean value to account for the heterogeneity in the distribution of ticks on hosts davidar et al 1989 the fitting criteria used was based on data from the literature on larvae and adult tick infestation for each wildlife host species e g mice deer halsey et al 2018 we assume that if larval and adult tick infestation intensity are within normal ranges nymph infestation will follow suit using a cost function approach the parameter estimates that best reproduce the observed tick infestation intensity will be chosen identified by having the lowest cost value cost values are calculated for each parameter estimate by comparing simulation results within the defined acceptable range using mean square error thiele et al 2014 to begin calibration the ea starts with 20 randomly chosen combinations of the 5 model parameters effectively creating 20 model populations we sampled the entire parameter range for four of the five parameters and a partial space for deer grooming 0 0 10 as deer grooming at the rate of 10 per hour resulted in more than 99 of ticks surviving grooming pressures for the 10 day feeding time needed for i scapularis a simulation run consists of running those 20 models populations with the output of mean larval infestation compared to the reference of 0 43 2 larva per mouse halsey et al 2018 using the two best populations elitism 2 where the model output met calibration criteria fell and incorporating a mutation rate of 16 67 the ea creates a subsequent generation of 20 new populations we ran the ea for 20 generations resulting in 400 total model combinations with 10 repetitions each the goal was to sample the entire parameter space with a high enough mutation frequency to prevent the ea from fixating in a state space but not so high that the model never converges on a single value successful parameterization includes reaching an equilibrium in the cost value where subsequent generations do not result in a better model fit fig a 1 and searching the entire parameter space for each parameter figs a 2 a 5 2 11 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of model outcomes i e host infestation rates density of questing ticks to variation in each parameter we utilized two methods global sensitivity and local sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2000 borgonovo et al 2003 ginot et al 2006 global sensitivity analyses assess input variables over the full range of their possible values whereas local analyses varies model parameters over a small percentage one at a time around a central default value beaudouin et al 2008 using the nlexperiment r package we used the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast a variance based global sensitivity analysis based on the fourier transformation sampling design to measure the strength of the contribution of uncertain inputs on larval infestation rates cukier et al 1973 this method returns a first order sensitivity index si or main effect where values closest to one indicate a larger influence of model output this method is the best choice for computationally expensive models because it is more efficient and requires fewer runs as compared to other global sensitivity methods e g sobol reusser et al 2011 to identify the likely consequences of management efforts that target specific stages in the life cycle we assessed how changes in parameter values for tick attachment grooming and molting rates influence questing tick density we used the one at a time oat method to perform local sensitivity analyses where we increase decrease each of the eight parameters by 10 to determine if any particular parameter was more influential in relation to the proportional change on the density of questing ticks at each life stage 3 results because we found that there is a threshold between the second and third year in the prevalence table 2 we discarded the data from the first two years of our models and focused only on the results from the last ten years of the model there was no significant difference in intensity of infestation on white tailed deer throughout the years due to no records of larval tick prevalence on white footed mice in the first two years of the invasion time line we are unable to identify whether there is a threshold for the prevalence of larva within the first two years of i scapularis reporting however the intensity of larval infestation varied significantly between the years 3 1 phenology the seib tim followed the seasonality for i scapularis in the northeastern united states fig 3 with each year the number of ticks feeding on wildlife hosts increased with phenological patterns of nymphs appearing before larvae remaining constant across years adult i scapularis that failed to find a host in the previous year emerge from dormancy and start to feed mid april with this cohort surviving to feed until early june nymphs start feeding on wildlife hosts in early may peaking in late may to early june and tapering off in early august larval i scapularis start to emerge in mid july with the majority feeding in early august and peaking mid to late august and the last larvae feeding mid october adult i scapularis begin feeding mid august peaking mid october and ending mid november 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 fourier amplitude sensitivity test we found that model output is most sensitive to uncertainty in nymph molting rates deer grooming and grooming survival for larvae and nymph infestation fig 4 a b however for adult infestation of deer the top ranking parameter influencing model output was deer grooming rates influences model output fig 4c 3 2 2 one at a time total number of questing ticks increased with time however reductions or increases in parameter values result in analogous changes in tick populations table 3 a 10 increase in mice grooming reduces larval ticks almost immediately by 20 or more however this decline is not noticeable ten years following establishment in contrast a 10 decrease in mice grooming corresponds to a 45 increase in questing larval ticks by year 10 this same pattern holds true for questing nymphs and adults changes in deer grooming has a more dramatic effect on questing tick populations a 10 reduction in deer grooming can increase the number of larval questing ticks in year 10 by almost 50 and questing nymphs by 40 in year 5 and 60 in year 10 the effect of increasing deer grooming is not as effective but still reduces larval and nymphal questing population by approximately 30 relative changes into grooming survival and larvae molting probably seem to have little effect on questing ticks increases in larval attachment rates have the potential to increase the number of questing adults in year one but this effect disappears by years five and ten changes in nymph attachment does not influence the questing population of either life stage however increasing adult attachment rates can result in a 42 increase in larval questing ticks by year 10 and steady increases in nymph questing from years 1 to 10 4 discussion 4 1 life stage specific management actions modeling vector borne diseases with a dual focus on both the vector and host populations can identify priorities for empirical research and may offer a mechanism for evaluating control policies sandberg et al 1992 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 this paper describes the first i scapularis ibm where both the tick vector and wildlife hosts are represented as individual agents by explicitly representing the interactions between the various tick life stages and wildlife hosts our model reveals the significance of host grooming tick molting and tick attachment rates to the maintenance of tick populations with regard to changes in model parameters that are specific to the ticks life cycle caraco et al 1998 global sensitivity analyses allowed us to detect both main and interaction effects of parameter variation in output we performed this analysis only on the parameters for which we were uncertain about the value and subsequently parameterized via calibration to do this we examined the full range of values to determine how robust our model is to parameter uncertainty and found that grooming survival nymph molting and deer grooming were the most influential parameters this suggests that the conclusions developed from our model output are dependent on the accuracy of these three values we recommend future research to assess adult tick survival with regard to deer grooming behaviors and nymph to adult molting rates we also performed local sensitivity analysis by varying parameter values using the one at a time oat method to isolate effects from each parameter corresponding to a ticks life stage in the case of this model our oat results identified four of the eight parameters in which changes in value resulted in a disproportionate change in model output because we restricted our local sensitivity analysis to a parameter range of 10 above or below the default value our results are limited to examining whether any specific parameter resulted in a disproportionate change in model results it is highly likely that larger changes in these parameters could result in greater differences in the numbers of questing ticks these parameters included mice grooming deer grooming nymph molting probability and adult attachment rates however for many of these parameters it takes approximately five to ten years for changes to manifest and they only impact specific tick life stages for example only in year ten did a reduction mice grooming rates by 10 result in a 30 decrease of questing nymphs as questing nymphs are recognized as the greatest threat to human disease risk mather et al 1996 management actions that take ten years to manifest may not seem like the best option however reducing the success of feeding juvenile ticks through management interventions such as targeted use of insecticides on wildlife hosts may prove fruitful ostfeld et al 2006 stafford et al 2017 especially if efforts result in more than a 10 decrease in ticks successfully feeding on mice in contrast previous modeling studies recommended targeting o virginianus which is known as the reproductive host for i scapularis and emphasized the importance of deer abundance in the maintenance of tick populations deblinger et al 1993 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 mount et al 1997 however experimental manipulations targeting deer have been ineffective at controlling i scapularis populations deblinger et al 1993 duffy et al 1994 wilson 1994 showcasing the weak role of deer in the maintenance of juvenile tick populations in our model reducing the number of adult ticks able to successfully feed on deer took 10 years to result in an approximate 36 reduction in larval questing ticks and 30 35 decline in questing nymph ticks we found one interesting case for which we are unable to explain where a decrease in the number of nymphs that successively molt into adults resulted in a 48 increase in the number of questing nymphs in the first year but this effect disappears in subsequent years this same decrease in molting probability also resulted in a 35 decline in the number of questing adult ticks it is important to note that in our model there was a general trend toward larger tick populations with each successive year meaning that while it may not seem like management actions targeting the ticks life cycle are effective at reducing absolute tick numbers comparing these changes to the default model parameters emphasizes their value in maintaining tick populations all models make simplifying assumptions and the assumptions we make in our model have several implications for the results because we restrict attachment of larvae and nymphs to only mice it is possible that we are underestimating tick abundance as larvae do also feed on deer bosler et al 1984 however because our study area is small having larvae feed on deer could inflate population size in addition because the presence of i scapularis is most strongly correlated with forest habitat we restrict the focus of our model to forest habitat although ticks can survive in the grassy meadows and the ecotone region between the two forest habitat has the highest rate of tick survival mount et al 1997 further we believe that the relationship between changes in the ticks life cycle and tick abundance will remain the same in other habitat types 4 2 model utility our motivation for building the seib tim was two fold first we sought to develop a model that has the potential to become a tool for epidemiologists enabling them to conduct simulation experiments that mimic the habitat and wildlife host community composition that is unique to their study site grimm 1999 to make this tool easily accessible we used an open source program with a user friendly interface rather than a proprietary program where interactions occur in a black box in addition to being user friendly we were able to design our model with the complexity needed to answer a broader range of questions than previous models this complexity resulted in extended run times where for our model to simulate 12 years it took an average of 8 9 h on a desktop though lengthy we found little variation in model output between runs indicating that we did not need hundreds of repetitions whereas previous models aggregated many of processes that influence vector populations either spatially or temporally e g mount et al 1997 ghosh and pugliese 2004 dobson and randolph 2011 our ibm approach incorporates both detailed temporal and spatial relationships which are known to be important to the maintenance of i scapularis ostfeld et al 1996 goodwin et al 2001 with few additions this model can easily incorporate multiple host species and disease transmission as well as utilize additional input about abiotic habitat conditions second we built this model to develop a better understanding of tick population dynamics and the mechanisms through which they are maintained to explore tick host associations in a way that allows us to identify the portion of the life cycle that influences population dynamics of i scapularis our model 1 represents each stage of the life cycle of individual ticks 2 represents interactions between the tick and its environment in response to temperature 3 represents interactions of the tick with the wildlife hosts upon which they obtain their blood meals and 4 outputs time series information on the numbers of questing and feeding ticks for each life stage by varying model parameters such as tick attachment rates and host grooming we can learn how the tick population responds to perturbations in the system every model builds upon previously developed models adding new information which makes the model capable of asking different questions we built our model with our specific objectives in mind to identify which aspects of the ticks lifecycle are important to the maintenance of tick populations by employing a bottom up approach although there are previous spatially explicit individual based models developed they are either primarily focused on a specific disease deelman et al 1996 or parameterized for different tick species wang et al 2012 in addition including a spatial aspect into models can allow for questions related to the role changes in climate and wildlife hosts play in tick range expansion madhav et al 2004 tran and waller 2015 though several models emphasize important aspects of ticks life cycle yet again the primary focus remains on reducing human disease risk van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 2002 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 suggest that effort might be better spent at reducing the prevalence of disease risk rather than reducing total tick numbers however their model was based solely on changes in host density emphasizing the role different wildlife species play in feeding specific tick life stages from this point of view attempting to manage disease risk through managing host populations can be both time and cost intensive however the results from our model show that you do not necessarily need to modify host densities to have an impact on tick populations management actions that reduce the number of ticks able to successfully feed on host can also be effective we chose to design the seib tim from the perspective of the tick by utilizing a spatial scale that mimics micro habitat conditions that affect influence tick development additions to this model could include additional environmental characteristics such as relative humidity and habitat type so that this model can be use to answer further questions such as those related to climate change ogden et al 2006 to provide a more realistic representation of host movements and provide sufficient host tick encounter rates we used a hourly timestep so as to allow the wildlife hosts in our model the ability to cover as much of their home range within a 24 h period however wang et al 2012 estimated that an ibm would need as many as 400 time steps per 24 h day to characterize wildlife host movements accurately for simplicity and to reduce computational time we chose to use hourly intervals to represent the interactions in our model regardless of the reduced number of time steps our model has accurately simulated the interactions betweeni scapularis wildlife hosts and the environment we first tested the model to ensure that the simulated ticks followed the life cycle of i scapularis which has a distinct seasonality our model is unique in this respect as previous models tend to ignore the seasonal patterns in tick abundance stanek et al 2012 tick phenology is critical to the maintenance of many tick borne pathogens randolph and storey 1999 including seasonality in our model via temperature driven tick development tick questing behavior follows the phenology of i scapularis in the northeast where nymphs appear in may larvae appear in late july and peak in mid august and adults appearing in early fall gatewood et al 2009 to modify this model for other regions would simply involve changing temperature inputs for the desired region as temperature regulates tick development incorporating the unique aspect of the ixodes life cycle in our model where nymphs appear before larvae is crucial to understanding the factors that contribute to the maintenance of tick borne diseases randolph and storey 1999 possible caveats should be kept in mind when attempting to use this model ecological questions modeling a heterogenous habitat would likely reduce the tick population further as any ticks that drop from their host in non forest habitat would have decrease probability of survival and thereby a heterogenous habitat has the potential to reduce overall tick abundance in addition not including territoriality in our model means that the home ranges of mice are allowed to overlap which may give ticks a greater chance of coming into contact with a wildlife host whereas if territories were in effect there would be a reduced probability of encountering a host to isolate the components of the ticks life cycle we chose to keep wildlife host densities constant although host populations fluctuate based on food resources and seasonality changes in host density can result in corresponding oscillations in tick populations with a one to two year lag ostfeld et al 2006 however the relationship between the number of ticks and host proceeds nonlinearly awerbuch and spielman 1994 where larvae tends to concentrate on fewer hosts when host density declines levi et al 2016 which may mean that at lower host densities management actions have a potentially larger impact although the research area of one hectare that we use for our modeling exercise may seem small we believe that the results of our model can extend to larger study areas because we use a bottom up approach to examine how the interactions between the tick and wildlife hosts influence the overall maintenance the relationship between tick grooming molting and attachments rates and the questing tick population should remain similar at larger spatial scales using sensitivity analysis allowed us to determine which parameters are crucial to model output and for future model iterations it may be possible to remove the negligible aspects of the model for example our model output is not very sensitive to changes in attachment rate and now that we have an approximation of these values for each tick life stage we can estimate the proportion of ticks that successfully find host using only the higher level relationships between ticks and hosts can result in fewer behind the scene computational operations speeding up the model and allowing us to increase both the temporal and spatial aspect of course increasing the study size will necessitate adding additional wildlife hosts to be representative of nature since extensive forest habitat serves a greater diversity of wildlife than small forest fragments rosenblatt et al 1999 although beyond the scope of our current study our future plans include manipulating the host community composition and density of wildlife hosts to test how biodiversity can regulate vectors and subsequently influence disease risk keesing et al 2006 5 summary we developed a spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model for the black legged tick i scapularis a vector of several diseases relevant to human populations in addition to providing information about how components of the tick life cycle influence tick population dynamics this model serves as the foundation for a more complex model that can answer the questions researchers are unable to address empirically we chose to use a simplified model with only mice and deer because these two species are thought to be the minimum requirements for maintaining both a tick population and the pathogens that cause tick borne disease ostfeld and keesing 2000 as the number of cases of tick borne diseases continues to rise there is a need for novel strategies and tools to reduce disease risk this seib tim puts us one step closer to designing effective prevention and control strategies for the organism that propagates disease transmission

25189,tick borne diseases are increasing worldwide and have a progressively negative impact on human health the black legged tick ixodes scapularis is the known vector of several emerging tick borne diseases to effectively manage diseases requires enhanced knowledge of the interactions of the tick its hosts and the environment modeling approaches may offer a way to evaluate vector control strategies since it is impossible to conduct large scale experiments in natural settings therefore we created the first spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim that is designed from the perspective of the tick to examine the processes through which i scapularis populations are maintained using a two host wildlife community consisting of white footed mice peromyscus leucopus and white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus we parameterized our model so that i scapularis infestation rates for p leucopus are within the range of those reported in field studies once our model seib tim accurately simulated the interactions between i scapularis wildlife hosts and the environment we evaluated its robustness to parameter uncertainty using both global and local sensitivity analyses lastly we related changes in model parameters to i scapularis life history traits to understand how those changes affected the maintenance of i scapularis populations we found that of the model parameters we examined increasing mouse grooming by 10 reduced the total questing nymph population by 30 in ten years in addition a 10 reduction in deer grooming is capable of reducing the questing larvae population by 36 and questing nymph population by 35 this result indicates that management interventions aimed at decreasing the number of larval ticks that can successfully feed on mice in addition to targeting the reproductive stage of the ticks lifecycle can potentially reduce tick populations we therefore conclude that effective management efforts should be aimed at multiple stages in the ticks life cycle and enacted for the long term the maintenance of tick populations can be better understood and controlling mechanisms identified when incorporating information on all components of the tick life cycle into the model this seib tim model serves as the foundation for a more complex model with additional host species as well as tick borne pathogens keywords black legged tick individual based model ixodes scapularis tick borne disease 1 introduction tick borne diseases are increasing worldwide and have had a progressively negative impact on human health over the past century gaff and gross 2007 jones et al 2008 the black legged tick ixodes scapularis is the known vector of several emerging tick borne diseases including human babesiosis human anaplasmosis powassan virus and lyme disease spielman et al 1985 schwartz et al 1997 piesman and eisen 2008 to effectively manage the risk of contracting such diseases requires a better knowledge of the interactions of the tick their environment and the wildlife host community upon which they feed the wildlife host community is essential to the lifecycle of i scapularis therefore previous management efforts have sought to reduce human disease risk through the culling of wildlife thought to maintain i scapularis populations namely white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus wilson et al 1985 reducing deer populations in the attempt to disrupt the reproduction stage of the ticks life cycle is ineffective because adult ticks can obtain a blood meal from other wildlife hosts and each female tick can lay thousands of eggs deblinger et al 1993 rand et al 2003 more recently small rodents such as white footed mice peromyscus leucopus are being targeted by researchers e g tickproject org targeting small rodents has the potential to control tick populations because hosts for the juvenile stage of ticks can be a limiting factor van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 kurtenbach et al 2006 by understanding the factors that control interactions between wildlife host populations and the tick vector through novel strategies we can identify priorities for managing disease risk sandberg et al 1992 piesman and eisen 2008 one such strategy involves modeling which may be particularly useful especially since it is nearly impossible to perform large scale experimental studies of different management scenarios in natural settings van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 1998 wood et al 2014 explicitly modeling the interactions between the vector and wildlife community and decomposing the relative contributions of parameter changes to model output can help us to understand the factors that allow tick populations to propagate caraco et al 2002 dobson and stuart 2016 however previous models for vector borne diseases have tended to focus only on pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts while ignoring the population dynamics of the vector caraco et al 2002 most models that investigate tick and host population dynamics are state variable models taking the form of differential equations e g ogden et al 2005 wu et al 2010 maliyoni et al 2017 negative binomial e g tran and waller 2015 matrix models e g mount et al 1997 dobson and stuart 2016 and cellular automata e g madhav et al 2004 yet these models are limited in their ability to identify key factors in the ticks life cycle that influence population dynamics due to simplifying assumptions that reduce the number of processes in the model these include reducing the number of stages representing the life cycle of the tick vector characterizing individual tick behavior as homogeneous and ignoring the seasonal patterns of tick abundance van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 deelman et al 1996 caraco et al 2002 alternatively one could avoid these shortcomings by employing a bottom up approach and individual based modeling ibm grimm 1999 an ibm approach allows one to assign rules regarding the abiotic and biotic interactions between the ticks wildlife hosts and the environment to observe how they relate to the emergence of population dynamics lindsay et al 1999 several attempts using ibms have been promising yet computational challenges necessitated a reduction in detail so that ticks were not represented as individuals and host movements were simplified which excludes fundamental processes involved in the tick life cycle such as attachment rates to hosts as well as host grooming wang et al 2012 2016 to expand on previously developed ibms we designed a spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim that varies temperature i e microclimate across the environment does not aggregate ticks uses hourly time steps and incorporates life stage specific attachment rates we built our model for end users who may not have a lot of coding and modeling experience but have a need for simulation experiments that can mimic the habitat and wildlife host community composition unique to their study site for both simplicity and ease of use we chose to utilize an open source software package netlogo which has a user friendly interface wilensky 1999 we describe our model following the widely accepted comprehensive standard method for documentation of ibms grimm et al 2010 the scope of our model was to examine the processes through which two primary hosts p leucopus and o virginianus maintain i scapularis populations within a homogeneous northeast us forest we evaluated the general performance of the model regarding tick phenology before parameterizing the model by ensuring that i scapularis infestation rates for p leucopus were within the range of those seen in the field next we inspected the sensitivity of model parameters to evaluate the robustness of our model to parameter uncertainty finally we examined changes in parameters as they relate to i scapularis life history traits to identify important aspects of the ticks life cycle that may influence the maintenance of i scapularis populations 2 modeling description the spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model seib tim halsey and miller 2018 operates at the scale of the tick i scapularis and its interactions with the temperature of the surrounding environment as well as the wildlife hosts through which it obtains blood meals fig 1 2 1 purpose the purpose of the seib tim is to understand the relationships between i scapularis its hosts and the environment we do this by simulating these relationships in a way that is spatially and temporally realistic to the patterns of tick burdens observed in field studies in doing so we identify how changes in attachment and molting rates of the three life stages of i scapularis as well as host grooming rates influence questing tick density 2 2 entities state variables and scale the entities of the seib tim are ixodes tick agents representing larval nymphal and adult i scapularis small mammals representing p leucopus large mammals representing o virginianus and patches representing forest habitat the state variables for all entities are defined in table a 1 the seib tim is composed of an one hectare homogeneous forest habitat arranged on a 100 100 square grid with individual patches measuring 1 m2 the scale at which ticks interact with their environment the time step of the seib tim is 1 h 2 3 processes and scheduling the seib tim is constructed to match the ecology of i scapularis we divided our model into sub models that correspond with different behaviors of the tick as well as wildlife host movements the following sub models are executed once per time step in the given order representing the logical order of the lifespan of the tick pull temp dormancy development reproduction questing and feeding see sub model sections for details the last sub model host movement see section 2 9 7 also occurs once per time step and acts independently of the other sub models the order in which individual agents and patches execute a process is always randomized with state variables updated immediately after each operation fig 2 2 4 i scapularis life cycle ixodes scapularis has a two year life cycle which depends on blood meals from wildlife hosts for nutrition to transition through each of its post embryonic stages larva nymph and adult fish 1993 in the spring adult female ticks lay up to 3000 eggs which hatch into larvae in mid summer and after successfully obtaining a blood meal molt into nymphs before overwintering and questing i e searching for hosts to feed on the following year platt et al 1992 after nymphs obtain their blood meal they molt into adults in the fall at which time they obtain another blood meal and mate restarting the cycle the following year 2 5 design concepts 2 5 1 emergence total numbers of ixodes questing and feeding on any given host at any given time emerge from the combined behaviors of the agents ticks and hosts in response to the environment e g temperature 2 5 2 sensing ixodes tick agents can sense when an appropriate host is within one meter square of their location larvae and nymphs only feed on small mammals i e mice whereas adult ticks only feed on large mammals i e deer tälleklint and jaenson 1994 dobson and randolph 2011 ticks are also able to sense temperature which influences tick development as indicated by ambient temperature branagan 1973 calculated by degree days eq 1 mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 1 degree day t c minimum t c maximum 2 6 c 2 5 3 interaction interactions in the seib tim are restricted to tick host and tick environment 2 5 4 stochasticity daily temperature is calculated using a mean and standard deviation of temperature for the day therefore stochasticity is inherent in the temperature dependent actions of the model such as tick questing behavior and molting 2 5 5 observation at each time step the following information will be stored for each tick life stage larvae nymphs adults total number of ticks host specific tick infestation of each life stage to determine the threshold for which we could consider the simulated i scapularis population as representative of an established population we analyzed data on i scapularis infestation prevalence i e proportion of hosts infested and intensity i e average number of ticks from data collected on tick infestation rates over the past forty years halsey et al 2018 we used a mann whitney u non parametric test of group differences to determine whether there were differences in the prevalence and intensity of infestation of i scapularis on white footed mice and white tailed deer in recently invaded and established counties we created five groupings e0 e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 where we categorized each data point as recently invaded or established based on the time since i scapularis was reported in the county for each grouping ex x is the cutoff for years since reported classified as recently invaded with the remaining later years classified as established 2 6 initial assumptions we made several assumptions in the seib tim based on our understanding of the important aspects of i scapularis life cycle larvae and nymphs are assumed only to attach to mice whereas adults only attach to deer dobson and randolph 2011 tälleklint and jaenson 1994 ticks are only able to molt if they feed to completion i e no partial feedings however we assume that 20 of ticks that are groomed off survive to resume questing and feed again cadenas et al 2007 in our model only temperature influences development times of i scapularis randolph and storey 1999 ogden et al 2005 leighton et al 2012 i scapularis is known to be sensitive to environmental conditions including temperature precipitation and humidity schauber et al 2005 killilea et al 2008 ogden et al 2006 ostfeld 2009 dhingra et al 2013 however the scope of our model is not to determine how weather variables influence tick populations rather we use temperature as a proxy to simulate tick development to understand how different aspects of the tick life cycle relate to population maintenance in our model we have a one hectare homogenous forest habitat and due to the small study area we do not assume edge effects horobik et al 2006 we chose to simulate a small study area due to only having a two host community this one hectare habitat size more accurately represents the host community composition whereas larger habitats necessitates the inclusion other species that can serve as wildlife hosts stafford and magnarelli 1993 allan et al 2003 brownstein et al 2005 in addition to isolate the aspects of the tick life cycle we chose to model only forest habitat which has both the highest rate of tick survival and is most likely to contribute to disease risk similar to wang et al 2012 we assume that wildlife hosts move within a set home range which is not dependent on the other hosts i e no territoriality or behavior avoidance wildlife hosts move once per time step and are not limited by the distance that they can move within their home range this results in wildlife host only being able to move 24 times a day a simplification and possible under representation of the movements within their activity range and potential contact with questing ticks wang et al 2012 all host populations are assumed to be at stable equilibria host density remains constant with no births deaths immigration or emigration happening within the habitat we do not incorporate sex differences among wildlife hosts regarding infestation rates but see ostfeld et al 1998 hamer et al 2012 we also assume that grooming efficacy i e the rate at which host remove ticks from their body is independent of sex and age of the host we chose not to explicitly include density dependent mortality in the form of a separate parameter instead using both grooming rate and attachment rate as a proxy mice are thought to be incapable of successfully grooming off attached ticks levin and fish 1998 and tick infestation level does not appear to affect the proportion of ticks that feed to completion hazler and ostfeld 1995 however we do constrain the maximum number of juvenile ticks per small mammal to 50 larvae or nymphs per host van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 1998 we initially sought to constrain the number of adult ticks to 100 dobson and randolph 2011 however in our model adult infestation never reached above 30 ticks per deer 2 7 initialization the seib tim initiates on january 1 a time when nymphs and adult ticks are dormant and overwintering platt et al 1992 initial model settings are 50 small mammals 2 deer and is based on density data per ha logiudice et al 2008 quality deer management association 2017 as well as 1500 overwintered nymphs 50 overwintered adults based on the mean number of feeding number of ticks per host usually found on each species halsey et al 2018 the justification for starting the model with two life stages larvae and nymphs is to simulate two cohorts of i scapularis as frequently observed in the wild fish 1993 hosts are randomly distributed throughout the environment 2 8 input data the inputs are the mean and standard deviation of daily temperature for the period 2010 2015 for connecticut us a key focal area of i scapularis as downloaded from the national climatic data center national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2015 2 9 sub models all model parameters are listed in table 1 2 9 1 pull temp this sub model operates only on patch entities for each square meter patch at hour 1 of each day the sub model will use the mean and standard deviation of the maximum and minimum temperature for the corresponding day to calculate the degree day eq 1 the degree day will be added to the patch state variable movingdd where the cmdd cumulative degree day holds the degree day for the last seven days this sub model also inserts the degree day into the patch state variable preovarr array an array that contains the average temperature for the last 17 days 2 9 2 dormanct the two year life cycle of i scapularis requires a period of dormancy over the winter fig 2b the procedure over winter changes the status to dormant for all ixodes agents once the mean cumulative degree day cmdd falls below 58 after the month of august mount et al 1997 the procedure awaken adults awaken nymphs and awaken larva changes the status of ixodes to questing once the mean cmdd increases to the threshold of 28 for adults 58 for nymphs and 110 for larvae 2 9 3 development this sub model operates on the ixodes tick agents which represent i scapularis fig 2c each ixodes agent is defined as either one of three life stages larva nymph or adult the first procedure of this sub model eggs to larvae creates ixodes with the larva life stage based on the number of eggs on a particular patch eggs are represented by a patch variable eggnum that keeps track of the number of eggs that were laid on that patch the second procedure harden cuticle represents the molting period from one life stage to the next one week for larva and nymphs and two weeks for adults mount et al 1997 the next procedure start questing asks the ixodes to change their status to questing the larva then enters the questing sub model see section 2 9 5 completion of a blood meal activates the procedure larvae to nymph to transition replete i e fed ixodes from the life stage larva into the life stage nymph based on the larva molting probability table 1 newly formed ixodes agents with the nymph status undergo a period of dormancy until the mean cmdd reaches the acceptable threshold for them to continue their life cycle in the following year incubate nymphs is a procedure representing the incubation period before replete nymphs transition to the adult life stage the next procedure nymph to adult uses the nymph molting probability to determine the likelihood that nymphs become adult ticks and in combination with procedure sex ratio assigns the sex of the ixodes based on a 50 50 probability any ixodes that are assigned to the male category dies all ixodes agents and the patch variable eggnum have a rate of mortality based on the number of weeks they have been in their current life stage and whether or not they are fed which is enacted by the procedure naturally die table 1 2 9 4 reproduction once female ixodes agents consume a blood meal and the mean cmdd reaches 28 the female begins a preoviposition period where their status becomes preoviposition indicating that there are getting ready to lay eggs fig 2e the number of eggs laid is dependent on the temperature for the past 17 days tracked by the patches in the pull temp sub model see section 2 9 1 once 17 days have passed since the adult female has started the preoviposition period the procedure female adult reproduce will be activated calculating the number of eggs the individual female will lay before dying table 1 2 9 5 questing the next procedure start questing asks the ixodes to change their status to questing from this point they can attach to any wildlife hosts that come within a one meter radius of their position 2 9 6 feed this sub model represents the process of i scapularis feeding on wildlife hosts fig 2d the feed ixodes procedure asks ixodes agents of any stage if their stage is questing and whether a wildlife host is within a meter radius of their position depending on if the tick is a juvenile or an adult the tick will attempt to attach to the host based on its corresponding attachment rate table 1 the next procedure detach ixodes removes the ixodes agent from a host once the agent has been attached to and feeding from a host for the specified amount of feeding time table 1 detachment involves updating the location of the ixodes agent to that of the attached wildlife host and setting the state variable replete to true the grooming procedure uses the grooming rates of wildlife host to remove feeding ixodes agents of the ixodes agents that are groomed off 80 die with the other 20 able to resume questing cadenas et al 2007 2 9 7 host movement this sub model represents the movements of the wildlife hosts mice and deer throughout the habitat using data on the minimum and maximum home ranges for mice and deer 0 05 0 07 ha and 216 345 ha respectively wolff 1985 dechen quinn et al 2013 with home ranges for each individual randomly chosen between those values each individual is allowed to randomly move once per time step within their home range if an agent reaches the edge of its home range it will face back towards the center of its home range 2 10 parameter estimation there are five unknown model parameters that have the potential to influence the number of ticks on hosts life stage specific tick attachment rate larvae nymph adult and nymph molting probability i e the success of nymph molting into adults and deer grooming i e the rate in which o virginianus removes feeding adult ticks to estimate model parameters we utilized the nlexperiment r package to determine the best parameter set via the evolutionary algorithm ea thiele et al 2014 evolutionary algorithms use evolutionary strategies such as selection and mutation on the parameters to find which combination of parameters best meets the defined criteria we chose to use categorical calibration where the criterion is a range of plausible values rather than a single mean value to account for the heterogeneity in the distribution of ticks on hosts davidar et al 1989 the fitting criteria used was based on data from the literature on larvae and adult tick infestation for each wildlife host species e g mice deer halsey et al 2018 we assume that if larval and adult tick infestation intensity are within normal ranges nymph infestation will follow suit using a cost function approach the parameter estimates that best reproduce the observed tick infestation intensity will be chosen identified by having the lowest cost value cost values are calculated for each parameter estimate by comparing simulation results within the defined acceptable range using mean square error thiele et al 2014 to begin calibration the ea starts with 20 randomly chosen combinations of the 5 model parameters effectively creating 20 model populations we sampled the entire parameter range for four of the five parameters and a partial space for deer grooming 0 0 10 as deer grooming at the rate of 10 per hour resulted in more than 99 of ticks surviving grooming pressures for the 10 day feeding time needed for i scapularis a simulation run consists of running those 20 models populations with the output of mean larval infestation compared to the reference of 0 43 2 larva per mouse halsey et al 2018 using the two best populations elitism 2 where the model output met calibration criteria fell and incorporating a mutation rate of 16 67 the ea creates a subsequent generation of 20 new populations we ran the ea for 20 generations resulting in 400 total model combinations with 10 repetitions each the goal was to sample the entire parameter space with a high enough mutation frequency to prevent the ea from fixating in a state space but not so high that the model never converges on a single value successful parameterization includes reaching an equilibrium in the cost value where subsequent generations do not result in a better model fit fig a 1 and searching the entire parameter space for each parameter figs a 2 a 5 2 11 sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of model outcomes i e host infestation rates density of questing ticks to variation in each parameter we utilized two methods global sensitivity and local sensitivity analyses saltelli et al 2000 borgonovo et al 2003 ginot et al 2006 global sensitivity analyses assess input variables over the full range of their possible values whereas local analyses varies model parameters over a small percentage one at a time around a central default value beaudouin et al 2008 using the nlexperiment r package we used the fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast a variance based global sensitivity analysis based on the fourier transformation sampling design to measure the strength of the contribution of uncertain inputs on larval infestation rates cukier et al 1973 this method returns a first order sensitivity index si or main effect where values closest to one indicate a larger influence of model output this method is the best choice for computationally expensive models because it is more efficient and requires fewer runs as compared to other global sensitivity methods e g sobol reusser et al 2011 to identify the likely consequences of management efforts that target specific stages in the life cycle we assessed how changes in parameter values for tick attachment grooming and molting rates influence questing tick density we used the one at a time oat method to perform local sensitivity analyses where we increase decrease each of the eight parameters by 10 to determine if any particular parameter was more influential in relation to the proportional change on the density of questing ticks at each life stage 3 results because we found that there is a threshold between the second and third year in the prevalence table 2 we discarded the data from the first two years of our models and focused only on the results from the last ten years of the model there was no significant difference in intensity of infestation on white tailed deer throughout the years due to no records of larval tick prevalence on white footed mice in the first two years of the invasion time line we are unable to identify whether there is a threshold for the prevalence of larva within the first two years of i scapularis reporting however the intensity of larval infestation varied significantly between the years 3 1 phenology the seib tim followed the seasonality for i scapularis in the northeastern united states fig 3 with each year the number of ticks feeding on wildlife hosts increased with phenological patterns of nymphs appearing before larvae remaining constant across years adult i scapularis that failed to find a host in the previous year emerge from dormancy and start to feed mid april with this cohort surviving to feed until early june nymphs start feeding on wildlife hosts in early may peaking in late may to early june and tapering off in early august larval i scapularis start to emerge in mid july with the majority feeding in early august and peaking mid to late august and the last larvae feeding mid october adult i scapularis begin feeding mid august peaking mid october and ending mid november 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 fourier amplitude sensitivity test we found that model output is most sensitive to uncertainty in nymph molting rates deer grooming and grooming survival for larvae and nymph infestation fig 4 a b however for adult infestation of deer the top ranking parameter influencing model output was deer grooming rates influences model output fig 4c 3 2 2 one at a time total number of questing ticks increased with time however reductions or increases in parameter values result in analogous changes in tick populations table 3 a 10 increase in mice grooming reduces larval ticks almost immediately by 20 or more however this decline is not noticeable ten years following establishment in contrast a 10 decrease in mice grooming corresponds to a 45 increase in questing larval ticks by year 10 this same pattern holds true for questing nymphs and adults changes in deer grooming has a more dramatic effect on questing tick populations a 10 reduction in deer grooming can increase the number of larval questing ticks in year 10 by almost 50 and questing nymphs by 40 in year 5 and 60 in year 10 the effect of increasing deer grooming is not as effective but still reduces larval and nymphal questing population by approximately 30 relative changes into grooming survival and larvae molting probably seem to have little effect on questing ticks increases in larval attachment rates have the potential to increase the number of questing adults in year one but this effect disappears by years five and ten changes in nymph attachment does not influence the questing population of either life stage however increasing adult attachment rates can result in a 42 increase in larval questing ticks by year 10 and steady increases in nymph questing from years 1 to 10 4 discussion 4 1 life stage specific management actions modeling vector borne diseases with a dual focus on both the vector and host populations can identify priorities for empirical research and may offer a mechanism for evaluating control policies sandberg et al 1992 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 this paper describes the first i scapularis ibm where both the tick vector and wildlife hosts are represented as individual agents by explicitly representing the interactions between the various tick life stages and wildlife hosts our model reveals the significance of host grooming tick molting and tick attachment rates to the maintenance of tick populations with regard to changes in model parameters that are specific to the ticks life cycle caraco et al 1998 global sensitivity analyses allowed us to detect both main and interaction effects of parameter variation in output we performed this analysis only on the parameters for which we were uncertain about the value and subsequently parameterized via calibration to do this we examined the full range of values to determine how robust our model is to parameter uncertainty and found that grooming survival nymph molting and deer grooming were the most influential parameters this suggests that the conclusions developed from our model output are dependent on the accuracy of these three values we recommend future research to assess adult tick survival with regard to deer grooming behaviors and nymph to adult molting rates we also performed local sensitivity analysis by varying parameter values using the one at a time oat method to isolate effects from each parameter corresponding to a ticks life stage in the case of this model our oat results identified four of the eight parameters in which changes in value resulted in a disproportionate change in model output because we restricted our local sensitivity analysis to a parameter range of 10 above or below the default value our results are limited to examining whether any specific parameter resulted in a disproportionate change in model results it is highly likely that larger changes in these parameters could result in greater differences in the numbers of questing ticks these parameters included mice grooming deer grooming nymph molting probability and adult attachment rates however for many of these parameters it takes approximately five to ten years for changes to manifest and they only impact specific tick life stages for example only in year ten did a reduction mice grooming rates by 10 result in a 30 decrease of questing nymphs as questing nymphs are recognized as the greatest threat to human disease risk mather et al 1996 management actions that take ten years to manifest may not seem like the best option however reducing the success of feeding juvenile ticks through management interventions such as targeted use of insecticides on wildlife hosts may prove fruitful ostfeld et al 2006 stafford et al 2017 especially if efforts result in more than a 10 decrease in ticks successfully feeding on mice in contrast previous modeling studies recommended targeting o virginianus which is known as the reproductive host for i scapularis and emphasized the importance of deer abundance in the maintenance of tick populations deblinger et al 1993 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 mount et al 1997 however experimental manipulations targeting deer have been ineffective at controlling i scapularis populations deblinger et al 1993 duffy et al 1994 wilson 1994 showcasing the weak role of deer in the maintenance of juvenile tick populations in our model reducing the number of adult ticks able to successfully feed on deer took 10 years to result in an approximate 36 reduction in larval questing ticks and 30 35 decline in questing nymph ticks we found one interesting case for which we are unable to explain where a decrease in the number of nymphs that successively molt into adults resulted in a 48 increase in the number of questing nymphs in the first year but this effect disappears in subsequent years this same decrease in molting probability also resulted in a 35 decline in the number of questing adult ticks it is important to note that in our model there was a general trend toward larger tick populations with each successive year meaning that while it may not seem like management actions targeting the ticks life cycle are effective at reducing absolute tick numbers comparing these changes to the default model parameters emphasizes their value in maintaining tick populations all models make simplifying assumptions and the assumptions we make in our model have several implications for the results because we restrict attachment of larvae and nymphs to only mice it is possible that we are underestimating tick abundance as larvae do also feed on deer bosler et al 1984 however because our study area is small having larvae feed on deer could inflate population size in addition because the presence of i scapularis is most strongly correlated with forest habitat we restrict the focus of our model to forest habitat although ticks can survive in the grassy meadows and the ecotone region between the two forest habitat has the highest rate of tick survival mount et al 1997 further we believe that the relationship between changes in the ticks life cycle and tick abundance will remain the same in other habitat types 4 2 model utility our motivation for building the seib tim was two fold first we sought to develop a model that has the potential to become a tool for epidemiologists enabling them to conduct simulation experiments that mimic the habitat and wildlife host community composition that is unique to their study site grimm 1999 to make this tool easily accessible we used an open source program with a user friendly interface rather than a proprietary program where interactions occur in a black box in addition to being user friendly we were able to design our model with the complexity needed to answer a broader range of questions than previous models this complexity resulted in extended run times where for our model to simulate 12 years it took an average of 8 9 h on a desktop though lengthy we found little variation in model output between runs indicating that we did not need hundreds of repetitions whereas previous models aggregated many of processes that influence vector populations either spatially or temporally e g mount et al 1997 ghosh and pugliese 2004 dobson and randolph 2011 our ibm approach incorporates both detailed temporal and spatial relationships which are known to be important to the maintenance of i scapularis ostfeld et al 1996 goodwin et al 2001 with few additions this model can easily incorporate multiple host species and disease transmission as well as utilize additional input about abiotic habitat conditions second we built this model to develop a better understanding of tick population dynamics and the mechanisms through which they are maintained to explore tick host associations in a way that allows us to identify the portion of the life cycle that influences population dynamics of i scapularis our model 1 represents each stage of the life cycle of individual ticks 2 represents interactions between the tick and its environment in response to temperature 3 represents interactions of the tick with the wildlife hosts upon which they obtain their blood meals and 4 outputs time series information on the numbers of questing and feeding ticks for each life stage by varying model parameters such as tick attachment rates and host grooming we can learn how the tick population responds to perturbations in the system every model builds upon previously developed models adding new information which makes the model capable of asking different questions we built our model with our specific objectives in mind to identify which aspects of the ticks lifecycle are important to the maintenance of tick populations by employing a bottom up approach although there are previous spatially explicit individual based models developed they are either primarily focused on a specific disease deelman et al 1996 or parameterized for different tick species wang et al 2012 in addition including a spatial aspect into models can allow for questions related to the role changes in climate and wildlife hosts play in tick range expansion madhav et al 2004 tran and waller 2015 though several models emphasize important aspects of ticks life cycle yet again the primary focus remains on reducing human disease risk van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 caraco et al 2002 van buskirk and ostfeld 1995 suggest that effort might be better spent at reducing the prevalence of disease risk rather than reducing total tick numbers however their model was based solely on changes in host density emphasizing the role different wildlife species play in feeding specific tick life stages from this point of view attempting to manage disease risk through managing host populations can be both time and cost intensive however the results from our model show that you do not necessarily need to modify host densities to have an impact on tick populations management actions that reduce the number of ticks able to successfully feed on host can also be effective we chose to design the seib tim from the perspective of the tick by utilizing a spatial scale that mimics micro habitat conditions that affect influence tick development additions to this model could include additional environmental characteristics such as relative humidity and habitat type so that this model can be use to answer further questions such as those related to climate change ogden et al 2006 to provide a more realistic representation of host movements and provide sufficient host tick encounter rates we used a hourly timestep so as to allow the wildlife hosts in our model the ability to cover as much of their home range within a 24 h period however wang et al 2012 estimated that an ibm would need as many as 400 time steps per 24 h day to characterize wildlife host movements accurately for simplicity and to reduce computational time we chose to use hourly intervals to represent the interactions in our model regardless of the reduced number of time steps our model has accurately simulated the interactions betweeni scapularis wildlife hosts and the environment we first tested the model to ensure that the simulated ticks followed the life cycle of i scapularis which has a distinct seasonality our model is unique in this respect as previous models tend to ignore the seasonal patterns in tick abundance stanek et al 2012 tick phenology is critical to the maintenance of many tick borne pathogens randolph and storey 1999 including seasonality in our model via temperature driven tick development tick questing behavior follows the phenology of i scapularis in the northeast where nymphs appear in may larvae appear in late july and peak in mid august and adults appearing in early fall gatewood et al 2009 to modify this model for other regions would simply involve changing temperature inputs for the desired region as temperature regulates tick development incorporating the unique aspect of the ixodes life cycle in our model where nymphs appear before larvae is crucial to understanding the factors that contribute to the maintenance of tick borne diseases randolph and storey 1999 possible caveats should be kept in mind when attempting to use this model ecological questions modeling a heterogenous habitat would likely reduce the tick population further as any ticks that drop from their host in non forest habitat would have decrease probability of survival and thereby a heterogenous habitat has the potential to reduce overall tick abundance in addition not including territoriality in our model means that the home ranges of mice are allowed to overlap which may give ticks a greater chance of coming into contact with a wildlife host whereas if territories were in effect there would be a reduced probability of encountering a host to isolate the components of the ticks life cycle we chose to keep wildlife host densities constant although host populations fluctuate based on food resources and seasonality changes in host density can result in corresponding oscillations in tick populations with a one to two year lag ostfeld et al 2006 however the relationship between the number of ticks and host proceeds nonlinearly awerbuch and spielman 1994 where larvae tends to concentrate on fewer hosts when host density declines levi et al 2016 which may mean that at lower host densities management actions have a potentially larger impact although the research area of one hectare that we use for our modeling exercise may seem small we believe that the results of our model can extend to larger study areas because we use a bottom up approach to examine how the interactions between the tick and wildlife hosts influence the overall maintenance the relationship between tick grooming molting and attachments rates and the questing tick population should remain similar at larger spatial scales using sensitivity analysis allowed us to determine which parameters are crucial to model output and for future model iterations it may be possible to remove the negligible aspects of the model for example our model output is not very sensitive to changes in attachment rate and now that we have an approximation of these values for each tick life stage we can estimate the proportion of ticks that successfully find host using only the higher level relationships between ticks and hosts can result in fewer behind the scene computational operations speeding up the model and allowing us to increase both the temporal and spatial aspect of course increasing the study size will necessitate adding additional wildlife hosts to be representative of nature since extensive forest habitat serves a greater diversity of wildlife than small forest fragments rosenblatt et al 1999 although beyond the scope of our current study our future plans include manipulating the host community composition and density of wildlife hosts to test how biodiversity can regulate vectors and subsequently influence disease risk keesing et al 2006 5 summary we developed a spatially explicit individual based tick interaction model for the black legged tick i scapularis a vector of several diseases relevant to human populations in addition to providing information about how components of the tick life cycle influence tick population dynamics this model serves as the foundation for a more complex model that can answer the questions researchers are unable to address empirically we chose to use a simplified model with only mice and deer because these two species are thought to be the minimum requirements for maintaining both a tick population and the pathogens that cause tick borne disease ostfeld and keesing 2000 as the number of cases of tick borne diseases continues to rise there is a need for novel strategies and tools to reduce disease risk this seib tim puts us one step closer to designing effective prevention and control strategies for the organism that propagates disease transmission
