dbps in rainwater in this study samples were collected from ten occurrences of rainfall in shanghai and batch experiments were executed to explore the contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater and to further understand some of unknowns regarding its characteristics results revealed that a part of pm was scavenged by rainfall and the scavenge performance was better for

among all detectable cx3r type dbps based on the pm removal data and dbp fp results the contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater was modeled furthermore aromatic proteins

exhibited higher cx3r type dbp fps dom fractions with higher suva254 and suva285 values gave relatively higher yields of cx3r type dbps indicating that aromatic compounds played an important role in

derived organic matter on the quality of drinking water remains limited particles in the atmosphere can serve as cloud condensation nuclei and be scavenged by rainfall lei and wania 2004 rainfall as an important wet deposition mechanism plays a vital role in the removal of these particles from the atmosphere organic carbon has been acknowledged as a primary element in the pm followed by organic nitrogen such as amine and amino acids cape et al 2011 song et al 2017 many of which are water soluble the water soluble fractions can contribute dissolved organic matter dom to rainwater and may enter into potable water sources through rainwater harvesting it is worth noting that pm derived dom scavenged by rainwater may not be effectively removed through conventional treatment processes in drinking water treatment plants similar to dom originally present in water sources chu et al 2011a therefore there is ample opportunity for contact between atmospheric dom and disinfectants during disinfection a key question is whether undesirable disinfection by products dbps can be formed as a result of the presence of pm derived dom during the drinking water disinfection process using chlorine to prevent people from being infected by pathogenic microorganism lechevallier et al 1988 bois et al 1997 and the contribution of total pm derived dom scavenged by rainfall to cx3r type dbp

rapidly mixed 150 rmp through a magnetic stirrer to ensure a complete mixing state mixing proceeded for 24 h to guarantee sufficient dissolution of pm derived dom size isolated pm derived dom

absorbance at 254 nm and 285 nm by solution doc respectively particularly suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 three dimensional spectrofluorometry f 7100 fluorescence hitachi japan was used to monitor fluorescent dom fluorescence scans λex 200 450 nm λem 220 550 nm was performed with 5 nm slits for excitation and emission fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra used to characterize dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater was divided into five regions i tyrosine like ii tryptophan like iii fulvic

solution doc was diluted to 1 mg l prior to analysis dom derived from total pm and rainwater was fractionated into five different mw groups 1 kda 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda using a 400 ml stirred cell millipore us with millipore ultrafiltration membranes amicon billerica ma with mw cut offs of 1 kda 5 kda 10 kda and 100 kda respectively the mw fractionation procedure was reported in a previous study hua and reckhow 2007 dbp fp tests were carried out for each mw group 2 3 analytical methods doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were measured separately using a toc analyzer shimadzu

shimadzu corporation japan thms hals hans and hnms were measured based on usepa method 551 1 haas were analyzed according to usepa method 552 2 hams were measured based on the analytical method reported by a previous study chu et al 2010 other detailed information on the analytical methods of these dbps is summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 pm removal by rainfall and doc derived from size isolated pm pm removal rate by rainfall and doc derived from per mass of pm are presented in fig 2 a and b respectively the removal rate of pm was calculated as eq 2 2 pm removal rate c 0 c 1 μ g m 3 c 0 μ g m 3 100 where c0 and c1 are the pm concentrations measured pre and post rainfall respectively concentrations of all size isolated pm including pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were evidently decreased post rainfall fig 2 a and table s1 implying that a portion of pm was scavenged by rainwater the washout effect of rainfall on atmospheric pm was also reported previously guo et al 2014 on the average the removal rate of pm2 5 was 52 4 slightly greater than that of pm with larger size little difference was observed between the removal rates of pm10 and total pm 37 0 11 6 for pm10 and 32 5 15 8 for total pm doc derived from per mass of size isolated pm refers to as b mg c mg pm was calculated as eq 3 3 b mg c mg pm doc mg c l 1 l m pm mg as shown in fig 2 b and table 1 pm derived organic compounds were capable to contribute dom to water the minimum 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th percentiles and maximum b value doc derived from per mass of pm of pm2 5 were higher than the corresponding values of larger pm this finding is in agreement with an existing literature which also reported that the percentage of water soluble particulate organic matter in smaller pm was relatively higher than that in larger size timonen et al 2008 moreover the values of b for pm10 and total pm were not significantly different 0 40 0 18 mg c mg pm for pm10 and 0 37 0 17 mg c mg pm for total pm respectively 3 2 characteristics of dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater fluorescence eem spectra together with fi hix and the ratio of β α was performed to investigate the characteristics of dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater results are shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively dom derived from size isolated pm fig 3 a c and rainwater fig 3 d showed the most intense peak at ex em of 230 330 nm in the regions of aromatic proteins λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and the second highest peak was observed at ex em of 280 330 nm in smp like region λex 250 nm λem 380 nm fi as an index corresponding to the source of dom was 1 8 or even higher indicating that dom in these solutions was microbial rather than terrestrial for which fi value is about 1 4 based on a previous study mcknight et al 2001 additionally hix for all solutions was lower than 0 5 while much higher hix values 10 30 were observed in surface water in a previous study birdwell and engel 2010 the ratio of β α a parameter to evaluate the contribution of smp like compounds was higher than 0 6 in all dom solutions table 1 a threshold value reported in literature huguet et al 2009 indicating that the containment of biological materials was in significant quantities compared to rainwater lake water and river water showed much lower fi and β α values and higher hix values fuentes et al 2006 birdwell and engel 2010 indicating that humic acid like compounds were their main compositions 3 3 cx3r type dbp formation from dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater fig 4 a f and g h display the results of cx3r type dbp formation from size isolated pm and rainwater respectively expressed as specific cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc particularly r μg c mg c refers to as the value for pm which was calculated as eq 4 4 r μg c mg c dbp fp μg c l doc mg c l as shown in fig 4 tcm tcaa ch dcan tcnm and dcam were detectable in all water samples dcaa and tcam fps are not shown because of the low yields ranging from nd not detected to 10 0 μg l 1 9 μg c mg c and to 0 3 μg l 0 04 μg c mg c respectively moreover other chlorinated and brominated cx3r type dbps were not detectable during chlorination for individual cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc in solutions derived from pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were not evidently different fig 4 a f under identical condition higher c dbp fps i e tcm and tcaa than those of n dbps dcan tcnm and dcam were observed in both dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater among all cx3r type dbps tcm fp was the highest indicating that tcm was the main cx3r type dbp during rainwater disinfection and tcm precursors were also abundant in pm derived dom solutions n dbp formation was relevant to don level bond et al 2012 so n dbp fps normalized to don was also analyzed fig s1 which was calculated by dividing the formation of n dbps by solution don the corresponding values for size isolated pm were also similar as stated in section 3 2 dom derived from pm and rainwater comprised aromatic proteins and smp like compounds which have been reported to be dbp precursors in previous studies chu et al 2010 2011b shah and mitch 2012 therefore they could also be important dbp precursors in dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater apart from cx3r type dbps the formation of unidentified dbps was also evaluated aox serving as an alternative dbp measurement characterizes the incorporation of halogen into organic matter unidentified dbp formation uaox is the difference between aox and cx3r type dbp formation fractions of uaox in the aox formation and individual dbp fp in the total cx3r type dbp fps are shown in fig 5 evidently the identified cx3r type dbp formation of dom derived from pm and rainwater accounted for 53 3 71 3 of aox indicating that they were the major dbps among cx3r type dbps tcm 51 6 73 3 was predominant and tcaa 10 0 27 2 was secondary as for drinking water the percentage of identified cx3r type dbps could be lower than half but tcm and tcaa were also the dominant dbps richardson 2003 krasner et al 2006 the fractions of total n dbp fps dcan tcnm dcam were low in all solutions ranged from 8 0 to 14 7 3 4 molecular weight distribution of dom derived from total pm and rainwater dom derived from total pm and rainwater was fractioned into five mw groups 1 kda 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda table s3 presents the relative doc percentage of each mw group for dom derived from total pm and rainwater 1 kda fraction contributed to 46 0 and 34 0 doc respectively relatively higher than the percentages of other fractions generally dom with mw 10 kda was considered to be the low mw organic matter due to their lower removal rate by enhanced coagulation liu et al 2012 low mw dom accounted for 68 6 and 60 1 doc in dom solutions derived from total pm and rainwater respectively dom with low mw was also the dominant fraction in surface water reported previously kitis et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 with poor removal rate low mw dom derived from pm and rainwater was capable to react with chlorine to form dbps cx3r type dbp formation and suva254 and suva285 values of low and high mw dom derived from total pm and rainwater are shown in fig 6 detailed information about cx3r type dbp formation from different mw dom fractions is shown in fig s2 as shown in fig 6 a b cx3r type dbps formed from low mw pm derived dom was much higher than that from high mw dom for rainwater low mw dom exhibited higher formation reactivity for most cx3r type dbps but high mw dom was also significant especially for dcan and tcnm as shown in fig s2 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda dom fractions derived from total pm exhibited higher cx3r type dbp fps and dbp formation reactivity of high mw dom was relatively lower in contrast rainwater dom with high mw i e 100 kda exhibited relative higher formation reactivity for some cx3r type dbps i e tcm tcaa dcan tcnm as shown in fig 6 c d suva254 and suva285 were analyzed to indicate the relative content of aromatic compounds in low and high mw dom fractions particularly suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 for total pm derived dom both suva254 and suva285 values for low mw dom were higher than those of high mw fraction indicating that aromatic dom such as aromatic proteins benzene carboxylic acids and phenols major distributed in low mw fraction however as for rainwater dom suva254 value for high mw dom was higher and suva285 values were basically the same different distribution of aromatic compounds may result in different reactivity of low and high mw dom in cx3r type dbp formation for these compounds were reported to be dbp precursors shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2015 2016 detailed information on specific uv absorbance of different mw dom fractions is shown in fig s3 the results also indicated the significant role of aromatic compounds played in cx3r type dbp formation as shown in fig s3 with higher suva254 and suva285 values 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda dom fractions derived from total pm and 100 kda rainwater dom gave the relatively higher yields of most cx3r type dbps however 1 kda dom fraction with the lowest suva254 and suva285 values exhibited lower reactivity for the formation of almost all cx3r type dbps but ch 3 5 contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater the contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater a was calculated by dividing dbp formation from pm derived dom scavenged by rainfall with which formed in rainwater as eq 5 5 a c 0 c 1 1000 h s b total pm v rain r total pm c rain v rain 100 where c0 and c1 are the concentrations of total pm μg m3 measured pre and post rainfall respectively which were calculated by eq 1 h is the height of mixing layer m s as the area of rainwater sampler m2 is 0 09 m2 btotal pm is the doc derived from total pm dissolved in 1 l water mg c mg pm rtotal pm is the specific cx3r type dbp fp normalized to doc μg c mg c crain is the concentration of specific cx3r type dbp measured in rainwater sample μg c l and vrain is the volume of collected rainwater l the major volume of particle dispersion is determined by the height of mixing layer adjacent to the ground and influenced primarily by pollutants emission wang and wang 2014 pm suspended in the mixing layer above the rainwater samplers could be incorporated into the collected rainwater during rainfall convection and mechanical turbulence are capable to make the pollutants dispersed uniformly over sufficient time in this layer seibert et al 2000 so assuming that total pm in mixing layer is evenly distributed due to little atmospheric information on vertical resolution of particles under diverse weather conditions a previous survey of shanghai reported that the height of atmospheric mixing layer h ranged from 200 m to 1000 m huang et al 2012 so assuming that h value in the calculation ranges from 200 to 1000 the top and bottom values of each column were calculated when h values were 200 and 1000 respectively the modeled contribution of pm to rainwater cx3r type dbp formation during chlorination is shown in fig 7 results indicated that pm derived dom might fairly contribute to the formation of several cx3r type dbps during rainwater chlorination although the estimated contributions of pm derived dom to tcm and ch formation in rainwater were minor to sum up almost 80 or even more dbp formation from rainwater originated from non pm derived dom but the contribution less than 20 of atmospheric pm to dbp formation could not be neglected in the atmosphere although volatile and semivolatile organic compounds sources of non pm derived dom can reduce volatility and partition into particle phase through complex reactions kroll and seinfeld 2008 many of them remain in non pm phase donahue et al 2006 non pm derived dom may also dissolve in rainwater and convert to dbp precursors during disinfection above mixing layer boundary pm may also present ferrero et al 2010 but it was not involved in this calculation therefore the contribution of pm to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater was underestimated to some degree actually the contribution of dom derived from pm2 5 and pm10 to dbp formation in rainwater can also be calculated as eq 5 the result indicated that pm2 5 contributed to the most dbp formation according to the report of global air in 2015 north africa and the middle east have witnessed the highest concentrations of population weighted average pm2 5 institute for health metrics and evaluation and health effects institute 2017 moreover china is the one of the countries experiencing high level and increasing trend in pm2 5 air quality comprehensive index and average pm concentration of shanghai ranked in the middle compared to other cities according to the reports on the state of the environment in china published by ministry of environmental protection http www english mep gov cn resource reports soe in chengdu beijing and xi an the concentrations of pm are usually higher than those in shanghai reported in previous studies tao et al 2013 elser et al 2016 sun et al 2016 in these heavy pm polluted areas more pm derived organic matter can convert into rainwater dom through rainfall resulting in the increasing contribution of pm to the formation of cx3r type dbps in rainwater 4 conclusion rainwater could scavenge atmospheric pm and pm was capable to contribute dom to rainwater smaller pm pm2 5 contained more doc than larger one individual cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc in dom solutions derived from pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were quite similar among cx3r type dbps tcm around 0 5 4 5 μg c mg c 51 6 73 3 was predominant and tcaa around 0 6 3 2 μg c mg c 10 0 27 2 was secondary cx3r type dbps in dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater accounted for over half of aox the contribution of pm derived dom to some cx3r type dbp formation during chlorination of rainwater could not be neglected i e 4 3 21 3 for tcaa 3 2 15 9 for dcan 3 8 19 0 for tcnm and 3 8 18 9 for dcam pm2 5 contributed to the most dbp formation in rainwater low mw dom derived from total pm and rainwater exhibited higher formation reactivity of cx3r type dbps than that of high mw dom dom fractions with higher suva254 and suva285 values gave relatively higher yields of almost all cx3r type dbps indicating that aromatic compounds i e aromatic proteins benzene carboxylic acids and phenols are deduced

formation in rainwater is necessary to be estimated it has been demonstrated that genomic dna and cellular damages are associated with a long term ingestion of water rich in dbps boorman 1999 richardson et al 2007 trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloaldehydes hals are the carbonaceous dbps c dbps frequently identified in finished water krasner et al 2006 koudjonou et al 2008 goslan et al 2009 strict regulatory guidelines about these dbps have been established by the us environmental protection agency usepa 2006 world health organization who 2006 and european union cortvriend 2008 among all the dbps nitrogenous dbps n dbps including haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams have increasingly attracted attention because they exhibit several orders of magnitude higher cyto and genotoxicity than the regulated dbps even at much lower concentrations during disinfection plewa et al 2004 mark et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 although new dbps with higher toxicities have been identified recently such as iodinated species jones et al 2011 the particular concerns remain on the aforementioned six classes of dbps thms haas hals hans hnms

rapidly mixed 150 rmp through a magnetic stirrer to ensure a complete mixing state mixing proceeded for 24 h to guarantee sufficient dissolution of pm derived dom size isolated pm derived dom

equivalent cl concentration μg l cl 2 2 3 spectroscopic characteristics and molecular weight distribution of dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and 285 nm suva285 were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv9000s metash instrument shanghai suva254 and suva285 were commonly measured for aromaticity which were calculated by dividing the uv absorbance at 254 nm and 285 nm by solution doc respectively particularly suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 three dimensional spectrofluorometry f 7100 fluorescence hitachi japan was used to monitor fluorescent dom fluorescence scans λex 200 450 nm λem 220 550 nm was performed with 5 nm slits for excitation and emission fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra used to characterize dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater was divided into five regions i tyrosine like ii tryptophan like iii fulvic acid like iv soluble microbial product like smp like v humic acid like chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 fluorescence index fi is an index to differentiate microbial and terrestrial origins calculated as the ratio of fluorescence intensities at emission 470 nm and 520 nm at excitation 370 nm cory and mcknight 2005 as an indicator of humic substances humification index hix was calculated by the area

microbial derived dom to water samples was calculated by dividing emission at 380 nm by the maximum emission between 420 nm and 435 nm at 310 nm excitation wavelength wilson and xenopoulos 2008 solution doc was diluted to 1 mg l prior to analysis dom derived from total pm and rainwater was fractionated into five different mw groups 1 kda 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda using a 400 ml stirred cell millipore us with millipore ultrafiltration membranes amicon billerica ma with mw cut offs of 1 kda 5 kda 10 kda and 100 kda respectively the mw fractionation procedure was reported in a previous study hua and reckhow 2007 dbp fp tests were carried out for each mw group 2 3 analytical methods doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were measured separately using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the detection limits of doc and tdn are 0 1 mg l concentrations of different dissolved inorganic nitrogen din species i e nh4 no2 and no3 were measured using their respective hach test

trichloroacetaldehyde ch bromochloroacetaldehyde bromodichloroacetaldehyde dibromochloroacetaldehyde and tribromoacetaldhyde were measured with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gcms qp2020 shimadzu corporation japan thms hals hans and hnms were measured based on usepa method 551 1 haas were analyzed according to usepa method 552 2 hams were measured based on the analytical method reported by a previous study chu et al 2010 other detailed information on the analytical methods of these dbps is summarized in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 pm removal by rainfall and doc derived from size isolated pm pm removal rate by rainfall and doc derived from per mass of pm are presented in fig 2 a and b respectively the removal rate of pm was calculated as eq 2 2 pm removal rate c 0 c 1 μ g m 3 c 0 μ g m 3 100 where c0 and c1 are the pm concentrations measured pre and post rainfall respectively concentrations of all size isolated pm including pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were evidently decreased post rainfall fig 2 a and table s1 implying that a portion of pm was scavenged by rainwater the washout effect of rainfall on atmospheric pm was also reported previously guo et al 2014 on the average the removal rate of pm2 5 was 52 4 slightly greater than that of pm with larger size little difference was observed between the removal rates of pm10 and total pm 37 0 11 6 for pm10 and 32 5 15 8 for total pm doc derived from per mass of size isolated pm refers to as b mg c mg pm was calculated as eq 3 3 b mg c mg pm doc mg c l 1 l m pm mg as shown in fig 2 b and table 1 pm derived organic compounds were capable to contribute dom to water the minimum 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th percentiles and maximum b value doc derived from per mass of pm of pm2 5 were higher than the corresponding values of larger pm this finding is in agreement with an existing literature which also reported that the percentage of water soluble particulate organic matter in smaller pm was relatively higher than that in larger size timonen et al 2008 moreover the values of b for pm10 and total pm were not significantly different 0 40 0 18 mg c mg pm for pm10 and 0 37 0 17 mg c mg pm for total pm respectively 3 2 characteristics of dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater fluorescence eem spectra together with fi hix and the ratio of β α was performed to investigate the characteristics of dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater results are shown in fig 3 and table 1 respectively dom derived from size isolated pm fig 3 a c and rainwater fig 3 d showed the most intense peak at ex em of 230 330 nm in the regions of aromatic proteins λex 250 nm λem 380 nm and the second highest peak was observed at ex em of 280 330 nm in smp like region λex 250 nm λem 380 nm fi as an index corresponding to the source of dom was 1 8 or even higher indicating that dom in these solutions was microbial rather than terrestrial for which fi value is about 1 4 based on a previous study mcknight et al 2001 additionally hix for all solutions was lower than 0 5 while much higher hix values 10 30 were observed in surface water in a previous study birdwell and engel 2010 the ratio of β α a parameter to evaluate the contribution of smp like compounds was higher than 0 6 in all dom solutions table 1 a threshold value reported in literature huguet et al 2009 indicating that the containment of biological materials was in significant quantities compared to rainwater lake water and river water showed much lower fi and β α values and higher hix values fuentes et al 2006 birdwell and engel 2010 indicating that humic acid like compounds were their main compositions 3 3 cx3r type dbp formation from dom derived from size isolated pm and rainwater fig 4 a f and g h display the results of cx3r type dbp formation from size isolated pm and rainwater respectively expressed as specific cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc particularly r μg c mg c refers to as the value for pm which was calculated as eq 4 4 r μg c mg c dbp fp μg c l doc mg c l as shown in fig 4 tcm tcaa ch dcan tcnm and dcam were detectable in all water samples dcaa and tcam fps are not shown because of the low yields ranging from nd not detected to 10 0 μg l 1 9 μg c mg c and to 0 3 μg l 0 04 μg c mg c respectively moreover other chlorinated and brominated cx3r type dbps were not detectable during chlorination for individual cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc in solutions derived from pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were not evidently different fig 4 a f under identical condition higher c dbp fps i e tcm and tcaa than those of n dbps dcan tcnm and dcam were observed in both dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater among all cx3r type dbps tcm fp was the highest indicating that tcm was the main cx3r type dbp during rainwater disinfection and tcm precursors were also abundant in pm derived dom solutions n dbp formation was relevant to don level bond et al 2012 so n dbp fps normalized to don was also analyzed fig s1 which was calculated by dividing the formation of n dbps by solution don the corresponding values for size isolated pm were also similar as stated in section 3 2 dom derived from pm and rainwater comprised aromatic proteins and smp like compounds which have been reported to be dbp precursors in previous studies chu et al 2010 2011b shah and mitch 2012 therefore they could also be important dbp precursors in dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater apart from cx3r type dbps the formation of unidentified dbps was also evaluated aox serving as an alternative dbp measurement characterizes the incorporation of halogen into organic matter unidentified dbp formation uaox is the difference between aox and cx3r type dbp formation fractions of uaox in the aox formation and individual dbp fp in the total cx3r type dbp fps are shown in fig 5 evidently the identified cx3r type dbp formation of dom derived from pm and rainwater accounted for 53 3 71 3 of aox indicating that they were the major dbps among cx3r type dbps tcm 51 6 73 3 was predominant and tcaa 10 0 27 2 was secondary as for drinking water the percentage of identified cx3r type dbps could be lower than half but tcm and tcaa were also the dominant dbps richardson 2003 krasner et al 2006 the fractions of total n dbp fps dcan tcnm dcam were low in all solutions ranged from 8 0 to 14 7 3 4 molecular weight distribution of dom derived from total pm and rainwater dom derived from total pm and rainwater was fractioned into five mw groups 1 kda 1 5 kda 5 10 kda 10 100 kda and 100 kda table s3 presents the relative doc percentage of each mw group for dom derived from total pm and rainwater 1 kda fraction contributed to 46 0 and 34 0 doc respectively relatively higher than the percentages of other fractions generally dom with mw 10 kda was considered to be the low mw organic matter due to their lower removal rate by enhanced coagulation liu et al 2012 low mw dom accounted for 68 6 and 60 1 doc in dom solutions derived from total pm and rainwater respectively dom with low mw was also the dominant fraction in surface water reported previously kitis et al 2002 hua and reckhow 2007 with poor removal rate low mw dom derived from pm and rainwater was capable to react with chlorine to form dbps cx3r type dbp formation and suva254 and suva285 values of low and high mw dom derived from total pm and rainwater are shown in fig 6 detailed information about cx3r type dbp formation from different mw dom fractions is shown in fig s2 as shown in fig 6 a b cx3r type dbps formed from low mw pm derived dom was much higher than that from high mw dom for rainwater low mw dom exhibited higher formation reactivity for most cx3r type dbps but high mw dom was also significant especially for dcan and tcnm as shown in fig s2 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda dom fractions derived from total pm exhibited higher cx3r type dbp fps and dbp formation reactivity of high mw dom was relatively lower in contrast rainwater dom with high mw i e 100 kda exhibited relative higher formation reactivity for some cx3r type dbps i e tcm tcaa dcan tcnm as shown in fig 6 c d suva254 and suva285 were analyzed to indicate the relative content of aromatic compounds in low and high mw dom fractions particularly suva285 serves as an indicator of benzene carboxylic acids and phenols buffle et al 1982 krasner et al 1996 for total pm derived dom both suva254 and suva285 values for low mw dom were higher than those of high mw fraction indicating that aromatic dom such as aromatic proteins benzene carboxylic acids and phenols major distributed in low mw fraction however as for rainwater dom suva254 value for high mw dom was higher and suva285 values were basically the same different distribution of aromatic compounds may result in different reactivity of low and high mw dom in cx3r type dbp formation for these compounds were reported to be dbp precursors shah and mitch 2012 chu et al 2015 2016 detailed information on specific uv absorbance of different mw dom fractions is shown in fig s3 the results also indicated the significant role of aromatic compounds played in cx3r type dbp formation as shown in fig s3 with higher suva254 and suva285 values 1 5 kda and 5 10 kda dom fractions derived from total pm and 100 kda rainwater dom gave the relatively higher yields of most cx3r type dbps however 1 kda dom fraction with the lowest suva254 and suva285 values exhibited lower reactivity for the formation of almost all cx3r type dbps but ch 3 5 contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater the contribution of pm derived dom to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater a was calculated by dividing dbp formation from pm derived dom scavenged by rainfall with which formed in rainwater as eq 5 5 a c 0 c 1 1000 h s b total pm v rain r total pm c rain v rain 100 where c0 and c1 are the concentrations of total pm μg m3 measured pre and post rainfall respectively which were calculated by eq 1 h is the height of mixing layer m s as the area of rainwater sampler m2 is 0 09 m2 btotal pm is the doc derived from total pm dissolved in 1 l water mg c mg pm rtotal pm is the specific cx3r type dbp fp normalized to doc μg c mg c crain is the concentration of specific cx3r type dbp measured in rainwater sample μg c l and vrain is the volume of collected rainwater l the major volume of particle dispersion is determined by the height of mixing layer adjacent to the ground and influenced primarily by pollutants emission wang and wang 2014 pm suspended in the mixing layer above the rainwater samplers could be incorporated into the collected rainwater during rainfall convection and mechanical turbulence are capable to make the pollutants dispersed uniformly over sufficient time in this layer seibert et al 2000 so assuming that total pm in mixing layer is evenly distributed due to little atmospheric information on vertical resolution of particles under diverse weather conditions a previous survey of shanghai reported that the height of atmospheric mixing layer h ranged from 200 m to 1000 m huang et al 2012 so assuming that h value in the calculation ranges from 200 to 1000 the top and bottom values of each column were calculated when h values were 200 and 1000 respectively the modeled contribution of pm to rainwater cx3r type dbp formation during chlorination is shown in fig 7 results indicated that pm derived dom might fairly contribute to the formation of several cx3r type dbps during rainwater chlorination although the estimated contributions of pm derived dom to tcm and ch formation in rainwater were minor to sum up almost 80 or even more dbp formation from rainwater originated from non pm derived dom but the contribution less than 20 of atmospheric pm to dbp formation could not be neglected in the atmosphere although volatile and semivolatile organic compounds sources of non pm derived dom can reduce volatility and partition into particle phase through complex reactions kroll and seinfeld 2008 many of them remain in non pm phase donahue et al 2006 non pm derived dom may also dissolve in rainwater and convert to dbp precursors during disinfection above mixing layer boundary pm may also present ferrero et al 2010 but it was not involved in this calculation therefore the contribution of pm to cx3r type dbp formation in rainwater was underestimated to some degree actually the contribution of dom derived from pm2 5 and pm10 to dbp formation in rainwater can also be calculated as eq 5 the result indicated that pm2 5 contributed to the most dbp formation according to the report of global air in 2015 north africa and the middle east have witnessed the highest concentrations of population weighted average pm2 5 institute for health metrics and evaluation and health effects institute 2017 moreover china is the one of the countries experiencing high level and increasing trend in pm2 5 air quality comprehensive index and average pm concentration of shanghai ranked in the middle compared to other cities according to the reports on the state of the environment in china published by ministry of environmental protection http www english mep gov cn resource reports soe in chengdu beijing and xi an the concentrations of pm are usually higher than those in shanghai reported in previous studies tao et al 2013 elser et al 2016 sun et al 2016 in these heavy pm polluted areas more pm derived organic matter can convert into rainwater dom through rainfall resulting in the increasing contribution of pm to the formation of cx3r type dbps in rainwater 4 conclusion rainwater could scavenge atmospheric pm and pm was capable to contribute dom to rainwater smaller pm pm2 5 contained more doc than larger one individual cx3r type dbp fps normalized to doc in dom solutions derived from pm2 5 pm10 and total pm were quite similar among cx3r type dbps tcm around 0 5 4 5 μg c mg c 51 6 73 3 was predominant and tcaa around 0 6 3 2 μg c mg c 10 0 27 2 was secondary cx3r type dbps in dom solutions derived from pm and rainwater accounted for over half of aox the contribution of pm derived dom to some cx3r type dbp formation during chlorination of rainwater could not be neglected i e 4 3 21 3 for tcaa 3 2 15 9 for dcan 3 8 19 0 for tcnm and 3 8 18 9 for dcam pm2 5 contributed to the most dbp formation in rainwater low mw dom derived from total pm and rainwater exhibited higher formation reactivity of cx3r type dbps than that of high mw dom dom fractions with higher suva254 and suva285 values gave relatively higher yields of almost all cx3r type dbps indicating that aromatic compounds i e aromatic proteins benzene carboxylic acids and phenols are deduced

19326,evidence of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in watersheds has attracted worldwide attention limited in formation is available on the occurrences of health related antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens arbps in recreational waters the effects of certain environmental factors e g suspended particles on the spread of resistance also has not been characterized to date in this study a combination of culture and molecular methods was employed to comprehensively investigate the patterns of microbial resistance to representative antibiotics in samples from three recreational lakes in beijing the antibiotic resistance index ari based on the gradient concentration assay revealed that samples showed high resistance to penicillin g moderate resistance to ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin and low resistance to ceftriaxone gentamycin tetracycline and chloramphenicol antibiotic resistant bacteria arb were cultured and collected and the diversity of potential arbp species was further explored using next generation sequencing ngs the results showed that most of the identified arbps were environmental opportunistic pathogens with emerging clinical concerns e g the multidrug resistant acinetobacter junii furthermore particle attached pa fractions presented higher ari values than free floating fl fractions did indicating that the pa fractions were more resistant to selected antibiotics and the ngs results revealed that the pa fractions showed higher similarity in the screened arb community compositions in comparison with the fl fractions primarily due to a protective effect provided by the particles accordingly arbps could persist for a longer time in protective particle matrices however quantification of antibiotic resistant genes args by qpcr showed no significant abundance differences between the two fractions overall these findings suggest a potential health risk from the prevalence of arbps in recreational waters and provides a better understanding of the contribution of particles in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems with implications for the control of excessive suspended particles by water management graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban recreational waters antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens antibiotic resistance genes suspended particles spread of antibiotic resistance 1 introduction the worldwide increase in use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and corresponding antibiotic resistance genes args today the prevalence and spread of arb and args are globally recognized as urgent public health threats xi et al 2009 shi et al 2013 the aquatic environment is a reservoir for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and various arb or args have been detected in hospital wastewater korzeniewska et al 2013 wastewater treatment plants zhang et al 2015 munir et al 2011 surface and groundwater li et al 2014 and drinking water ram et al 2008 talukdar et al 2013 notably the incidence of antibiotic resistance in urban waters has become an important issue for public health leonard et al 2015 xu et al 2016 as urban waters play vital roles in receiving sewage and flood control as well as in landscaping and recreational functions several studies have reported the occurrence of certain types of arb and args in urban water xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 low et al 2016 pang et al 2015 and leonard et al 2015 further estimated human exposure risk to an arb during water sports as these studies have shown it is essential to evaluate the health risk of arb in urban recreational waters with which humans may have frequent contact the exact risk associated with antibiotic resistance in non pathogens is difficult to quantify xu et al 2016 and there is no direct evidence regarding arg transfer from the non clinical environment to human microflora lin et al 2015 attention has primarily been focused on antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria since infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens arbps tacconelli et al 2017 lead to higher healthcare costs and a higher fatality rate than do infections by non resistant strains vignesh et al 2012 xu et al 2016 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 a growing number of epidemiological surveys have reported the spread of threatening arbps e g methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus vancomycin resistant enterococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical environments lagacé wiens et al 2013 vaz moreira et al 2014 yet little is known about the diversity of arbps in urban waters berendonk et al 2015 addressed the necessity to assess the resistance of several species including escherichia coli klebsiella pneumonia aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as resistance indicators in waters however current studies in aquatic systems emphasize antibiotic resistance in fecal indicators or specific pathogens e g salmonella spp ram et al 2008 hello et al 2013 li et al 2014 at this time only a small number of pathogens found in the environment have been determined to harbor antibiotic resistance vaz moreira et al 2014 bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 with recent advances in molecular methods such as qpcr and genome sequencing yang et al 2014 fang et al 2018 arbp studies can be conducted with high throughput analyses to provide a more comprehensive description of arbps and hence to aid in the discernment of the microbial risks in urban water antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between pathogenic and or nonpathogenic bacteria in the environment by vertical or horizontal gene transfer schwartz et al 2003 thus it is necessary to ascertain the extent of the spread of antibiotic resistance in water the complex urban water system has many environmental factors affecting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance berendonk et al 2015 and the role of these factors in spreading resistance has not been thoroughly elucidated leonard et al 2015 among the environmental factors suspended particles which are usually present in high concentration in urban waters might have the potential to promote the spread of antibiotic resistance waterborne bacteria that become attached to suspended particles might mature into surface biofilms biofilms may enhance resistance spread by several mechanisms such as by the protection of exopolymer matrices for arb persistence and multiplication muranaka et al 2012 hall stoodley et al 2004 or by providing a microenvironment with a higher possibility of args transfer among bacteria due to the closer cell proximities and higher conjugation rates within the biofilm balcazar et al 2015 there is some evidence that bacterial antibiotic resistance increases within pipe biofilms fahrenfeld et al 2013 and in aquatic sediments xu et al 2016 thus as a preferred habitat for many bacteria in water fang et al 2018 suspended particles might play an important role in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environment however the extent to which suspended particles increase antibiotic resistance and whether higher concentrations of suspended particles facilitate the spread of resistance have not been investigated in the present study we selected three typical urban recreational lakes in beijing for field sampling the antibiotic resistance profiles and args in each lake were characterized using a combination of culture and molecular methods bacterial resistance in the water samples to eight representative antibiotics was first quantified in an assay using antibiotic concentration gradients after which the composition and diversity of arbps were elucidated by combining antibiotic selective culture methods and next generation sequencing ngs several args in the water or in selective communities were further quantified by qpcr the aims of this study were to 1 comprehensively investigate the levels of resistance to representative antibiotics in urban recreational waters 2 explore the diversity of potential arbp species in water samples and 3 assess the contribution of suspended particles to the spread of antibiotic resistance in water overall this study presents a detailed assessment of arbps in urban recreational waters and contributes to characterization of the effect of suspended particles on the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample preparation three recreational lakes in three different parks that are popular among tourists in beijing urban area were selected as described in our previous study fang et al 2018 the lakes were all supplemented with reclaimed water to compensate for water loss duplicate sampling sites in each lake were randomly selected sampling was conducted twice as parallel samples in table s1 once in august and again september 2016 representing the time of year when people frequently visit these waters fang et al 2018 samples were collected from approximately 10 00 12 00 samples were collected at a depth of approximately 15 cm

sequentially filtered through 5 μm filter and 0 22 μm pore filters next filters were immediately put into beakers containing 100 ml phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 0 2 under sterile conditions bacteria were gently scraped off filters with disposable sterile loops corning usa and agitated to suspend them again it should be noted that in order to keep the original attached status pa bacteria were gently gathered without violent vibration during pretreatment these pretreated pa fl samples were stored in 100 ml sterile bottles at 4 c within 2 h for further analysis 2 2 total suspended solids tss analysis and total heterotrophic bacteria enumeration total suspended solids tss content was determined by the gravimetric method with 500 ml of raw water filtered through the prewashed and pre weighed whatman gf f filters which had been dried at 105 c for 2 h each sample was analyzed in triplicate total heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated by heterotrophic plate counts hpc using a dilution plating procedure with 1 ml of diluted sample placed in 20 ml of nutrient agar aoboxing china in a petri dish iso 6222 1999 samples were serially diluted using pbs and proper dilutions were chosen to obtain between 30 and 300 colonies per plate pang et al 2015 plates were incubated at 37 c for 48 h duplicate plates were prepared per dilution for each sample and the data were reported as colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 2 3 quantification of antibiotic resistance in pa fl samples by the antibiotic resistance index ari 2 3 1 antibiotics and antibiotic solution preparation eight representative antibiotics were chosen including penicillin g pen ampicillin amp ceftriaxone cef vancomycin van erythromycin ery gentamycin gen tetracycline tet and chloramphenicol chl among them ceftriaxone was obtained from the aladdin china and the seven other antibiotics were from the genview usa these antibiotics represent different chemical structural classes and susceptibility ranges β lactams penicillin g with narrow spectrum ampicillin and ceftriaxone with broad spectrum glycopeptide vancomycin narrow spectrum macrolides erythromycin narrow spectrum aminoglycosides gentamycin narrow spectrum tetracycline broad spectrum and chloramphenicol broad spectrum brooks et al 2007 vignesh et al 2012 antibiotic stock solutions were prepared with a specific concentration to facilitate dilution penicillin g 8192 mg l in water ampicillin 8192 mg l in water ceftriaxone 8192 mg l in water vancomycin 8192 mg l in water erythromycin 4096 mg l in ethanol gentamycin 4096 mg l in water tetracycline 4096 mg l in water and chloramphenicol 8192 mg l in ethanol stock solutions were sterilized by passing through 0 22 μm filters and stored in darkness at 20 c stock solutions were utilized within one week of preparation 2 3 2 gradient antibiotic resistance assay antibiotic resistance levels of pa fl water samples were examined by incubations with eight antibiotic concentration gradients in 96 well microtiter plates catno 655185 greiner bio one germany the concentration gradients are listed in table s2 stock solutions of the antibiotics were diluted with muller hinton broth oxiod england to obtain the target concentrations in the wells each well contained 100 μl of antibiotic solution and 100 μl of the diluted water sample 5 assays were performed in triplicate for each antibiotic for each sample plates were first measured by a microplate reader spectramax m5 molecular devices to obtain the initial turbidity od600 0 of each well and then were incubated at 37 c for 20 h after which the turbidity od600 20 of each well was measured again the reference strains staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and escherichia coli atcc 25922 representatives of gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively were included as quality controls in each antibiotic assay according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines overnight grown strains were diluted with demineralized water and adjusted to turbidity comparable to that of the 0 5 mcfarland turbidity standards clsi 2015 100 μl of the suspensions were transferred into each well containing antibiotics control assays were performed in duplicate 2 3 3 ari calculation of antibiotic resistance in each sample the survival of bacteria exposed to antibiotics was normalized to calculate the ari as shown in eq 1 and the dose response of bacteria to each antibiotic was fitted mathematically to the general equation four parameter logistic function shown in eq 2 pang et al 2015 1 s u r v i v a l

et al 2016 the ic50 of the antibiotic to the bacteria was obtained for each sample using eq 2 ari was introduced and calculated as the ic50 micd ratio pang et al 2015 in this instance micd is minimum inhibitory concentration listed in table s2 which is defined as the maximum mic of typical pathogens in the clsi manual 2015 2 4 screening the antibiotic resistant bacteria arb community of pa fl samples heterotrophic plates with antibiotics were used as selective media to screen arb in the samples according to clsi 2015 guidelines samples were cultured on mueller hinton agar containing no antibiotic control or one of 8 antibiotics at specified concentrations penicillin g 16 mg l ampicillin 32 mg l ceftriaxone 64 mg l vancomycin 32 mg l erythromycin 8 mg l gentamycin 8 mg l tetracycline 16 mg l and chloramphenicol 32 mg l the given antibiotic concentrations used in this study were determined as the maximum mic in table s2 of typical pathogens according to the clsi directory huang et al 2012 to obtain the arb community 0 1 ml of serial dilutions 1 10 and 100 of pa fl water samples were spread onto plates in duplicate plates were incubated in the dark at 37 c for 20 h 0 1 ml of the two reference strains s aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 at 0 5 mcfarland turbidity were also spread as quality controls the two strains should not be observed after incubation on plates with antibiotics agar plates without inoculations were also prepared as sterile controls colonies obtained after incubation were characterized as antibiotic resistant strains watkinson et al 2007 huang et al 2012 to focus on the entire arb community all the colonies on each 10 plate with duplicates of each antibiotic for each sample were washed into 50 ml centrifuge tubes greiner bio one germany with pbs under sterile conditions collected colonies were concentrated by centrifugation avanti 26xpi beckman at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 80 c until dna extraction these screened arb communities were further analyzed by ngs to determine their composition and to identify the potential arbps using the ngs method detailed below 2 5 dna extraction environmental dna and dna of the arb communities arb dna were extracted according to the ctab sds method described previously fang et al 2018 100 μl of dna was extracted from each sample extracted dna was quantified using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher usa examined by gel electrophoresis and stored at 80 c environmental dna was used for further qpcr analysis and arb dna was used for illumina sequencing and qpcr analysis 2 6 next generation sequencing ngs and pathogen identification paired end sequencing of arb dna samples table s3 was performed by sinogenomax institute beijing china using an illumina hiseq 2500 platform generating 250 bp reads the universal primers 340f 5 cctacgggnbgcascag and 805r 5 gactacnvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the v3 4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene approximately 460 bp to minimize the effect of potential early round pcr errors pcr amplification was conducted in triplicate and purified pcr products were pooled an amplicon library was constructed according to the procedure proposed by kozich et al 2013 target sequencing depth for screening potential pathogens was 50 000 effective reads per sample the raw sequence data was submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra with accession numbers srp126035 srp126049 and srp126031 sequencing data was processed as previously described fang et al 2018 all samples were normalized to 50 000 sequences per sample for statistical analyses potential pathogens were initially identified at the genus level according to our reference list of human pathogenic bacteria created in a previous study fang et al 2018 typically the self constructed pathogenic species database cai and zhang 2013 ibekwe et al 2013 for sequence alignment does not include all pathogens and it excludes non pathogens thus the aligned results might overestimate the occurrence of pathogens to mitigate this issue further analysis at the species level was performed using a strict screening criteria 1 unique reads in each genus were sorted out for sequence alignment 2 alignments of unique reads were compared to those in a new database constructed using representative 16s rrna v3 v4 gene sequences from all species in 24 genera containing pathogens including 303 pathogenic and 754 non pathogenic species table s4 and 3 sequences with more than 99 identity to the match were annotated in a hit table and the annotated sequences were counted as potential pathogenic species it should be noted that not all of the identified pathogens here were true pathogenic species thus the results here could be used to indicate the potential pathogen risks 2 7 qpcr analysis of args and bacterial args args in total genomic dna isolated from natural water water arg and in arb community arb arg were both quantified by qpcr seven representative genes including genes encoding β lactamase bla tem bla shv ampc erythromycin resistance erma ermb and chloramphenicol resistance cat cmr were selected for qpcr assay primers and annealing temperatures used are described in table s5 plasmid construction standard curve determination qpcr analyses matrix inhibition test and comparison between samples was performed as previously described fang et al 2018 results are reported as absolute concentrations gene copies 100 ml water or relative numbers gene copies 16s rrna gene copies 2 8 statistical analyses the spearman s correlation coefficient was calculated to statistically analyze the relationship between tss and hpc to obtain the ic50 for the ari calculation dose responses to the antibiotics using the logistic function in eq 2 were fitted using pasw statistics 18 spss inc chicago the wilcoxon signed rank test of the data differences between the pa fl fractions was performed using pasw statistics 18 the mann whitney u test of the abundance differences between each pair of the studied lakes were also performed with pasw statistics 18 principal coordinate analyses pcoa of the arb profiles in all samples were produced based on the bray curtis distance matrix calculated by mothur version 1 32 1 similarity profiles simprof analyses according to the bray curtis distances were used to test for similarities among the samples with primer 7 software with the permutation test for significant differences of clusters set at the 5 level somerfield et al 2014 3 results 3 1 characterization of tss and hpc in recreational lakes relevant basic information including tss and hpc was monitored for each lake as shown in fig 1 tss content was the highest level in lake hong 35 40 mg l followed by lake tao 27 32 mg l and lake ao approximately 20 mg l hpc showed a similar pattern with the highest numbers in lake hong spearman s coefficient showed a positive correlation between tss and hpc correlation coefficient 0 732 p 0 007 hpc numbers in the pa fractions were significantly higher than those in the fl fractions wilcoxon test p 0 001 and hpc in the pa fractions were positively correlated with tss correlation coefficient 0 756 p 0 004 together these results suggested that suspended particles were favorable habitats for bacterial survival 3 2 quantitative evaluation of sample resistance levels to representative antibiotics resistance of the samples to eight antibiotics were characterized by the ari fig 2 which indicates a composite resistance of all cultured heterotrophic bacteria in sample pang et al 2015 a larger ari indicates a higher resistance to the specific antibiotic samples from lake hong had the highest aris followed by lake tao and lake ao with a similar pattern for tss and hpc fig 1 although ari was different in each lake samples from all three lakes showed similar pattern in resistance to the eight antibiotics which were divided into three groups fig 2 group i typically ari 4 referred to penicillin g to which there was relatively high resistance group ii average ari from 1 to 4 included the antibiotics ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin to which there was a medium level of resistance and group iii average ari 1 comprised of gentamycin chloramphenicol ceftriaxone and tetracycline to which there was relatively low resistance moreover all the pa fractions were found to have a significantly stronger tolerance for all of the antibiotics than that of the corresponding fl fractions p 0 001 fig 2 the ari difference between pa and fl values was the most obvious in lake hong samples especially with respect to group iii antibiotics correlating with above ari results total bacteria of the arb community after plate selection of eight antibiotics were quantified by qpcr figure s1 distinctions of 16s rrna gene copies of the arb communities corroborated results from above gradient resistance and hpc assays 3 3 determination of arb by culturing and ngs the composition and diversity of arb communities in water samples were determined by selective culturing and further investigation using ngs the composition of arb communities resistant to one of six tested antibiotics as well as control communities not exposed to antibiotics are shown in fig 3 for the pa and fl fractions of each lake differences between the two sampling months shown in fig 3 may be due to temporal variations or experimental error especially for the gentamycin and chloramphenicol resistant communities which had fewer total isolates in figure s1 in total 94 genera were identified in all the samples the heterotrophic bacterial communities in each lake were dominated by gram negative bacteria over 98 of which the vast majority belonged to the phylum proteobacteria average 98 with the remainder belonging to the phylum firmicutes average 2 although the quantitative ratios of the species in bacterial communities after culturing are not the same as the ratios in the original sample water the results here may still indicate the dominant genera and suggest structural differences among the samples in lake ao the genera aeromonas acinetobacter and pseudomonas were found to be dominant and aeromonas showed higher abundances in pa control samples approximately 50 in pa 35 in fl while acinetobacter displayed higher abundances in fl control samples 10 in pa 30 in fl in lake hong the genus aeromonas was the most prevalent and acinetobacter pseudomonas and enterobacter were also present in high abundances aeromonas and acinetobacter also showed distinct abundance differences between pa control and fl control samples in lake hong in lake tao the genera aeromonas acinetobacter pseudomonas vibrio and enterobacter were all found to be the dominant specifically 30 of the 94 genera identified in all samples contained species that may be pathogenic table s6 and were selected for further analyses at the species level compared to the control communities arb communities screened by different antibiotics showed several composition distinctions fig 3 in all three lakes the patterns of penicillin g group i resistant communities were the most similar to their corresponding control community compositions in contrast bacterial communities resistant to ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin group ii presented notable but different shifts in their composition structures in the pa and fl fractions for example in the fl samples from lake ao erythromycin resistant communities showed marked differences from the control communities in their abundances of aeromonas and acinetobacter whereas the changes in the pa samples were comparatively smaller moreover bacterial communities resistant to group iii antibiotics revealed discernible and irregular community differences from control communities in both the fl and pa fractions it is suggested that different degrees of composition shift in arb communities from control communities could be indicative of the antibiotic resistance levels in samples similar to the ari pcoa analyses fig 4 further revealed differences in the arb community compositions samples from the same lake collected in aug and sep were pooled to represent the entire community in the lake over the duration of the experiment non pooled results are included in the supplementary information figure s2 the first two axes explain over 50 of the variation in each lake in general the arb communities in the pa fractions clustered more tightly than those in the fl fractions did revealing more similar compositions regardless of the type of antibiotics for example in lake ao the bacterial communities resistant to group i and group ii antibiotics in the pa fractions clustered more closely to the those of their respective pa controls with higher similarity values 71 90 by simprof analysis as shown in table s7 while the communities in fl fractions are both less similar to their respective fl controls 49 84 similarity by simprof analysis and less similar to each other table s7 in contrast for the bacterial communities resistant to group iii antibiotics those in both the pa and fl fractions presented large distinctions from their respective controls 3 4 diversity of potential arbp species and their antibiotic resistant types by ngs based on the ngs results potential arbp species were identified in the arb communities by aligning sequences to a purpose built pathogen database using the strict screening criteria detailed in the methods a total of 27 potential pathogens and 13 non pathogens were frequently identified in the control communities table s8a and additional species with lower frequencies are noted in table s8c the diversity of potential arbp species in the fl fractions of each lake and their antibiotic resistance are summarized in table 1 potential pathogens in the three lakes generally showed similar resistance patterns with several minor differences such as the more types of resistance in pseudomonas spp in lake tao the resistance of most species were to group i and group ii antibiotics although several species also showed the resistance to group iii antibiotics notably many potential pathogens with emerging clinical attention such as a junii a hydrophila a veronii and several species in family enterobacteriaceae showed resistance to multiple antibiotics additionally the diversity of potential arbps in the pa fractions are described in table s8b compared with those in the fl fractions a larger number of species in the pa fractions displayed resistance to multiple antibiotics especially members of the genus aeromonas although the limitations of identifying pathogenic bacterial species based on sequencing of the v3 4 region of the 16s rrna gene is seen in table 1 where species that cannot be discriminated are noted the large number of potential arbps that can be identified highlight the value of this approach 3 5 abundances of args in recreational water and in selected communities by qpcr the abundance of args were used as another indicator of antibiotic resistance in the water samples several args including β lactamase genes bla tem bla shv ampc erythromycin resistance genes erma ermb and chloramphenicol resistance genes cat cmr were selected and quantified by qpcr all tested args were detected in water samples at different levels table 2 the bla tem gene was the most prevalent 105 gc 100 ml and the bla shv 104 5 gc 100 ml erma 104 5 gc 100 ml and ermb 104 5 gc 100 ml genes were also detected with high concentrations the ampc 103 4 gc 100 ml cat 103 gc 100 ml and cmr 103 4 gc 100 ml were present at lower levels the concentrations of args in lake hong and lake tao were not much higher than those in lake ao mann whitney u test p 0 05 and the concentrations of args in the fl samples were generally in the same order of magnitude as those in the pa samples albeit slightly lower than those in the pa fractions wilcoxon test in table 2 for the relative abundance of args there were no significant differences between fa and pl samples wilcoxon test in table 2 the relative abundance of the selected args in arb communities was also determined figure s3 with an emphasis on comparing pa and fl samples the relative abundances of args in pa samples were not significantly higher than those in the fl control and arb communities and in some cases args erma cat cmr were more abundant in the fl samples the similarity in the abundances of args in the pa and fl fractions suggested that the increased resistance to antibiotics in pa samples was due to some other factor 4 discussion 4 1 antibiotic resistance in urban recreational water urban recreational waters provide ecological landscape and recreational benefits to cities as well as playing a vital role in water circulation and sewage reception it is noteworthy that in the modern megacity of beijing over 65 of urban recreational waters are supplemented with reclaimed water to alleviate water scarcity both domestic sewage and reclaimed water have been reported to contain high levels of arb and args zhang et al 2009 munir et al 2011 pang et al 2015 thus urban recreational waters could be an important sink for antibiotic resistance as such it is essential to evaluate the risks of microbial antibiotic resistance in urban recreational waters especially those supplemented with reclaimed water this study combined culture and molecular methods for an overall assessment of antibiotic resistance in sample water from three lakes used for recreational activity in the beijing area first antibiotic resistance using the ari of the aquatic microbial community was quantified with the antibiotic gradient assay although it might result in an overestimation of the actual ari in nature due to the usage of od600 calculation incorporating bacterial growth the ari displayed variations in antibiotic resistance and the distinctions between the pa fl fractions using an easier method by the 96 well plate further comparisons of arb community structures with control communities also demonstrated a consistent resistance pattern with use of the ari method and the quantification of several kinds of args β lactamase genes erythromycin resistance genes etc also indicated similar distinctions to the ari results regarding the types of antibiotic resistance resistance patterns to the eight tested antibiotics suggest that environmental resistance may be related to clinical drug usage patterns the high observed rate of antibiotic resistance in this study to the commonly prescribed and overused antibiotics in group i penicillin g and group ii ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin correlates with high global rates of resistance to these antibiotics stedtfeld et al 2016 especially the common drug penicillin g has lost nearly all its efficacy for the heterotrophic bacteria in the sampled water further the intrinsic resistance to antibiotics in groups i and ii by the most common gram negative bacteria e g the p aeruginosa cannot be overlooked low et al 2016 which might lead to an overestimation of levels of the acquired resistance to these antibiotics in contrast in group iii microbes from all the lakes exhibited a low resistance to tetracycline although other studies have found high levels of resistance to tetracycline brooks et al 2007 munir et al 2011 this discrepancy can possibly be explained by the current restrictions on clinical use of tetracycline in china along with its rapid degradation rate in environment qiao et al 2018 similarly the low level of chloramphenicol resistance in the three lakes may also be linked to declines in clinical usage bacterial communities also exhibited low levels of resistance to ceftriaxone a new third generation cephalosporin and gentamycin one of the most effective antibiotics for targeting gram negative bacteria the comparatively short term of exposure to these new antibiotics has likely not allowed environmental microbial populations enough time to acquire significant levels of resistance to these two drugs however the possible emergence of this resistance should be monitored as the use of these drugs increases excessive domestic and clinical usage of antibiotics results in the continuous discharge of these drugs to sewage treatment systems where the arb and args might persist these resistant bacteria and genes can enter recreational waters as reclaimed water supplements or as direct sewage discharge our observation of arb and args in the studied lakes suggested the necessity to enhance the quality of water used as supplemental sources and to avoid sewage discharge to recreational waters 4 2 diversity of potential arbp in recreational water though recommendations can be made from assessments of the composite antibiotic resistance in water samples it is more informative for regulators to identify antibiotic resistant pathogens with direct health risks currently there are two main methods to investigate arbps in water most studies focus on the isolation of certain pathogenic strains including escherichia coli enterococcal species and staphylococcus spp from water and subsequent assessment of their resistances resende et al 2014 li et al 2014 alm et al 2014 this strategy is time intensive and ultimately represents only a small portion of the total heterotrophic pathogens in the samples and little remains known about many arbp species in the water other efforts using more recently developed methods qpcr and gene sequencing have been widely applied to study args in various environments yang et al 2014 these efforts have focused on determining the occurrence of args as a proxy for measuring antibiotic resistance however large surveys of args still cannot show direct correlation of args with pathogens which usually exist at low density in natural water limiting the applicability of these molecular approaches for the evaluation of arbp in the present study low levels of viable antibiotic resistant pathogens in water samples were first enriched vaz moreira et al 2014 by selection with several antibiotics in nutrient media and the resulting microbial community was elucidated using ngs arbps were identified among these arb communities in a high throughput manner interestingly most of the potential arbp species identified in this study are environmental opportunistic pathogens that have not been reported in similar studies focusing on the antibiotic resistance of certain enteric pathogens in water ram et al 2008 hello et al 2013 li et al 2014 in the clinical environment increasing attention has been paid to opportunistic pathogens vaz moreira et al 2014 since they most likely are of environmental origin and the incidence of opportunistic infections has recently increased falkinham iii et al 2015 thus antibiotic resistance among opportunistic pathogens in recreational waters should not be neglected moreover a significant number of the potential opportunistic pathogens exhibited resistance to more than one antibiotic table 1 suggesting that resistance might be transmitted among them aeromonas spp and species of enterobacteriaceae have been reported as important carriers and disseminators of args in the environment not only among themselves but potentially through interaction with other genera stecher and hardt 2012 leonard et al 2015 berendonk et al 2015 the ubiquity and propensity to carry and spread antibiotic resistance could make opportunistic pathogens a considerable risk in recreational waters and further assessment of health risks associated with these bacteria is required the novel methodology used to characterize arbp in the present study revealed antibiotic resistant potential pathogens within communities of arb however there are some inadequacies in the arb ngs methodology first antibiotic concentrations used for the selection of resistant bacteria in this study were based on the maximum mic values recommended by clsi for certain pathogens but these maximum mic values may not be suitable for other environmental microbes zhang et al 2016 thus the actual level of antibiotic resistance and the diversity of antibiotic resistant populations may be underestimated accordingly more defined concentrations of antibiotics should be used for the selection of arb from environmental samples in future studies as a second future methodological improvement while the potential pathogens identified by the sequencing method in the present study were considered as indicative of pathogen risks more advanced sequencing and culture based methods need to be developed to explore the true diversity of pathogenic bacteria and the actual risk in aquatic environments additionally the results in this study also showed that the majority of the arb isolates were gram negative bacteria it is important to further optimize culture media with a focus on the cultivation of more gram positive bacteria 4 3 contribution of particles to the enhancement and spread of antibiotic resistance in recreational waters apart from the identification of arbps to assess risks in recreational waters environmental factors that influence the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance also require attention this study focused on the effect of suspended particles which are typically present in high concentrations in urban water on the extent of antibiotic resistance and the incidence of arbp the results consistently indicated that arb communities in the pa fractions were more similar to each other than to those in the fl fractions particularly with respect to the resistance to groups i and ii antibiotics this could be explained by protection of the particle matrix in the pa fractions from the antibiotic penetration which has been shown to be a significant mechanism for antibiotic resistance enhancement hall stoodley et al 2004 our results also showed that the arb displayed greater community disruptions from group iii antibiotics to which the bacteria showed low resistance possible due to weaker particle matrix protection from these antibiotics the enhanced phenotypic resistance to antibiotics by the pa fraction suggests the necessity to adequately consider the influence of suspended particles on monitoring methods and resistance evaluations of recreational waters moreover due to protection by the particle matrix arb persistence and multiplication within particles could occur the hpc results suggested that the presence of suspended particles favors bacteria survival in recreational waters fig 1 especially for bacteria with a preference for the pa fractions e g aeromonas fig 3 and table s8b and 16s rrna gene copies of screened communities demonstrated a higher number of arbs in the pa fractions figure s1 overall the findings show that suspended particles may facilitate arbs proliferation and prolong the persistence of arbps contributing to the vertical spread of antibiotic resistance in recreational waters the effect of suspended particles on args was also investigated notably despite higher ari values in the pa fractions the quantification of args consistently indicated no differences in abundance between the pa and fl samples some args even showed higher relative abundances in the fl samples than those in the pa samples table 2 these results lend further credence to the hypothesis that protection by the particle matrix was the main contributor to the enhancement of phenotypic antibiotic resistance the observation that lake hong had the highest tss and ari values figs 1 and 2 but lower numbers of args table 2 could also be explained by particle matrix protection compared with other studies it has been reported that sediment was an important reservoir for args with concentrations in the sediment that were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the overlying water xu et al 2016 the surface biofilm in the yangtze estuary was also a sink for args guo et al 2018 while the args in another established biofilm in water were not significantly elevated engemann et al 2008 the authors suggested that the args accumulation in matrices is associated with many factors such as the matrix properties xu et al 2016 and antibiotic or metal adsorption guo et al 2018 the results in this study indicated that suspended particles might not be advantageous for the enhancement of arg levels and further investigations of the particle properties and args dissemination e g horizontal gene transfer among bacteria within particles can be conducted many potential arbp species and other bacteria carrying args could persist for a long time within the protection of aquatic particles which should not be neglected especially in the type of urban recreational water investigated in this study which could be easily polluted by human activities and harbor excessive suspended particles fang et al 2018 enhanced water management to control tss is essential overall our findings help in understanding the effects of particles on the levels and spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems investigations of other environmental factors as suggested by berendonk et al 2015 can be further conducted to better predict the fate of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems 5 conclusions this study combined culture and molecular methods to comprehensively characterize the antibiotic resistance pattern and potential arbp diversity in urban recreational water most of the identified arbps were environmental opportunistic pathogens with emerging clinical concerns and more efforts to evaluate the health risks of these potential arbps in recreational waters are essential the role played by suspended particles in the level and spread of antibiotic resistance was determined for the first time it was most likely that protection by the particle matrix was the main contributor to the antibiotic resistance enhancement and arbp proliferation with implications for the control of excessive suspended particles by water management further characterization of the particle properties and arg behavior e g gene transfer among bacteria within particles can be conducted this study provides a better understanding of the spread and fate of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments and investigations of other environmental factors affecting the resistance spread can be conducted to better predict the fate of antibiotic resistance in water acknowledgement this study was supported by

19326,evidence of the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance in watersheds has attracted worldwide attention limited in formation is available on the occurrences of health related antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens arbps in recreational waters the effects of certain environmental factors e g suspended particles on the spread of resistance also has not been characterized to date in this study a combination of culture and molecular methods was employed to comprehensively investigate the patterns of microbial resistance to representative antibiotics in samples from three recreational lakes in beijing the antibiotic resistance index ari based on the gradient concentration assay revealed that samples showed high resistance to penicillin g moderate resistance to ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin and low resistance to ceftriaxone gentamycin tetracycline and chloramphenicol antibiotic resistant bacteria arb were cultured and collected and the diversity of potential arbp species was further explored using next generation sequencing ngs the results showed that most of the identified arbps were environmental opportunistic pathogens with emerging clinical concerns e g the multidrug resistant acinetobacter junii furthermore particle attached pa fractions presented higher ari values than free floating fl fractions did indicating that the pa fractions were more resistant to selected antibiotics and the ngs results revealed that the pa fractions showed higher similarity in the screened arb community compositions in comparison with the fl fractions primarily due to a protective effect provided by the particles accordingly arbps could persist for a longer time in protective particle matrices however quantification of antibiotic resistant genes args by qpcr showed no significant abundance differences between the two fractions overall these findings suggest a potential health risk from the prevalence of arbps in recreational waters and provides a better understanding of the contribution of particles in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems with implications for the control of excessive suspended particles by water management graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban recreational waters antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens antibiotic resistance genes suspended particles spread of antibiotic resistance 1 introduction the worldwide increase in use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and corresponding antibiotic resistance genes

of antibiotic resistance and various arb or args have been detected in hospital wastewater korzeniewska et al 2013 wastewater treatment plants zhang et al 2015 munir et al 2011 surface and groundwater li et al 2014 and drinking water ram et al 2008 talukdar et al 2013 notably the incidence of antibiotic resistance in urban waters has become an important issue for public health leonard et al 2015 xu et al 2016 as urban waters play vital roles in receiving sewage and flood control as well as in landscaping and recreational functions several studies have reported the occurrence of certain types of arb and args in urban water xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 low et al 2016 pang et al 2015 and leonard et al 2015 further estimated human exposure risk to an arb during water sports as these studies have shown it is essential to evaluate the health risk of arb in urban recreational waters with which humans may have frequent contact the exact risk associated with antibiotic resistance in non pathogens is difficult to quantify xu et al 2016 and there is no direct evidence regarding arg transfer from the non clinical environment to human microflora lin et al 2015 attention has primarily been focused on antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria since infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens arbps tacconelli et al 2017 lead to higher healthcare costs and a higher fatality rate than do infections by non resistant strains vignesh et al 2012 xu et al 2016 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 a growing number of epidemiological surveys have reported the spread of threatening arbps e g methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus vancomycin resistant enterococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa in clinical environments lagacé wiens et al 2013 vaz moreira et al 2014 yet little is known about the diversity of arbps in urban waters berendonk et al 2015 addressed the necessity to assess the resistance of several species including escherichia coli klebsiella pneumonia aeromonas spp pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as resistance indicators in waters however current studies in aquatic systems emphasize antibiotic resistance in fecal indicators or specific pathogens e g salmonella spp ram et al 2008 hello et al 2013 li et al 2014 at this time only a small number of pathogens found in the environment have been determined to harbor antibiotic resistance vaz moreira et al 2014 bengtsson palme and larsson 2015 with recent advances in molecular methods such as qpcr and genome sequencing yang et al 2014 fang et al 2018 arbp studies can be conducted with high throughput analyses to provide a more comprehensive description of arbps and hence to aid in the discernment of the microbial risks in urban water antibiotic resistance can be transmitted between pathogenic and or nonpathogenic bacteria in the environment by vertical or horizontal gene transfer schwartz et al 2003 thus it is necessary to ascertain the extent of the spread of antibiotic resistance in water the complex urban water system has many environmental factors affecting the dissemination of antibiotic resistance berendonk et al 2015 and the role of these factors in spreading resistance has not been thoroughly elucidated leonard et al 2015 among the environmental factors suspended particles which are usually present in high concentration in urban waters might have the potential to promote the spread of antibiotic resistance waterborne bacteria that become attached to suspended particles might mature into surface biofilms biofilms may enhance resistance spread by several mechanisms such as by the protection of exopolymer matrices for arb persistence and multiplication muranaka et al 2012 hall stoodley et al 2004 or by providing a microenvironment with a higher possibility of args transfer among bacteria due to the closer cell proximities and higher conjugation rates within the biofilm balcazar et al 2015 there is some evidence that bacterial antibiotic resistance increases within pipe biofilms fahrenfeld et al 2013 and in aquatic sediments xu et al 2016 thus as a preferred habitat for many bacteria in water fang et al 2018 suspended particles might play an important role in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environment however the extent to which suspended particles increase antibiotic resistance and whether higher concentrations of suspended particles facilitate the spread of resistance have not been investigated in the present study we selected three typical urban recreational lakes in beijing for field sampling the antibiotic resistance profiles and args in each lake were characterized using a combination of culture and molecular methods bacterial resistance in the water samples to eight representative antibiotics was first quantified in an assay using antibiotic concentration gradients after which the composition and diversity of arbps were elucidated by combining antibiotic selective culture methods and next generation sequencing ngs several args in the water or in selective communities were further quantified by qpcr the aims of this study were to 1 comprehensively investigate the levels of resistance to representative antibiotics in urban recreational waters 2 explore the diversity of potential arbp species in water samples and 3 assess the contribution of suspended particles to the spread of antibiotic resistance in water overall this study presents a detailed assessment of arbps in urban recreational waters and contributes to characterization of the effect of suspended particles on the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample preparation three recreational lakes in three different parks that are popular among tourists in beijing urban area were selected as described in our previous study fang et al 2018 the lakes were all supplemented with reclaimed water to compensate for water loss duplicate sampling sites in each lake were randomly selected sampling was conducted twice as parallel samples in table s1 once in august and again september 2016

sequentially filtered through 5 μm filter and 0 22 μm pore filters next filters were immediately put into beakers containing 100 ml phosphate buffer saline pbs ph 7 2 0 2 under sterile conditions bacteria were gently scraped off filters with disposable sterile loops corning usa and agitated to suspend them again it should be noted that in order to keep the original attached status pa bacteria were gently gathered without violent vibration during pretreatment these pretreated pa fl samples were stored in 100 ml sterile bottles at 4 c within 2 h for further analysis 2 2 total suspended solids tss analysis and total heterotrophic bacteria enumeration total suspended solids tss content was determined by the gravimetric method with 500 ml of raw water filtered through the prewashed and pre weighed whatman gf f filters which had been dried at 105 c for 2 h each sample was analyzed in triplicate total heterotrophic bacteria were enumerated by heterotrophic plate counts hpc using a dilution plating procedure with 1 ml of diluted sample placed in 20 ml of nutrient agar aoboxing china in a petri dish iso 6222 1999 samples were serially diluted using pbs and proper dilutions were chosen to obtain between 30 and 300 colonies per plate pang et al 2015 plates were incubated at 37 c for 48 h duplicate plates were prepared per dilution for each sample and the data were reported as colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 2 3 quantification of antibiotic resistance in pa fl samples by the antibiotic resistance index ari 2 3 1 antibiotics and antibiotic solution preparation eight representative antibiotics were chosen including penicillin g pen ampicillin amp ceftriaxone cef vancomycin van erythromycin ery gentamycin gen tetracycline tet and chloramphenicol chl among them ceftriaxone was obtained from the aladdin china and the seven other antibiotics were from the genview usa these antibiotics represent different chemical structural classes and susceptibility ranges β lactams penicillin g with narrow spectrum ampicillin and ceftriaxone with broad spectrum glycopeptide vancomycin narrow spectrum macrolides erythromycin narrow spectrum aminoglycosides gentamycin narrow spectrum tetracycline broad spectrum and chloramphenicol broad spectrum brooks et al 2007 vignesh et al 2012 antibiotic stock solutions were prepared with a specific concentration to facilitate dilution penicillin g 8192 mg l in water ampicillin 8192 mg l in water ceftriaxone 8192 mg l in water vancomycin 8192 mg l in water erythromycin 4096 mg l in ethanol gentamycin 4096 mg l in water tetracycline 4096 mg l in water and chloramphenicol 8192 mg l in ethanol stock solutions were sterilized by passing through 0 22 μm filters and stored in darkness at 20 c stock solutions were utilized within one week of preparation 2 3 2 gradient antibiotic resistance assay antibiotic resistance levels of pa fl water samples were examined by incubations with eight antibiotic concentration gradients in 96 well microtiter plates catno 655185 greiner bio one germany the concentration gradients are listed in table s2 stock solutions of the antibiotics were diluted with muller hinton broth oxiod england to obtain the target concentrations in the wells each well contained 100 μl of antibiotic solution and 100 μl of the diluted water sample 5 assays were performed in triplicate for each antibiotic for each sample plates were first measured by a microplate reader spectramax m5 molecular devices to obtain the initial turbidity od600 0 of each well and then were incubated at 37 c for 20 h after which the turbidity od600 20 of each well was measured again the reference strains staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and escherichia coli atcc 25922 representatives of gram positive and gram negative bacteria respectively were included as quality controls in each antibiotic assay according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines overnight grown strains were diluted with demineralized water and adjusted to turbidity comparable to that of the 0 5 mcfarland turbidity standards clsi 2015 100 μl of the suspensions were transferred into each well containing antibiotics control assays were performed in duplicate 2 3 3 ari calculation of antibiotic resistance in each sample the survival of bacteria exposed to antibiotics was normalized to calculate the ari as shown in eq 1 and the dose response of bacteria to each antibiotic was fitted mathematically to the general equation four parameter logistic function shown in eq 2 pang et al 2015 1 s u r v i v a l

et al 2016 the ic50 of the antibiotic to the bacteria was obtained for each sample using eq 2 ari was introduced and calculated as the ic50 micd ratio pang et al 2015 in this instance micd is minimum inhibitory concentration listed in table s2 which is defined as the maximum mic of typical pathogens in the clsi manual 2015 2 4 screening the antibiotic resistant bacteria arb community of pa fl samples heterotrophic plates with antibiotics were used as selective media to screen arb in the samples according to clsi 2015 guidelines samples were cultured on mueller hinton agar containing no antibiotic control or one of 8 antibiotics at specified concentrations penicillin g 16 mg l ampicillin 32 mg l ceftriaxone 64 mg l vancomycin 32 mg l erythromycin 8 mg l gentamycin 8 mg l tetracycline 16 mg l and chloramphenicol 32 mg l the given antibiotic concentrations used in this study were determined as the maximum mic in table s2 of typical pathogens according to the clsi directory huang et al 2012 to obtain the arb community 0 1 ml of serial dilutions 1 10 and 100 of pa fl water samples were spread onto plates in duplicate plates were incubated in the dark at 37 c for 20 h 0 1 ml of the two reference strains s aureus atcc 29213 and e coli atcc 25922 at 0 5 mcfarland turbidity were also spread as quality controls the two strains should not be observed after incubation on plates with antibiotics agar plates without inoculations were also prepared as sterile controls colonies obtained after incubation were characterized as antibiotic resistant strains watkinson et al 2007 huang et al 2012 to focus on the entire arb community all the colonies on each 10 plate with duplicates of each antibiotic for each sample were washed into 50 ml centrifuge tubes greiner bio one germany with pbs under sterile conditions collected colonies were concentrated by centrifugation avanti 26xpi beckman at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 80 c until dna extraction these screened arb communities were further analyzed by ngs to determine their composition and to identify the potential arbps using the ngs method detailed below 2 5 dna extraction environmental dna and dna of the arb communities arb dna were extracted according to the ctab sds method described previously fang et al 2018 100 μl of dna was extracted from each sample extracted dna was quantified using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher usa examined by gel electrophoresis and stored at 80 c environmental dna was used for further qpcr analysis and arb dna was used for illumina sequencing and qpcr analysis 2 6 next generation sequencing ngs and pathogen identification paired end sequencing of arb dna samples table s3 was performed by sinogenomax institute beijing china using an illumina hiseq 2500 platform generating 250 bp reads the universal primers 340f 5 cctacgggnbgcascag and 805r 5 gactacnvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the v3 4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene approximately 460 bp to minimize the effect of potential early round pcr errors pcr amplification was conducted in triplicate and purified pcr products were pooled an amplicon library was constructed according to the procedure proposed by kozich et al 2013 target sequencing depth for screening potential pathogens was 50 000 effective reads per sample the raw sequence data was submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra with accession numbers srp126035 srp126049 and srp126031 sequencing data was processed as previously described fang et al 2018 all samples were normalized to 50 000 sequences per sample for statistical analyses potential pathogens were initially identified at the genus level according to our reference list of human pathogenic bacteria created in a previous study fang et al 2018 typically the self constructed pathogenic species database cai and zhang 2013 ibekwe et al 2013 for sequence alignment does not include all pathogens and it excludes non pathogens thus the aligned results might overestimate the occurrence of pathogens to mitigate this issue further analysis at the species level was performed using a strict screening criteria 1 unique reads in each genus were sorted out for sequence alignment 2 alignments of unique reads were compared to those in a new database constructed using representative 16s rrna v3 v4 gene sequences from all species in 24 genera containing pathogens including 303 pathogenic and 754 non pathogenic species table s4 and 3 sequences with more than 99 identity to the match were annotated in a hit table and the annotated sequences were counted as potential pathogenic species it should be noted that not all of the identified pathogens here were true pathogenic species thus the results here could be used to indicate the potential pathogen risks 2 7 qpcr analysis of args and bacterial args args in total genomic dna isolated from natural water water arg and in arb community arb arg were both quantified by qpcr seven representative genes including genes encoding β lactamase bla tem bla shv ampc erythromycin resistance erma ermb and chloramphenicol resistance cat cmr were selected for qpcr assay primers and annealing temperatures used are described in table s5 plasmid construction standard curve determination qpcr analyses matrix inhibition test and comparison between samples was performed as previously described fang et al 2018 results are reported as absolute concentrations gene copies 100 ml water or relative numbers gene copies 16s rrna gene copies 2 8 statistical analyses the spearman s correlation coefficient was calculated to statistically analyze the relationship between tss and hpc to obtain the ic50 for the ari calculation dose responses to the antibiotics using the logistic function in eq 2 were fitted using pasw statistics 18 spss inc chicago the wilcoxon signed rank test of the data differences between the pa fl fractions was performed using pasw statistics 18 the mann whitney u test of the abundance differences between each pair of the studied lakes were also performed with pasw statistics 18 principal coordinate analyses pcoa of the arb profiles in all samples were produced based on the bray curtis distance matrix calculated by mothur version 1 32 1 similarity profiles simprof analyses according to the bray curtis distances were used to test for similarities among the samples with primer 7 software with the permutation test for significant differences of clusters set at the 5 level somerfield et al 2014 3 results 3 1 characterization of tss and hpc in recreational lakes relevant basic information including tss and hpc was monitored for each lake as shown in fig 1 tss content was the highest level in lake hong 35 40 mg l followed by lake tao 27 32 mg l and lake ao approximately 20 mg l hpc showed a similar pattern with the highest numbers in lake hong spearman s coefficient showed a positive correlation between tss and hpc correlation coefficient 0 732 p 0 007 hpc numbers in the pa fractions were significantly higher than those in the fl fractions wilcoxon test p 0 001 and hpc in the pa fractions were positively correlated with tss correlation coefficient 0 756 p 0 004 together these results suggested that suspended particles were favorable habitats for bacterial survival 3 2 quantitative evaluation of sample resistance levels to representative antibiotics resistance of the samples to eight antibiotics were characterized by the ari fig 2 which indicates a composite resistance of all cultured heterotrophic bacteria in sample pang et al 2015 a larger ari indicates a higher resistance to the specific antibiotic samples from lake hong had the highest aris followed by lake tao and lake ao with a similar pattern for tss and hpc fig 1 although ari was different in each lake samples from all three lakes showed similar pattern in resistance to the eight antibiotics which were divided into three groups fig 2 group i typically ari 4 referred to penicillin g to which there was relatively high resistance group ii average ari from 1 to 4 included the antibiotics ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin to which there was a medium level of resistance and group iii average ari 1 comprised of gentamycin chloramphenicol ceftriaxone and tetracycline to which there was relatively low resistance moreover all the pa fractions were found to have a significantly stronger tolerance for all of the antibiotics than that of the corresponding fl fractions p 0 001 fig 2 the ari difference between pa and fl values was the most obvious in lake hong samples especially with respect to group iii antibiotics correlating with above ari results total bacteria of the arb community after plate selection of eight antibiotics were quantified by qpcr figure s1 distinctions of 16s rrna gene copies of the arb communities corroborated results from above gradient resistance and hpc assays 3 3 determination of arb by culturing and ngs the composition and diversity of arb communities in water samples were determined by selective culturing and further investigation using ngs the composition of arb communities resistant to one of six tested antibiotics as well as control communities not exposed to antibiotics are shown in fig 3 for the pa and fl fractions of each lake differences between the two sampling months shown in fig 3 may be due to temporal variations or experimental error especially for the gentamycin and chloramphenicol resistant communities which had fewer total isolates in figure s1 in total 94 genera were identified in all the samples the heterotrophic bacterial communities in each lake were dominated by gram negative bacteria over 98 of which the vast majority belonged to the phylum proteobacteria average 98 with the remainder belonging to the phylum firmicutes average 2 although the quantitative ratios of the species in bacterial communities after culturing are not the same as the ratios in the original sample water the results here may still indicate the dominant genera and suggest structural differences among the samples in lake ao the genera aeromonas acinetobacter and pseudomonas were found to be dominant and aeromonas showed higher abundances in pa control samples approximately 50 in pa 35 in fl while acinetobacter displayed higher abundances in fl control samples 10 in pa 30 in fl in lake hong the genus aeromonas was the most prevalent and acinetobacter pseudomonas and enterobacter were also present in high abundances aeromonas and acinetobacter also showed distinct abundance differences between pa control and fl control samples in lake hong in lake tao the genera aeromonas acinetobacter pseudomonas vibrio and enterobacter were all found to be the dominant specifically 30 of the 94 genera identified in all samples contained species that may be pathogenic table s6 and were selected for further analyses at the species level compared to the control communities arb communities screened by different antibiotics showed several composition distinctions fig 3 in all three lakes the patterns of penicillin g group i resistant communities were the most similar to their corresponding control community compositions in contrast bacterial communities resistant to ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin group ii presented notable but different shifts in their composition structures in the pa and fl fractions for example in the fl samples from lake ao erythromycin resistant communities showed marked differences from the control communities in their abundances of aeromonas and acinetobacter whereas the changes in the pa samples were comparatively smaller moreover bacterial communities resistant to group iii antibiotics revealed discernible and irregular community differences from control communities in both the fl and pa fractions it is suggested that different degrees of composition shift in arb communities from control communities could be indicative of the antibiotic resistance levels in samples similar to the ari pcoa analyses fig 4 further revealed differences in the arb community compositions samples from the same lake collected in aug and sep were pooled to represent the entire community in the lake over the duration of the experiment non pooled results are included in the supplementary information figure s2 the first two axes explain over 50 of the variation in each lake in general the arb communities in the pa fractions clustered more tightly than those in the fl fractions did revealing more similar compositions regardless of the type of antibiotics for example in lake ao the bacterial communities resistant to group i and group ii antibiotics in the pa fractions clustered more closely to the those of their respective pa controls with higher similarity values 71 90 by simprof analysis as shown in table s7 while the communities in fl fractions are both less similar to their respective fl controls 49 84 similarity by simprof analysis and less similar to each other table s7 in contrast for the bacterial communities resistant to group iii antibiotics those in both the pa and fl fractions presented large distinctions from their respective controls 3 4 diversity of potential arbp species and their antibiotic resistant types by ngs based on the ngs results potential arbp species were identified in the arb communities by aligning sequences to a purpose built pathogen database using the strict screening criteria detailed in the methods a total of 27 potential pathogens and 13 non pathogens were frequently identified in the control communities table s8a and additional species with lower frequencies are noted in table s8c the diversity of potential arbp species in the fl fractions of each lake and their antibiotic resistance are summarized in table 1 potential pathogens in the three lakes generally showed similar resistance patterns with several minor differences such as the more types of resistance in pseudomonas spp in lake tao the resistance of most species were to group i and group ii antibiotics although several species also showed the resistance to group iii antibiotics notably many potential pathogens with emerging clinical attention such as a junii a hydrophila a veronii and several species in family enterobacteriaceae showed resistance to multiple antibiotics additionally the diversity of potential arbps in the pa fractions are described in table s8b compared with those in the fl fractions a larger number of species in the pa fractions displayed resistance to multiple antibiotics especially members of the genus aeromonas although the limitations of identifying pathogenic bacterial species based on sequencing of the v3 4 region of the 16s rrna gene is seen in table 1 where species that cannot be discriminated are noted the large number of potential arbps that can be identified highlight the value of this approach 3 5 abundances of args in recreational water and in selected communities by qpcr the abundance of args were used as another indicator of antibiotic resistance in the water samples several args including β lactamase genes bla tem bla shv ampc erythromycin resistance genes erma ermb and chloramphenicol resistance genes cat cmr were selected and quantified by qpcr all tested args were detected in water samples at different levels table 2 the bla tem gene was the most prevalent 105 gc 100 ml and the bla shv 104 5 gc 100 ml erma 104 5 gc 100 ml and ermb 104 5 gc 100 ml genes were also detected with high concentrations the ampc 103 4 gc 100 ml cat 103 gc 100 ml and cmr 103 4 gc 100 ml were present at lower levels the concentrations of args in lake hong and lake tao were not much higher than those in lake ao mann whitney u test p 0 05 and the concentrations of args in the fl samples were generally in the same order of magnitude as those in the pa samples albeit slightly lower than those in the pa fractions wilcoxon test in table 2 for the relative abundance of args there were no significant differences between fa and pl samples wilcoxon test in table 2 the relative abundance of the selected args in arb communities was also determined figure s3 with an emphasis on comparing pa and fl samples the relative abundances of args in pa samples were not significantly higher than those in the fl control and arb communities and in some cases args erma cat cmr were more abundant in the fl samples the similarity in the abundances of args in the pa and fl fractions suggested that the increased resistance to antibiotics in pa samples was due to some other factor 4 discussion 4 1 antibiotic resistance in urban recreational water urban recreational waters provide ecological landscape and recreational benefits to cities as well as playing a vital role in water circulation and sewage reception it is noteworthy that in the modern megacity of beijing over 65 of urban recreational waters are supplemented with reclaimed water to alleviate water scarcity both domestic sewage and reclaimed water have been reported to contain high levels of arb and args zhang et al 2009 munir et al 2011 pang et al 2015 thus urban recreational waters could be an important sink for antibiotic resistance as such it is essential to evaluate the risks of microbial antibiotic resistance in urban recreational waters especially those supplemented with reclaimed water this study combined culture and molecular methods for an overall assessment of antibiotic resistance in sample water from three lakes used for recreational activity in the beijing area first antibiotic resistance using the ari of the aquatic microbial community was quantified with the antibiotic gradient assay although it might result in an overestimation of the actual ari in nature due to the usage of od600 calculation incorporating bacterial growth the ari displayed variations in antibiotic resistance and the distinctions between the pa fl fractions using an easier method by the 96 well plate further comparisons of arb community structures with control communities also demonstrated a consistent resistance pattern with use of the ari method and the quantification of several kinds of args β lactamase genes erythromycin resistance genes etc also indicated similar distinctions to the ari results regarding the types of antibiotic resistance resistance patterns to the eight tested antibiotics suggest that environmental resistance may be related to clinical drug usage patterns the high observed rate of antibiotic resistance in this study to the commonly prescribed and overused antibiotics in group i penicillin g and group ii ampicillin vancomycin and erythromycin correlates with high global rates of resistance to these antibiotics stedtfeld et al 2016 especially the common drug penicillin g has lost nearly all its efficacy for the heterotrophic bacteria in the sampled water further the intrinsic resistance to antibiotics in groups i and ii by the most common gram negative bacteria e g the p aeruginosa cannot be overlooked low et al 2016 which might lead to an overestimation of levels of the acquired resistance to these antibiotics in contrast in group iii microbes from all the lakes exhibited a low resistance to tetracycline although other studies have found high levels of resistance to tetracycline brooks et al 2007 munir et al 2011 this discrepancy can possibly be explained by the current restrictions on clinical use of tetracycline in china along with its rapid degradation rate in environment qiao et al 2018 similarly the low level of chloramphenicol resistance in the three lakes may also be linked to declines in clinical usage bacterial communities also exhibited low levels of resistance to ceftriaxone a new third generation cephalosporin and gentamycin one of the most effective antibiotics for targeting gram negative bacteria the comparatively short term of exposure to these new antibiotics has likely not allowed environmental microbial populations enough time to acquire significant levels of resistance to these two drugs however the possible emergence of this resistance should be monitored as the use of these drugs increases excessive domestic and clinical usage of antibiotics results in the continuous discharge of these drugs to sewage treatment systems where the arb and args might persist these resistant bacteria and genes can enter recreational waters as reclaimed water supplements or as direct sewage discharge our observation of arb and args in the studied lakes suggested the necessity to enhance the quality of water used as supplemental sources and to avoid sewage discharge to recreational waters 4 2 diversity of potential arbp in recreational water though recommendations can be made from assessments of the composite antibiotic resistance in water samples it is more informative for regulators to identify antibiotic resistant pathogens with direct health risks currently there are two main methods to investigate arbps in water most studies focus on the isolation of certain pathogenic strains including escherichia coli enterococcal species and staphylococcus spp from water and subsequent assessment of their resistances resende et al 2014 li et al 2014 alm et al 2014 this strategy is time intensive and ultimately represents only a small portion of the total heterotrophic pathogens in the samples and little remains known about many arbp species in the water other efforts using more recently developed methods qpcr and gene sequencing have been widely applied to study args in various environments yang et al 2014 these efforts have focused on determining the occurrence of args as a proxy for measuring antibiotic resistance however large surveys of args still cannot show direct correlation of args with pathogens which usually exist at low density in natural water limiting the applicability of these molecular approaches for the evaluation of arbp in the present study low levels of viable antibiotic resistant pathogens in water samples were first enriched vaz moreira et al 2014 by selection with several antibiotics in nutrient media and the resulting microbial community was elucidated using ngs arbps were identified among these arb communities in a high throughput manner interestingly most of the potential arbp species identified in this study are environmental opportunistic pathogens that have not been reported in similar studies focusing on the antibiotic resistance of certain enteric pathogens in water ram et al 2008 hello et al 2013 li et al 2014 in the clinical environment increasing attention has been paid to opportunistic pathogens vaz moreira et al 2014 since they most likely are of environmental origin and the incidence of opportunistic infections has recently increased falkinham iii et al 2015 thus antibiotic resistance among opportunistic pathogens in recreational waters should not be neglected moreover a significant number of the potential opportunistic pathogens exhibited resistance to more than one antibiotic table 1 suggesting that resistance might be transmitted among them aeromonas spp and species of enterobacteriaceae have been reported as important carriers and disseminators of args in the environment not only among themselves but potentially through interaction with other genera stecher and hardt 2012 leonard et al 2015 berendonk et al 2015 the ubiquity and propensity to carry and spread antibiotic resistance could make opportunistic pathogens a considerable risk in recreational waters and further assessment of health risks associated with these bacteria is required the novel methodology used to characterize arbp in the present study revealed antibiotic resistant potential pathogens within communities of arb however there are some inadequacies in the arb ngs methodology first antibiotic concentrations used for the selection of resistant bacteria in this study were based on the maximum mic values recommended by clsi for certain pathogens but these maximum mic values may not be suitable for other environmental microbes zhang et al 2016 thus the actual level of antibiotic resistance and the diversity of antibiotic resistant populations may be underestimated accordingly more defined concentrations of antibiotics should be used for the selection of arb from environmental samples in future studies as a second future methodological improvement while the potential pathogens identified by the sequencing method in the present study were considered as indicative of pathogen risks more advanced sequencing and culture based methods need to be developed to explore the true diversity of pathogenic bacteria and the actual risk in aquatic environments additionally the results in this study also showed that the majority of the arb isolates were gram negative bacteria it is important to further optimize culture media with a focus on the cultivation of more gram positive bacteria 4 3 contribution of particles to the enhancement and spread of antibiotic resistance in recreational waters apart from the identification of arbps to assess risks in recreational waters environmental factors that influence the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance also require attention this study focused on the effect of suspended particles which are typically present in high concentrations in urban water on the extent of antibiotic resistance and the incidence of arbp the results consistently indicated that arb communities in the pa fractions were more similar to each other than to those in the fl fractions particularly with respect to the resistance to groups i and ii antibiotics this could be explained by protection of the particle matrix in the pa fractions from the antibiotic penetration which has been shown to be a significant mechanism for antibiotic resistance enhancement hall stoodley et al 2004 our results also showed that the arb displayed greater community disruptions from group iii antibiotics to which the bacteria showed low resistance possible due to weaker particle matrix protection from these antibiotics the enhanced phenotypic resistance to antibiotics by the pa fraction suggests the necessity to adequately consider the influence of suspended particles on monitoring methods and resistance evaluations of recreational waters moreover due to protection by the particle matrix arb persistence and multiplication within particles could occur the hpc results suggested that the presence of suspended particles favors bacteria survival in recreational waters fig 1 especially for bacteria with a preference for the pa fractions e g aeromonas fig 3 and table s8b and 16s rrna gene copies of screened communities demonstrated a higher number of arbs in the pa fractions figure s1 overall the findings show that suspended particles may facilitate arbs proliferation and prolong the persistence of arbps contributing to the vertical spread of antibiotic resistance in recreational waters the effect of suspended particles on args was also investigated notably despite higher ari values in the pa fractions the quantification of args consistently indicated no differences in abundance between the pa and fl samples some args even showed higher relative abundances in the fl samples than those in the pa samples table 2 these results lend further credence to the hypothesis that protection by the particle matrix was the main contributor to the enhancement of phenotypic antibiotic resistance the observation that lake hong had the highest tss and ari values figs 1 and 2 but lower numbers of args table 2 could also be explained by particle matrix protection compared with other studies it has been reported that sediment was an important reservoir for args with concentrations in the sediment that were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the overlying water xu et al 2016 the surface biofilm in the yangtze estuary was also a sink for args guo et al 2018 while the args in another established biofilm in water were not significantly elevated engemann et al 2008 the authors suggested that the args accumulation in matrices is associated with many factors such as the matrix properties xu et al 2016 and antibiotic or metal adsorption guo et al 2018 the results in this study indicated that suspended particles might not be advantageous for the enhancement of arg levels and further investigations of the particle properties and args dissemination e g horizontal gene transfer among bacteria within particles can be conducted many potential arbp species and other bacteria carrying args could persist for a long time within the protection of aquatic particles which should not be neglected especially in the type of urban recreational water investigated in this study which could be easily polluted by human activities and harbor excessive suspended particles fang et al 2018 enhanced water management to control tss is essential overall our findings help in understanding the effects of particles on the levels and spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems investigations of other environmental factors as suggested by berendonk et al 2015 can be further conducted to better predict the fate of antibiotic resistance in aquatic systems 5 conclusions this study combined culture and molecular methods to comprehensively characterize the antibiotic resistance pattern and potential arbp diversity in urban recreational water most of the identified arbps were environmental opportunistic pathogens with emerging clinical concerns and more efforts to evaluate the health risks of these potential arbps in recreational waters are essential the role played by suspended particles in the level and spread of antibiotic resistance was determined for the first time it was most likely that protection by the particle matrix was the main contributor to the antibiotic resistance enhancement and arbp proliferation with implications for the control of excessive suspended particles by water management further characterization of the particle properties and arg behavior e g gene transfer among bacteria within particles can be conducted this study provides a better understanding of the spread and fate of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments and investigations of other environmental factors affecting the resistance spread can be conducted to better predict the fate of antibiotic resistance in water acknowledgement this study was supported by

19327,nitrification failure of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in cold season calls into investigations of the functional ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms in this study we report the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa bacteria aob and complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira in 23 municipal wwtps in cold season and explore the correlations between aoms abundance and their relative contribution to nitrification the copy numbers of aoa and aob amoa gene ranged from 2 42 107 to 2 47 109 and 5 54 106 to 3 31 109 copies g sludge respectively the abundance of amoa gene of candidatus nitrospira inopinata an important strain of comammox nitrospira was stable with averaged abundance of 8 47 106 copies g sludge dna based stable isotope probing dna sip assays were conducted with three typical wwtps in which the abundance of aoa was lower than similar to and higher than that of aob respectively the results showed that considerable 13c assimilation by aoa was detected during active nitrification in all wwtps whereas just a much lesser extent of 13c incorporation by aob and comammox nitrospira was found in one wwtp high throughput sequencing with 13c labeled dna also showed the higher reads abundance of aoa than aob and comammox nitrospira nitrososphaera viennensis was the dominant active aoa while nitrosomonas oligotropha and nitrosomonas europaea were identified as active aob the results obtained suggest that aoa rather than aob and comammox nitrospira dominate ammonia oxidation in wwtps in cold season despite the numerical relationships of aoms graphical abstract image 1 keywords ammonia oxidizing archaea ammonia oxidizing bacteria complete ammonia oxidizing nitrospira dna based stable isotope probing wastewater treatment plants numerical relationships 1 introduction nitrification is conventionally considered as a two step process where ammonia is firstly oxidized into nitrite by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob and then nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob until 2015 our knowledge about nitrification is extended by the discoveries of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which convert ammonia to nitrate in one organism since nitrification failure frequently occurs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in cold season kim et al 2006 martin et al 2005 a better understanding of the distribution of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms and their relative contribution to nitrification could benefit the operation and stable performance of wwtps the co occurrence of aoa and aob in wwtps in winter has been detected by some previous studies pan et al 2018 sauder et al 2012 but the distribution of comammox nitrospira in wwtps in cold season is still unclear until now the studies about comammox nitrospira are focused on the oligotrophic environments such as drinking water treatment plants dwtps pinto et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the detection of comammox nitrospira in wwtps is just revealed by limited studies through high throughput sequencing chao et al 2016 and metagenomic sequencing annavajhala et al 2018 therefore whether aoa aob and comammox nitrospira can co occur in wwtps in cold season is still unknown the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira has been investigated in dwtps wang et al 2017 freshwater recirculation aquaculture system bartelme et al 2017 and forests soils hu and he 2017 however little information can be available about the numerical relationships of these aoms in wwtps especially in cold season for the numerical relationships of aoa and aob some studies found that aob outnumber aoa in wwtps with temperature lower than 15 c sauder et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 while aoa are reported as the numerically dominant aoms in two wwtps in cold season roy et al 2017 for the abundance of comammox nitrospira it is nearly untapped in wwtps fan et al 2017 found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira is lower than that of aoa and aob in a wwtp during a year sampling whereas the higher abundance of comammox nitrospira than that of aob was reported in a wwtp without the occurrence of aoa pjevac et al 2017 as the metabolic distinction and niche partitioning have been reported within different nitrifying microorganisms lawson and lücker 2018 it is important to understand their abundance in wwtps in cold season which can benefit for creating novel and better process control strategies of nitrification until now the correlations between numerical relationships of aoms and their potential nitrification activity are still unclear dna based stable isotope probing dna sip can serve as an ideal technique to discover functional microorganisms involved in some specific metabolic processes since the assimilation of carbon source by ammonia oxidizers depends on the energy generated from ammonia oxidation wang et al 2015 it provides access for dna sip technique to trace active ammonia oxidizers incorporating 13c substrate as revealed by dna sip assays in previous studies it seems that the functional activity of aoms in nitrification may not be always positive with their numerical relationships pan et al 2018 found that aob dominate active ammonia oxidation in a wwtp even though their initial abundance is lower than that of aoa niu et al 2013 confirmed the more important role of aoa in nitrification in dwtps despite the numerical dominance of aob in contrast the functional dominance in nitrification by the numerical dominant aoms has been reported in wwtps gao et al 2016 and acidic soils zhang et al 2012 in addition no information can be available about the functional activity and relative contribution of comammox nitrospira to nitrification in wwtps to better understand the microbial mechanisms of nitrification in wwtps in cold season in depth investigations are urgently needed to explore the correlations between numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers and their relative contribution to nitrification the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the numerical relationships of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira and 2 explore whether numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers were responsible for their nitrification activity in municipal wwtps in cold season in this study 23 wwtps from china were sampled in february to investigate the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira using quantitative real time pcr qpcr then three wwtps with different numerical relationships of aoms were typically selected to subject time course dna sip incubation to trace the active ammonia oxidizers and evaluate their relative contribution to ammonia oxidation further high throughput sequencing and network analysis were performed to identify the active aoms and their potential interactions respectively 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection activated sludge was taken from 23 municipal wwtps in seven provinces across china in february 2016 four technological configurations were covered including oxidation ditch 13 wwtps sequencing batch reactor four wwtps anaerobic anoxic aerobic five wwtps and biological aerated filter one wwtp details of the description of these wwtps sewage characteristics and operation parameters were given in table 1 all the activated sludge flocs were sampled in triplicate from different positions at the end of aeration tanks and then mixed together after briefly settling sludge sample was kept in the ice box and transported to laboratory immediately a part of activated sludge was freeze dried by labconco freezone 1 l labconco usa for dna extraction and the others was stored at 4 c until further analyses 2 2 dna sip incubation based on the numerical relationships between aoa and aob the activated sludge samples from three wwtps located in the same city w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od represent for aoa aob aoa aob and aoa aob respectively were typically selected to perform dna sip incubation to explore the active aoms in municipal wwtps in cold season each activated sludge was subjected to pre incubation to exhaust the residual substrates in supernatant then the wet sludge was transferred to serum bottle to carry out dna sip incubation with 200 ml synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared as described by pan et al 2018 the ammonium concentration mlss temperature ph and do of each microcosm were as in situ conditions details were given in table 2 in addition equivalent nah12co3 or nah13co3 was added into microcosms as sole carbon source of control or labeled treatments respectively the time course incubation was applied in order to label active aoms with suitable and shorter incubation time the incubation cycles were ten and 20 for w1 od and w8 sbr while they were ten 20 and 30 for w23 od all the treatments were set up in duplicate in total 28 microcosms were set up and all of them were incubated in dark and shaken at 100 rpm the concentration of ammonium was monitored in the supernatant every 30 min during dna sip incubation if ammonium was completely degraded one cycle incubation was ended the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the influent and effluent were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 at the end of incubation microcosms were harvested and freeze dried after remove of supernatant 2 3 dna extraction isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation 0 05 0 10 g dry sludge was applied to extract dna using fastdna spin kit for soil qiagen usa dna from the duplicate microcosms was pooled together and the concentration was measured using nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 thermo fisher scientific usa then cscl density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described by previous study neufeld et al 2007 briefly for each treatment 5 μg of total dna was mixed with cscl stock solution and gb buffer to form an initial density of 1 725 g ml determined by ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert usa after thorough mixing the gradient mediums were loaded into 5 1 ml polyallomer quick seal centrifuge tubes beckman coulter usa and then ultracentrifugation was proceeded with the centrifuge tubes in a nvt100 vertical rotor in optima xe 100 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter usa at 45000 rpm for 44 h at 20 c the gradient medium was fractionated into 12 aliquots using a syringe pump to deliver sterile water into the top of ultracentrifuge tube and fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube the buoyant density of each fraction was measured by ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert usa after that dna was precipitated from fractions by adding two volumes of peg 6000 solution at room temperature overnight after washing by 70 ethanol dna was dissolved in 30 μl te buffer 2 4 qpcr assays qpcr was applied to measure the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in total genomic dna and fractionated dna using mx3005p thermocycler agilent technologies usa for quantification of aoa and aob archaeal amoa gene and bacterial amoa gene were targeted for comammox nitrospira primers special for candidatus nitrospira inopinata amoa gene were selected to perform quantification assays in addition the abundance of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was also determined across the entire buoyant density gradients the reactions were performed in 20 μl mixture containing 10 μl gotaq qpcr master mix promega usa 0 2 μm of each specific primer and 2 μl of template dna all the primer sets and protocols were summarized in table s1 to construct standard curves the plasmids containing target gene were taken in 10 fold serial dilution from 108 to 101 copies all the standard dna and test samples were run in triplicate the correlation coefficients and amplification efficiencies were in range of 0 995 0 999 and 95 3 99 0 respectively 2 5 miseq sequencing and bioinformation analyses dna retrieved from fractions 2 5 of each 13c amanded microcosm after isopycnic centrifugation was pooled as heavy dna sample heavy dna and total genomic dna of their seed samples without incubation were subjected to miseq high throughput sequencing targeting v3 v4 regions of archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna gene the details of primers and protocols were given in table s1 pcr amplication of each sample was carried out in triplicate after purified by a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen germany the positive pcr products were pooled and quantified by a quantifluortm st promega usa and then normalized to equimolar amounts finally dna was sequenced on illumina miseq pe300 sequencer illumina usa in allwegene technology co ltd beijing china all the raw sequences obtained have been submitted to sequence read archive sra database and can be found with accession number of srp148631 after sequencing fast length adjustment of short reads flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 was conducted to assemble the paired end reads based on the overlap more than 10 bp then the merged reads were subjected to further analyses using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2011 briefly primer barcodes chimera and low quality reads were checked and removed for the quality control followed by normalization with the minimum number of the reads in the test samples next the clean reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity using uclust algorithm then the taxonomy assignment of otus was performed using rdp classifier with silva database alpha diversity was calculated including chao 1 good coverage observed species and shannon index the representative sequences of otus affiliated with aoa aob and nob were extracted at genus level in order to further reveal aoa and aob communities at species level local blast program was conducted to align the representative sequences to the sub database of aoa and aob as reported by pan et al 2018 for the further taxonomy assignment of the otus of nob mega 7 0 was used to construct a neighbor joining nj phylogenetic tree with representative sequences and reference sequences after trimmed bootstrap approach 1000 replicates was performed to test the reliability of the nj tree one way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the variances of the numerical relationships of aoa and aob between different groups of wwtps the statistical significance will be confirmed with p value 0 05 spearmans rank correlation coefficient srcc was applied to estimate the relationships between environmental factors with the abundance of aoms and to explore the associations between the active aoms recovered from w23 od then network analysis was carried out to show the interactions of active communities with statistical robustness if p value was less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 quantification of aoms in 23 wwtps qpcr was performed to quantify the abundance of amoa gene of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in 23 wwtps as shown in fig 1 the abundance of aoa varied from 2 42 107 w4 od to 2 47 109 w18 od copies g sludge averaged at 3 25 108 copies g sludge for aob the copy numbers of amoa gene were in the range of 5 54 106 w23 od to 3 31 109 w3 od copies g sludge averaged at 7 57 108 copies g sludge the copy numbers of amoa gene of ca nsp inopinata a species of comammox nitrospira were successfully quantified in all 23 wwtps the abundance of ca nsp inopinata was stable in the test wwtps which averaged at 8 47 106 copies g sludge the successful quantification of ca nsp inopinata provided evidences that comammox nitrospira were widespread in wwtps in cold season in most of the test wwtps the abundance of ca nsp inopinata was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of aoa and aob so 23 wwtps were divided into three groups based on the ratios of aoa to aob group ⅰ ratio 0 1 group ⅱ 0 1 ratio 10 and group ⅲ 10 ratio anova further confirmed the significant differences of numerical relationships of aoa and aob between different groups that p values of group ⅰ vs group ⅱ group ⅰ vs group ⅲ and group ⅱ vs group ⅲ were 0 04 0 00 and 0 00 respectively four wwtps were included in group ⅰ that the ratios of aoa to aob were in the range of 0 03 0 08 in group ⅱ 18 wwtps where the ratios of aoa to aob were within one order of magnitude the significantly numerical dominance of aoa over aob was only found in w23 od with the ratio of aoa to aob of 57 65 in order to explore the correlations between numerical relationships of aoms and their relative contribution to nitrification in wwtps w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od were typically selected to perform dna sip assays standing for group ⅰ group ⅱ and group ⅲ respectively 3 2 nitrification activity of dna sip microcosms in order to assess nitrification activity during dna sip incubation the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were determined in the influent and effluent of each cycle as shown in fig 2 ammonium was almost depleted in the effluent of each treatment the averaged removal rates of ammonium were 96 90 96 12 and 90 60 in w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od respectively most of the degraded ammonium was converted into nitrate while nitrite in effluent was stable with low concentration the dynamics of ammonium nitrite and nitrate during a typical incubation cycle were demonstrated in fig s1 these results demonstrated that all microcosms can achieve high nitrification activity during dna sip incubation 3 3 quantification of nitrifying communities across entire buoyant density fractions cscl density gradient centrifugation was performed to separate labeled dna from native dna of microcosms followed by quantification of amoa gene of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira across the entire buoyant density fractions as the failure of quantification of comammox nitrospira in fractionated dna the abundance of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was determined as an alternative as shown in fig 3 a c a small amount of aoa amoa gene was detected in the heavy dna fractions from 13c microcosms of w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od with the shortest incubation cycles despite their initial abundance in seed samples as increasing incubation time more and more aoa amoa gene was labeled and the peaks of aoa abundance obviously shifted toward heavy dna fractions especially in 13c microcosm of w23 od 30 the majority of aoa amoa gene was observed in the heavy layers while in control microcosm aoa abundance peaked in the light dna fractions in contrast the highest copy number of aob amoa gene was retrieved in the light dna fractions with buoyant density of approximately 1 70 g ml regardless of control or labeled microcosms fig 3d f labeling aob amoa gene cannot be detected in the 13c microcosms of w1 od and w8 sbr where aob abundance was higher than and equivalent to that of aoa respectively whereas aob amoa gene was only observed with low relative abundance in the heavy layers from 13c microcosms of w23 od that harbored lower abundance of aob than that of aoa these results suggest that aoa predominate ammonia oxidation in all the test wwtps while aob act as minor ammonia oxidizers just in w23 od similar to aob a small amount of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was labeled and made the existence in the heavy dna fractions from 13c microcosms of w23 od whereas in other microcosms the abundance of nitrospira only peaked in the light dna fractions fig 3g i 3 4 community composition of active nitrifying microorganisms in order to assess the active nitrifying communities heavy dna from 13c microcosms together with the total genomic dna from seed samples of w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od was subjected to high throughput sequencing targeting archaeal 16s rrna gene based on the results of quantification of aob and nitrospira the heavy dna and seed sample dna of w23 od were conducted to sequence bacterial 16s rrna gene the results of sequencing were summarized in table s2 in total 687682 and 156540 effective reads were obtained targeting archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna gene respectively in order to identify the active nitrifying phylotypes the sequences assigned to aoa aob and nob at genus level were retrieved for the further analyses 3 4 1 identification of active aoa and aob as shown in fig 4 a 4165 sequences affiliated with aoa were identified proliferation of aoa 16s rrna gene was found that the sequence abundance in heavy dna was positive with incubation time for aob a total of 84 sequences were retrieved fig 4b compared with aoa the less aob sequence abundance further supported the results of quantification of aoa and aob in density fractions the communities of active aoa and aob at species level were shown in fig 4c and d respectively for aoa all the sequences retrieved were exclusively related to genus nitrososphaera and divided into three species including candidatus nitrososphaera gargensis nitrososphaera sp jg1 and nitrososphaera viennensis among them np viennensis was the predominant aoa regardless of seed samples or heavy dna samples 83 84 99 84 and 85 76 of the labeled aoa 16s rrna gene were affiliated with np viennensis in w1 od 20 h the heavy dna of w1 od 20 w8 sbr 20 h and w23 od 30 h respectively the sequences belonged to ca np gargensis and np sp jg1 were also detected in heavy dna indicating their functional roles during active nitrification even though they just accounted for a minority of total aoa sequences for aob three species nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas nitrosa and nitrosomonas oligotropha related to genus nitrosomonas were detected nm oligotropha dominated aob both in seed sample and in heavy dna samples although nm europaea cannot be found in seed sample resulting from the low abundance the existence in heavy dna provided the evidence of its nitrification activity after dna sip incubation nm nitrosa disappeared in heavy dna suggesting that nm nitrosa may not be the active aob in this study 3 4 2 identification of active comammox nitrospira as demonstrated in fig 5 a 836 and 1085 sequences of nob 16s rrna gene were retrieved from seed sample and heavy dna samples of w23 od respectively based on 97 similarity all these sequences were divided into ten otus and their representative sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis shown in fig 5b most nob 16s rrna gene sequences were clustered into genus nitrospira as well known ca nsp inopinata ca nsp nitrosa and ca nsp nitrificans were the three strains of comammox nitrospira otu1403 as well as otu1874 and otu729 was phylogenetically related to comammox nitrospira strains that they closely clustered into a unique clade besides otu1613 also showed high identification with ca nsp inopinata 98 ca nsp nitrosa 97 and ca nsp nitrificans 97 based on the results of blast against with 16s rrna gene sequences of these comammox nitrospira strains taken together these four otus otu1403 otu1874 otu729 and otu1613 were related to comammox nitrospira fig 5c shows the relative abundance of comammox nitrospira to total nob phylotypes in seed sample and heavy dna samples as demonstrated in fig 5c the active nob were dominated by comammox nitrospira in heavy dna samples with the relative abundance of 87 10 88 04 and 72 59 in w23 od 10 h w23 od 20 h and w23 od 30 h respectively indicating that comammox nitrospira were functional in assimilating 13c substrate during active nitrification 3 5 potential interactions between active nitrifying communities network analysis was performed to further explore the potential interactions between the active nitrifying communities including aoa aob comammox nitrospira and canonical nob as these four functional guilds co occurred and functionally assimilated 13c substrate in the labeled microcosms derived from w23 od treatment as shown in fig 6 all the phylotypes were divided into eight clusters based on their connections most of the interactions of phylotypes were positive the connections of phylotypes affiliated with aoa dominated the interactions between active nitrifying communities 21 out of 33 nodes and 47 out of 52 edges the more frequent interactions within aoa guild rather than between different guilds can be found such as cluster i and iii aob phylotypes of otu1886 and otu 1923 were significantly in positive interactions with aoa phylotypes of otu263 otu414 otu544 and otu1859 cluster ii otu729 and otu1403 which fell into comammox nitrospira guild positively correlated with the phylotypes affiliated with aoa and aob in contrast the phylotypes belonged to canonical nob made less correlations with other phylotypes in the microcosms these results of network analysis also demonstrated the important role of aoa within active nitrifying communities 4 discussion quantification analyses showed that aoa aob and comammox nitrospira widely co occurred in municipal wwtps in cold season the abundance of aoa in this study varied from 2 42 107 to 2 47 109 copies g sludge which was lower than that in two wwtps from usa roy et al 2017 and higher than that in a wwtp with three separate processes from china in winter pan et al 2018 with respect to aob the copy numbers were in the range of 5 54 106 to 3 31 109 copies g sludge which were similar to that reported by roy et al 2017 but lower than that reported by zhang et al 2015 in cold season majority of the test samples 18 out of 23 harbored approximately equivalent abundance of aoa and aob amoa gene in four wwtps the abundance of aob was one order of magnitude higher than that of aoa which was similar to the results reported by fan et al 2017 just in one wwtp w23 od the abundance of aoa was 56 65 times higher than that of aob which was in consistent with the results obtained in three wwtps kayee et al 2011 srcc analysis was performed to further investigate the correlations between environmental factors and the abundance of aoa and aob and the ratios of aoa to aob the results showed that ph value in wwtps was significantly negative with the abundance of aoa p 0 01 given in table s3 which was similar to that reported in a biological aerated filter process chen et al 2017a ph value was reported as the most important driver of aoa community structure gubry rangin et al 2011 nicol et al 2008 found that the abundance and transcript of aoa amoa gene increase with the decreasing ph value it seems that aoa may prefer to relatively lower ph condition whereas few environmental factors measured in this study could be responsible for the differentiations of aob abundance and the ratios of aoa to aob in wwtps shown in table s3 until now the components affecting the abundance of aoa and aob in wwtps are still in debate many physicochemical and operational parameters are thought as the key factors towards aoa and aob abundance in different studies such as temperature wells et al 2009 and ammonium removal kayee et al 2011 the factors causing the numerical variations of aoa and aob are still needed further investigation the abundance of ca nsp inopinata an important group of comammox nitrospira clade a was successful quantified in all 23 wwtps these results further confirmed the wide distribution of comammox nitrospira in wwtps in cold season the copy numbers of ca nsp inopinata was stable and kept around at 107 copies g sludge about 101 copies ng dna in 23 wwtps which was higher than that reported by fan et al 2017 pjevac et al 2017 found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a is 5 1 102 copies ng dna which is higher than that obtained in this study comammox nitrospira are also abundant in many environmental habitats the abundance of comammox nitrospira is 107 109 copies g sand in dwtps fowler et al 2018 and about 108 copies g biofilter sand in freshwater recirculating aquaculture system bartelme et al 2017 hu and he 2017 found that abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a and b is around 107 copies g soil which is significantly higher than that of aoa in acidic forest soils and aob in both acidic and alkaline forest soils it seems that ph may be a key factor affecting the numerical patterns of comammox nitrispira and other ammonia oxidizers however no significant correlations between ph value and the abundance of ca nsp inopinata have been recognized by srcc analysis given in table s3 these results indicated that comammox nitrispira may adapt to certain ph regimens in wwtps as the newly discovered ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira have not been subjected to well study of their responses to different environmental factors more efforts should be taken in the future studies to reveal the effects of environmental factors on the abundance of comammox nitrospira we found that there was tn loss during dna sip incubation averaged at 49 76 40 56 and 50 31 for w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od respectively summarized in table s4 tn loss during aerobic nitrification has been reported in previous study that 40 of tn is removed in an autotrophic nitrification denitrification system which is suspected to be mediated by ammonia oxidizers kuai and verstraete 1998 since gaseous nitrogen produced by aob just accounts for 2 3 3 8 of oxidized nh4 n at aerobic condition in nitrifying activated sludge wunderlin et al 2012 it seems that aob cannot be solely responsible for whole tn loss during dna sip incubation in this study in addition aerobic condition was maintained and no organic carbon was added during dna sip incubation which provided bad conditions for anammox and denitrifiers survival the ability of gaseous nitrogen production by aoa has been confirmed in ocean santoro et al 2011 and pure culture löscher et al 2012 as the most predominant active ammonia oxidizers aoa are suspected to contribute most to tn loss with some yet unknown pathways during dna sip incubation noted that either nh4 n is converted to no3 n or gaseous nitrogen the process of oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n is inevitable which is mediated by ammonia oxidizers tn loss cannot affect the results that aoa assimilated considerable 13c substrate during active nitrification three wwtps were typically selected to perform time course dna sip incubation to investigate the effects of numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers on their relative contribution to nitrification in cold season dna sip assays identified that aoa were the dominant active aoms in all test wwtps while aob and comammox nitrospira were minor ammonia oxidizers in w23 od regardless of whether aoa were the numerically dominant ammonia oxidizers in the seed samples or not as well known dna sip relies on the assimilation of labeled substrate and cell proliferation the maximum specific growth rate of aoa is far lower than that of aob chen et al 2017b könneke et al 2005 prosser 1990 tourna et al 2011 whereas considerable 13c substrate assimilation by aoa rather than aob can be detected in all microcosms during active nitrification indicating that it was aoa that undoubtedly dominated ammonia oxidation during dna sip incubation the results obtained suggest that the numerical dominance of aoms may not directly correlate with their contribution to ammonia oxidation similar result has been reported in dwtps that aob outnumber aoa but the ammonia oxidation is mostly mediated by aoa niu et al 2013 and in wwtps reported by muβmann et al 2011 and pan et al 2018 aoa are the most abundant ammonia oxidizers while aob are responsible for the in situ ammonia oxidation whereas gao et al 2016 found that aob outnumber aoa and aob play more important role than aoa during active nitrification in a wwtp it seems that the niche differentiation may contribute to the distinction of the phylogeny and physiology of aoa and aob sauder et al 2017 showed that different growth conditions can elicit different physiological responses and niche partitioning in this study the low temperature in wwtps in cold season may affect the activity and communities of aoa and aob horak et al 2013 fount that little variations of ammonia oxidation activity of aoa can be detected with the changing temperature from 8 to 20 c as aoa were detected in different environments at low temperature alves et al 2013 santoro and casciotti 2011 they may be tolerant to a wide range of temperature and keep their activity and communities stable in contrast the nitrification activity of aob sharply drops when the temperature decreases from 30 to 10 c grunditz and dalhammar 2001 kim et al 2008 moreover few seasonal variations of aoa and aob abundance can be found in wwtps pan et al 2018 roy et al 2017 wells et al 2009 it seems that temperature may regulate the nitrification activity of aoa and aob rather than their abundance the results obtained call into the question that why can aob maintain their substantial abundance in wwtps in cold season if they are not active in ammonia oxidation previous studies hoefman et al 2012 oliver 2005 found when exposed to some extreme environmental conditions such as low temperature bacteria could turn to viable but nonculturable vbnc state that they are still alive and keep very low levels of metabolic activity but stop growing it is possibly that aob may be in the vbnc state when they are exposed to the low temperature environment in wwtps in cold season and they can be revival when the environmental stress disappears until now it is poorly understood about community structure of comammox nitrospira and their relative contribution to nitrification in wwtps in this study the results of high throughput sequencing showed that more than 72 of total nob sequences from heavy dna samples were composed of comammox nitrospira indicating that comammox nitrospira could be active in performing complete ammonia oxidation in w23 od the active role of comammox nitrospira in nitrification of wwtps in cold season agreed with the results reported by gonzalez martinez et al 2016 that comammox nitrospira may be favored to low temperature as the common substrate for ammonia oxidizers ammonia may also be the key factor affecting the niche partitioning of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira kits et al 2017 found that the half saturation constants k m app of ca nsp inopinata for ammonia is 63 nm which is comparable with that of nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 strain of aoa lower than that of non marine aoa and 4 to 2500 fold lower than that of kinetically characterized aob moreover hu and he 2017 suggest that comammox nitrospira may be the strong competitors of aoa in the ammonia limited environments the exclusive detection of labeled 16s rrna gene of comammox nitrospira in w23 od a wwtp with the lowest ammonium concentration in this study indicated that comammox nitrospira could be active in nitrification and compete with aoa in wwtps with limited ammonium as revealed by high throughput sequencing np viennensis was the most dominant active aoa in wwtps in cold season np viennensis was enriched from a garden soil tourna et al 2011 and serves as a model organism for the investigation of aoa np viennensis is the key and active ammonia oxidizer making significant contribution to nitrogen removal in wwtps pan et al 2018 freshwater sediment wu et al 2013 and paddy soils wang et al 2015 in addition ca np gargensis and np sp jg1 were also detected as a minority of active aoa which were also confirmed as the active aoa in wwtps in warn season avrahami et al 2011 pan et al 2018 with respect of aob nm oligotropha and nm europaea were the active aob and made minor contribution to the ammonia oxidation in w23 od during incubation similarly avrahami et al 2011 also found that nm oligotropha and nm europaea dominate the active aob responsible for the nitrification of creek ecosystems at 13 c as the main active aob in agricultural soil jia and conrad 2009 the sequences belonged to genus nitrosospira cannot be detected both in seed sample and in heavy dna samples indicating that they may not be the active aob in wwtps in cold season 5 conclusions the co occurrence of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira was widely confirmed in 23 wwtps in cold season dna sip assays indicated that aoa dominated ammonia oxidation in wwtps in cold season while aob and comammox nitrospira just acted as minor active ammonia oxidizers the results obtained provided the evidences that the nitrification activity of aoms cannot be determined by their numerical relationships as the first discovered aoms aob were not always functional in nitrification in wwtps in addition comammox nitrospira were also active in a wwtp with limited ammonium where they may be strong competitors of aoa more efforts should be taken to further estimate the relative contribution of aoms to nitrification in wwtps and their response to the

19327,nitrification failure of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in cold season calls into investigations of the functional ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms in this study we report the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa bacteria aob and complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira in 23 municipal wwtps in cold season and explore the correlations between aoms abundance and their relative contribution to nitrification the copy numbers of aoa and aob amoa gene ranged from 2 42 107 to 2 47 109 and 5 54 106 to 3 31 109 copies g sludge respectively the abundance of amoa gene of candidatus nitrospira inopinata an important strain of comammox nitrospira was stable with averaged abundance of 8 47 106 copies g sludge dna based stable isotope probing dna sip assays were conducted with three typical wwtps in which the abundance of aoa was lower than similar to and higher than that of aob respectively the results showed that considerable 13c assimilation by aoa was detected during active nitrification in all wwtps whereas just a much lesser extent of 13c incorporation by aob and comammox nitrospira was found in one wwtp high throughput sequencing with 13c labeled dna also showed the higher reads abundance of aoa than aob and comammox nitrospira nitrososphaera viennensis was the dominant active aoa while nitrosomonas oligotropha and nitrosomonas europaea were identified as active aob the results obtained suggest that aoa rather than aob and comammox nitrospira dominate ammonia oxidation in wwtps in cold season despite the numerical relationships of aoms graphical abstract image 1 keywords ammonia oxidizing archaea ammonia oxidizing bacteria complete ammonia oxidizing nitrospira dna based stable isotope probing wastewater treatment plants numerical relationships 1 introduction nitrification is conventionally considered as a two step process where ammonia is firstly oxidized into nitrite by ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob and then nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob until 2015 our knowledge about nitrification is extended by the discoveries of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrospira daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which convert ammonia to nitrate in one organism since nitrification failure frequently occurs in wastewater treatment plants wwtps in cold season kim et al 2006 martin et al 2005 a better understanding of the distribution of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aoms and their relative contribution to nitrification could benefit the operation and stable performance of wwtps the co occurrence of aoa and aob in wwtps in winter has been detected by some previous studies pan et al 2018 sauder et al 2012 but the distribution of comammox nitrospira in wwtps in cold season is still unclear until now the studies about comammox nitrospira are focused on the oligotrophic environments such as drinking water treatment plants dwtps pinto et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the detection of comammox nitrospira in wwtps is just revealed by limited studies through high throughput sequencing chao et al 2016 and metagenomic sequencing annavajhala et al 2018 therefore whether aoa aob and comammox nitrospira can co occur in wwtps in cold season is still unknown the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira has been investigated in dwtps wang et al 2017 freshwater recirculation aquaculture system bartelme et al 2017 and forests soils hu and he 2017 however little information can be available about the numerical relationships of these aoms in wwtps especially in cold season for the numerical relationships of aoa and aob some studies found that aob outnumber aoa in wwtps with temperature lower than 15 c sauder et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 while aoa are reported as the numerically dominant aoms in two wwtps in cold season roy et al 2017 for the abundance of comammox nitrospira it is nearly untapped in wwtps fan et al 2017 found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira is lower than that of aoa and aob in a wwtp during a year sampling whereas the higher abundance of comammox nitrospira than that of aob was reported in a wwtp without the occurrence of aoa pjevac et al 2017 as the metabolic distinction and niche partitioning have been reported within different nitrifying microorganisms lawson and lücker 2018 it is important to understand their abundance in wwtps in cold season which can benefit for creating novel and better process control strategies of nitrification until now the correlations between numerical relationships of aoms and their potential nitrification activity are still unclear dna based stable isotope probing dna sip can serve as an ideal technique to discover functional microorganisms involved in some specific metabolic processes since the assimilation of carbon source by ammonia oxidizers depends on the energy generated from ammonia oxidation wang et al 2015 it provides access for dna sip technique to trace active ammonia oxidizers incorporating 13c substrate as revealed by dna sip assays in previous studies it seems that the functional activity of aoms in nitrification may not be always positive with their numerical relationships pan et al 2018 found that aob dominate active ammonia oxidation in a wwtp even though their initial abundance is lower than that of aoa niu et al 2013 confirmed the more important role of aoa in nitrification in dwtps despite the numerical dominance of aob in contrast the functional dominance in nitrification by the numerical dominant aoms has been reported in wwtps gao et al 2016 and acidic soils zhang et al 2012 in addition no information can be available about the functional activity and relative contribution of comammox nitrospira to nitrification in wwtps to better understand the microbial mechanisms of nitrification in wwtps in cold season in depth investigations are urgently needed to explore the correlations between numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers and their relative contribution to nitrification the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the numerical relationships of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira and 2 explore whether numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers were responsible for their nitrification activity in municipal wwtps in cold season in this study 23 wwtps from china were sampled in february to investigate the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira using quantitative real time pcr qpcr then three wwtps with different numerical relationships of aoms were typically selected to subject time course dna sip incubation to trace the active ammonia oxidizers and evaluate their relative contribution to ammonia oxidation further high throughput sequencing and network analysis were performed to identify the active aoms and their potential interactions respectively 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection activated sludge was taken from 23 municipal wwtps in seven provinces across china in february 2016 four technological configurations were covered including oxidation ditch 13 wwtps sequencing batch reactor four wwtps anaerobic anoxic aerobic five wwtps and biological aerated filter one wwtp details of the description of these wwtps sewage characteristics and operation parameters were given in table 1 all the activated sludge flocs were sampled in triplicate from different positions at the end of aeration tanks and then mixed together after briefly settling sludge sample was kept in the ice box and transported to laboratory immediately a part of activated sludge was freeze dried by labconco freezone 1 l labconco usa for dna extraction and the others was stored at 4 c until further analyses 2 2 dna sip incubation based on the numerical relationships between aoa and aob the activated sludge samples from three wwtps located in the same city w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od represent for aoa aob aoa aob and aoa aob respectively were typically selected to perform dna sip incubation to explore the active aoms in municipal wwtps in cold season each activated sludge was subjected to pre incubation to exhaust the residual substrates in supernatant then the wet sludge was transferred to serum bottle to carry out dna sip incubation with 200 ml synthetic wastewater synthetic wastewater was prepared as described by pan et al 2018 the ammonium concentration mlss temperature ph and do of each microcosm were as in situ conditions details were given in table 2 in addition equivalent nah12co3 or nah13co3 was added into microcosms as sole carbon source of control or labeled treatments respectively the time course incubation was applied in order to label active aoms with suitable and shorter incubation time the incubation cycles were ten and 20 for w1 od and w8 sbr while they were ten 20 and 30 for w23 od all the treatments were set up in duplicate in total 28 microcosms were set up and all of them were incubated in dark and shaken at 100 rpm the concentration of ammonium was monitored in the supernatant every 30 min during dna sip incubation if ammonium was completely degraded one cycle incubation was ended the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the influent and effluent were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 at the end of incubation microcosms were harvested and freeze dried after remove of supernatant 2 3 dna extraction isopycnic centrifugation and gradient fractionation 0 05 0 10 g dry sludge was applied to extract dna using fastdna spin kit for soil qiagen usa dna from the duplicate microcosms was pooled together and the concentration was measured using nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 1000 thermo fisher scientific usa then cscl density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed as described by previous study neufeld et al 2007 briefly for each treatment 5 μg of total dna was mixed with cscl stock solution and gb buffer to form an initial density of 1 725 g ml determined by ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert usa after thorough mixing the gradient mediums were loaded into 5 1 ml polyallomer quick seal centrifuge tubes beckman coulter usa and then ultracentrifugation was proceeded with the centrifuge tubes in a nvt100 vertical rotor in optima xe 100 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter usa at 45000 rpm for 44 h at 20 c the gradient medium was fractionated into 12 aliquots using a syringe pump to deliver sterile water into the top of ultracentrifuge tube and fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube the buoyant density of each fraction was measured by ar200 digital hand held refractometer reichert usa after that dna was precipitated from fractions by adding two volumes of peg 6000 solution at room temperature overnight after washing by 70 ethanol dna was dissolved in 30 μl te buffer 2 4 qpcr assays qpcr was applied to measure the abundance of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in total genomic dna and fractionated dna using mx3005p thermocycler agilent technologies usa for quantification of aoa and aob archaeal amoa gene and bacterial amoa gene were targeted for comammox nitrospira primers special for candidatus nitrospira inopinata amoa gene were selected to perform quantification assays in addition the abundance of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was also determined across the entire buoyant density gradients the reactions were performed in 20 μl mixture containing 10 μl gotaq qpcr master mix promega usa 0 2 μm of each specific primer and 2 μl of template dna all the primer sets and protocols were summarized in table s1 to construct standard curves the plasmids containing target gene were taken in 10 fold serial dilution from 108 to 101 copies all the standard dna and test samples were run in triplicate the correlation coefficients and amplification efficiencies were in range of 0 995 0 999 and 95 3 99 0 respectively 2 5 miseq sequencing and bioinformation analyses dna retrieved from fractions 2 5 of each 13c amanded microcosm after isopycnic centrifugation was pooled as heavy dna sample heavy dna and total genomic dna of their seed samples without incubation were subjected to miseq high throughput sequencing targeting v3 v4 regions of archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna gene the details of primers and protocols were given in table s1 pcr amplication of each sample was carried out in triplicate after purified by a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen germany the positive pcr products were pooled and quantified by a quantifluortm st promega usa and then normalized to equimolar amounts finally dna was sequenced on illumina miseq pe300 sequencer illumina usa in allwegene technology co ltd beijing china all the raw sequences obtained have been submitted to sequence read archive sra database and can be found with accession number of srp148631 after sequencing fast length adjustment of short reads flash program magoc and salzberg 2011 was conducted to assemble the paired end reads based on the overlap more than 10 bp then the merged reads were subjected to further analyses using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline caporaso et al 2011 briefly primer barcodes chimera and low quality reads were checked and removed for the quality control followed by normalization with the minimum number of the reads in the test samples next the clean reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity using uclust algorithm then the taxonomy assignment of otus was performed using rdp classifier with silva database alpha diversity was calculated including chao 1 good coverage observed species and shannon index the representative sequences of otus affiliated with aoa aob and nob were extracted at genus level in order to further reveal aoa and aob communities at species level local blast program was conducted to align the representative sequences to the sub database of aoa and aob as reported by pan et al 2018 for the further taxonomy assignment of the otus of nob mega 7 0 was used to construct a neighbor joining nj phylogenetic tree with representative sequences and reference sequences after trimmed bootstrap approach 1000 replicates was performed to test the reliability of the nj tree one way analysis of variance anova was performed to test the variances of the numerical relationships of aoa and aob between different groups of wwtps the statistical significance will be confirmed with p value 0 05 spearmans rank correlation coefficient srcc was applied to estimate the relationships between environmental factors with the abundance of aoms and to explore the associations between the active aoms recovered from w23 od then network analysis was carried out to show the interactions of active communities with statistical robustness if p value was less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 quantification of aoms in 23 wwtps qpcr was performed to quantify the abundance of amoa gene of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira in 23 wwtps as shown in fig 1 the abundance of aoa varied from 2 42 107 w4 od to 2 47 109 w18 od copies g sludge averaged at 3 25 108 copies g sludge for aob the copy numbers of amoa gene were in the range of 5 54 106 w23 od to 3 31 109 w3 od copies g sludge averaged at 7 57 108 copies g sludge the copy numbers of amoa gene of ca nsp inopinata a species of comammox nitrospira were successfully quantified in all 23 wwtps the abundance of ca nsp inopinata was stable in the test wwtps which averaged at 8 47 106 copies g sludge the successful quantification of ca nsp inopinata provided evidences that comammox nitrospira were widespread in wwtps in cold season in most of the test wwtps the abundance of ca nsp inopinata was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of aoa and aob so 23 wwtps were divided into three groups based on the ratios of aoa to aob group ⅰ ratio 0 1 group ⅱ 0 1 ratio 10 and group ⅲ 10 ratio anova further confirmed the significant differences of numerical relationships of aoa and aob between different groups that p values of group ⅰ vs group ⅱ group ⅰ vs group ⅲ and group ⅱ vs group ⅲ were 0 04 0 00 and 0 00 respectively four wwtps were included in group ⅰ that the ratios of aoa to aob were in the range of 0 03 0 08 in group ⅱ 18 wwtps where the ratios of aoa to aob were within one order of magnitude the significantly numerical dominance of aoa over aob was only found in w23 od with the ratio of aoa to aob of 57 65 in order to explore the correlations between numerical relationships of aoms and their relative contribution to nitrification in wwtps w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od were typically selected to perform dna sip assays standing for group ⅰ group ⅱ and group ⅲ respectively 3 2 nitrification activity of dna sip microcosms in order to assess nitrification activity during dna sip incubation the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were determined in the influent and effluent of each cycle as shown in fig 2 ammonium was almost depleted in the effluent of each treatment the averaged removal rates of ammonium were 96 90 96 12 and 90 60 in w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od respectively most of the degraded ammonium was converted into nitrate while nitrite in effluent was stable with low concentration the dynamics of ammonium nitrite and nitrate during a typical incubation cycle were demonstrated in fig s1 these results demonstrated that all microcosms can achieve high nitrification activity during dna sip incubation 3 3 quantification of nitrifying communities across entire buoyant density fractions cscl density gradient centrifugation was performed to separate labeled dna from native dna of microcosms followed by quantification of amoa gene of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira across the entire buoyant density fractions as the failure of quantification of comammox nitrospira in fractionated dna the abundance of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was determined as an alternative as shown in fig 3 a c a small amount of aoa amoa gene was detected in the heavy dna fractions from 13c microcosms of w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od with the shortest incubation cycles despite their initial abundance in seed samples as increasing incubation time more and more aoa amoa gene was labeled and the peaks of aoa abundance obviously shifted toward heavy dna fractions especially in 13c microcosm of w23 od 30 the majority of aoa amoa gene was observed in the heavy layers while in control microcosm aoa abundance peaked in the light dna fractions in contrast the highest copy number of aob amoa gene was retrieved in the light dna fractions with buoyant density of approximately 1 70 g ml regardless of control or labeled microcosms fig 3d f labeling aob amoa gene cannot be detected in the 13c microcosms of w1 od and w8 sbr where aob abundance was higher than and equivalent to that of aoa respectively whereas aob amoa gene was only observed with low relative abundance in the heavy layers from 13c microcosms of w23 od that harbored lower abundance of aob than that of aoa these results suggest that aoa predominate ammonia oxidation in all the test wwtps while aob act as minor ammonia oxidizers just in w23 od similar to aob a small amount of nitrospira 16s rrna gene was labeled and made the existence in the heavy dna fractions from 13c microcosms of w23 od whereas in other microcosms the abundance of nitrospira only peaked in the light dna fractions fig 3g i 3 4 community composition of active nitrifying microorganisms in order to assess the active nitrifying communities heavy dna from 13c microcosms together with the total genomic dna from seed samples of w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od was subjected to high throughput sequencing targeting archaeal 16s rrna gene based on the results of quantification of aob and nitrospira the heavy dna and seed sample dna of w23 od were conducted to sequence bacterial 16s rrna gene the results of sequencing were summarized in table s2 in total 687682 and 156540 effective reads were obtained targeting archaeal and bacterial 16s rrna gene respectively in order to identify the active nitrifying phylotypes the sequences assigned to aoa aob and nob at genus level were retrieved for the further analyses 3 4 1 identification of active aoa and aob as shown in fig 4 a 4165 sequences affiliated with aoa were identified proliferation of aoa 16s rrna gene was found that the sequence abundance in heavy dna was positive with incubation time for aob a total of 84 sequences were retrieved fig 4b compared with aoa the less aob sequence abundance further supported the results of quantification of aoa and aob in density fractions the communities of active aoa and aob at species level were shown in fig 4c and d respectively for aoa all the sequences retrieved were exclusively related to genus nitrososphaera and divided into three species including candidatus nitrososphaera gargensis nitrososphaera sp jg1 and nitrososphaera viennensis among them np viennensis was the predominant aoa regardless of seed samples or heavy dna samples 83 84 99 84 and 85 76 of the labeled aoa 16s rrna gene were affiliated with np viennensis in w1 od 20 h the heavy dna of w1 od 20 w8 sbr 20 h and w23 od 30 h respectively the sequences belonged to ca np gargensis and np sp jg1 were also detected in heavy dna indicating their functional roles during active nitrification even though they just accounted for a minority of total aoa sequences for aob three species nitrosomonas europaea nitrosomonas nitrosa and nitrosomonas oligotropha related to genus nitrosomonas were detected nm oligotropha dominated aob both in seed sample and in heavy dna samples although nm europaea cannot be found in seed sample resulting from the low abundance the existence in heavy dna provided the evidence of its nitrification activity after dna sip incubation nm nitrosa disappeared in heavy dna suggesting that nm nitrosa may not be the active aob in this study 3 4 2 identification of active comammox nitrospira as demonstrated in fig 5 a 836 and 1085 sequences of nob 16s rrna gene were retrieved from seed sample and heavy dna samples of w23 od respectively based on 97 similarity all these sequences were divided into ten otus and their representative sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis shown in fig 5b most nob 16s rrna gene sequences were clustered into genus nitrospira as well known ca nsp inopinata ca nsp nitrosa and ca nsp nitrificans were the three strains of comammox nitrospira otu1403 as well as otu1874 and otu729 was phylogenetically related to comammox nitrospira strains that they closely clustered into a unique clade besides otu1613 also showed high identification with ca nsp inopinata 98 ca nsp nitrosa 97 and ca nsp nitrificans 97 based on the results of blast against with 16s rrna gene sequences of these comammox nitrospira strains taken together these four otus otu1403 otu1874 otu729 and otu1613 were related to comammox nitrospira fig 5c shows the relative abundance of comammox nitrospira to total nob phylotypes in seed sample and heavy dna samples as demonstrated in fig 5c the active nob were dominated by comammox nitrospira in heavy dna samples with the relative abundance of 87 10 88 04 and 72 59 in w23 od 10 h w23 od 20 h and w23 od 30 h respectively indicating that comammox nitrospira were functional in assimilating 13c substrate during active nitrification 3 5 potential interactions between active nitrifying communities network analysis was performed to further explore the potential interactions between the active nitrifying communities including aoa aob comammox nitrospira and canonical nob as these four functional guilds co occurred and functionally assimilated 13c substrate in the labeled microcosms derived from w23 od treatment as shown in fig 6 all the phylotypes were divided into eight clusters based on their connections most of the interactions of phylotypes were positive the connections of phylotypes affiliated with aoa dominated the interactions between active nitrifying communities 21 out of 33 nodes and 47 out of 52 edges the more frequent interactions within aoa guild rather than between different guilds can be found such as cluster i and iii aob phylotypes of otu1886 and otu 1923 were significantly in positive interactions with aoa phylotypes of otu263 otu414 otu544 and otu1859 cluster ii otu729 and otu1403 which fell into comammox nitrospira guild positively correlated with the phylotypes affiliated with aoa and aob in contrast the phylotypes belonged to canonical nob made less correlations with other phylotypes in the microcosms these results of network analysis also demonstrated the important role of aoa within active nitrifying communities 4 discussion quantification analyses showed that aoa aob and comammox nitrospira widely co occurred in municipal wwtps in cold season the abundance of aoa in this study varied from 2 42 107 to 2 47 109 copies g sludge which was lower than that in two wwtps from usa roy et al 2017 and higher than that in a wwtp with three separate processes from china in winter pan et al 2018 with respect to aob the copy numbers were in the range of 5 54 106 to 3 31 109 copies g sludge which were similar to that reported by roy et al 2017 but lower than that reported by zhang et al 2015 in cold season majority of the test samples 18 out of 23 harbored approximately equivalent abundance of aoa and aob amoa gene in four wwtps the abundance of aob was one order of magnitude higher than that of aoa which was similar to the results reported by fan et al 2017 just in one wwtp w23 od the abundance of aoa was 56 65 times higher than that of aob which was in consistent with the results obtained in three wwtps kayee et al 2011 srcc analysis was performed to further investigate the correlations between environmental factors and the abundance of aoa and aob and the ratios of aoa to aob the results showed that ph value in wwtps was significantly negative with the abundance of aoa p 0 01 given in table s3 which was similar to that reported in a biological aerated filter process chen et al 2017a ph value was reported as the most important driver of aoa community structure gubry rangin et al 2011 nicol et al 2008 found that the abundance and transcript of aoa amoa gene increase with the decreasing ph value it seems that aoa may prefer to relatively lower ph condition whereas few environmental factors measured in this study could be responsible for the differentiations of aob abundance and the ratios of aoa to aob in wwtps shown in table s3 until now the components affecting the abundance of aoa and aob in wwtps are still in debate many physicochemical and operational parameters are thought as the key factors towards aoa and aob abundance in different studies such as temperature wells et al 2009 and ammonium removal kayee et al 2011 the factors causing the numerical variations of aoa and aob are still needed further investigation the abundance of ca nsp inopinata an important group of comammox nitrospira clade a was successful quantified in all 23 wwtps these results further confirmed the wide distribution of comammox nitrospira in wwtps in cold season the copy numbers of ca nsp inopinata was stable and kept around at 107 copies g sludge about 101 copies ng dna in 23 wwtps which was higher than that reported by fan et al 2017 pjevac et al 2017 found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a is 5 1 102 copies ng dna which is higher than that obtained in this study comammox nitrospira are also abundant in many environmental habitats the abundance of comammox nitrospira is 107 109 copies g sand in dwtps fowler et al 2018 and about 108 copies g biofilter sand in freshwater recirculating aquaculture system bartelme et al 2017 hu and he 2017 found that abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a and b is around 107 copies g soil which is significantly higher than that of aoa in acidic forest soils and aob in both acidic and alkaline forest soils it seems that ph may be a key factor affecting the numerical patterns of comammox nitrispira and other ammonia oxidizers however no significant correlations between ph value and the abundance of ca nsp inopinata have been recognized by srcc analysis given in table s3 these results indicated that comammox nitrispira may adapt to certain ph regimens in wwtps as the newly discovered ammonia oxidizers comammox nitrospira have not been subjected to well study of their responses to different environmental factors more efforts should be taken in the future studies to reveal the effects of environmental factors on the abundance of comammox nitrospira we found that there was tn loss during dna sip incubation averaged at 49 76 40 56 and 50 31 for w1 od w8 sbr and w23 od respectively summarized in table s4 tn loss during aerobic nitrification has been reported in previous study that 40 of tn is removed in an autotrophic nitrification denitrification system which is suspected to be mediated by ammonia oxidizers kuai and verstraete 1998 since gaseous nitrogen produced by aob just accounts for 2 3 3 8 of oxidized nh4 n at aerobic condition in nitrifying activated sludge wunderlin et al 2012 it seems that aob cannot be solely responsible for whole tn loss during dna sip incubation in this study in addition aerobic condition was maintained and no organic carbon was added during dna sip incubation which provided bad conditions for anammox and denitrifiers survival the ability of gaseous nitrogen production by aoa has been confirmed in ocean santoro et al 2011 and pure culture löscher et al 2012 as the most predominant active ammonia oxidizers aoa are suspected to contribute most to tn loss with some yet unknown pathways during dna sip incubation noted that either nh4 n is converted to no3 n or gaseous nitrogen the process of oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n is inevitable which is mediated by ammonia oxidizers tn loss cannot affect the results that aoa assimilated considerable 13c substrate during active nitrification three wwtps were typically selected to perform time course dna sip incubation to investigate the effects of numerical relationships of ammonia oxidizers on their relative contribution to nitrification in cold season dna sip assays identified that aoa were the dominant active aoms in all test wwtps while aob and comammox nitrospira were minor ammonia oxidizers in w23 od regardless of whether aoa were the numerically dominant ammonia oxidizers in the seed samples or not as well known dna sip relies on the assimilation of labeled substrate and cell proliferation the maximum specific growth rate of aoa is far lower than that of aob chen et al 2017b könneke et al 2005 prosser 1990 tourna et al 2011 whereas considerable 13c substrate assimilation by aoa rather than aob can be detected in all microcosms during active nitrification indicating that it was aoa that undoubtedly dominated ammonia oxidation during dna sip incubation the results obtained suggest that the numerical dominance of aoms may not directly correlate with their contribution to ammonia oxidation similar result has been reported in dwtps that aob outnumber aoa but the ammonia oxidation is mostly mediated by aoa niu et al 2013 and in wwtps reported by muβmann et al 2011 and pan et al 2018 aoa are the most abundant ammonia oxidizers while aob are responsible for the in situ ammonia oxidation whereas gao et al 2016 found that aob outnumber aoa and aob play more important role than aoa during active nitrification in a wwtp it seems that the niche differentiation may contribute to the distinction of the phylogeny and physiology of aoa and aob sauder et al 2017 showed that different growth conditions can elicit different physiological responses and niche partitioning in this study the low temperature in wwtps in cold season may affect the activity and communities of aoa and aob horak et al 2013 fount that little variations of ammonia oxidation activity of aoa can be detected with the changing temperature from 8 to 20 c as aoa were detected in different environments at low temperature alves et al 2013 santoro and casciotti 2011 they may be tolerant to a wide range of temperature and keep their activity and communities stable in contrast the nitrification activity of aob sharply drops when the temperature decreases from 30 to 10 c grunditz and dalhammar 2001 kim et al 2008 moreover few seasonal variations of aoa and aob abundance can be found in wwtps pan et al 2018 roy et al 2017 wells et al 2009 it seems that temperature may regulate the nitrification activity of aoa and aob rather than their abundance the results obtained call into the question that why can aob maintain their substantial abundance in wwtps in cold season if they are not active in ammonia oxidation previous studies hoefman et al 2012 oliver 2005 found when exposed to some extreme environmental conditions such as low temperature bacteria could turn to viable but nonculturable vbnc state that they are still alive and keep very low levels of metabolic activity but stop growing it is possibly that aob may be in the vbnc state when they are exposed to the low temperature environment in wwtps in cold season and they can be revival when the environmental stress disappears until now it is poorly understood about community structure of comammox nitrospira and their relative contribution to nitrification in wwtps in this study the results of high throughput sequencing showed that more than 72 of total nob sequences from heavy dna samples were composed of comammox nitrospira indicating that comammox nitrospira could be active in performing complete ammonia oxidation in w23 od the active role of comammox nitrospira in nitrification of wwtps in cold season agreed with the results reported by gonzalez martinez et al 2016 that comammox nitrospira may be favored to low temperature as the common substrate for ammonia oxidizers ammonia may also be the key factor affecting the niche partitioning of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira kits et al 2017 found that the half saturation constants k m app of ca nsp inopinata for ammonia is 63 nm which is comparable with that of nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 strain of aoa lower than that of non marine aoa and 4 to 2500 fold lower than that of kinetically characterized aob moreover hu and he 2017 suggest that comammox nitrospira may be the strong competitors of aoa in the ammonia limited environments the exclusive detection of labeled 16s rrna gene of comammox nitrospira in w23 od a wwtp with the lowest ammonium concentration in this study indicated that comammox nitrospira could be active in nitrification and compete with aoa in wwtps with limited ammonium as revealed by high throughput sequencing np viennensis was the most dominant active aoa in wwtps in cold season np viennensis was enriched from a garden soil tourna et al 2011 and serves as a model organism for the investigation of aoa np viennensis is the key and active ammonia oxidizer making significant contribution to nitrogen removal in wwtps pan et al 2018 freshwater sediment wu et al 2013 and paddy soils wang et al 2015 in addition ca np gargensis and np sp jg1 were also detected as a minority of active aoa which were also confirmed as the active aoa in wwtps in warn season avrahami et al 2011 pan et al 2018 with respect of aob nm oligotropha and nm europaea were the active aob and made minor contribution to the ammonia oxidation in w23 od during incubation similarly avrahami et al 2011 also found that nm oligotropha and nm europaea dominate the active aob responsible for the nitrification of creek ecosystems at 13 c as the main active aob in agricultural soil jia and conrad 2009 the sequences belonged to genus nitrosospira cannot be detected both in seed sample and in heavy dna samples indicating that they may not be the active aob in wwtps in cold season 5 conclusions the co occurrence of aoa aob and comammox nitrospira was widely confirmed in 23 wwtps in cold season dna sip assays indicated that aoa dominated ammonia oxidation in wwtps in cold season while aob and comammox nitrospira just acted as minor active ammonia oxidizers the results obtained provided the evidences that the nitrification activity of aoms cannot be determined by their numerical relationships as the first discovered aoms aob were not always functional in nitrification in wwtps in addition comammox nitrospira were also active in a wwtp with limited ammonium where they may be strong competitors of aoa more efforts should be taken to further estimate the relative contribution of aoms to nitrification in wwtps and their response to the

19328,adsorbable organic halogen aox is a parameter conventionally used to indicate the sum of organic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps which are formed from the reactions of disinfectants with dissolved organic matter bromide and iodide in water to overcome the issues of the aox analytical method we proposed a new facile and green pretreatment method to enable the analysis of nonionic total organic halogen ntox via the following three steps 1 separation of ntox and halides with electrodialysis 2 conversion of ntox with ultraviolet uv photolysis and 3 analysis of halides with ion chromatography to verify this proposal we mainly evaluated the efficiency of vacuum ultraviolet vuv coupled with uv photolysis vuv uv in converting ntox into halides results showed that by applying vuv irradiation for 60 min and uv irradiation at ph 10 11 for another 30 min over 85 5 of each halide from 20 representative small molecular weight dbps each at 100 μg x l level was recovered the purpose of uv photolysis under alkaline conditions was to reduce oxyhalides such as bromate and iodate formed in the vuv process back to halides with the aid of electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry we captured the whole pictures of high molecular weight polar dbps in a chlorinated drinking water before and after vuv uv through which averagely 96 4 of dehalogenation with the vuv uv treatment was observed an illustrative comparison of the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method indicates that although the detected ntox was lower by 2 3 30 6 than aox the results of the two methods were highly correlated r2 0 97 all these hence verified the photolysis as a mature yet novel tool for sample pretreatment in environmental analytical chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps disinfection byproducts tox total organic halogen aox photolysis 1 introduction adsorbable organic halogen aox is a bulk surrogate parameter conventionally used to indicate the sum of halogenated organic disinfection byproducts dbps in disinfected waters pourmoghaddas and stevens 1995 because of the lack of alternative methods aox is usually regarded as total organic halogen tox although not currently regulated aox is important in quantifying both identified and unidentified halogenated dbps in drinking water and wastewater archer and singer 2006 for example a survey indicated that the portions of unknown dbps in eight chinese cities accounted for 28 93 of aox pan et al 2015 and the magnitude and speciation of dbps kept changing along disinfection time zhai and zhang 2011 li and mitch 2018 moreover thousands of organic halogenated compounds namely organohalogens have been detected in the environment gribble 2010 kinani et al 2016 wigilius et al 1988 meaning that aox exists not only in engineering water but also in natural environment meantime the toxicity of a disinfected water has been reported to positively correlate with its tox level savitz et al 2006 itoh et al 2011 pan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 han et al 2017 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2017 lv et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 thus in addition to identifying individual dbps such as regulated trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and emerging haloacetonitriles hans it is also necessary to measure tox since the aox analytical method was established it has been used for many types of waters including raw water lee et al 2010 tian et al 2013 groundwater drewes and jeke 1996 landfill leachate lei et al 2007 wastewater uğurlu and karaoğ lu 2009 gong et al 2016 and reused wastewater doederer et al 2014 drewes and jekel 1998 stepwisely the method for aox analysis involves three major steps that is 1 concentrating and separating aox from halides with activated carbon ac 2 converting aox into halides with combustion i e pyrolysis and 3 detecting halides with microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic echigo et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 although useful and robust some issues remain challenging for the aox method particularly in the pyrolysis process for example to provide a temperature of 1000 c for aox conversion a specially designed combustor is needed moreover the oxygen used for combustion can undesirably oxidize iodide to iodine or iodate which cannot be readily recovered or detected with ic thereby underestimating the quantity of total organic iodine toi langsa et al 2017 to fully recover halogens a proper selection of a gas absorbing solution is important langsa et al 2017 sayess and reckhow 2016 we herein proposed to analyze nonionic total organic halogen ntox in disinfected water by three new sequential steps that is 1 separating ntox and halides with electrodialysis ed 2 converting ntox into halides via ultraviolet uv photolysis and 3 measuring halides via ic following the first step of this proposal i e ed pretreatment this study mainly focused on evaluating the efficiency of photolysis in converting ntox into halides to achieve this goal the study addressed some issues encountered in the photoconversion process also the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method were compared in analyzing real water samples the selection of uv photolysis was based upon several considerations firstly uv and vacuum uv vuv technologies are known robust tools for degrading organic substances in water either in advanced oxidation process aop legrini et al 1993 or in advanced reduction process arp liu et al 2014 although most of existing studies focused on the degradation of parent compounds the recoveries of halides using uv or vuv have been reported only in several studies for example hua and reckhow 2006 reported that a combination of uv with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can mineralize 95 0 100 0 of selected dbps yielding halides and bicarbonate as the products reckhow et al 2007 in another study halogens in three thms including chcl2br chbr2cl and chbr3 were completely converted to halides by uv alone but chloroform chcl3 was found to be refractory to direct uv photolysis nicole et al 1991 recently complete dehalogenation for seven haas was also observed for photolysis of haas with monochloroacetic acid mcaa showing the slowest dehalogenation rate wang et al 2017b secondly vuv photolysis was once applied in tandem with liquid chromatography to analyze total organic carbon and total nitrogen lc toc tn suggesting that vuv can convert organic carbon and nitrogen into inorganic carbon and nitrogen completely in practice huber et al 2011 this application serves as an indicator of the robustness of vuv because carbon halogen c x except for c f bonds are usually weaker than c c and c n bonds wang et al 2017a cleavage of c x bonds and halide release are expected to be achievable thirdly although other transformation technologies such as fenton catalkaya and kargi 2007 uv persulfate oxidation chuang et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 laser photolysis jiang et al 2017b neutron activation reckhow et al 1990 and radiolysis pereira et al 2011 are more powerful than uv and vuv photolysis is preferred owing to its inexpensiveness ease of operation and without external ion introduction which can make it a promising pretreatment approach for later analysis using ic 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and chemicals for organic halogens a list of model dbp compounds with varying molecular weights mws and functional groups were obtained in powder forms 98 0 purity from aladdin and sigma aldrich inc for inorganic halogens four sodium halides were purchased at reagent grade from aladdin inc each dbp s stock solution was prepared individually in ultrapure water without using organic solvent so as to avoid the interference of solvent on the photolysis of target compound ultrapure water was generated using an ultrapure water generator direct q3 millipore a synthetic water sample was prepared with humic acid 3 0 mg l as c purchased from aladdin co nahco3 90 mg l as caco3 and kbr 2 0 mg l as br in ultrapure water the bromide level was chosen to simulate a sample with relatively high bromide concentration in some source water e g up to 4 13 mg l in australia magazinovic et al 2004 and to amplify the formation of brominated dbps chlorination of the synthetic water sample was performed by adding 5 0 mg l of naocl as cl2 after a contact time of 2 h in the dark at room temperature the chlorine residual in the sample was determined using the diethyl p phenylene diamine ferrous titrimetric method and quenched with sodium thiosulfate at 105 of the required stoichiometric amount several real water samples including a swimming pool water spw and two tap waters were collected in august september and december of 2017 in shenzhen china these samples were quenched with sodium sulfite na2so3 and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane xingya co ltd before analysis some water characteristics of these samples are provided in table s1 2 2 analytical methods the changes of fluoride chloride bromide iodide nitrate and sulfate were analyzed using an ic equipped with conductivity and uv detectors ic2010 tosoh inc japan according to epa method 300 0 the halogenated methanes hms hans chloral hydrate ch halophenols hps and haas were detected with a gas chromatograph pe580 perkinelmer america equipped with an electron capture detector according to epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 dissolved organic matter dom was determined by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan according to epa method 415 3 ph was determined by an electrode meter 8103bn thermofisher america aox was measured by the equipment described in an earlier study li et al 2010 in addition to small mw compounds a precursor ion scan pis of bromide m z 79 or 81 using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry esi tqms was used in this study as an effective and efficient method for detection of polar and high mw brominated dbps ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 because this method can detect almost all halogenated dbps without knowing their specific structures it has been successfully applied in disclosing the whole pictures of polar halogenated dbps in drinking waters sewage effluents and swimming pool waters yang and zhang 2016 the synthetic water sample aliquots for uv photolysis were pretreated by a method reported before zhang et al 2008 in brief 1 l of the aliquot was firstly adjusted to ph 0 5 using a 50 v v aqueous solution of sulfuric acid followed by addition of sodium sulfate to saturation then the aliquot was extracted with 100 ml of methyl tert butyl ether the upper layer was transferred to a 250 ml flat bottomed flask and then concentrated in a rotary evaporator to approximately 1 ml the concentrate was then mixed with 10 ml of acetonitrile and concentrated to achieve a final volume of 0 5 ml prior to pis analysis 0 5 ml of ultrapure water was added to the 0 5 ml solution and then the mixture was filtered with a 0 22 μm filter the pis analysis was carried out by using a triple quad 4500 uplc esi tqms system ab sciex concord ontario canada the sample injection volume was 5 μl the chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 8 μm waters the gradient eluent was made by methanol and water with the ratio of methanol water v v changing linearly from 5 95 to 90 10 in the first 8 0 min and then returning to 5 95 within 0 1 min followed by the column re equilibrating for 2 9 min the flowrate and column temperature were set at 0 4 ml min and 35 c respectively the ms data were acquired in the electrospray negative ion mode the ms parameters were optimized and set as follows ion spray voltage 4500 v ion source gas i 55 arbitrary unit ion source gas ii 55 arbitrary unit curtain gas 40 arbitrary unit heater temperature 550 c declustering potential 30 v and collision energy 30 v the parameters of entrance potential and collision cell exit potential were both set at 10 v for pis analysis 2 3 photoreactor and experimental procedures the photoreactor used in this study was similar in shape to an earlier study wang et al 2017a except that two types of low pressure mercury lamps were adopted the photoreactor was made of stainless steel strings with a quartz tube deployed in the middle while four uv lamps 11 w philips inc netherlands which emit 254 nm wavelength only and four vuv lamps 12 w uv tec co china which emit both 185 nm and 254 nm wavelengths were placed in parallel to encircle the quartz tube as shown in fig s1 the quartz tube was used as a water container 22 cm length 1 5 cm diameter and 30 ml volume and sealed by glass cap during irradiation the purpose of applying both uv and vuv lamps was described in the results and discussion section by using h2o2 as an actinometer zalazar et al 2007 the photon intensity and effective optical path length of the uv lamps were determined to be 88 mw cm2 and 2 72 cm respectively however because of the inherent complexity of reactions involved in the vuv process no study has been conducted to measure the light intensity and optical length of vuv lamps before zoschke et al 2014 therefore this study did not delve into the details of actinometry but focused on the feasibility of vuv photolysis for halogen recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis kinetics because earlier literature indicates that vuv is more powerful than uv in degrading organic compounds due to the production of hydroxyl radical a very strong oxidant zoschke et al 2014 we herein chose vuv as the key tool to release halides from organohalogens meanwhile because dbps feature varying properties and amounts in real water and the huge variability may influence the reaction rate dramatically westerhoff et al 1999 we decided to evaluate three typical refractory chlorinated species because chlorinated species are usually more resistant to degradation than brominated and iodinated species in addition given that the transformation of organohalogens in real water is likely more difficult than that in ultrapure water the efficiency of halide recovery was also tested on two real waters fig 1 shows the halide formation kinetics of three water solutions and two ed pretreated real waters by vuv irradiation the three water solutions each contained 100 μg cl l of trichlorophenol tcp ch or mcaa as seen although the samples exhibited different trends the recoveries of chloride kept increasing with time and ultimately reached 87 0 of dosed quantity for all the three water solutions specifically the recoveries of halides for ch and tcp were 87 3 and 94 2 respectively within 5 min while that of mcaa was 87 1 within 10 min the sums of inorganic and organic chlorine remained within 94 3 107 2 of initial chlorine data not shown meaning that the mass of chlorine was balanced and consequently no substantial amount of halogen was lost during the photolysis process based upon the literature mcaa was slower in reaction with hydroxyl radical than most of dbps chuang et al 2016 and it was the slowest among haas toward direct uv photolysis wang et al 2017b however the time required for complete mcaa conversion was just 20 min under this study s condition the enhanced efficiency was likely due to increased light dosage and the specialty of 185 nm light gonzalez et al 2004 as for real samples it took 1 2 h to achieve steady halide recoveries suggesting that certain compounds in water might retard the dehalogenation process accordingly we hereafter applied 60 min irradiation time in following studies 3 2 reduction of oxyhalides ideally samples pretreated with ed should not contain significant amount of halides and upon irradiation the appearance of halides in water is only derived from organohalogens however in the case of incomplete removal of halides by ed ntox can be quantified as the difference between total halides measured before and after photolysis meanwhile there is another possibility that certain halides e g bromide and iodide may be oxidized by hydroxyl radical von gunten 2003 to form organohalogens or oxyhalides e g bromate or iodate in fact certain studies even reported that hydroxyl radicals may react with chloride to form inorganic chlorine derivatives e g cloh and cl2 jayson et al 1973 and chlorine radical cl yu and barker 2012 the following experiments were designed to determine the side effects of vuv irradiation on halides transformation and to optimize the dehalogenation process fig 2 a shows the recoveries of chloride bromide and iodide irradiated with vuv at different initial concentrations for chloride 99 5 was remained regardless of concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l suggesting that chloride was not readily converted to other halogen species under this study s condition for bromide varying fractions yet fixed amounts i e 45 3 49 0 μg l of bromide were lost during vuv irradiation meaning that certain levels of bromide were transformed to other bromine containing species in comparison almost all iodide became undetectable for initial iodide concentrations below 200 μg l indicating that iodide was easily converted to other forms under vuv irradiation and optimization was vitally needed to improve the iodide recovery to minimize the losses of bromide and iodide we adjusted the samples to ph 10 11 using sodium hydroxide after vuv photolysis and applied uv photolysis irradiation for another 30 min the purpose was to reduce oxidized halogens back to halides following a previous study zhang et al 2016 the uv irradiation at alkaline condition was applied to form a reductive environment siddiqui et al 1996 fig 2b shows the results that the samples with a basic uv irradiation recovered almost all bromide and iodide 87 8 hence the results justified the sequential use of vuv dehalogenation and uv reduction in maximizing the recoveries of halides as for concerns about the potential formation of organic halogenated compounds because the water volume used was limited 30 ml while the uv dosage imposed was unlimited a complete dehalogenation or mineralization might not be difficult even if a sample was irradiated for 10 h with eight 12 w lamps together the expense was only 0 60 rmb 0 10 usd which is affordable for most of laboratories globally in fact even sunlight can recover a portion of halides from halogenated dbps in the absence of chlorine liu et al 2017 3 3 halide recovery for small mw compounds to provide more evidence for the vuv conversion method the method was applied to several groups of halogenated dbps under optimized operational conditions fig 3 shows the recoveries of twenty halogenated compounds with various halogenation types and degrees mws and functional groups the results showed that the vuv uv photolysis process achieved 85 5 halide recovery for all compounds with each spiked at 100 μg x l notably chloroform as a photo resistant compound nicole et al 1991 was dehalogenated by 91 0 thus demonstrating the robustness of vuv uv method 3 4 influencing factors to evaluate the method applicability we examined several influencing factors including dbp initial concentration ph and typical coexisting compounds on the halide recovery tcp tribromophenol tbp and monoiodophenol mip were chosen as the model dbps because they are also reference compounds used in conventional aox method fig 4 a shows the recoveries of halides for three compounds at two concentration levels as seen the halide recoveries achieved 100 1 107 6 for tcp and tbp but decreased from 99 0 at 0 2 mg i l to 87 8 at 1 mg i l for mip suggesting that iodinated dbps are more difficult to recover than chlorinated and brominated dbps at higher concentrations given that the concentrations of iodide and iodinated organic compounds in most waters were less than 212 μg l moran et al 2002 this inefficiency might not substantially affect the performance of the vuv uv method in recovering iodide from iodinated dbps water ph is another important factor for aop and arp during vuv photolysis because at high ph the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals can be suppressed by hydroxide kutschera et al 2009 therefore the halide recoveries at five different ph values were determined fig 4b the results showed that the halide recoveries ranged from 98 2 to 103 7 for tcp and tbp at all ph conditions 7 12 but the iodide recoveries ranged from 87 8 to 95 0 and increased with increasing ph suggesting that the loss of iodine was mainly caused by oxidation instead of incomplete conversion of organoiodine although transformation of organic compounds may decrease with rising ph ratpukdi et al 2010 this study achieved almost complete dehalogenation for all target compounds certain ions in water may retard or facilitate photolysis for example carbonate and bicarbonate are known to quench hydroxyl radicals while nitrate may compete directly with dbps for uv and vuv lights kutschera et al 2009 zoschke et al 2014 therefore we examined the influences of several typical compounds including carbonate nitrate bromide and humic acids on the halide recovery fig 4c shows that in the presence of humic substance hs carbonate or bromide at 10 mg l level the halide recoveries from tcp and tbp always achieved 92 1 105 7 only for the sample dosed with 10 mg l nitrate did the chloride recovery from tcp decrease slightly from 99 5 to 91 8 suggesting that nitrate was an inhibitor for dehalogenation of chlorinated dbps as for mip the recovery of iodide ranged from 86 2 to 92 2 in the presence of these anions and hs it should be noted that iodate is occasionally the dominant iodine species in chlorinated or ozonated samples zhang et al 2016 since uv used in this study could reduce iodate to iodide which was then measured as ntox the nonionic total organic iodine ntoi was likely overestimated however it should be reminded that prior to vuv photolysis most coexisting ions has been substantially or completely removed with preceding ed process therefore even iodate is present in raw water its influence is unlikely to be significant after ed pretreatment which means that ed and vuv are an attractive combination to pretreat water samples 3 5 halogen recovery for high mw compounds the pis spectra of the chlorinated synthetic sample with and without vuv uv photolysis are shown in fig 5 according to fig 5a and b ion pairs detected by piss of m z 79 and 81 in the sample mainly include m z 127 129 129 131 149 151 161 163 165 163 165 167 171 173 173 175 193 195 205 207 209 207 209 211 215 217 217 219 275 277 279 277 279 281 293 295 295 297 319 321 323 321 323 325 and 391 393 395 393 395 397 as listed in table s2 the pairs at m z 127 129 129 131 149 151 161 163 165 163 165 167 171 173 173 175 193 195 205 207 209 207 209 211 215 217 217 219 and 293 295 295 297 can be ascribed to previously reported dbps i e bromochloroacetic acid decarboxylated bromopropanoic acid bromodichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid decarboxylated 2 bromo 2 butenedioic acid dichlorobromoacetic acid dibromoacetic acid and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromo salicylic acid respectively pan and zhang 2013a zhai and zhang 2011 zhang et al 2008 other major ion pairs might be new and unknown dbps fig 5c shows the ions ion clusters detected by pis m z 79 in the chlorinated synthetic sample after photolysis although responses for different brominated dbps were not identical during pis analysis the intensity of a specific brominated compound should be positively related with its concentration with the same sample matrix and under the same instrumental condition compared with the data without uv photolysis all representative ion intensities shown in pis m z 79 of the sample with photolysis decreased dramatically by 95 6 99 3 in addition the sum of ion intensities within the range of m z 100 500 in pis m z 79 was calculated to obtain total ion intensity tii according to a previous study liu et al 2015 the intensities of ions with m z 500 were not counted because they were quite low in general the tii level in the original chlorinated synthetic sample was 2 07 106 and it was reduced to 7 42 104 after uv photolysis table s2 the remarkable reduction of tii by 96 4 indicates that most polar organic halogenated compounds have been converted to inorganic halogens by photolysis and the trend was consistent with the observations obtained from model compounds as aforementioned interestingly pan and colleagues once reported that the tii values of drinking water samples collected from representative cities in china were highly correlated r2 0 98 with the corresponding tox concentrations pan et al 2015 liu and colleagues found that tii tox and developmental toxicity of real tap water displayed identical trends during boiling liu et al 2015 hence the pis data suggested that the overall halogenated dbps formed in the chlorinated synthetic water sample were completely dehalogenated during vuv uv photolysis 3 6 halide detection with ic after ed separation and uv conversion the next challenge for ntox analysis is to achieve method detection limits mdls as low as possible e g at sub μg l or ng l levels however although chloride and bromide can be readily detected with ic using conductivity detector iodide at near μg l level is difficult to be detected because iodide has a longer retention time in ic column yet lower signal for conductivity detector than chloride and bromide in earlier studies advanced systems like uplc esi ms pan and zhang 2013b and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms sayess and reckhow 2016 have been employed to achieve 5 μg l mdl for iodide measurement however those instruments are very expensive and less accessible for most of researchers therefore we integrated a uv detector spd 20av shimadzu japan with dual wavelengths into the ic system for iodide analysis eventually the method reached a mdl of 4 μg i l for iodide although the mdl is still higher than the quantity of organic iodine in most water samples those photolyzed water may be concentrated with rotary evaporation freeze drying or other non chemical concentration methods in the laboratory to enable even lower mdl of iodide by ic analysis according to the us environmental protection agency usepa standard procedure usepa 2000 we estimated the mdls of the proposed method for nonionic total organic chlorine bromine and iodine ntocl ntobr and ntoi because ed and uv photolysis are essentially pretreatment methods the mdls of ntocl ntobr and ntoi are equivalent to the mdls of halides in ic which are 7 μg cl l 11 μg br l and 4 μg i l respectively take one example a calibration curve was built over a range of ntocl from 20 to 200 μg cl l with a fixed ratio of halide to ntox 30 1 the results showed a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 fig s2 with relative standard deviations rsds 9 3 suggesting a satisfactory precision of this method 3 7 comparison of methods despite the huge mechanistic difference a comparison of proposed ntox method and conventional aox method is needed table 1 shows their analytical data for model compounds and real samples for the six tested model compounds the recoveries by ntox method ranged from 80 0 to 115 8 except for trichloroacetic acid similar to the recoveries by conventional aox method 78 2 122 0 of all model compounds the recovery of tcm with aox method was lower than that with ntox method likely attributed to its high volatility that caused loss of tcm during sample transfer process and adsorption process in contrast tcp was better recovered by aox method 102 0 than that by ntox method 80 0 which was likely due to its high hydrophobicity and strong adsorption potential as for real water samples because the exact quantities of halogenated compounds were unknown we compared the two analytical methods by diluting the samples fig 6 indicates that the results of both ntox and aox methods from raw and diluted samples can be well correlated to the sample dilution factors r2 0 97 however the amounts of ntocl were averagely 30 6 23 6 and 13 7 lower than aocl for tap water swimming pool water and chlorinated synthetic water respectively similarly the results of ntobr were averagely 30 1 and 2 3 lower than aobr for tap and chlorinated synthetic waters respectively the discrepancies are likely attributed to the losses of ionic compounds such as haas during the ed process under this study s condition the samples with lower organic halogen contents exhibited larger gaps between the two methods suggesting that the ntox method is suitable for samples with high levels of organic halogens 4 conclusions in general this study proposed and verified a new method for detecting ntox in water by converting ntox into halides via photolysis pretreatment by applying vuv photolysis for 60 min and uv photolysis at an alkaline condition for another 30 min we overcame the problem of formation of oxyhalides overall this study achieved 85 5 halogen recoveries for 20 small mw model compounds and in average 96 4 for high mw polar compounds the initial concentrations of organic halogenated compounds ph humic substance and coexisting compounds showed limited influence on the halide recoveries a comparison of the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method demonstrated that they generated comparable results with good precision hence all these demonstrate that the novel use of photolysis which is a mature technology in water treatment industry may be considered as a facile and green tool for environmental sample pretreatment in retrospective we recognize that the greatest challenge of this new method for ntox measurement is the improvement and optimization of tox recovery during the ed process although this study has provided evidence and classic literature may theoretically justify the method based on molecular size and charge analyses too more analysis of real samples by more researchers are necessary in the future to verify the feasibility and application scope of the present method in future studies we plan to further improve the proposed method in many ways such as enhancing the photolysis efficiency to allow more rapid conversion of organic halogen species evaluating the applicability of the proposed method in more complicated samples automating and commercializing the method and replacing ic with ion selective electrodes to allow convenient measurement of halides it is worth mentioning that the ntox method enabled by the ed uv ic combination is able to analyze not only organohalogens but also other organic elements such as nitrogen zhu et al 2015 sulfur and phosphorous accordingly this method may open a door for future studies dealing with organic compounds containing multiple types of elements such as nitrogenous

19328,adsorbable organic halogen aox is a parameter conventionally used to indicate the sum of organic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps which are formed from the reactions of disinfectants with dissolved organic matter bromide and iodide in water to overcome the issues of the aox analytical method we proposed a new facile and green pretreatment method to enable the analysis of nonionic total organic halogen ntox via the following three steps 1 separation of ntox and halides with electrodialysis 2 conversion of ntox with ultraviolet uv photolysis and 3 analysis of halides with ion chromatography to verify this proposal we mainly evaluated the efficiency of vacuum ultraviolet vuv coupled with uv photolysis vuv uv in converting ntox into halides results showed that by applying vuv irradiation for 60 min and uv irradiation at ph 10 11 for another 30 min over 85 5 of each halide from 20 representative small molecular weight dbps each at 100 μg x l level was recovered the purpose of uv photolysis under alkaline conditions was to reduce oxyhalides such as bromate and iodate formed in the vuv process back to halides with the aid of electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry we captured the whole pictures of high molecular weight polar dbps in a chlorinated drinking water before and after vuv uv through which averagely 96 4 of dehalogenation with the vuv uv treatment was observed an illustrative comparison of the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method indicates that although the detected ntox was lower by 2 3 30 6 than aox the results of the two methods were highly correlated r2 0 97 all these hence verified the photolysis as a mature yet novel tool for sample pretreatment in environmental analytical chemistry graphical abstract image 1 keywords dbps disinfection byproducts tox total organic halogen aox photolysis 1 introduction adsorbable organic halogen aox is a bulk surrogate parameter conventionally used to indicate the sum of halogenated organic disinfection byproducts dbps in disinfected waters pourmoghaddas and stevens 1995 because of the lack of alternative methods aox is usually regarded as total organic halogen tox although not currently regulated aox is important in quantifying both identified and unidentified halogenated dbps in drinking water and wastewater archer and singer 2006 for example a survey indicated that the portions of unknown dbps in eight chinese cities accounted for 28 93 of aox pan et al 2015 and the magnitude and speciation of dbps kept changing along disinfection time zhai and zhang 2011 li and mitch 2018 moreover thousands of organic halogenated compounds namely organohalogens have been detected in the environment gribble 2010 kinani et al 2016 wigilius et al 1988 meaning that aox exists not only in engineering water but also in natural environment meantime the toxicity of a disinfected water has been reported to positively correlate with its tox level savitz et al 2006 itoh et al 2011 pan et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 han et al 2017 jiang et al 2017a li et al 2017 lv et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 thus in addition to identifying individual dbps such as regulated trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and emerging haloacetonitriles hans it is also necessary to measure tox since the aox analytical method was established it has been used for many types of waters including raw water lee et al 2010 tian et al 2013 groundwater drewes and jeke 1996 landfill leachate lei et al 2007 wastewater uğurlu and karaoğ lu 2009 gong et al 2016 and reused wastewater doederer et al 2014 drewes and jekel 1998 stepwisely the method for aox analysis involves three major steps that is 1 concentrating and separating aox from halides with activated carbon ac 2 converting aox into halides with combustion i e pyrolysis and 3 detecting halides with microcoulometry or ion chromatography ic echigo et al 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 although useful and robust some issues remain challenging for the aox method particularly in the pyrolysis process for example to provide a temperature of 1000 c for aox conversion a specially designed combustor is needed moreover the oxygen used for combustion can undesirably oxidize iodide to iodine or iodate which cannot be readily recovered or detected with ic thereby underestimating the quantity of total organic iodine toi langsa et al 2017 to fully recover halogens a proper selection of a gas absorbing solution is important langsa et al 2017 sayess and reckhow 2016 we herein proposed to analyze nonionic total organic halogen ntox in disinfected water by three new sequential steps that is 1 separating ntox and halides with electrodialysis ed 2 converting ntox into halides via ultraviolet uv photolysis and 3 measuring halides via ic following the first step of this proposal i e ed pretreatment this study mainly focused on evaluating the efficiency of photolysis in converting ntox into halides to achieve this goal the study addressed some issues encountered in the photoconversion process also the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method were compared in analyzing real water samples the selection of uv photolysis was based upon several considerations firstly uv and vacuum uv vuv technologies are known robust tools for degrading organic substances in water either in advanced oxidation process aop legrini et al 1993 or in advanced reduction process arp liu et al 2014 although most of existing studies focused on the degradation of parent compounds the recoveries of halides using uv or vuv have been reported only in several studies for example hua and reckhow 2006 reported that a combination of uv with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can mineralize 95 0 100 0 of selected dbps yielding halides and bicarbonate as the products reckhow et al 2007 in another study halogens in three thms including chcl2br chbr2cl and chbr3 were completely converted to halides by uv alone but chloroform chcl3 was found to be refractory to direct uv photolysis nicole et al 1991 recently complete dehalogenation for seven haas was also observed for photolysis of haas with monochloroacetic acid mcaa showing the slowest dehalogenation rate wang et al 2017b secondly vuv photolysis was once applied in tandem with liquid chromatography to analyze total organic carbon and total nitrogen lc toc tn suggesting that vuv can convert organic carbon and nitrogen into inorganic carbon and nitrogen completely in practice huber et al 2011 this application serves as an indicator of the robustness of vuv because carbon halogen c x except for c f bonds are usually weaker than c c and c n bonds wang et al 2017a cleavage of c x bonds and halide release are expected to be achievable thirdly although other transformation technologies such as fenton catalkaya and kargi 2007 uv persulfate oxidation chuang et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 laser photolysis jiang et al 2017b neutron activation reckhow et al 1990 and radiolysis pereira et al 2011 are more powerful than uv and vuv photolysis is preferred owing to its inexpensiveness ease of operation and without external ion introduction which can make it a promising pretreatment approach for later analysis using ic 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and chemicals for organic halogens a list of model dbp compounds with varying molecular weights mws and functional groups were obtained in powder forms 98 0 purity from aladdin and sigma aldrich inc for inorganic halogens four sodium halides were purchased at reagent grade from aladdin inc each dbp s stock solution was prepared individually in ultrapure water without using organic solvent so as to avoid the interference of solvent on the photolysis of target compound ultrapure water was generated using an ultrapure water generator direct q3 millipore a synthetic water sample was prepared with humic acid 3 0 mg l as c purchased from aladdin co nahco3 90 mg l as caco3 and kbr 2 0 mg l as br in ultrapure water the bromide level was chosen to simulate a sample with relatively high bromide concentration in some source water e g up to 4 13 mg l in australia magazinovic et al 2004 and to amplify the formation of brominated dbps chlorination of the synthetic water sample was performed by adding 5 0 mg l of naocl as cl2 after a contact time of 2 h in the dark at room temperature the chlorine residual in the sample was determined using the diethyl p phenylene diamine ferrous titrimetric method and quenched with sodium thiosulfate at 105 of the required stoichiometric amount several real water samples including a swimming pool water spw and two tap waters were collected in august september and december of 2017 in shenzhen china these samples were quenched with sodium sulfite na2so3 and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane xingya co ltd before analysis some water characteristics of these samples are provided in table s1 2 2 analytical methods the changes of fluoride chloride bromide iodide nitrate and sulfate were analyzed using an ic equipped with conductivity and uv detectors ic2010 tosoh inc japan according to epa method 300 0 the halogenated methanes hms hans chloral hydrate ch halophenols hps and haas were detected with a gas chromatograph pe580 perkinelmer america equipped with an electron capture detector according to epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 dissolved organic matter dom was determined by a toc analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan according to epa method 415 3 ph was determined by an electrode meter 8103bn thermofisher america aox was measured by the equipment described in an earlier study li et al 2010 in addition to small mw compounds a precursor ion scan pis of bromide m z 79 or 81 using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry esi tqms was used in this study as an effective and efficient method for detection of polar and high mw brominated dbps ding et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 because this method can detect almost all halogenated dbps without knowing their specific structures it has been successfully applied in disclosing the whole pictures of polar halogenated dbps in drinking waters sewage effluents and swimming pool waters yang and zhang 2016 the synthetic water sample aliquots for uv photolysis were pretreated by a method reported before zhang et al 2008 in brief 1 l of the aliquot was firstly adjusted to ph 0 5 using a 50 v v aqueous solution of sulfuric acid followed by addition of sodium sulfate to saturation then the aliquot was extracted with 100 ml of methyl tert butyl ether the upper layer was transferred to a 250 ml flat bottomed flask and then concentrated in a rotary evaporator to approximately 1 ml the concentrate was then mixed with 10 ml of acetonitrile and concentrated to achieve a final volume of 0 5 ml prior to pis analysis 0 5 ml of ultrapure water was added to the 0 5 ml solution and then the mixture was filtered with a 0 22 μm filter the pis analysis was carried out by using a triple quad 4500 uplc esi tqms system ab sciex concord ontario canada the sample injection volume was 5 μl the chromatographic separation was performed on an acquity uplc hss t3 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 8 μm waters the gradient eluent was made by methanol and water with the ratio of methanol water v v changing linearly from 5 95 to 90 10 in the first 8 0 min and then returning to 5 95 within 0 1 min followed by the column re equilibrating for 2 9 min the flowrate and column temperature were set at 0 4 ml min and 35 c respectively the ms data were acquired in the electrospray negative ion mode the ms parameters were optimized and set as follows ion spray voltage 4500 v ion source gas i 55 arbitrary unit ion source gas ii 55 arbitrary unit curtain gas 40 arbitrary unit heater temperature 550 c declustering potential 30 v and collision energy 30 v the parameters of entrance potential and collision cell exit potential were both set at 10 v for pis analysis 2 3 photoreactor and experimental procedures the photoreactor used in this study was similar in shape to an earlier study wang et al 2017a except that two types of low pressure mercury lamps were adopted the photoreactor was made of stainless steel strings with a quartz tube deployed in the middle while four uv lamps 11 w philips inc netherlands which emit 254 nm wavelength only and four vuv lamps 12 w uv tec co china which emit both 185 nm and 254 nm wavelengths were placed in parallel to encircle the quartz tube as shown in fig s1 the quartz tube was used as a water container 22 cm length 1 5 cm diameter and 30 ml volume and sealed by glass cap during irradiation the purpose of applying both uv and vuv lamps was described in the results and discussion section by using h2o2 as an actinometer zalazar et al 2007 the photon intensity and effective optical path length of the uv lamps were determined to be 88 mw cm2 and 2 72 cm respectively however because of the inherent complexity of reactions involved in the vuv process no study has been conducted to measure the light intensity and optical length of vuv lamps before zoschke et al 2014 therefore this study did not delve into the details of actinometry but focused on the feasibility of vuv photolysis for halogen recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 photolysis kinetics because earlier literature indicates that vuv is more powerful than uv in degrading organic compounds due to the production of hydroxyl radical a very strong oxidant zoschke et al 2014 we herein chose vuv as the key tool to release halides from organohalogens meanwhile because dbps feature varying properties and amounts in real water and the huge variability may influence the reaction rate dramatically westerhoff et al 1999 we decided to evaluate three typical refractory chlorinated species because chlorinated species are usually more resistant to degradation than brominated and iodinated species in addition given that the transformation of organohalogens in real water is likely more difficult than that in ultrapure water the efficiency of halide recovery was also tested on two real waters fig 1 shows the halide formation kinetics of three water solutions and two ed pretreated real waters by vuv irradiation the three water solutions each contained 100 μg cl l of trichlorophenol tcp ch or mcaa as seen although the samples exhibited different trends the recoveries of chloride kept increasing with time and ultimately reached 87 0 of dosed quantity for all the three water solutions specifically the recoveries of halides for ch and tcp were 87 3 and 94 2 respectively within 5 min while that of mcaa was 87 1 within 10 min the sums of inorganic and organic chlorine remained within 94 3 107 2 of initial chlorine data not shown meaning that the mass of chlorine was balanced and consequently no substantial amount of halogen was lost during the photolysis process based upon the literature mcaa was slower in reaction with hydroxyl radical than most of dbps chuang et al 2016 and it was the slowest among haas toward direct uv photolysis wang et al 2017b however the time required for complete mcaa conversion was just 20 min under this study s condition the enhanced efficiency was likely due to increased light dosage and the specialty of 185 nm light gonzalez et al 2004 as for real samples it took 1 2 h to achieve steady halide recoveries suggesting that certain compounds in water might retard the dehalogenation process accordingly we hereafter applied 60 min irradiation time in following studies 3 2 reduction of oxyhalides ideally samples pretreated with ed should not contain significant amount of halides and upon irradiation the appearance of halides in water is only derived from organohalogens however in the case of incomplete removal of halides by ed ntox can be quantified as the difference between total halides measured before and after photolysis meanwhile there is another possibility that certain halides e g bromide and iodide may be oxidized by hydroxyl radical von gunten 2003 to form organohalogens or oxyhalides e g bromate or iodate in fact certain studies even reported that hydroxyl radicals may react with chloride to form inorganic chlorine derivatives e g cloh and cl2 jayson et al 1973 and chlorine radical cl yu and barker 2012 the following experiments were designed to determine the side effects of vuv irradiation on halides transformation and to optimize the dehalogenation process fig 2 a shows the recoveries of chloride bromide and iodide irradiated with vuv at different initial concentrations for chloride 99 5 was remained regardless of concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 mg l suggesting that chloride was not readily converted to other halogen species under this study s condition for bromide varying fractions yet fixed amounts i e 45 3 49 0 μg l of bromide were lost during vuv irradiation meaning that certain levels of bromide were transformed to other bromine containing species in comparison almost all iodide became undetectable for initial iodide concentrations below 200 μg l indicating that iodide was easily converted to other forms under vuv irradiation and optimization was vitally needed to improve the iodide recovery to minimize the losses of bromide and iodide we adjusted the samples to ph 10 11 using sodium hydroxide after vuv photolysis and applied uv photolysis irradiation for another 30 min the purpose was to reduce oxidized halogens back to halides following a previous study zhang et al 2016 the uv irradiation at alkaline condition was applied to form a reductive environment siddiqui et al 1996 fig 2b shows the results that the samples with a basic uv irradiation recovered almost all bromide and iodide 87 8 hence the results justified the sequential use of vuv dehalogenation and uv reduction in maximizing the recoveries of halides as for concerns about the potential formation of organic halogenated compounds because the water volume used was limited 30 ml while the uv dosage imposed was unlimited a complete dehalogenation or mineralization might not be difficult even if a sample was irradiated for 10 h with eight 12 w lamps together the expense was only 0 60 rmb 0 10 usd which is affordable for most of laboratories globally in fact even sunlight can recover a portion of halides from halogenated dbps in the absence of chlorine liu et al 2017 3 3 halide recovery for small mw compounds to provide more evidence for the vuv conversion method the method was applied to several groups of halogenated dbps under optimized operational conditions fig 3 shows the recoveries of twenty halogenated compounds with various halogenation types and degrees mws and functional groups the results showed that the vuv uv photolysis process achieved 85 5 halide recovery for all compounds with each spiked at 100 μg x l notably chloroform as a photo resistant compound nicole et al 1991 was dehalogenated by 91 0 thus demonstrating the robustness of vuv uv method 3 4 influencing factors to evaluate the method applicability we examined several influencing factors including dbp initial concentration ph and typical coexisting compounds on the halide recovery tcp tribromophenol tbp and monoiodophenol mip were chosen as the model dbps because they are also reference compounds used in conventional aox method fig 4 a shows the recoveries of halides for three compounds at two concentration levels as seen the halide recoveries achieved 100 1 107 6 for tcp and tbp but decreased from 99 0 at 0 2 mg i l to 87 8 at 1 mg i l for mip suggesting that iodinated dbps are more difficult to recover than chlorinated and brominated dbps at higher concentrations given that the concentrations of iodide and iodinated organic compounds in most waters were less than 212 μg l moran et al 2002 this inefficiency might not substantially affect the performance of the vuv uv method in recovering iodide from iodinated dbps water ph is another important factor for aop and arp during vuv photolysis because at high ph the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals can be suppressed by hydroxide kutschera et al 2009 therefore the halide recoveries at five different ph values were determined fig 4b the results showed that the halide recoveries ranged from 98 2 to 103 7 for tcp and tbp at all ph conditions 7 12 but the iodide recoveries ranged from 87 8 to 95 0 and increased with increasing ph suggesting that the loss of iodine was mainly caused by oxidation instead of incomplete conversion of organoiodine although transformation of organic compounds may decrease with rising ph ratpukdi et al 2010 this study achieved almost complete dehalogenation for all target compounds certain ions in water may retard or facilitate photolysis for example carbonate and bicarbonate are known to quench hydroxyl radicals while nitrate may compete directly with dbps for uv and vuv lights kutschera et al 2009 zoschke et al 2014 therefore we examined the influences of several typical compounds including carbonate nitrate bromide and humic acids on the halide recovery fig 4c shows that in the presence of humic substance hs carbonate or bromide at 10 mg l level the halide recoveries from tcp and tbp always achieved 92 1 105 7 only for the sample dosed with 10 mg l nitrate did the chloride recovery from tcp decrease slightly from 99 5 to 91 8 suggesting that nitrate was an inhibitor for dehalogenation of chlorinated dbps as for mip the recovery of iodide ranged from 86 2 to 92 2 in the presence of these anions and hs it should be noted that iodate is occasionally the dominant iodine species in chlorinated or ozonated samples zhang et al 2016 since uv used in this study could reduce iodate to iodide which was then measured as ntox the nonionic total organic iodine ntoi was likely overestimated however it should be reminded that prior to vuv photolysis most coexisting ions has been substantially or completely removed with preceding ed process therefore even iodate is present in raw water its influence is unlikely to be significant after ed pretreatment which means that ed and vuv are an attractive combination to pretreat water samples 3 5 halogen recovery for high mw compounds the pis spectra of the chlorinated synthetic sample with and without vuv uv photolysis are shown in fig 5 according to fig 5a and b ion pairs detected by piss of m z 79 and 81 in the sample mainly include m z 127 129 129 131 149 151 161 163 165 163 165 167 171 173 173 175 193 195 205 207 209 207 209 211 215 217 217 219 275 277 279 277 279 281 293 295 295 297 319 321 323 321 323 325 and 391 393 395 393 395 397 as listed in table s2 the pairs at m z 127 129 129 131 149 151 161 163 165 163 165 167 171 173 173 175 193 195 205 207 209 207 209 211 215 217 217 219 and 293 295 295 297 can be ascribed to previously reported dbps i e bromochloroacetic acid decarboxylated bromopropanoic acid bromodichloroacetic acid bromochloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid decarboxylated 2 bromo 2 butenedioic acid dichlorobromoacetic acid dibromoacetic acid and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromo salicylic acid respectively pan and zhang 2013a zhai and zhang 2011 zhang et al 2008 other major ion pairs might be new and unknown dbps fig 5c shows the ions ion clusters detected by pis m z 79 in the chlorinated synthetic sample after photolysis although responses for different brominated dbps were not identical during pis analysis the intensity of a specific brominated compound should be positively related with its concentration with the same sample matrix and under the same instrumental condition compared with the data without uv photolysis all representative ion intensities shown in pis m z 79 of the sample with photolysis decreased dramatically by 95 6 99 3 in addition the sum of ion intensities within the range of m z 100 500 in pis m z 79 was calculated to obtain total ion intensity tii according to a previous study liu et al 2015 the intensities of ions with m z 500 were not counted because they were quite low in general the tii level in the original chlorinated synthetic sample was 2 07 106 and it was reduced to 7 42 104 after uv photolysis table s2 the remarkable reduction of tii by 96 4 indicates that most polar organic halogenated compounds have been converted to inorganic halogens by photolysis and the trend was consistent with the observations obtained from model compounds as aforementioned interestingly pan and colleagues once reported that the tii values of drinking water samples collected from representative cities in china were highly correlated r2 0 98 with the corresponding tox concentrations pan et al 2015 liu and colleagues found that tii tox and developmental toxicity of real tap water displayed identical trends during boiling liu et al 2015 hence the pis data suggested that the overall halogenated dbps formed in the chlorinated synthetic water sample were completely dehalogenated during vuv uv photolysis 3 6 halide detection with ic after ed separation and uv conversion the next challenge for ntox analysis is to achieve method detection limits mdls as low as possible e g at sub μg l or ng l levels however although chloride and bromide can be readily detected with ic using conductivity detector iodide at near μg l level is difficult to be detected because iodide has a longer retention time in ic column yet lower signal for conductivity detector than chloride and bromide in earlier studies advanced systems like uplc esi ms pan and zhang 2013b and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms sayess and reckhow 2016 have been employed to achieve 5 μg l mdl for iodide measurement however those instruments are very expensive and less accessible for most of researchers therefore we integrated a uv detector spd 20av shimadzu japan with dual wavelengths into the ic system for iodide analysis eventually the method reached a mdl of 4 μg i l for iodide although the mdl is still higher than the quantity of organic iodine in most water samples those photolyzed water may be concentrated with rotary evaporation freeze drying or other non chemical concentration methods in the laboratory to enable even lower mdl of iodide by ic analysis according to the us environmental protection agency usepa standard procedure usepa 2000 we estimated the mdls of the proposed method for nonionic total organic chlorine bromine and iodine ntocl ntobr and ntoi because ed and uv photolysis are essentially pretreatment methods the mdls of ntocl ntobr and ntoi are equivalent to the mdls of halides in ic which are 7 μg cl l 11 μg br l and 4 μg i l respectively take one example a calibration curve was built over a range of ntocl from 20 to 200 μg cl l with a fixed ratio of halide to ntox 30 1 the results showed a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 99 fig s2 with relative standard deviations rsds 9 3 suggesting a satisfactory precision of this method 3 7 comparison of methods despite the huge mechanistic difference a comparison of proposed ntox method and conventional aox method is needed table 1 shows their analytical data for model compounds and real samples for the six tested model compounds the recoveries by ntox method ranged from 80 0 to 115 8 except for trichloroacetic acid similar to the recoveries by conventional aox method 78 2 122 0 of all model compounds the recovery of tcm with aox method was lower than that with ntox method likely attributed to its high volatility that caused loss of tcm during sample transfer process and adsorption process in contrast tcp was better recovered by aox method 102 0 than that by ntox method 80 0 which was likely due to its high hydrophobicity and strong adsorption potential as for real water samples because the exact quantities of halogenated compounds were unknown we compared the two analytical methods by diluting the samples fig 6 indicates that the results of both ntox and aox methods from raw and diluted samples can be well correlated to the sample dilution factors r2 0 97 however the amounts of ntocl were averagely 30 6 23 6 and 13 7 lower than aocl for tap water swimming pool water and chlorinated synthetic water respectively similarly the results of ntobr were averagely 30 1 and 2 3 lower than aobr for tap and chlorinated synthetic waters respectively the discrepancies are likely attributed to the losses of ionic compounds such as haas during the ed process under this study s condition the samples with lower organic halogen contents exhibited larger gaps between the two methods suggesting that the ntox method is suitable for samples with high levels of organic halogens 4 conclusions in general this study proposed and verified a new method for detecting ntox in water by converting ntox into halides via photolysis pretreatment by applying vuv photolysis for 60 min and uv photolysis at an alkaline condition for another 30 min we overcame the problem of formation of oxyhalides overall this study achieved 85 5 halogen recoveries for 20 small mw model compounds and in average 96 4 for high mw polar compounds the initial concentrations of organic halogenated compounds ph humic substance and coexisting compounds showed limited influence on the halide recoveries a comparison of the conventional aox method and the proposed ntox method demonstrated that they generated comparable results with good precision hence all these demonstrate that the novel use of photolysis which is a mature technology in water treatment industry may be considered as a facile and green tool for environmental sample pretreatment in retrospective we recognize that the greatest challenge of this new method for ntox measurement is the improvement and optimization of tox recovery during the ed process although this study has provided evidence and classic literature may theoretically justify the method based on molecular size and charge analyses too more analysis of real samples by more researchers are necessary in the future to verify the feasibility and application scope of the present method in future studies we plan to further improve the proposed method in many ways such as enhancing the photolysis efficiency to allow more rapid conversion of organic halogen species evaluating the applicability of the proposed method in more complicated samples automating and commercializing the method and replacing ic with ion selective electrodes to allow convenient measurement of halides it is worth mentioning that the ntox method enabled by the ed uv ic combination is able to analyze not only organohalogens but also other organic elements such as nitrogen zhu et al 2015 sulfur and phosphorous accordingly this method may open a door for future studies dealing with organic compounds containing multiple types of elements such as nitrogenous

19329,the advantage of using non invasive imaging such as optical coherence tomography oct to asses material properties from deformed biofilm geometries can be compromised by the assumptions made on fluid forces acting on the biofilm this study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by oct imaging with poroelastic fluid structure interaction computations two dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from oct scans of non deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading the biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and darcy flow in the biofilm the simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the young s modulus in given flow conditions the present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini fluidic rectangular channels this superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface total stress including also pressure is accounted for any biofilm shape can be used in the determinations and non linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700 pa were obtained and biofilm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified the work performed here opens the way for in situ determination of other mechanical properties e g viscoelastic properties relaxation times plastic yields and provides data for modelling biofilm deformation and detachment with eventual applications in biofilm control and removal strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm mechanics elastic modulus poroelastic model fluid structure interaction imaging 1 introduction formation of biofilms is regarded as a strategy of microbes to thrive in flowing environments and to protect themselves from environmental stresses by living attached to interfaces biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms e g bacteria algae fungi embedded in extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming and wingender 2010 the eps consist of a variety of proteins polysaccharides and other substances which form a hydrogel network stabilizing the biofilm structure and allowing the biofilm to withstand external stresses induced by the surrounding flow beside the exact composition structure and functions of the biofilm matrix the mechanical properties of biofilms are still not entirely known currently the biofilm mechanical properties cannot be predicted based on the acting microorganisms or growth conditions nevertheless for water quality control in drinking water distribution systems shen et al 2016 or for a reliable control of biofilm thickness in biofilm reactors e g by backwashing of other mechanical methods the knowledge of the mechanical stability would be extremely helpful morgenroth and wilderer 1999 guelon et al 2011 provided a comprehensive overview of methods by which the mechanical properties of biofilms can be measured biofilm material can be subjected to ex situ tests in well known and standardized equipment e g rheometers however developing in situ measurement methods appears to be important as we do not know how quickly the mechanical properties might change if the biofilm is removed from its original environment guelon et al 2011 a further review by böl et al 2013 related the available methods for identification of mechanical properties with the numerical modelling efforts they concluded that none of the existing methods by itself can cover the whole spectrum of biofilm behavior böl et al 2013 based on this statement the combination of biofilm modelling together with in situ experimental measurements of biofilm deformation could be a good approach to ascertain the mechanical properties of biofilms in their natural environment for this aim a fast and non invasive imaging technique such as the optical coherence tomography oct is required wagner and horn 2017 martin et al 2014 used two dimensional 2d oct cross sections as a basis for the biofilm geometry to assess by numerical modelling the permeation fluxes through membranes covered with patchy biofilms li et al 2016 performed similar studies using also 2d cross sections from oct they could show that higher substrate fluxes were obtained for heterogeneous biofilm surface structures moreover fortunato et al 2016 used oct cross sections to visualize biofouling in submerged membranes they used the acquired imaging data to calculate the decrease in flux due to the biofouling and their theoretical estimations differed by only 5 from the original flux a step forward was made by blauert et al 2015 who managed to record 2d biofilm deformation in movies made with oct confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was also combined with oscillatory shear rheology to measure the storage modulus g and loss modulus g connecting the g values to variations in eps waters et al 2014 other authors used magnetic particles embedded in growing biofilms which were manipulated by magnetic tweezers generating a 3d map of mechanical biofilm properties galy et al 2012 most of the numerical simulation studies aiming at describing dynamics of biofilm formation assumed the biofilm as a non deformable rigid material even when biofilm deformation and detachment were coupled with flow induced stresses the biofilm was assumed as an elastically deformable but quasi static structure martin et al 2015 picioreanu et al 2001 radu et al 2010 several other studies combined the flow with biofilm deformation in a dynamic fashion tierra et al 2015 the new possibility of simulating moving geometries allowed fluid structure interaction biofilm models to describe for example oscillations of a biofilm streamers taherzadeh et al 2010 and their effect on increased substrate uptake taherzadeh et al 2012 the question is how the measured mechanical data can be combined with models typically the fluid structure interaction in biofilms is simulated with continuum approaches based on partial differential equations e g finite element finite volume etc relying on published values of mechanical properties such as young s modulus and poison s ratio taherzadeh et al 2010 a finite element software ansys was used by towler et al to simulate the steady state fluid structure interaction of a hemispherical biofilm structure in turbulent flow using a linear viscoelastic burger constitutive relation for the biofilm material towler et al 2006 other authors applied a immersed boundary method to biofilm deformation simulated in a discrete approach based on particles connected by springs e g alpkvist and klapper 2007 nevertheless all numerical models need realistic values of biofilm properties elastic viscoelastic or plastic within this study 2d images of deforming biofilms under defined flow conditions were used to derive biofilm mechanical properties by a series of numerical simulations mimicking the fluid structure interaction the biofilm imaging has been performed with oct in micro fluidic flow channels blauert et al 2015 this method proved several advantages especially over clsm imaging for study of biofilm mechanics it is non invasive and in situ does not require staining it can provide images at meso scale millimeters and it is relatively fast 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm cultivation biofilms were cultivated in flow cells made of poly methyl methacrylate with a straight channel of 2 1 124 mm width height length the flow cells were inoculated with activated sludge supernatant from a local waste water treatment plant ka karlsruhe germany for 24 h before the supernatant was replaced by the cultivation medium biofilm cultivation was performed with acetate 20 mg l or glucose 24 mg l the cultivation medium included one of the substrates together with nutrient and trace element solutions the nutrient solution contained concentrations in mg l k2hpo4 2 mgso4 7h2o 12 ca no3 2 4h2o 8 nh4 so4 12 and feso4 7h2o 6 the trace element solution included in μg l h3bo3 300 cocl2 7h2o 130 cucl2 8 mnso4 h2o 20 na2moo4 2h2o 26 nicl2 6h2o 10 and znso4

from 11 to 472 calculated with measured average flow velocity u av water density ρ and viscosity μ and hydraulic diameter d h 2 h w h w 1 33 mm for the flow cell width w and height h biofilm development was followed by oct blauert et al 2015 blauert 2017 2 2 biofilm visualization and image processing imaging data sets containing the biofilm geometry were acquired by means of optical coherence tomography ganymede i thorlabs gmbh lübeck germany briefly oct measures a point reflection signal from the biofilm and produces a depth resolved intensity profile along the scan axis z direction here the flow cell height by acquiring several scans along one lateral axis x direction here the flow cell length a cross sectional image is produced in the xz plane consecutive cross sections along the other lateral axis the flow cell width y generates a full volumetric representation as detailed in haisch and niessner 2007 wagner et al 2010 xi et al 2006 oct is suitable for in situ biofilm imaging at the meso scale e g millimeter scale no staining is required it is non invasive and acquires imaging data sets fast cross sections are obtained within milliseconds and full volumetric representations can be visualized within seconds this allows oct to follow fast processes over time either in real time for 2 d cross sections or in time lapsed mode for 3 d volumetric representations for the mechanical study cross sections of 2 1 mm2 1024 1024 pixels were acquired which corresponds to a resolution of 2 μm in the x direction and 2 9 μm in the z direction the images were then cut to the area of interest containing the biofilm structure from these oct images the biofilm surface coordinates x z were manually extracted with the free software graph data extractor a j mattheuws the list of points x z was used to create polygonal shapes representing the biofilm geometry in the numerical simulations performed in comsol multiphysics comsol 5 3 comsol inc burlington ma 2 3 shear induced biofilm deformation experiments experiments were carried out by step wise changes in flow velocity and recording the corresponding biofilm deformation with oct in a time lapse series two recorded geometries were used for each biofilm one at the unloaded geometry no flow zero shear and the other at full steady state deformation details can be found in blauert et al 2015 the acquired data sets of the deformed and un deformed structures were processed and loaded as model geometries into comsol multiphysics for the numerical evaluation of mechanical properties 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 model geometry the two dimensional model in fig 1 presents an example of biofilm geometry sub domain ω b extracted from oct images on which the fluid and solid mechanics calculations were based the irregularly shaped biofilm sub domain was placed in a rectangular box length l x 3 mm and height l z 1 mm representing an oct cross section of the flow cell along the flow direction the difference between the outer rectangle and the biofilm sub domain is the fluid sub domain ω f 2 4 2 fluid and solid mechanics the biofilm structure experiences the forces shear and pressure exerted by the moving liquid onto the biofilm surface boundary γfsi in fig 1 as a result the biofilm deforms and this is experienced by the flow as a moving boundary changing the flow pattern this is a two way interaction between the biofilm and the water flow typically referred to as fluid structure interaction fsi at the same time inner cohesive forces prevent the biofilm from breaking apart and give rise to internal stresses other processes which may issue internal forces such as bacteria replication motility production of extracellular polymers or aging of the biofilm matrix were neglected during the short time frame seconds to minutes in which the biofilm deformation was investigated however the pressure of water in the biofilm pores was taken into account in a poroelastic model formulation counteracting the pressure exerted by the surrounding liquid pressure gradients in the deformable biofilm pores lead to a slow flow represented by darcy s law fluid flow outside the biofilm fluid flow in the sub domain ω f was modeled by the incompressible laminar navier stokes equations of momentum 1 and mass conservation continuity 2 the range of re numbers investigated up to 550 was well within the laminar flow regime in rectangular section pipes 1 σ f ρ u f u f 2 u f 0 the liquid experiences pressure and viscous forces included in the constitutive eq 3 for the stress tensor σ f 3 σ f p f i μ u f u f t the variables solved for were the flow field velocity vector u f and the liquid pressure p f water density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ were assumed constant with the values at 20 c solution of hydrodynamic equations involved the assumption that eventual biofilm structures upstream and downstream the imaged biofilm would be situated far enough not to affect the flow field in the studied domain a fully established laminar flow profile was imposed in the inflow γ i with an average velocity u av the outflow was set to a constant gauge pressure p 0 on the channel walls γ wt and γ wb no slip was imposed u f 0 on the fsi interface a leaking wall continuity condition was implemented with velocity taken from the darcy flow within the biofilm u f u b fluid flow in the biofilm darcy flow

biofilm with the pressure in biofilm pores p f p b biofilm mechanics the navier equations for a solid in equilibrium with quasi static plane strain 2 d approximation i e negligible small deformation out of the 2 d plane were applied in the biofilm sub domain ω b to represent the biofilm matrix deformation 6 σ b 0 7 v b 0 biofilms display elastic deformation in short stress exposure and viscous flow behavior during long stress exposure klapper et al 2002 shaw et al 2004 stoodley et al 2002 in the experiments studied here the biofilm deformation occurred within seconds with oct b scans acquired between 1 and 3 s from the flow change which is much shorter than the expected transition time from elastic to viscoelastic deformation of 20 min shaw et al 2004 therefore viscous flow creep of the biofilm matrix was neglected and only the elastic behavior was considered however the porous nature of the biofilm cannot be overlooked for a correct representation of the fluid pressure in the biofilm matrix which has to balance the pressure in the water domain therefore the stress tensor in the biofilm included a poroelastic as well as an isotropic linear elastic component 8 σ b α p b i c e ν v b v b t 2 replacing eq 8 in 6 the variables solved for were the displacement field v b and the fluid pressure inside biofilm pores p b the biofilm elasticity tensor c was expressed function of young elasticity modulus e and poisson ratio ν the deformation field is directly influenced by the young s modulus e which can therefore be used as sensitive parameter in fsi models to fit the simulated deformation to the measured deformed geometry the poisson s ratio regulates thereby the lateral to the horizontal deformation additionally the biot willis coefficient α relates the volume change of fluid absorbed into or released from the biofilm to the volumetric change of the porous matrix for soft porous materials α 1 coussy 2004 continuity of total stress σ b σ f was implemented on the fsi boundary as the load exerted by the flow of liquid on the biofilm surface the biofilm was fixed on the support surface γ wf with v b 0 geometry deformation equations 1 8 are shown here in the stationary form because all the results presented in this study are based only on the computed deformation at steady state compared with the oct recorded deformation however the steady state solution was reached in time dependent simulations with the fluid structure interaction coupled through a moving finite element mesh this was needed because preliminary simulations showed that not accounting for the reciprocal fluid structure interaction i e calculating the forces acting on the biofilm surface based only on the initial undeformed geometry introduced errors in the biofilm deformation due to inaccurate load stress distributions zero mesh displacement was prescribed on all boundaries except on biofilm liquid interface γ fsi where displacement was set to v b by the solid mechanics 2 4 3 model solution all model equations were implemented and solved in comsol multiphysics 5 3 by a finite element method model parameters are listed in table 1 a triangular mesh with maximum element size of 10 μm was used flow equations and the deformed geometry were discretized linearly while quadratic discretization with geometric nonlinearity was applied for the solid mechanics in time dependent simulations the flow velocity was increased from 0 to u av in a smoothed step of 1 second all results are reported at steady state after 1 5 s 2 4 4 evaluation of young s modulus e from the simulation parametric sweeps were performed with e from 50 to 800 pa depending on the experiment to find the best overlap of the simulated and real deformed geometry recorded with oct a first optimization criterion compared the non overlapping area of model computed biofilm deformation and experimental deformation δa relative to the area of experimental deformation a e in percents err a δa a e 100 the

integration secondly multiple parameter optimization was performed using the nelder meed algorithm in matlab code coupled with comsol simulations livelink for matlab the objective function to be minimized was constructed as an average distance between points on the computed contour of deformed biofilm and the nearest polygonal segments forming the measured biofilm contour at deformed state err m reported as μm error 3 results 3 1 biofilm deformation measurements the non deformed biofilm geometry used as simulation basis was extracted from oct images furthermore oct images taken for the deformed biofilms exposed to different flow conditions were compared with simulation results biofilm deformation experiments were adapted from blauert 2017 fig 2 a c shows two dimensional oct cross sections of a biofilm cultivated with glucose case biofilm i taken over an area of 2000 500 μm2 a video of the deformation process was added in the supplementary information si v1 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 08 070 the following is the supplementary data related to this article si v1 si v1 other biofilms cases were also investigated biofilm ii and biofilm iii were grown with glucose while biofilm iv was cultivated with acetate oct images of non deformed and deformed biofilm structures are presented in fig 3 a f 3 2 computed flow fields and stress distributions results from the numerical model simulation of fluid biofilm interaction are presented in fig 4 at the stationary state reached after 1 5 s of time dependent simulation with inflow velocity increased during a smooth step of 1 s the results are for the biofilm i case at re 91 but similar solutions were obtained for the other biofilm cases and other re numbers the velocity field shows the expected laminar flow with larger fluid velocity above the biofilm obstruction fig 4a due to the small biofilm permeability and small pressure gradients much less flow establishes through the biofilm pores with a darcy velocity less than 1 μm s fig 4c as a result of the forces exerted by the flow the biofilm deforms and reaches a stationary state an animation of the time dependent simulation is presented in supplementary information si v2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 08 070 the following is the supplementary data related to this article si v2 si v2 the simulations considered the total stress applied along the bulk biofilm interface γ fsi that is both shear stress exerted tangentially on the biofilm surface by the viscous flow and pressure acting normally to the biofilm the total stress distributions in fig 4b present values from close to zero to a maximum of 12 pa or n m2 it becomes clear that the pressure dominates on the biofilm frontally exposed to flow exerting a compressive load i e pushing the biofilm inwards conversely on the biofilm top the negative pressure exerted a tensile load i e traction pulling the biofilm outwards interestingly the pressure max 9 pa is larger than the shear stress max 3 pa as compared in fig 4c the shear was found to act mainly on the up front biofilm surface in the rest being much smaller than the pressure slightly increased friction was only on the high points in the middle of the biofilm structure this shows that the tested biofilm was mainly compressed from the upstream side and experienced a small drag along the whole structure due to the shear forces the forces on the biofilm surface produce mechanical stress non uniformly distributed in the biofilm fig 4b the von mises stress reduces the local stress in all directions to one scalar value making it easier to compare the local stress to a failure criterion for which the material would break naturally the fluid forces exerted on the biofilm front coincide with the largest deformation and largest internal stresses in this region simulation showed the highest stresses close to the upstream contact point of biofilm and substratum hinge effect where the main deformation would occur were the biofilm not firmly attached to substratum however comparison of the computed deformation in the hinge area with the collected oct images is not easy the apparent gliding effect of the biofilm base at higher re flows fig 2b and c was not considered in the simulations which assumed the whole biofilm base fixed to the support fig 2d and e and fig 4 3 3 assessment of the elastic modulus e the evaluation of material elastic modulus was done by performing a parametric sweep over a range of e values to find the best fit for the computed deformation to the measured deformed biofilm geometry while in conventional fsi simulations the model is set with known mechanical parameters and the desired output is the deformed geometry in this study the method can be seen as reversed the deformed geometry was used to assess values of the mechanical properties as an example for the biofilm i changing the elastic modulus resulted in important geometry changes upon flow at re 172 fig 5 a as expected large deformations occur at smaller values of e while compression occurs on the biofilm frontal zone traction takes place on the upper biofilm sections a value of e around 160 pa was found to fit best the measured deformed biofilm contour with an error of 14 μm in average fig 2e at the lower re 91 the elastic modulus best fitting the recorded structure deformation was 80 pa with err m 11 μm and err a 3 5 as displayed in fig 2d table 2 lists the model measurement differences for the parametric sweep of the young s modulus from 50 to 120 pa smaller e lead to a rapid degradation of the fit as the structure deforms too much both error measures lead to the same conclusions given the strong 2 d simplification the model comes remarkably close to the real deformation the simulated displacement field is in good agreement with the shear stress distribution showing that the largest displacement is in the upper front region the main deformations always occur in the frontal region of the biofilm this being also the most difficult part to model correctly for the simulations a poisson ratio of ν 0 4 was chosen in similarity with gels geissler and hecht 1981 and with theoretical estimations by laspidou and aravas 2007 due to lack of other experiments the poisson s ratio relates the lateral to transverse elongation during the deformation process influencing the deformation field within the biofilm matrix parametric sweeps with the poisson ratio reveal that the simulated biofilm structure sinks as lower values are chosen fig 5b while keeping the same e however the choice of a conservative value of ν 0 4 results in good fits not only for biofilm i but also for the other cases fig 3 simulations with different values of biot parameter α and biofilm permeability κ showed practically no model sensitivity within an acceptable range of values α between 1 and biofilm porosity of 0 6 κ changed by two orders of magnitude see si fig s3 in addition to biofilm i other biofilm structures were examined glucose grown biofilms ii and iii and acetate grown biofilm iv the simulated and measured biofilm deformations are summarized in fig 3 while all tests and conditions reported here are listed in table 3 overall the agreement between the measured and computed deformations was good simpler biofilm shapes and smaller biofilm areas seem to lead to better results biofilm iii err m 5 μm and biofilm iv err m 9 μm the obtained e values for these biofilms appear notably higher than for biofilm i however these deformations were performed at larger re numbers where due to larger forces biofilm hardening effects occur notably more than for biofilm i the pressure dominates over the shear stress in biofilm iii that has a dome like shape fig 6 large pressure pushes the biofilm downstream and pulls it upward max 30 pa while the shear increases as expected over the biofilm height but displays much lower values max 10 pa at the biofilm top this reflects once again the importance of considering correct hydrodynamic representation of forces not only an overall shear such as in previous studies a firm base leads to a more uniform von mises stress distribution within biofilm iii compared with biofilm i 3 4 biofilm hardening and consolidation experimental techniques often evaluate a single value of the elastic modulus for biofilms assuming that this value is valid over a large range of elastic deformations möhle et al 2007 stoodley et al 1999 laspidou and aravas 2007 predicted that the value of young s modulus can be influenced by the change of porosity during deformation as a result biofilm consolidation occurs i e closing or collapsing of voids which leads to an increase of the elastic modulus this biofilm hardening effect was observed experimentally by paramonova et al 2009 in streptococcus dental biofilms however experimental data for biofilm hardening stiffening are still scarce and coupling in situ oct imaging with numerical modelling of biofilm deformation under a range of flow velocities could contribute to the quantification of this effect recently biofilm hardening at large stresses has been observed for biofilms formed in gravity driven filtration upon applied step wise changes in permeate flux or trans membrane pressure jafari et al 2018 in addition to hardening biofilm consolidation has also been reported alpkvist et al 2006 meaning that the biofilm base becomes denser in time the increase of biofilm density toward the support was experimentally evaluated in several studies e g zhang and bishop 1994 however whether this also leads to increased biofilm stiffness i e with increased e compared with the upper younger biofilm layers still remains to be measured the hardening effect is evident in the experiments with biofilm i the young s modulus evaluated at re 91 was 80 pa while at re 172 a value of 160 pa was found to fit best the data when applying the e 80 pa for re 172 case unrealistically large deformations were calculated the biofilm hardening and consolidation were also measured in a separate biofilm case biofilm v as shown in fig 7 for this biofilm grown on glucose deformations were recorded at re 238 and re 477 and the best deformed geometry fits were obtained with e 70 and 190 pa respectively this shows that the biofilms get harder at larger flow velocity i e more applied stress on the biofilm fig 7a and b however the match is not very good especially at the larger re were both the frontal surface and the back of the biofilm deviate from the observed deformation it is clear that the real biofilm deformed less close to the base and more at the top surface than the model with uniform e would predict therefore we have also imposed an elasticity profile with larger e at the base and much smaller at the top as shown in fig 7c and d while for the slow flow the match did not improve for the fast flow re 477 the model computed biofilm deformation fitted better the measurements visibly the frontal region close to base deforms less while the top region deforms more fig 7d no attempt was made to further tune the imposed elasticity profile as for that more local deformation measurements would be needed possibly by tracking the displacement of marked biofilm points these poroelastic simulations show how gradients in biofilm elasticity can explain consolidation effects near the support but also how biofilm compression can be achieved without changing the poisson s ratio however it can not be excluded that the studied biofilms were also deformed plastically i e upon flow rate increase the structure suffered some permanent deformation this would be certainly possible by closing macropores and collapsing the finger like structures often seen at the biofilm surface into a more compact structure 4 discussion 4 1 stress in the biofilm simulations performed in this study showed invariably high stresses within the biofilm frontal section close to the attachment surface similar stress distributions in biofilms were found by taherzadeh et al 2012 who simulated oscillatory biofilm streamer movements the shear stress decreases along the tail of the streamer indicating a phenomenological advantage of the streamlined structure in fast flows böl et al 2009 used a biofilm geometry obtained from confocal laser scanning images for simulation of the fluid structure interaction their work provided similar results to those presented here showing the highest inner stresses around the bended biofilm neckings this also points to the importance of using real biofilm geometries such those in figs 2 and 3 for obtaining a more accurate picture of the shear stress distribution within the biofilm moreover this weak contact point is a possible place where the biofilm detachment begins picioreanu et al 2001 studied in a 2d simulation the influence of shear stress on the detachment behavior of biofilms even though the simulations were based stong simplifing assumptions biofilm as homogeneous elastic material they showed the importance of stress distribution on and within the biofilm structure in determining areas of large deformation as well as regions prone to detachment moreover this created the base for model extensions to multispecies biofilms martin et al 2015 bioclogging of porous media bottero et al 2013 or biofouling of membrane filtration devices radu et al 2010 the method developed in the present study could therefore provide very useful information both input parameters and data to check model output for more elaborate modelling of biofilm detachment a comparison of elastic modulus e obtained in this study with values resulting from other studies is only qualitatively possible the e moduli in this study ranged from 70 to 700 pa table 3 the values are slightly larger than other experimentally determined young s moduli from flow cell setups 40 pa in mixed cultures stoodley et al 1999 blauert et al 2015 20 250 pa for p aeruginosa stoodley et al 1999 2001 klapper et al 2002 other tests of the mechanical strength of biofilms such as compression measurements were used by paramonova et al 2009 yielding values closer to this study e 50 350 pa however direct comparison to other techniques compression indentation atomic force microscopy shear rheometry etc is difficult as long as standardized samples and test conditions do not exist 4 2 importance of shear and pressure exerted by the fluid model results clearly showed that the tested biofilms were mostly compressed upstream and experienced only relatively small shear these findings have actually profound implications on the validity of results obtained in other studies blauert et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 considering only the shear stress in the determination of the elastic modulus the underestimation of forces acting on a biofilm for which a certain deformation was measured would lead to underestimation of the biofilm stiffness moreover the same value of shear was assumed to act uniformly on the whole biofilm surface in previous studies critically these studies took the shear estimated from the liquid velocity in the empty channel in the calculation of mechanical moduli whereas the biofilm could obstruct an important flow section resulting actually in larger shear for example a shear value τ 0 3 pa was used in blauert et al 2015 for the same biofilm i at re 90 while in the present study an average shear τ 0 66 pa was calculated on the biofilm surface with large local variations from 0 to 3 pa moreover the total stress including pressure was σ 4 1 pa which clearly shows that the estimation of the young s modulus relies on a good assumption of the forces responsible for the deformation considering the shear only can underestimate the actual total stress and therefore the real young s modulus of the biofilm using the newly developed fluid biofilm interaction model we relaxed the assumption of a constant shear stress revealing a more realistic value for the young s modulus in past studies the elastic young s modulus was experimentally evaluated from the linear part of a stress strain plot based on images of biofilm deformation at different shear stress blauert et al 2015 böl et al 2013 stoodley et al 1999 this method requires a certain shape of the biofilm structure and introduces errors from manual calculation of the shear stress and strain for example biofilms had to present a straight edge and certain attack angles of the section facing the flow to allow determination of shear modulus or large finger like structures to calculate the young s modulus from elongation measurements implementing a real biofilm geometry into a numerical simulation should also allow the determination of mechanical parameters from any biofilm geometries considering the coupled fluid biofilm interaction instead of computing deformation based on the forces exerted only on the underformed structure has a certain effect for the coupled model the average total stress over the whole bulk biofilm boundary was σ 4 1 pa and the average shear stress τ 0 66 pa in a decoupled case when biofilm deformation did not affect the flow σ 3 56 pa and τ 0 64 pa this simplification introduces another possible source of errors in the deformation forces the computed biofilm deformation in this case showed indeed less compression and a biofilm pulled slightly more upwards si fig s2 4 3 biofilm hardening porosity and compressibility assuming poisson s ratios close 0 5 imply that the structure would be nearly incompressible requiring that biofilms maintain volume while deforming however in some cases oct imaging of deformation showed that biofilm compression occurs this could be mainly attributed to pressure forces it has also been shown that during the deformation at higher flow velocities the porosity decreases blauert et al 2015 water extrusion from the biofilm makes the structure more rigid several empirical formulae have been proposed to describe the dependence of mechanical strength on porosity ϕ for example for ceramic materials e e 0 1 ϕ ϕcrit n phani and niyogi 1987 implies the existence of a critical porosity at which the young modulus becomes zero or e e 0exp mϕ was proposed for porous sintered materials ryshkewitch 1953 recently a simple power law e e 0ϕ m was used to describe biofilm hardening in gravity driven filtration jafari et al 2018 related to compression under pressure or due to flow induced internal friction additionally re arrangement of polysaccharides and polypeptides may also play a role in biofilm stiffening especially when the shear stress is applied longer than viscoelastic relaxation times minutes shaw et al 2004 the results of this study are in agreement with the theoretical estimations of elastic modulus change with decreasing porosity by laspidou and aravas 2007 in their model the decrease in porosity at least doubled the young s modulus while a similar trend was found in our study moreover laspidou and aravas showed that by assuming a compressible or incompressible biofilm material the slope of both young s modulus and poisson s ratio with the strain can also be altered unfortunately the oct imaging alone does not reveal mechanical heterogeneity of the biofilm oct might well be used to reveal denser regions inside the structure to include heterogeneity in future calculations it may also be possible to couple particle tracking techniques with oct to determine deformation fields and from this to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of mechanical properties within the biofilm 4 4 sources of errors in the oct model determination of mechanical properties several factors that may compromise the accuracy of determination of elastic properties by coupling oct imaging with numerical modelling have been already discussed these included non elastic behaviors viscoelastic or plastic non linear elasticity with biofilm hardening at high applied loads and compression with porosity change e g biofilm porosity decrease up to 10 blauert et al 2015 has a hardening effect mechanical consolidation of base layers or other factors leading to heterogeneous distribution of properties e g if bacteria tend to build clusters regions of locally stiffer or softer biofilm can develop other possible interferring factors are discussed here steady state deformation not achieved this could be caused by viscoelastic biofilm behavior which keeps deforming even when the shear stress exerted by the liquid reached a quasi constant value this continuous deformation should however be minimal in the present study because the acquisition time was long enough compared with the viscoelastic time constants seconds measured by other researchers peterson et al 2013 and still short compared with the time scale of long term macromolecular rearrangements 20 min klapper et al 2002 shaw et al 2004 in addition it could be noted that the biofilm imaged in the supplementary information si v1 vibrated slightly under flow with an amplitude of 10 μm the assumed steady deformation should therefore be considered within this marge of error changes in the flow pattern typically the flow established very fast seconds in the performed experiments and the volumetric flowrate was accurately measured however the average velocity value calculated in the simulations from the volumetric flowrate may be altered by variations in the crossectional area higher velocities and shear stress may be caused by biofilm patches not removed by regular cleaning growing on the upper and lateral flowcell walls which decrease the flow section the flow pattern could also be affected by biofilm colonies growing upstream the observed biofilm patch and much less by those downstream which can only affect the recirculation vortex behind the obstacle in the flow we used here fully developed laminar flow in inlet with an average velocity corresponding to measured volumetric flowrate this excluding influences by other upstream obstacles on the flow pattern however if other biofilm colonies are placed upstream the water velocity near the biofilm base will be slower recirculation zones will occur and the forces upon the biofilm base will be smaller this could eventally be approximated by a periodic flow condition applied to inlet and outlet flow boundaries as if the observed biofilm colony would repeat periodically e g haaksman et al 2017 three dimensional effects these could arise from biofilm deformation in the out of plane direction y not considered in the plain strain mechanical model as neither 3 d flow components were considered certainly for an accurate evaluation of the biofilm mechanical properties volumetric biofilm deformations should be acquired by oct and then interpreted by a full 3 d fluid structure interaction model the difficulty however is not only a strongly increased computing time and memory but more importantly the integration of the oct image into the computational model surface smoothing noise removal and advanced image thresholding would be needed to construct a meshable 3 d object nevertheless such techniques exist for example developed when importing 3 d ct scans of complex structures into cfd models haaksman et al 2017 in extension we believe that the methodology developed here could also be applied in flow cells or channels with non rectangular geometry or irregular walls however the requirement of an optical window allowing for the visualization by means of oct remains biofilm erosion and detachment these could affect the recorded biofilm shape at high re numbers it cannot be excluded that the slight biofilm compression observed at high flow rates could also be due to surface erosion i e loss of biofilm material as a result of fluid shear forces 5 conclusions this study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded in 2 d slices by optical coherence tomography imaging with poroelastic fluid structure interaction numerical computations the present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini fluidic rectangular channels this improved prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface total stress including also pressure is accounted for any biofilm shape can be practically used in the determinations and non linear behavior of

19329,the advantage of using non invasive imaging such as optical coherence tomography oct to asses material properties from deformed biofilm geometries can be compromised by the assumptions made on fluid forces acting on the biofilm this study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded by oct imaging with poroelastic fluid structure interaction computations two dimensional biofilm geometries were extracted from oct scans of non deformed and deformed structures as a result of hydrodynamic loading the biofilm geometries were implemented in a model coupling fluid dynamics with elastic solid mechanics and darcy flow in the biofilm the simulation results were compared with real deformed geometries and a fitting procedure allowed estimation of the young s modulus in given flow conditions the present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini fluidic rectangular channels this superior prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface total stress including also pressure is accounted for any biofilm shape can be used in the determinations and non linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated biofilm elastic moduli

and removal strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilm mechanics elastic modulus poroelastic model fluid structure interaction imaging 1 introduction formation of biofilms is regarded as a strategy of microbes to thrive in flowing environments and to protect themselves from environmental stresses by living attached to interfaces biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms e g bacteria algae fungi embedded in extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming and wingender 2010 the eps consist of a variety of proteins polysaccharides and other substances which form a hydrogel network stabilizing the biofilm structure and allowing the biofilm to withstand external stresses induced by the surrounding flow beside the exact composition structure and functions of the biofilm matrix the mechanical properties of biofilms are still not entirely known currently the biofilm mechanical properties cannot be predicted based on the acting microorganisms or growth conditions nevertheless for water quality control in drinking water distribution systems shen et al 2016 or for a reliable control of biofilm thickness in biofilm reactors e g by backwashing of other mechanical methods the knowledge of the mechanical stability would be extremely helpful morgenroth and wilderer 1999 guelon et al 2011 provided a comprehensive overview of methods by which the mechanical properties of biofilms can be measured biofilm material can be subjected to ex situ tests in well known and standardized equipment e g rheometers however developing in situ measurement methods appears to be important as we do not know how quickly the mechanical properties might change if the biofilm is removed from its original environment guelon et al 2011 a further review by böl et al 2013 related the available methods for identification of mechanical properties with the numerical modelling efforts they concluded that none of the existing methods by itself can cover the whole spectrum of biofilm behavior böl et al 2013 based on this statement the combination of biofilm modelling together with in situ experimental measurements of biofilm deformation could be a good approach to ascertain the mechanical properties of biofilms in their natural environment for this aim a fast and non invasive imaging technique such as the optical coherence tomography oct is required wagner and horn 2017 martin et al 2014 used two dimensional 2d oct cross sections as a basis for the biofilm geometry to assess by numerical modelling the permeation fluxes through membranes covered with patchy biofilms li et al 2016 performed similar studies using also 2d cross sections from oct they could show that higher substrate fluxes were obtained for heterogeneous biofilm surface structures moreover fortunato et al 2016 used oct cross sections to visualize biofouling in submerged membranes they used the acquired imaging data to calculate the decrease in flux due to the biofouling and their theoretical estimations differed by only 5 from the original flux a step forward was made by blauert et al 2015 who managed to record 2d biofilm deformation in movies made with oct confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was also combined with oscillatory shear rheology to measure the storage modulus g and loss modulus g connecting the g values to variations in eps waters et al 2014 other authors used magnetic particles embedded in growing biofilms which were manipulated by magnetic tweezers generating a 3d map of mechanical biofilm properties galy et al 2012 most of the numerical simulation studies aiming at describing dynamics of biofilm formation assumed the biofilm as a non deformable rigid material even when biofilm deformation and detachment were coupled with flow induced stresses the biofilm was assumed as an elastically deformable but quasi static structure martin et al 2015 picioreanu et al 2001 radu et al 2010 several other studies combined the flow with biofilm deformation in a dynamic fashion tierra et al 2015 the new possibility of simulating moving geometries allowed fluid structure interaction biofilm models to describe for example oscillations of a biofilm streamers taherzadeh et al 2010 and their effect on increased substrate uptake taherzadeh et al 2012 the question is how the measured mechanical data can be combined with models typically the fluid structure interaction in biofilms is simulated with continuum approaches based on partial differential equations e g finite element finite volume etc relying on published values of mechanical properties such as young s modulus and poison s ratio taherzadeh et al 2010 a finite element software ansys was used by towler et al to simulate the steady state fluid structure interaction of a hemispherical biofilm structure in turbulent flow using a linear viscoelastic burger constitutive relation for the biofilm material towler et al 2006 other authors applied a immersed boundary method to biofilm deformation simulated in a discrete approach based on particles connected by springs e g alpkvist and klapper 2007 nevertheless all numerical models need realistic values of biofilm properties elastic viscoelastic or plastic within this study 2d images of deforming biofilms under defined flow conditions were used to derive biofilm mechanical properties by a series of numerical simulations mimicking the fluid structure interaction the biofilm imaging has been performed with oct in micro fluidic flow channels blauert et al 2015 this method proved several advantages especially over clsm imaging for study of biofilm mechanics it is non invasive and in situ does not require staining it can provide images at meso scale millimeters and it is relatively fast 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilm cultivation biofilms were cultivated in flow cells made of poly methyl methacrylate with a straight channel of 2 1 124 mm width height length the flow cells were inoculated with activated sludge supernatant from a local waste water treatment plant ka karlsruhe germany for 24 h before the supernatant was replaced by the cultivation medium biofilm cultivation was performed with acetate 20 mg l or glucose 24 mg l the cultivation medium included one of the substrates together with nutrient and trace element solutions the nutrient solution contained concentrations in mg l k2hpo4 2 mgso4 7h2o 12 ca no3 2 4h2o 8 nh4 so4 12 and feso4 7h2o 6 the trace element solution included in μg l h3bo3 300 cocl2 7h2o 130 cucl2 8 mnso4 h2o 20 na2moo4 2h2o 26 nicl2 6h2o 10 and znso4 7h2o 56 the solution was phosphate buffered to ph 7 and aerated to a dissolved oxygen concentration of 8 mg l biofilms were cultivated at flow rates corresponding to reynolds numbers r e d h u a v ρ μ from 11 to 472 calculated with measured average flow velocity u av water density ρ and viscosity μ and hydraulic diameter d h 2 h w h w 1 33 mm for the flow cell width w and height h biofilm development was followed by oct blauert et al 2015 blauert 2017 2 2 biofilm visualization and image processing imaging data sets containing the biofilm geometry were acquired by means of optical coherence tomography ganymede i thorlabs gmbh lübeck germany briefly oct measures a point reflection signal from the biofilm and produces a depth resolved intensity profile along the scan axis z direction here the flow cell height by acquiring several scans along one lateral axis x direction here the flow cell length a cross sectional image is produced in the xz plane consecutive cross sections along the other lateral axis the flow cell width y generates a full volumetric representation as detailed in haisch and niessner 2007 wagner et al 2010 xi et al 2006 oct is suitable for in situ biofilm imaging at the meso scale e g millimeter scale no staining is required it is non invasive and acquires imaging data sets fast cross sections are obtained within milliseconds and full volumetric representations can be visualized within seconds this allows oct to follow fast processes over time either in real time for 2 d cross sections or in time lapsed mode for 3 d volumetric representations for the mechanical study cross sections of 2 1 mm2 1024 1024 pixels were acquired which corresponds to a resolution of 2 μm in the x direction and 2 9 μm in the z direction the images were then cut to the area of interest containing the biofilm structure from these oct images the biofilm surface coordinates x z were manually extracted with the free software graph data extractor a j mattheuws the list of points x z was used to create polygonal shapes representing the biofilm geometry in the numerical simulations performed in comsol multiphysics comsol 5 3 comsol inc burlington ma 2 3 shear induced biofilm deformation experiments experiments were carried out by step wise changes in flow velocity and recording the corresponding biofilm deformation with oct in a time lapse series two recorded geometries were used for each biofilm one at the unloaded geometry no flow zero shear and the other at full steady state deformation details can be found in blauert et al 2015 the acquired data sets of the deformed and un deformed structures were processed and loaded as model geometries into comsol multiphysics for the numerical evaluation of mechanical properties 2 4 numerical model 2 4 1 model geometry the two dimensional model in fig 1 presents an example of biofilm geometry sub domain ω b extracted from oct images on which the fluid and solid mechanics calculations were based the irregularly shaped biofilm sub domain was placed in a rectangular box length l x 3 mm and height l z 1 mm representing an oct cross section of the flow cell along the flow direction the difference between the outer rectangle and the biofilm sub domain is the fluid sub domain ω f 2 4 2 fluid and solid mechanics the biofilm structure experiences the forces shear and pressure exerted by the moving liquid onto the biofilm surface boundary γfsi in fig 1 as a result the biofilm deforms and this is experienced by the flow as a moving boundary changing the flow pattern this is a two way interaction between the biofilm and the water flow typically referred to as fluid structure interaction fsi at the same time inner cohesive forces prevent the biofilm from breaking apart and give rise to internal stresses other processes which may issue internal forces such as bacteria replication motility production of extracellular polymers or aging of the biofilm matrix were neglected during the short time frame seconds to minutes in which the biofilm deformation was investigated however the pressure of water in the biofilm pores was taken into account in a poroelastic model formulation counteracting the pressure exerted by the surrounding liquid pressure gradients in the deformable biofilm pores lead to a slow flow represented by darcy s law fluid flow outside the biofilm fluid flow in the sub domain ω f was modeled by the incompressible laminar navier stokes equations of momentum 1 and mass conservation continuity 2 the range of re numbers investigated up to 550 was well within the laminar flow regime in rectangular section pipes 1 σ f ρ u f u f 2 u f 0 the liquid experiences pressure and viscous forces included in the constitutive eq 3 for the stress tensor σ f 3 σ f p f i μ u f u f t the variables solved for were the flow field velocity vector u f and the liquid pressure p f water density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ were assumed constant with the values at 20 c solution of hydrodynamic equations involved the assumption that eventual biofilm structures upstream and downstream the imaged biofilm would be situated far enough not to affect the flow field in the studied domain a fully established laminar flow profile was imposed in the inflow γ i with an average velocity u av the outflow was set to a constant gauge pressure p 0 on the channel walls γ wt and γ wb no slip was imposed u f 0 on the fsi interface a leaking wall continuity condition was implemented with velocity taken from the darcy flow within the biofilm u f u b fluid flow in the biofilm darcy flow

biofilm with the pressure in biofilm pores p f p b biofilm mechanics the navier equations for a solid in equilibrium with quasi static plane strain 2 d approximation i e negligible small deformation out of the 2 d plane were applied in the biofilm sub domain ω b to represent the biofilm matrix deformation 6 σ b 0 7 v b 0 biofilms display elastic deformation in short stress exposure and viscous flow behavior during long stress exposure klapper et al 2002 shaw et al 2004 stoodley et al 2002 in the experiments studied here the biofilm deformation occurred within seconds with oct b scans acquired between 1 and 3 s from the flow change which is much shorter than the expected transition time from elastic to viscoelastic deformation of 20 min shaw et al 2004 therefore viscous flow creep of the biofilm matrix was neglected and only the elastic behavior was considered however the porous nature of the biofilm cannot be overlooked for a correct representation of the fluid pressure in the biofilm matrix which has to balance the pressure in the water domain therefore the stress tensor in the biofilm included a poroelastic as well as an isotropic linear elastic component 8 σ b α p b i c e ν v b v b t 2 replacing eq 8 in 6 the variables solved for were the displacement field v b and the fluid pressure inside biofilm pores p b the biofilm elasticity tensor c was expressed function of young elasticity modulus e and poisson ratio ν the deformation field is directly influenced by the young s modulus e which can therefore be used as sensitive parameter in fsi models to fit the simulated deformation to the measured deformed geometry the poisson s ratio regulates thereby the lateral to the horizontal deformation additionally the biot willis coefficient α relates the volume change of fluid absorbed into or released from the biofilm to the volumetric change of the porous matrix for soft porous materials α 1 coussy 2004 continuity of total stress σ b σ f was implemented on the fsi boundary as the load exerted by the flow of liquid on the biofilm surface the biofilm was fixed on the support surface γ wf with v b 0 geometry deformation equations 1 8 are shown here in the stationary form because all the results presented in this study are based only on the computed deformation at steady state compared with the oct recorded deformation however the steady state solution was reached in time dependent simulations with the fluid structure interaction coupled through a moving finite element mesh this was needed because preliminary simulations showed that not accounting for the reciprocal fluid structure interaction i e calculating the forces acting on the biofilm surface based only on the initial undeformed geometry introduced errors in the biofilm deformation due to inaccurate load stress distributions zero mesh displacement was prescribed on all boundaries except on biofilm liquid interface γ fsi where displacement was set to v b by the solid mechanics 2 4 3 model solution all model equations were implemented and solved in comsol multiphysics 5 3 by a finite element method model parameters are listed in table 1 a triangular mesh with maximum element size of 10 μm was used flow equations and the deformed geometry were discretized linearly while quadratic discretization with geometric nonlinearity was applied for the solid mechanics in time dependent simulations the flow velocity was increased from 0 to u av in a smoothed step of 1 second all results are reported at steady state after 1 5 s 2 4 4 evaluation of young s modulus e from the simulation parametric sweeps were performed with e from 50 to 800 pa depending on the experiment to find the best overlap of the simulated and real deformed geometry recorded with oct a first optimization criterion compared the non overlapping area of model computed biofilm deformation and experimental deformation δa relative to the area of experimental deformation a e in percents err a δa a e 100 the

integration secondly multiple parameter optimization was performed using the nelder meed algorithm in matlab code coupled with comsol simulations livelink for matlab the objective function to be minimized was constructed as an average distance between points on the computed contour of deformed biofilm and the nearest polygonal segments forming the measured biofilm contour at deformed state err m reported as μm error 3 results 3 1 biofilm deformation measurements the non deformed biofilm geometry used as simulation basis was extracted from oct images furthermore oct images taken for the deformed biofilms exposed to different flow conditions were compared with simulation results biofilm deformation experiments were adapted from blauert 2017 fig 2 a c shows two dimensional oct cross sections of a biofilm cultivated with glucose case biofilm i taken over an area of 2000 500 μm2 a video of the deformation process was added in the supplementary information si v1 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 08 070 the following is the supplementary data related to this article si v1 si v1 other biofilms cases were also investigated biofilm ii and biofilm iii were grown with glucose while biofilm iv was cultivated with acetate oct images of non deformed and deformed biofilm structures are presented in fig 3 a f 3 2 computed flow fields and stress distributions results from the numerical model simulation of fluid biofilm interaction are presented in fig 4 at the stationary state reached after 1 5 s of time dependent simulation with inflow velocity increased during a smooth step of 1 s the results are for the biofilm i case at re 91 but similar solutions were obtained for the other biofilm cases and other re numbers the velocity field shows the expected laminar flow with larger fluid velocity above the biofilm obstruction fig 4a due to the small biofilm permeability and small pressure gradients much less flow establishes through the biofilm pores with a darcy velocity less than 1 μm s fig 4c as a result of the forces exerted by the flow the biofilm deforms and reaches a stationary state an animation of the time dependent simulation is presented in supplementary information si v2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2018 08 070 the following is the supplementary data related to this article si v2 si v2 the simulations considered the total stress applied along the bulk biofilm interface γ fsi that is both shear stress exerted tangentially on the biofilm surface by the viscous flow and pressure acting normally to the biofilm the total stress distributions in fig 4b present values from close to zero to a maximum of 12 pa or n m2 it becomes clear that the pressure dominates on the biofilm frontally exposed to flow exerting a compressive load i e pushing the biofilm inwards conversely on the biofilm top the negative pressure exerted a tensile load i e traction pulling the biofilm outwards interestingly the pressure max 9 pa is larger than the shear stress max 3 pa as compared in fig 4c the shear was found to act mainly on the up front biofilm surface in the rest being much smaller than the pressure slightly increased friction was only on the high points in the middle of the biofilm structure this shows that the tested biofilm was mainly compressed from the upstream side and experienced a small drag along the whole structure due to the shear forces the forces on the biofilm surface produce mechanical stress non uniformly distributed in the biofilm fig 4b the von mises stress reduces the local stress in all directions to one scalar value making it easier to compare the local stress to a failure criterion for which the material would break naturally the fluid forces exerted on the biofilm front coincide with the largest deformation and largest internal stresses in this region simulation showed the highest stresses close to the upstream contact point of biofilm and substratum hinge effect where the main deformation would occur were the biofilm not firmly attached to substratum however comparison of the computed deformation in the hinge area with the collected oct images is not easy the apparent gliding effect of the biofilm base at higher re flows fig 2b and c was not considered in the simulations which assumed the whole biofilm base fixed to the support fig 2d and e and fig 4 3 3 assessment of the elastic modulus e the evaluation of material elastic modulus was done by performing a parametric sweep over a range of e values to find the best fit for the computed deformation to the measured deformed biofilm geometry while in conventional fsi simulations the model is set with known mechanical parameters and the desired output is the deformed geometry in this study the method can be seen as reversed the deformed geometry was used to assess values of the mechanical properties as an example for the biofilm i changing the elastic modulus resulted in important geometry changes upon flow at re 172 fig 5 a as expected large deformations occur at smaller values of e while compression occurs on the biofilm frontal zone traction takes place on the upper biofilm sections a value of e around 160 pa was found to fit best the measured deformed biofilm contour with an error of 14 μm in average fig 2e at the lower re 91 the elastic modulus best fitting the recorded structure deformation was 80 pa with err m 11 μm and err a 3 5 as displayed in fig 2d table 2 lists the model measurement differences for the parametric sweep of the young s modulus from 50 to 120 pa smaller e lead to a rapid degradation of the fit as the structure deforms too much both error measures lead to the same conclusions given the strong 2 d simplification the model comes remarkably close to the real deformation the simulated displacement field is in good agreement with the shear stress distribution showing that the largest displacement is in the upper front region the main deformations always occur in the frontal region of the biofilm this being also the most difficult part to model correctly for the simulations a poisson ratio of ν 0 4 was chosen in similarity with gels geissler and hecht 1981 and with theoretical estimations by laspidou and aravas 2007 due to lack of other experiments the poisson s ratio relates the lateral to transverse elongation during the deformation process influencing the deformation field within the biofilm matrix parametric sweeps with the poisson ratio reveal that the simulated biofilm structure sinks as lower values are chosen fig 5b while keeping the same e however the choice of a conservative value of ν 0 4 results in good fits not only for biofilm i but also for the other cases fig 3 simulations with different values of biot parameter α and biofilm permeability κ showed practically no model sensitivity within an acceptable range of values α between 1 and biofilm porosity of 0 6 κ changed by two orders of magnitude see si fig s3 in addition to biofilm i other biofilm structures were examined glucose grown biofilms ii and iii and acetate grown biofilm iv the simulated and measured biofilm deformations are summarized in fig 3 while all tests and conditions reported here are listed in table 3 overall the agreement between the measured and computed deformations was good simpler biofilm shapes and smaller biofilm areas seem to lead to better results biofilm iii err m 5 μm and biofilm iv err m 9 μm the obtained e values for these biofilms appear notably higher than for biofilm i however these deformations were performed at larger re numbers where due to larger forces biofilm hardening effects occur notably more than for biofilm i the pressure dominates over the shear stress in biofilm iii that has a dome like shape fig 6 large pressure pushes the biofilm downstream and pulls it upward max 30 pa while the shear increases as expected over the biofilm height but displays much lower values max 10 pa at the biofilm top this reflects once again the importance of considering correct hydrodynamic representation of forces not only an overall shear such as in previous studies a firm base leads to a more uniform von mises stress distribution within biofilm iii compared with biofilm i 3 4 biofilm hardening and consolidation experimental techniques often evaluate a single value of the elastic modulus for biofilms assuming that this value is valid over a large range of elastic deformations möhle et al 2007 stoodley et al 1999 laspidou and aravas 2007 predicted that the value of young s modulus can be influenced by the change of porosity during deformation as a result biofilm consolidation occurs i e closing or collapsing of voids which leads to an increase of the elastic modulus this biofilm hardening effect was observed experimentally by paramonova et al 2009 in streptococcus dental biofilms however experimental data for biofilm hardening stiffening are still scarce and coupling in situ oct imaging with numerical modelling of biofilm deformation under a range of flow velocities could contribute to the quantification of this effect recently biofilm hardening at large stresses has been observed for biofilms formed in gravity driven filtration upon applied step wise changes in permeate flux or trans membrane pressure jafari et al 2018 in addition to hardening biofilm consolidation has also been reported alpkvist et al 2006 meaning that the biofilm base becomes denser in time the increase of biofilm density toward the support was experimentally evaluated in several studies e g zhang and bishop 1994 however whether this also leads to increased biofilm stiffness i e with increased e compared with the upper younger biofilm layers still remains to be measured the hardening effect is evident in the experiments with biofilm i the young s modulus evaluated at re 91 was 80 pa while at re 172 a value of 160 pa was found to fit best the data when applying the e 80 pa for re 172 case unrealistically large deformations were calculated the biofilm hardening and consolidation were also measured in a separate biofilm case biofilm v as shown in fig 7 for this biofilm grown on glucose deformations were recorded at re 238 and re 477 and the best deformed geometry fits were obtained with e 70 and 190 pa respectively this shows that the biofilms get harder at larger flow velocity i e more applied stress on the biofilm fig 7a and b however the match is not very good especially at the larger re were both the frontal surface and the back of the biofilm deviate from the observed deformation it is clear that the real biofilm deformed less close to the base and more at the top surface than the model with uniform e would predict therefore we have also imposed an elasticity profile with larger e at the base and much smaller at the top as shown in fig 7c and d while for the slow flow the match did not improve for the fast flow re 477 the model computed biofilm deformation fitted better the measurements visibly the frontal region close to base deforms less while the top region deforms more fig 7d no attempt was made to further tune the imposed elasticity profile as for that more local deformation measurements would be needed possibly by tracking the displacement of marked biofilm points these poroelastic simulations show how gradients in biofilm elasticity can explain consolidation effects near the support but also how biofilm compression can be achieved without changing the poisson s ratio however it can not be excluded that the studied biofilms were also deformed plastically i e upon flow rate increase the structure suffered some permanent deformation this would be certainly possible by closing macropores and collapsing the finger like structures often seen at the biofilm surface into a more compact structure 4 discussion 4 1 stress in the biofilm simulations performed in this study showed invariably high stresses within the biofilm frontal section close to the attachment surface similar stress distributions in biofilms were found by taherzadeh et al 2012 who simulated oscillatory biofilm streamer movements the shear stress decreases along the tail of the streamer indicating a phenomenological advantage of the streamlined structure in fast flows böl et al 2009 used a biofilm geometry obtained from confocal laser scanning images for simulation of the fluid structure interaction their work provided similar results to those presented here showing the highest inner stresses around the bended biofilm neckings this also points to the importance of using real biofilm geometries such those in figs 2 and 3 for obtaining a more accurate picture of the shear stress distribution within the biofilm moreover this weak contact point is a possible place where the biofilm detachment begins picioreanu et al 2001 studied in a 2d simulation the influence of shear stress on the detachment behavior of biofilms even though the simulations were based stong simplifing assumptions biofilm as homogeneous elastic material they showed the importance of stress distribution on and within the biofilm structure in determining areas of large deformation as well as regions prone to detachment moreover this created the base for model extensions to multispecies biofilms martin et al 2015 bioclogging of porous media bottero et al 2013 or biofouling of membrane filtration devices radu et al 2010 the method developed in the present study could therefore provide very useful information both input parameters and data to check model output for more elaborate modelling of biofilm detachment a comparison of elastic modulus e obtained in this study with values resulting from other studies is only qualitatively possible the e moduli in this study ranged from 70 to 700 pa table 3 the values are slightly larger than other experimentally determined young s moduli from flow cell setups 40 pa in mixed cultures stoodley et al 1999 blauert et al 2015 20 250 pa for p aeruginosa stoodley et al 1999 2001 klapper et al 2002 other tests of the mechanical strength of biofilms such as compression measurements were used by paramonova et al 2009 yielding values closer to this study e 50 350 pa however direct comparison to other techniques compression indentation atomic force microscopy shear rheometry etc is difficult as long as standardized samples and test conditions do not exist 4 2 importance of shear and pressure exerted by the fluid model results clearly showed that the tested biofilms were mostly compressed upstream and experienced only relatively small shear these findings have actually profound implications on the validity of results obtained in other studies blauert et al 2015 stoodley et al 1999 considering only the shear stress in the determination of the elastic modulus the underestimation of forces acting on a biofilm for which a certain deformation was measured would lead to underestimation of the biofilm stiffness moreover the same value of shear was assumed to act uniformly on the whole biofilm surface in previous studies critically these studies took the shear estimated from the liquid velocity in the empty channel in the calculation of mechanical moduli whereas the biofilm could obstruct an important flow section resulting actually in larger shear for example a shear value τ 0 3 pa was used in blauert et al 2015 for the same biofilm i at re 90 while in the present study an average shear τ 0 66 pa was calculated on the biofilm surface with large local variations from 0 to 3 pa moreover the total stress including pressure was σ 4 1 pa which clearly shows that the estimation of the young s modulus relies on a good assumption of the forces responsible for the deformation considering the shear only can underestimate the actual total stress and therefore the real young s modulus of the biofilm using the newly developed fluid biofilm interaction model we relaxed the assumption of a constant shear stress revealing a more realistic value for the young s modulus in past studies the elastic young s modulus was experimentally evaluated from the linear part of a stress strain plot based on images of biofilm deformation at different shear stress blauert et al 2015 böl et al 2013 stoodley et al 1999 this method requires a certain shape of the biofilm structure and introduces errors from manual calculation of the shear stress and strain for example biofilms had to present a straight edge and certain attack angles of the section facing the flow to allow determination of shear modulus or large finger like structures to calculate the young s modulus from elongation measurements implementing a real biofilm geometry into a numerical simulation should also allow the determination of mechanical parameters from any biofilm geometries considering the coupled fluid biofilm interaction instead of computing deformation based on the forces exerted only on the underformed structure has a certain effect for the coupled model the average total stress over the whole bulk biofilm boundary was σ 4 1 pa and the average shear stress τ 0 66 pa in a decoupled case when biofilm deformation did not affect the flow σ 3 56 pa and τ 0 64 pa this simplification introduces another possible source of errors in the deformation forces the computed biofilm deformation in this case showed indeed less compression and a biofilm pulled slightly more upwards si fig s2 4 3 biofilm hardening porosity and compressibility assuming poisson s ratios close 0 5 imply that the structure would be nearly incompressible requiring that biofilms maintain volume while deforming however in some cases oct imaging of deformation showed that biofilm compression occurs this could be mainly attributed to pressure forces it has also been shown that during the deformation at higher flow velocities the porosity decreases blauert et al 2015 water extrusion from the biofilm makes the structure more rigid several empirical formulae have been proposed to describe the dependence of mechanical strength on porosity ϕ for example for ceramic materials e e 0 1 ϕ ϕcrit n phani and niyogi 1987 implies the existence of a critical porosity at which the young modulus becomes zero or e e 0exp mϕ was proposed for porous sintered materials ryshkewitch 1953 recently a simple power law e e 0ϕ m was used to describe biofilm hardening in gravity driven filtration jafari et al 2018 related to compression under pressure or due to flow induced internal friction additionally re arrangement of polysaccharides and polypeptides may also play a role in biofilm stiffening especially when the shear stress is applied longer than viscoelastic relaxation times minutes shaw et al 2004 the results of this study are in agreement with the theoretical estimations of elastic modulus change with decreasing porosity by laspidou and aravas 2007 in their model the decrease in porosity at least doubled the young s modulus while a similar trend was found in our study moreover laspidou and aravas showed that by assuming a compressible or incompressible biofilm material the slope of both young s modulus and poisson s ratio with the strain can also be altered unfortunately the oct imaging alone does not reveal mechanical heterogeneity of the biofilm oct might well be used to reveal denser regions inside the structure to include heterogeneity in future calculations it may also be possible to couple particle tracking techniques with oct to determine deformation fields and from this to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of mechanical properties within the biofilm 4 4 sources of errors in the oct model determination of mechanical properties several factors that may compromise the accuracy of determination of elastic properties by coupling oct imaging with numerical modelling have been already discussed these included non elastic behaviors viscoelastic or plastic non linear elasticity with biofilm hardening at high applied loads and compression with porosity change e g biofilm porosity decrease up to 10 blauert et al 2015 has a hardening effect mechanical consolidation of base layers or other factors leading to heterogeneous distribution of properties e g if bacteria tend to build clusters regions of locally stiffer or softer biofilm can develop other possible interferring factors are discussed here steady state deformation not achieved this could be caused by viscoelastic biofilm behavior which keeps deforming even when the shear stress exerted by the liquid reached a quasi constant value this continuous deformation should however be minimal in the present study because the acquisition time was long enough compared with the viscoelastic time constants seconds measured by other researchers peterson et al 2013 and still short compared with the time scale of long term macromolecular rearrangements 20 min klapper et al 2002 shaw et al 2004 in addition it could be noted that the biofilm imaged in the supplementary information si v1 vibrated slightly under flow with an amplitude of 10 μm the assumed steady deformation should therefore be considered within this marge of error changes in the flow pattern typically the flow established very fast seconds in the performed experiments and the volumetric flowrate was accurately measured however the average velocity value calculated in the simulations from the volumetric flowrate may be altered by variations in the crossectional area higher velocities and shear stress may be caused by biofilm patches not removed by regular cleaning growing on the upper and lateral flowcell walls which decrease the flow section the flow pattern could also be affected by biofilm colonies growing upstream the observed biofilm patch and much less by those downstream which can only affect the recirculation vortex behind the obstacle in the flow we used here fully developed laminar flow in inlet with an average velocity corresponding to measured volumetric flowrate this excluding influences by other upstream obstacles on the flow pattern however if other biofilm colonies are placed upstream the water velocity near the biofilm base will be slower recirculation zones will occur and the forces upon the biofilm base will be smaller this could eventally be approximated by a periodic flow condition applied to inlet and outlet flow boundaries as if the observed biofilm colony would repeat periodically e g haaksman et al 2017 three dimensional effects these could arise from biofilm deformation in the out of plane direction y not considered in the plain strain mechanical model as neither 3 d flow components were considered certainly for an accurate evaluation of the biofilm mechanical properties volumetric biofilm deformations should be acquired by oct and then interpreted by a full 3 d fluid structure interaction model the difficulty however is not only a strongly increased computing time and memory but more importantly the integration of the oct image into the computational model surface smoothing noise removal and advanced image thresholding would be needed to construct a meshable 3 d object nevertheless such techniques exist for example developed when importing 3 d ct scans of complex structures into cfd models haaksman et al 2017 in extension we believe that the methodology developed here could also be applied in flow cells or channels with non rectangular geometry or irregular walls however the requirement of an optical window allowing for the visualization by means of oct remains biofilm erosion and detachment these could affect the recorded biofilm shape at high re numbers it cannot be excluded that the slight biofilm compression observed at high flow rates could also be due to surface erosion i e loss of biofilm material as a result of fluid shear forces 5 conclusions this study developed a method for the determination of elastic properties of biofilms by modelling the biofilm deformation recorded in 2 d slices by optical coherence tomography imaging with poroelastic fluid structure interaction numerical computations the present method considerably improves the estimation of elastic moduli of biofilms grown in mini fluidic rectangular channels this improved prediction is based on the relaxation of several simplifying assumptions made in past studies shear stress is not anymore taken constant over the biofilm surface total stress including also pressure is accounted for any biofilm shape can be practically used in the determinations and non linear behavior of mechanical properties can be estimated biofilm elastic moduli between 70 and 700 pa were obtained and biofilm hardening at large applied stress due to increasing flow velocity was quantified the work performed here opens the way for in situ determination of other mechanical properties poisson ratio viscoelastic modulus and relaxation time plastic yields etc furthermore this provides data for
