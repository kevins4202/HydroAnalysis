15745,the electrochemical oxidation method is a promising technology for the degradation of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos however the elimination processes of pfos are still unknown including the electron transfer pathway key reactive sites and degradation mechanism here we fabricated diatomite and cerium ce co modified sb2o3 d ce sb2o3 anode to realize efficient degradation of pfos via peroxymonosulfate pms activation the transferred electron and the generated hydroxyl radical oh can high effectively decompose pfos the electron can be rapidly transferred from the highest occupied molecular orbital of the pfos to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the pms via the d ce sb2o3 driven by a potential energy difference under electrochemical process the active site of ce o in the d ce sb2o3 can greatly reduce the migration distance of the electron and the oh and thus improving the catalytic activity for degrading various organic micropollutants with high stability in addition the electrochemical process shows strong resistance and tolerance to the changing ph inorganic ions and organic matter this study offers insights into the electron transfer pathway and pms activation mechanism in pfos removal via electrochemical oxidation paving the way for its potential application in water purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctane sulfonate electrochemical oxidation peroxymonosulfate activation hydroxyl radical reaction mechanism 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs have been widely applied in various fields such as leather treatment carpet manufacturing fire fighting foams and medical equipments since 1950s due to their unique physicochemical properties including lipophobicity hydrophobicity and thermal and chemical stability zhang et al 2020 however the wide application of pfcs which have been detected in various environmental media causes serious environmental issue because of their toxicity and environmental persistence sun et al 2011 among these pfcs perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have received intensive attention owing to their larger accumulation property and tolerance to degradation nevertheless which bring potential serious human health issues including cancer genotoxicity developmental toxicity neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity lan et al 2020 wen et al 2019 due to these potential health risks pfos and pfoa have been identified as persistent organic pollutants pops and listed in annex b of the stockholm convention in 2009 with limiting emission standard of 70 ng l 1 in drinking water zhai et al 2016 the traditional wastewater purification technology cannot effectively remove the pfos due to the high energy c f bonds 530 kj mol 1 and high redox potential of fluorine duan et al 2020 based on the reported data the monitored concentration of the pfos in ground water was 60 18000 ng l 1 in europe usa and china li et al 2022a llorca et al 2012 the concentration in surface water was 4 2709 ng l 1 in india china and japan braunig et al 2017 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021b worldwide distribution of the persistent pfos promotes us to explore highly efficient methods for purifying and removing the pfos traditional wastewater treatment technologies including chemical oxidation and biodegradation cannot effectively destruct pfos or pfoa to short chain pfcs chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 although some oxidation methods such as sonochemistry photocatalytic oxidation and plasma decomposition have been used to remove pfos or pfoa these treatment approaches need stringent experimental conditions high energy consumption long reaction time high ph levels and temperatures gole et al 2018 sun et al 2022 zhan et al 2020 either advanced oxidation processes aops with the generation of reactive oxygen species ross cannot successfully decompose the stable carbon chains with full fluorine li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 compared with the above methods the electrochemical oxidation eo process can realize the degradation and mineralization of pfcs due to the strong oxidation capacity high reaction rate and environmental compatibility under mild conditions wang et al 2020b consequently eo process as a promising alternative can be potentially applied in the degradation of pfcs from the water environment excellent removal efficiency of pfcs is dependent on the generation ability of ross the conductivity of the electrode and the transferred speed of electrons on the anode materials shin et al 2019 according to the previous studies boron doped diamond bdd and ti sno2 sb anode using naclo4 as electrolyte achieved excellent degradation performance for pfos removal under eo process with the high kinetic constant of 0 0779 and 0 0354 min 1 respectively shin et al 2019 wang et al 2021a nevertheless these electrodes are not ideal for scale up application owing to relatively low reaction rate high cost and the leaching of metal ions during the degradation of pfcs li et al 2020a therefore it is significant to develop stable highly efficient and cost effective electrode to mineralize and degrade pfcs via eo process intensive exploration of anode electrodes has promoted the quick development of ti based electrodes for example zhuo et al used ti sno2 sb2o5 pbo2 ptfe as anode to decompose pfos achieving a removal efficiency of 92 1 with a current density of 40 ma cm 2 zhuo et al 2020 wang et al utilized ti sno2 sb membrane anode to degrade pfos and pfoa with strong oxidants of naclo4 in electrolyte harvesting high kinetic constant of 0 0337 min 1 with an energy consumption of 37 46 kwh m 3 order 1 wang et al 2021a although some good performance was obtained via these electrodes the leaching of metal ions harmful to the safety of the water environment which has been a major issue to the application of eo technology diatomite can be employed as a carrier to effectively modify and support metal oxides to form stable structure because of the specific skeleton with large porosity and abundant surface hydroxyls yuan et al 2020 consequently diatomite is used to modify metal oxides for preventing the leaching of metal ions in our study in addition owing to of the advantageous of environmental benignity easy of fabrication low cost and high theoretical capacity sb2o3 is used as a metal oxide electrode for the reformation of diatomite du et al 2021 to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency and lifespan of sb2o3 electrode the cerium ce element is used to modify the sb2o3 surface layer to disperse internal stress and increase the binding force between the active layer and the electrode wang et al 2020c thus diatomite and ce co modified sb2o3 d ce sb2o3 is used as the anode electrode in our study in these previous studies naclo4 a strong oxidant has been served as the electrolyte for effectively removing pfcs under eo process shi et al 2019 however naclo4 is also a persistent and hazardous contaminant as result the unsuitable use will bring an explosion and secondary pollutant zheng et al 2020 to replace the naclo4 and enhance the conductivity and reactivity of the electrolyte peroxymonosulfate pms is used as an oxidant to produce ross oh so4 1o2 and o2 to activate the reaction and promote the degradation of pfcs li et al 2022b the oh and so4 can be easily generated via the pms activation reaction owing to its asymmetric structure interestingly these ross are more efficient for organic pollutants degradation via indirect oxidation than the direct oxidation process chai et al 2017 li et al 2022d nevertheless the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these ross remain unclear during eo process along with pms activation eo pms process and the reaction pathway and adsorption energy between pms and the anode electrode need further clarification although many ross are generated under eo process the dominant contribution for removing pfos is still uncertain the reaction mechanism and electron transfer pathway between the pfos pms and the anode electrode also need to be confirmed and proved for example how does the pfos adsorb on the surface of the anode electrode what is the key active center for pms activation the aim of this work is to develop an electrochemical technology for high efficiently degradation of persistent organic contaminants from the water environment in addition this study is also designed to explore the pathway of electron transfer among pfos pms and the electrode figure out the generation mechanism of ross and clarify key reaction sites for pfos adsorption and degradation herein the novel d ce sb2o3 electrode is fabricated to compensate the leaching defects of metal ions and the eo pms process with d ce sb2o3 electrode is employed to effectively degrade pfos different quenching reaction esr trapping method and ros quantitative analysis are used to demonstrate the dominant contribution of different ross the key active centre pms adsorption behaviour on electrode electron transfer together with the radical generation pathway was supported by the density functional theory dft calculation the stability and feasibility of d ce sb2o3 electrode for the removal of pfos from water environment via eo pms process are confirmed based on the results of different supporting electrolyte recycling tests degradation performance of various organics and defluorination properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study are analytical grade without any further purification the detailed information is provided in text s1 2 2 electrode preparation and characterization ti plates 4 4 cm were immersed in naoh solution at 100 c for 2 h and then etched in boiling oxalic acid for 4 h to remove grease and produce gray surface the electrode was fabricated by the sol gel method firstly ethylene glycol and citric acid were mixed and agitated at 60 c for 6 h and then heated at 100 c for 2 h secondly the sbcl3 was dissolved in isopropanol with the molar ratio of 1 3 10 for sb citric acid ethylene glycol respectively thirdly the ce no3 3 was introduced into the above mixture to achieve a molar ratio of 9 1 for sb ce respectively after 1 h reaction amounts of purified diatomite and the h2so4 were added into the mixture with a mass ratio of 9 1 2 for sb ce diatomite the mixture was kept at 100 c for 2 h to form sol gel finally the sol gel solution was coated on both sides of the ti plates after that the above ti plates were dried at 120 c for 15 min in an oven and sintered at 500 c for 10 min in a muffle furnace the continuous operates were repeated 16 times and the last baking was maintained at 500 c for 2 h the obtained electrode was defined as the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode the ti ce sb2o3 electrode was prepared by the same method without the introduction of diatomite the surface morphology of these electrodes was observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem merlin zeiss germany coupled with elemental dispersive spectroscopy eds the chemical state of elements was detected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha 2 3 electrochemical experiments all electrochemical experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor organic glass with an effective volume of 500 ml a ti plate electrode and the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode 40 40 mm were used as cathode and anode electrode respectively and the electrode gap between the two electrode was kept at 2 0 cm these electrodes were connected to a dc power supply beijing hansheng puyuan technology co ltd via the wires all electrochemical experiments were run at room temperature 26 2 c with a magnetic stirring apparatus at a stirring speed of 800 rpm min 1 the reactor electrolyte containing na2so4 10 mm target organic contaminants 10 mg l 1 and a certain amount of the pms solution h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust ph value of the electrolyte samples 1 0 ml contained 100 µl of methanol were periodically extracted from the reaction reactor all experiments were carried out at least twice 2 4 analytical methods the target organic contaminants pfos and pfoa were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms equipped with an api4000 q trap spectroscopy these other organic pollutants containing tetracycline tc acid orange 7 ao7 and phenol were measured by hplc agilent 1200 the total organic carbon toc in all experiments was detected via a shimadzu toc toc l csh cn200 the released ross were measured by an electron paramagnetic response epr bruker usa spectrum with the dmpo or temp as spin trapping reagents the concentration of the pms was detected by an abts colorimetric method liang et al 2008 linear sweep voltammetry lsv was carried out in an electrochemical workstation cs310 corrtest with a three electrode system where ag agcl electrode pt wire electrode and catalysts electrode were used as reference electrode counter electrode and working electrode respectively in addition the scanning range was 0 1 5 v at the scanning rate of 5 mv s 1 during lsv measurements 2 5 theoretical calculation to explore the reaction mechanism and key active sites during electrochemical degradation pfos dft calculation was carried out using dmol3 program package in materials studios based on the generalized gradient approximation gga in the form of the perdew burke ernerhof function aihara 1999 ricca et al 2018 the adsorption energy eads of the pms on the electrode surface was defined as the following 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u r f a c e e p m s where etotal is the adsorption energy of the pms on the electrode surface esurface is the energy of isolated electrode surface epms is the energy of isolated monomer facets 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface structure of electrodes the preparation process of the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode was illustrated in fig 1 a the ce doped sb2o3 was formed by a series of mixing and heating process then the desired ti d ce sb2o3 electrode was obtained via further modified by diatomite obviously the purified diatomite was in the disk shape with many small nanopores on the smooth surface fig s1a b the synthesized pure ceo2 showed a flower structure with a diameter of 0 8 µm fig s1c d and the pure sb2o3 possessed a soft ribbon structure with a diameter of 150 nm fig s1e f however the ce sb2o3 showed a stable bar morphology fig 1b c which was significantly different with that of the pure sb2o3 due to the introduction of the ce element the elemental mapping images figs 1i 6 showed c n o sb and ce were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ce sb2o3 electrode further confirming effective doping process of the ce into sb2o3 afterwards the formed ce sb2o3 electrode was further regulated and modified by the diatomite and h2so4 and then the bar morphology was broken and redistributed to form the final d ce sb2o3 electrode as shown in fig 1d f many diamond particles 120 150 nm with burrs like shape were observed and uniformly distributed on the surface of electrode in addition the elemental mapping analysis figs 1h 6 also demonstrated the uniform distribution of the c n o sb ce and si on the electrode surface furthermore the diameter of burrs gauged by imagej software was 7 8 nm fig 1g and the formed a great deal of burrs stably coated on the electrode surface which was beneficial to the electrochemical oxidation process chemical valence states of the ti d ce sb2o3 were examined by xps fig s2 shows the high resolution sb 3d spectrum two characteristics peaks located at 530 2 and 539 4 ev were assigned to sb0 3p5 2 and sb0 3p3 2 respectively cui et al 2017 the other characteristics peaks located at 531 3 and 539 6 ev were attributed to sb3 3p5 2 and sb3 3p3 2 respectively the corresponding energy gap was 9 21 and 8 31 ev for sb0 and sb3 respectively after eo process these characteristic peaks showed minor shift with the corresponding energy gap slightly shifting to 9 17 and 8 20 ev for sb0 and sb3 respectively shi et al 2021 little change of peak location suggested that the electrode was stable before and after reaction further confirming the excellent stability for this eo process 3 2 removal efficacy of pfos in various process various processes contained electrodes with different catalysts used only electrodes used only pms used different pms concentration and current density used will greatly affect the degradation performance of pfos fig 2 a exhibites the time dependence of the electrochemical degradation of the pfos under different anode electrodes overall quicker decay was found over the d ce sb2o3 electrode than the other electrodes with almost complete degradation of the pfos within 30 min of electrolysis in comparison the pfos removal efficiency at 30 min was 93 2 1 2 41 6 0 8 and 26 4 1 5 for the ce sb2o3 sb2o3 ceo2 electrodes respectively in addition only 12 3 0 9 of the pfos was removed via a single eo process suggesting weak removing performance of the pfos via single eo process effective removal of the pfos via the d ce sb2o3 electrode confirmed the great potential of the eo process with the pms activation in addition different kinetic curves were also obtained upon electrolysis of the pfos with different electrodes as shown in fig s3a the pfos degradation curves via these electrodes well fitted by pseudo first order behavior the d ce sb2o3 electrode achieved a high reaction rate constant of 0 117 min 1 which was 1 33 6 5 and 11 7 folds higher than that of the ce sb2o3 0 088 min 1 sb2o3 0 018 min 1 ceo2 0 010 min 1 electrodes respectively the high reaction rate constant for the d ce sb2o3 electrode led to rapid removal of the pfos moreover the corresponding toc changes were also investigated obviously the toc removal ratios of the pfos fig 2b were 83 8 2 2 74 2 1 6 38 8 2 6 and 22 7 1 4 for the d ce sb2o3 ce sb2o3 sb2o3 ceo2 electrodes after 30 min electrolysis respectively further implying that the d ce sb2o3 electrode can efficiently mineralize the pfos to small molecule and co2 the improved performance of the d ce sb2o3 electrode can be ascribed to diatomite and ce co doping enhanced the electron transfer rate of the d ce sb2o3 electrode the previous studies reported that the generation ability of ross and the electron transfer ability of the electrode materials play an important role in degrading pfcs wang et al 2020b our studies results indicated that the d ce sb2o3 electrode exhibited effective electron transfer ability and the generation of a great deal of the ros ability consequently the d ce sb2o3 electrode achieved much higher pfos degradation efficiency kinetic rate constants and toc removal rate than the other electrodes and thus the d ce sb2o3 electrode was selected to explore the key active site and the reaction mechanism in the following experiments the current density determined the generating amounts of ross for the pfos degradation during the eo process fig 2c shows that pfos was rapidly removed on the d ce sb2o3 electrode with 10 mm na2so4 as electrolyte and the pfos removal efficiency was significantly increased as the current density increased from 1 to 20 ma cm 2 the pfos was completely removed within 30 min at a current density of 10 or 20 ma cm 2 in addition the degradation behavior of the pfos was well fitted by pseudo first order equation fig s3b with a high reaction rate constant for the pfos degradation 0 186 min 1 achieved at current density of 20 ma cm 2 it obviously increased from 0 011 to 0 186 min 1 with an increase of current density from 1 to 20 ma cm 2 although the reaction rate constant for the pfos degradation at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 was higher than that of 10 ma cm 2 the consume time for complete removal of the pfos was the same and the system will consume more energy at 20 ma cm 2 than 10 ma cm 2 it was demonstrated that a high current supply would destroy electrode and bring the release of metal ion on the electrode surface wang et al 2020a consequently the current density of 10 ma cm 2 was chosen for the subsequent pfos degradation meanwhile toc removal under different current density can also confirm the above findings as shown in fig 2d the mineralization of the pfos at 10 ma cm 2 was 83 8 2 2 after 30 min reaction which was slightly lower than 85 6 1 8 at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 the results suggest that the pfos can be effectively removed and mineralized at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 which was beneficial to practical application of the eo pms process for pfos degradation fig 3 a shows that the pms alone can hardly degrade the pfos within 30 min 0 8 without activation process which was consistent with the previous study wu et al 2020 obviously the pfos can be removed with the addition of the pms under the d ce sb2o3 electrode a rapid increase of the pfos was observed from 61 4 0 8 to 99 8 0 15 with the increase of initial pms concentration from 1 to 5 mm meanwhile the reaction rate constant of the pfos was also increased from 0 023 to 0 117 min 1 with the pms concentration fig s4 however the further increase of the pms concentration to 10 mm brought the decrease of removal efficiency 96 5 1 5 and rate constant 0 106 min 1 resulting from the scavenging reaction between ros and pms li et al 2019 toc removal ratio was detected after 30 min electrolysis to explore the efficacy of the pms activation for the pfos mineralization as exhibited in fig 3b the toc removal ratio was the highest with the pms 5 mm at 10 55 9 1 6 or 30 min 83 8 2 2 indicating that the pfos can be efficiently mineralized to short chain molecule or co2 the above results confirmed that the d ce sb2o3 electrode with pms of 5 mm tended to have better oxidation ability than the other concentration moreover the electric energy was consumed during the eo pms process and electric energy per order ee o was a critical indicator to assess energy consumption under various process ee o can be achieved based on eq 2 the ee o value was firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the pms concentration from 1 to 10 mm the 5 mm pms achieved the lowest ee o value up to 0 025 kwh kg 1 suggesting that 5 mm pms was more energy efficient than the other concentrations 2 e e o p t 1000 v 60 lg c 0 c t based on the lsv curves fig 3d much higher oxygen evolution potential oep 1 29 v vs ag agcl was observed with the addition of the pms than without the pms 1 23 v vs ag agcl meanwhile lower current response was obtained from the pms curves at the same potential the lsv results suggested that the addition of the pms into electrolyte can reduce the energy consumption inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction and improve the electrochemical selectivity to the pfos degradation song et al 2018 3 3 identification and contribution of reactive oxygen species during the eo pms process for degrading pfos the oh and so4 were the key active species here different scavengers were used to determine the contribution of different ross oh so4 o2 and 1o2 to the pfos degradation in the eo pms process li et al 2022c as shown in fig 4 a b the removal ratio of pfos was significantly inhibited with the addition of scavengers with high concentration however no obvious inhibition effect was observed in fig 4c d suggesting that o2 and 1o2 were not generated for the pfos degradation during the eo pms process based on the kinetic curves fig s5 we found that the reaction rate constant was 0 040 min 1 with the addition of 5 mm methanol meoh which further decreased to 0 017 and 0 008 min 1 at 20 and 50 mm meoh respectively meanwhile the reaction rate constant was decreased to 0 024 min 1 with the addition of 50 mm tert butanol tba the above results showed that the degradation performance of the pfos was greatly inhibited with the addition of the meoh and tba and that the oh and so4 were dominant for the pfos degradation during the eo pms process as displayed in fig 4e the reaction rate constant of the pfos was significantly declined with the increase of the tba and meoh concentration from 5 to 50 ppm and seldomly change for the addition of furfuryl alcohol ffa and p benzoquinone bq furthermore various scavengers containing superoxide dismutase sod the bq ki nan3 ffa l histidine lh tba etoh and meoh 50 ppm were used to further confirm the above results evidently only the addition of the tba meoh and etoh brought the decrease of reaction rate constant much weaker inhibition effect for tba than meoh or etoh demonstrates that the oh has larger contribution than the so4 for degrading pfos during the eo pms process to further discriminate the involvement of the oh so4 o2 and 1o2 epr spectroscopy was examined using dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents during the eo pms process wang and wang 2020 it was demonstrated in fig 5 a that no obvious characteristic peaks were observed in the presence of pms only in the electrolyte indicating that the pms alone cannot be effectively activated for radical generation in addition no peaks were detected in these curves of the dmpo o2 and temo 1o2 suggesting the release of o2 and 1o2 during the eo pms process in comparison with these curves some clear characteristic signals of six line peaks ɑh 0 78 1 48 9 6 and 13 2 g and four line peaks an ah 14 9 g were detected which were assigned to dmpo so4 and dmpo oh respectively the intensity of characteristic peaks was further increased with the reaction time and the signal intensity of the oh was much stronger than that of the so4 indicating the continuous generation of the oh and so4 furthermore these radical concentrations were also quantified and exhibited in fig 5b only minor o2 and 1o2 were detected in addition the concentration of the oh radical was significantly higher than that of the so4 radical in 10 or 30 min suggesting the dominant role of the oh radical in the pfos degradation during electrolysis to verify the origin of the o element in these radicals various gases such as n2 ar o2 and air were bubbled into the electrolyte as represented in fig 6 a the rate constant for the pfos degradation exhibited few changes compared to the control experiment in addition the toc removal ratio kept at stable level in 10 or 30 min with the introduction of these gas fig 6b these findings indicated that the o element in these radicals in the eo process was derived from the undissolved oxygen in the electrolyte these ross of the o2 and 1o2 showed negligible contribution for the pfos removal such released the oh and so4 played important role in the degradation of pfos during the eo pms process 3 4 effects of various water metrices electrochemical technology in our study can efficiently remove pfos from aqueous solution based the lab phase we want to apply this technology for treating actual wastewater however various anions cations and natural organic matter humic acid ha have widely distributed in the actual wastewater in addition various water environments exhibit changing ph value these water metrices will affect the degradation performance of pfos though the pfos can be effectively removed under electrochemical process it is still unclear whether the solution ph will promote or inhibit the degradation reaction with this regard electrolytes with different ph values 2 6 3 8 5 2 6 8 7 9 9 3 10 5 11 8 were used to explore the system stability for the pfos degradation via the eo pms process as exhibited in fig 6c the degradation rate for different ph values showed a minor change from 0 115 to 0 117 min 1 the slight fluctuations suggest that the eo pms process can effectively remove pfos under different ph values and the process possessed strong tolerance to the changes in the acidity of the water environment for the potential application of this technology different ions in water environment may bring changes of degradation efficiency for the pfos degradation various anions f cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 cations mg2 ca2 k and na and ha were introduced into the electrolyte to study the effectiveness of the pfos degradation it can be seen from fig 6d f that the reaction rate constant of the pfos kept at stable level with the addition of different anions or cations 1 mm no inhibition effect was found with the ion concentrations even with a further increase to 10 and 30 mm moreover the reaction rate constant of the pfos with the addition of the ha from 5 to 50 mg l 1 displayed similar changes with the above ions fig 6f this indicated that the eo pms process for the pfos degradation showed little interference from general background ions and organic matter existing in water in summary the eo pms process possessed excellent ph tolerance inorganic ions and organic matter adaptability 3 5 reaction mechanism the dft calculation was used to deeply explore the pms activation reaction and key active sites for electron transfer during electrochemical oxidation fig 7 a c shows the images of the pms adsorption on different catalysts and corresponding differential charge density obviously the localized electrons around the active center and charge transfers from the so4 group to the catalyst substrate were observed in addition the adsorption energy of the pms molecule on the active sites of different catalysts and the corresponding the length of the connecting bond were also calculated as shown in fig 7d the d ce sb2o3 3 371 ev possesses more negative adsorption energy than sb2o3 1 729 ev and ce sb2o3 3 332 ev respectively suggesting good affinity of the pms in addition the length of connecting bond for the ce sb2o3 is 2 165 å which is slightly lower than those of the sb2o3 2 187 å and ce sb2o3 2 174 å respectively further demonstrating the stronger interaction between the ce and o atom after the modification of diatomite consequently the d ce sb2o3 showed the best activity for adsorbing the pms during electrochemical oxidation for the pfos degradation and the ce atom is the critical key center for electron transfer and the pms adsorption the optimized structures of the pfos adsorbed on the surface of the ce sb2o3 and d ce sb2o3 are shown in fig 7e and f and further reveal that the ce and sb atom on these catalysts can strongly adsorb the f in the pfos through the formation of chemical bonds the bond lengths of ce f 2 020 å and sb f 1 861 å for the d ce sb2o3 are slightly lower than those of the ce sb2o3 suggesting much quicker electron transfer between the pfos and the d ce sb2o3 benefiting from the modification of diatomite in addition the adsorption energy of the pfos on the d ce sb2o3 3 899 ev is more negative than that of ce sb2o3 3 864 ev demonstrating that the pfos can be adsorbed and take part in electrochemical reaction on the surface of the d ce sb2o3 with the optimal adsorption structure thus these chemical bonds ce f and sb f in the pfos d ce sb2o3 structure are easy to transfer electron to decompose pms for the degradation of pfos the potential generation pathway of active radicals via the d ce sb2o3 structure is further investigated using the dft calculation as fig 8 a exhibits the pms is firstly adsorbed on the ce active species in the d ce sb2o3 structure to form the pms d ce sb2o3 structure with a gibbs free energy of 3 333 ev subsequently the so4 d ce sb2o3 structure is formed due to the loss of the electron along a gibbs free energy of 1 473 ev under electrochemical effect afterwards the so4 d ce sb2o3 structure can adsorb a water molecule to release the oh 2 842 ev and the hso4 d ce sb2o3 structure finally the so4 is generated because of the decomposition of unstable the hso4 d ce sb2o3 structure 0 337 ev obviously no metal ions are released and leached in generating reactive oxygen species indicating the stability of the d ce sb2o3 structure in addition the above reaction and gibbs free energy confirm that the generation pathways of reactive oxygen species are thermodynamically feasible the electron transfer mechanism between the oh and pfos is also explored by the homo and lumo energy profile different reagent type as shown in fig 8b the optimized structure of the oh pfos d ce sb2o3 and the pms and the corresponding homo lumo and homo lumo energy gap were calculated the lumo of d ce sb2o3 0 05 ev is much higher than that of the homo of the pfos 0 84 ev which indicates that the electron can be rapidly moved from the pfos to the d ce sb2o3 in addition the lumo of pms 0 29 ev is also higher than that of the homo for d ce sb2o3 0 59 ev indicating that similar electron transfer from low orbital to high orbital is occurred consequently the electron can be transferred from the pfos to the pms via the d ce sb2o3 and the computations match well with the above findings the pms adsorbs transferred the electron to produce the oh radical for decomposition of organic contaminants based on the above results a potential reaction mechanism for the pfos degradation has been proposed as fig 8c exhibits the pfos is easy to lose an electron to form unstable pfos under electrochemical condition meanwhile the electron from the pfos and the electrode via active sites of the d ce sb2o3 are transferred to the h2o and the pms to produce the oh and so4 and these radicals will attack the unstable pfos to produce short chains organics for further decomposition reaction after a series of defluorination and decomposition process the pfos is finally transformed to co2 and h2o 3 6 stability and application in surface water the decomposition of the pms condition was important to the degradation stability it can be seen from fig 9 a that much more rapid decomposition of the pms than the pfos degradation was found during the eo pms process indicating the oh and so4 radicals can be quickly released for the pfos degradation in addition extremely weak decomposition reaction was observed in the presence of alone pms which was in accordance with poor degradation performance of the pfos in fig 3a the finding further confirmed the effectiveness of the oh and so4 radicals in the pfos removal to explore the actual application of the eo pms process the reaction system was carried out with the contaminated water derived from different water matrices such as the peal river water sea water ground water tap water and ultrapure water it can be seen from fig 9b that the removal ratios of the pfos for different water matrices were high and the peal river water received slightly lower removal ratio 95 6 1 1 than the other water metrices during electrolysis in addition the reaction rate constant of the pfos was 0 111 0 115 0 104 and 0 093 min 1 for the tap water ground water sea water and peal river water fig s6a respectively and the corresponding toc removal ratio were 80 7 1 2 81 0 0 6 78 5 1 3 and 77 3 0 8 respectively after 30 min reaction although these values were slightly lower in the control experiments total pfos still can be removed via prolonging reaction time or increasing the output current the above results indicated great potential of the eo pms process for the pfos degradation in actual application furthermore various organic pollutants such as phenol acid orange 7 ao7 tetracycline tc pfoa and the pfos were used as target organic contaminants to explore the universality of the eo pms as shown in fig 9d ao7 tc pfoa and pfos were completely degraded within 30 min during electrolysis and the corresponding reaction rate constant fig s6b was 0 181 0 142 0 098 and 0 117 min 1 respectively interestingly phenol could be rapidly removed within 20 min and a high reaction rate constant could be achieved up to 0 241 min 1 resulting from the small molecular structure which was much easier to be degraded than the large one the toc removal ratio for these various organic contaminants exhibited similar properties during electrolysis further verifying the effective mineralization of these organic contaminants via the eo pms process fig 9e the recyclability and stability of the d ce sb2o3 electrode for degrading the pfos were carried out by five consecutive batch experiments at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 its pfos removal ratio showed no significant change during five cycles operations fig 9f and the corresponding rate constant had slight change fig s6c in addition the toc removal ratio was 79 8 0 8 within 30 min after five cycles operations which was close to the result in the first cycle operation implying that the d ce sb2o3 electrode was stable and reusable for the eo of organic contaminants the good recyclability of the d ce sb2o3 electrode was originated from the mechanical and chemical stability of metal electrodes which was beneficial to cost effective advanced oxidation processes the leaching of metal ions would bring some serious environmental safety issues thus the leaching of the ce and sb ions was also determined by the icp aes it can be observed from fig 9h that the concentration of the ce and sb ions under the ce sb2o3 electrode within 30 min electrolysis reaction was 0 59 and 1 26 µg l 1 respectively however the leaching concentration of the ce and sb ions was further decreased to 0 1 and 0 17 µg l 1 respectively after the diatomite modification d ce sb2o3 electrode the leaching concentration of the ce and sb ions for the d ce sb2o3 electrode was obviously less than 0 2 µg l 1 suggesting very limiting leaching performance of metal ions from the d ce sb2o3 electrode this study also further validated the stability safety and high efficiency of the d ce sb2o3 electrode for the removal and mineralization of target organic contaminants the mass balance of fluorine was explored to explain the pfos degradation properties via the eo pms process the fluorine mass balance determined from mf intermediates mmf ion mf undegraded pfos mf initial pfos was in the range of 100 87 8 during 30 min electrolysis of the pfos degradation at the d ce sb2o3 via the eo pms process fig 9i the pfos can be rapidly removed within 30 min and the concentration of fluorine ion exhibited an increasing trend from 0 to 85 6 with the reaction time however this trend of fluorine concentration was slow in the absence of the pms up to 19 7 it suggests that the presence of the pms can significantly promote the degradation efficiency of the pfos and that pms was a critical activator for the pfos degradation it should be noted that fluorine mass balance showed a slight decreasing trend since some degradation products have not been detected or quantified in the solution 4 conclusions in this work the diatomite and ce co modified sb2o3 was synthesized as anode electrode in an electrochemical which exhibited excellent catalytic properties for the pms activation and pfos degradation the combination of electrolysis and the pms activation could significantly improve the degradation performance of pfos which can be completely removed within 30 min with initial pms concentration of 5 mm and current density of 10 ma cm 2 along with high kinetic rate constant of 0 117 min 1 the quenching experiment with various radical scavengers radical quantified tests and the epr spectra indicated the oh and electron were responsible for highly effective degradation of the pfos the dft calculation indicated that the electron can be quickly transferred from the homo of pfos to the lumo of pms driven by the potential energy difference this technology with high stability and minor leaching of ions shows high efficiency for degrading various organic micropollutants consequently eo pms process can be used for application in the

15745,the electrochemical oxidation method is a promising technology for the degradation of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos however the elimination processes of pfos are still unknown including the electron transfer pathway key reactive sites and degradation mechanism here we fabricated diatomite and cerium ce co modified sb2o3 d ce sb2o3 anode to realize efficient degradation of pfos via peroxymonosulfate pms activation the transferred electron and the generated hydroxyl radical oh can high effectively decompose pfos the electron can be rapidly transferred from the highest occupied molecular orbital of the pfos to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the pms via the d ce sb2o3 driven by a potential energy difference under electrochemical process the active site of ce o in the d ce sb2o3 can greatly reduce the migration distance of the electron and the oh and thus improving the catalytic activity for degrading various organic micropollutants with high stability in addition the electrochemical process shows strong resistance and tolerance to the changing ph inorganic ions and organic matter this study offers insights into the electron transfer pathway and pms activation mechanism in pfos removal via electrochemical oxidation paving the way for its potential application in water purification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctane sulfonate electrochemical oxidation peroxymonosulfate activation hydroxyl radical reaction mechanism 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl chemicals pfcs have been widely applied in various fields such as leather treatment carpet manufacturing fire fighting foams and medical equipments since 1950s due to their unique physicochemical properties including lipophobicity hydrophobicity and thermal and chemical stability zhang et al 2020 however the wide application of pfcs which have been detected in various environmental media causes serious environmental issue because of their toxicity and environmental persistence sun et al 2011 among these pfcs perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa have received intensive attention owing to their larger accumulation property and tolerance to degradation nevertheless which bring potential serious human health issues including cancer genotoxicity developmental toxicity neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity lan et al 2020 wen et al 2019 due to these potential health risks pfos and pfoa have been identified as persistent organic pollutants pops and listed in annex b of the stockholm convention in 2009 with limiting emission standard of 70 ng l 1 in drinking water zhai et al 2016 the traditional wastewater purification technology cannot effectively remove the pfos due to the high energy c f bonds 530 kj mol 1 and high redox potential of fluorine duan et al 2020 based on the reported data the monitored concentration of the pfos in ground water was 60 18000 ng l 1 in europe usa and china li et al 2022a llorca et al 2012 the concentration in surface water was 4 2709 ng l 1 in india china and japan braunig et al 2017 li et al 2020b wang et al 2021b worldwide distribution of the persistent pfos promotes us to explore highly efficient methods for purifying and removing the pfos traditional wastewater treatment technologies including chemical oxidation and biodegradation cannot effectively destruct pfos or pfoa to short chain pfcs chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 although some oxidation methods such as sonochemistry photocatalytic oxidation and plasma decomposition have been used to remove pfos or pfoa these treatment approaches need stringent experimental conditions high energy consumption long reaction time high ph levels and temperatures gole et al 2018 sun et al 2022 zhan et al 2020 either advanced oxidation processes aops with the generation of reactive oxygen species ross cannot successfully decompose the stable carbon chains with full fluorine li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 compared with the above methods the electrochemical oxidation eo process can realize the degradation and mineralization of pfcs due to the strong oxidation capacity high reaction rate and environmental compatibility under mild conditions wang et al 2020b consequently eo process as a promising alternative can be potentially applied in the degradation of pfcs from the water environment excellent removal efficiency of pfcs is dependent on the generation ability of ross the conductivity of the electrode and the transferred speed of electrons on the anode materials shin et al 2019 according to the previous studies boron doped diamond bdd and ti sno2 sb anode using naclo4 as electrolyte achieved excellent degradation performance for pfos removal under eo process with the high kinetic constant of 0 0779 and 0 0354 min 1 respectively shin et al 2019 wang et al 2021a nevertheless these electrodes are not ideal for scale up application owing to relatively low reaction rate high cost and the leaching of metal ions during the degradation of pfcs li et al 2020a therefore it is significant to develop stable highly efficient and cost effective electrode to mineralize and degrade pfcs via eo process intensive exploration of anode electrodes has promoted the quick development of ti based electrodes for example zhuo et al used ti sno2 sb2o5 pbo2 ptfe as anode to decompose pfos achieving a removal efficiency of 92 1 with a current density of 40 ma cm 2 zhuo et al 2020 wang et al utilized ti sno2 sb membrane anode to degrade pfos and pfoa with strong oxidants of naclo4 in electrolyte harvesting high kinetic constant of 0 0337 min 1 with an energy consumption of 37 46 kwh m 3 order 1 wang et al 2021a although some good performance was obtained via these electrodes the leaching of metal ions harmful to the safety of the water environment which has been a major issue to the application of eo technology diatomite can be employed as a carrier to effectively modify and support metal oxides to form stable structure because of the specific skeleton with large porosity and abundant surface hydroxyls yuan et al 2020 consequently diatomite is used to modify metal oxides for preventing the leaching of metal ions in our study in addition owing to of the advantageous of environmental benignity easy of fabrication low cost and high theoretical capacity sb2o3 is used as a metal oxide electrode for the reformation of diatomite du et al 2021 to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency and lifespan of sb2o3 electrode the cerium ce element is used to modify the sb2o3 surface layer to disperse internal stress and increase the binding force between the active layer and the electrode wang et al 2020c thus diatomite and ce co modified sb2o3 d ce sb2o3 is used as the anode electrode in our study in these previous studies naclo4 a strong oxidant has been served as the electrolyte for effectively removing pfcs under eo process shi et al 2019 however naclo4 is also a persistent and hazardous contaminant as result the unsuitable use will bring an explosion and secondary pollutant zheng et al 2020 to replace the naclo4 and enhance the conductivity and reactivity of the electrolyte peroxymonosulfate pms is used as an oxidant to produce ross oh so4 1o2 and o2 to activate the reaction and promote the degradation of pfcs li et al 2022b the oh and so4 can be easily generated via the pms activation reaction owing to its asymmetric structure interestingly these ross are more efficient for organic pollutants degradation via indirect oxidation than the direct oxidation process chai et al 2017 li et al 2022d nevertheless the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these ross remain unclear during eo process along with pms activation eo pms process and the reaction pathway and adsorption energy between pms and the anode electrode need further clarification although many ross are generated under eo process the dominant contribution for removing pfos is still uncertain the reaction mechanism and electron transfer pathway between the pfos pms and the anode electrode also need to be confirmed and proved for example how does the pfos adsorb on the surface of the anode electrode what is the key active center for pms activation the aim of this work is to develop an electrochemical technology for high efficiently degradation of persistent organic contaminants from the water environment in addition this study is also designed to explore the pathway of electron transfer among pfos pms and the electrode figure out the generation mechanism of ross and clarify key reaction sites for pfos adsorption and degradation herein the novel d ce sb2o3 electrode is fabricated to compensate the leaching defects of metal ions and the eo pms process with d ce sb2o3 electrode is employed to effectively degrade pfos different quenching reaction esr trapping method and ros quantitative analysis are used to demonstrate the dominant contribution of different ross the key active centre pms adsorption behaviour on electrode electron transfer together with the radical generation pathway was supported by the density functional theory dft calculation the stability and feasibility of d ce sb2o3 electrode for the removal of pfos from water environment via eo pms process are confirmed based on the results of different supporting electrolyte recycling tests degradation performance of various organics and defluorination properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study are analytical grade without any further purification the detailed information is provided in text s1 2 2 electrode preparation and characterization ti plates 4 4 cm were immersed in naoh solution at 100 c for 2 h and then etched in boiling oxalic acid for 4 h to remove grease and produce gray surface the electrode was fabricated by the sol gel method firstly ethylene glycol and citric acid were mixed and agitated at 60 c for 6 h and then heated at 100 c for 2 h secondly the sbcl3 was dissolved in isopropanol with the molar ratio of 1 3 10 for sb citric acid ethylene glycol respectively thirdly the ce no3 3 was introduced into the above mixture to achieve a molar ratio of 9 1 for sb ce respectively after 1 h reaction amounts of purified diatomite and the h2so4 were added into the mixture with a mass ratio of 9 1 2 for sb ce diatomite the mixture was kept at 100 c for 2 h to form sol gel finally the sol gel solution was coated on both sides of the ti plates after that the above ti plates were dried at 120 c for 15 min in an oven and sintered at 500 c for 10 min in a muffle furnace the continuous operates were repeated 16 times and the last baking was maintained at 500 c for 2 h the obtained electrode was defined as the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode the ti ce sb2o3 electrode was prepared by the same method without the introduction of diatomite the surface morphology of these electrodes was observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem merlin zeiss germany coupled with elemental dispersive spectroscopy eds the chemical state of elements was detected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha 2 3 electrochemical experiments all electrochemical experiments were conducted in a cylindrical reactor organic glass with an effective volume of 500 ml a ti plate electrode and the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode 40 40 mm were used as cathode and anode electrode respectively and the electrode gap between the two electrode was kept at 2 0 cm these electrodes were connected to a dc power supply beijing hansheng puyuan technology co ltd via the wires all electrochemical experiments were run at room temperature 26 2 c with a magnetic stirring apparatus at a stirring speed of 800 rpm min 1 the reactor electrolyte containing na2so4 10 mm target organic contaminants 10 mg l 1 and a certain amount of the pms solution h2so4 and naoh were used to adjust ph value of the electrolyte samples 1 0 ml contained 100 µl of methanol were periodically extracted from the reaction reactor all experiments were carried out at least twice 2 4 analytical methods the target organic contaminants pfos and pfoa were quantified by a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy hplc ms equipped with an api4000 q trap spectroscopy these other organic pollutants containing tetracycline tc acid orange 7 ao7 and phenol were measured by hplc agilent 1200 the total organic carbon toc in all experiments was detected via a shimadzu toc toc l csh cn200 the released ross were measured by an electron paramagnetic response epr bruker usa spectrum with the dmpo or temp as spin trapping reagents the concentration of the pms was detected by an abts colorimetric method liang et al 2008 linear sweep voltammetry lsv was carried out in an electrochemical workstation cs310 corrtest with a three electrode system where ag agcl electrode pt wire electrode and catalysts electrode were used as reference electrode counter electrode and working electrode respectively in addition the scanning range was 0 1 5 v at the scanning rate of 5 mv s 1 during lsv measurements 2 5 theoretical calculation to explore the reaction mechanism and key active sites during electrochemical degradation pfos dft calculation was carried out using dmol3 program package in materials studios based on the generalized gradient approximation gga in the form of the perdew burke ernerhof function aihara 1999 ricca et al 2018 the adsorption energy eads of the pms on the electrode surface was defined as the following 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u r f a c e e p m s where etotal is the adsorption energy of the pms on the electrode surface esurface is the energy of isolated electrode surface epms is the energy of isolated monomer facets 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface structure of electrodes the preparation process of the ti d ce sb2o3 electrode was illustrated in fig 1 a the ce doped sb2o3 was formed by a series of mixing and heating process then the desired ti d ce sb2o3 electrode was obtained via further modified by diatomite obviously the purified diatomite was in the disk shape with many small nanopores on the smooth surface fig s1a b the synthesized pure ceo2 showed a flower structure with a diameter of 0 8 µm fig s1c d and the pure sb2o3 possessed a soft ribbon structure with a diameter of 150 nm fig s1e f however the ce sb2o3 showed a stable bar morphology fig 1b c which was significantly different with that of the pure sb2o3 due to the introduction of the ce element the elemental mapping images figs 1i 6 showed c n o sb and ce were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ce sb2o3 electrode further confirming effective doping process of the ce into sb2o3 afterwards the formed ce sb2o3 electrode was further regulated and modified by the diatomite and h2so4 and then the bar morphology was broken and redistributed to form the final d ce sb2o3 electrode as shown in fig 1d f many diamond particles 120 150 nm with burrs like shape were observed and uniformly distributed on the surface of electrode in addition the elemental mapping analysis figs 1h 6 also demonstrated the uniform distribution of the c n o sb ce and si on the electrode surface furthermore the diameter of burrs gauged by imagej software was 7 8 nm fig 1g and the formed a great deal of burrs stably coated on the electrode surface which was beneficial to the electrochemical oxidation process chemical valence states of the ti d ce sb2o3 were examined by xps fig s2 shows the high resolution sb 3d spectrum two characteristics peaks located at 530 2 and 539 4 ev were assigned to sb0 3p5 2 and sb0 3p3 2 respectively cui et al 2017 the other characteristics peaks located at 531 3 and 539 6 ev were attributed to sb3 3p5 2 and sb3 3p3 2 respectively the corresponding energy gap was 9 21 and 8 31 ev for sb0 and sb3 respectively after eo process these characteristic peaks showed minor shift with the corresponding energy gap slightly shifting to 9 17 and 8 20 ev for sb0 and sb3 respectively shi et al 2021 little change of peak location suggested that the electrode was stable before and after reaction further confirming the excellent stability for this eo process 3 2 removal efficacy of pfos in various process various processes contained electrodes with different catalysts used only electrodes used only pms used different pms concentration and current density used will greatly affect the degradation performance of pfos fig 2 a exhibites the time dependence of the electrochemical degradation of the pfos under different anode electrodes overall quicker decay was found over the d ce sb2o3 electrode than the other electrodes with almost complete degradation of the pfos within 30 min of electrolysis in comparison the pfos removal efficiency at 30 min was 93 2 1 2 41 6 0 8 and 26 4 1 5 for the ce sb2o3 sb2o3 ceo2 electrodes respectively in addition only 12 3 0 9 of the pfos was removed via a single eo process suggesting weak removing performance of the pfos via single eo process effective removal of the pfos via the d ce sb2o3 electrode confirmed the great potential of the eo process with the pms activation in addition different kinetic curves were also obtained upon electrolysis of the pfos with different electrodes as shown in fig s3a the pfos degradation curves via these electrodes well fitted by pseudo first order behavior the d ce sb2o3 electrode achieved a high reaction rate constant of 0 117 min 1 which was 1 33 6 5 and 11 7 folds higher than that of the ce sb2o3 0 088 min 1 sb2o3 0 018 min 1 ceo2 0 010 min 1 electrodes respectively the high reaction rate constant for the d ce sb2o3 electrode led to rapid removal of the pfos moreover the corresponding toc changes were also investigated obviously the toc removal ratios of the pfos fig 2b were 83 8 2 2 74 2 1 6 38 8 2 6 and 22 7 1 4 for the d ce sb2o3 ce sb2o3 sb2o3 ceo2 electrodes after 30 min electrolysis respectively further implying that the d ce sb2o3 electrode can efficiently mineralize the pfos to small molecule and co2 the improved performance of the d ce sb2o3 electrode can be ascribed to diatomite and ce co doping enhanced the electron transfer rate of the d ce sb2o3 electrode the previous studies reported that the generation ability of ross and the electron transfer ability of the electrode materials play an important role in degrading pfcs wang et al 2020b our studies results indicated that the d ce sb2o3 electrode exhibited effective electron transfer ability and the generation of a great deal of the ros ability consequently the d ce sb2o3 electrode achieved much higher pfos degradation efficiency kinetic rate constants and toc removal rate than the other electrodes and thus the d ce sb2o3 electrode was selected to explore the key active site and the reaction mechanism in the following experiments the current density determined the generating amounts of ross for the pfos degradation during the eo process fig 2c shows that pfos was rapidly removed on the d ce sb2o3 electrode with 10 mm na2so4 as electrolyte and the pfos removal efficiency was significantly increased as the current density increased from 1 to 20 ma cm 2 the pfos was completely removed within 30 min at a current density of 10 or 20 ma cm 2 in addition the degradation behavior of the pfos was well fitted by pseudo first order equation fig s3b with a high reaction rate constant for the pfos degradation 0 186 min 1 achieved at current density of 20 ma cm 2 it obviously increased from 0 011 to 0 186 min 1 with an increase of current density from 1 to 20 ma cm 2 although the reaction rate constant for the pfos degradation at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 was higher than that of 10 ma cm 2 the consume time for complete removal of the pfos was the same and the system will consume more energy at 20 ma cm 2 than 10 ma cm 2 it was demonstrated that a high current supply would destroy electrode and bring the release of metal ion on the electrode surface wang et al 2020a consequently the current density of 10 ma cm 2 was chosen for the subsequent pfos degradation meanwhile toc removal under different current density can also confirm the above findings as shown in fig 2d the mineralization of the pfos at 10 ma cm 2 was 83 8 2 2 after 30 min reaction which was slightly lower than 85 6 1 8 at the current density of 20 ma cm 2 the results suggest that the pfos can be effectively removed and mineralized at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 which was beneficial to practical application of the eo pms process for pfos degradation fig 3 a shows that the pms alone can hardly degrade the pfos within 30 min 0 8 without activation process which was consistent with the previous study wu et al 2020 obviously the pfos can be removed with the addition of the pms under the d ce sb2o3 electrode a rapid increase of the pfos was observed from 61 4 0 8 to 99 8 0 15 with the increase of initial pms concentration from 1 to 5 mm meanwhile the reaction rate constant of the pfos was also increased from 0 023 to 0 117 min 1 with the pms concentration fig s4 however the further increase of the pms concentration to 10 mm brought the decrease of removal efficiency 96 5 1 5 and rate constant 0 106 min 1 resulting from the scavenging reaction between ros and pms li et al 2019 toc removal ratio was detected after 30 min electrolysis to explore the efficacy of the pms activation for the pfos mineralization as exhibited in fig 3b the toc removal ratio was the highest with the pms 5 mm at 10 55 9 1 6 or 30 min 83 8 2 2 indicating that the pfos can be efficiently mineralized to short chain molecule or co2 the above results confirmed that the d ce sb2o3 electrode with pms of 5 mm tended to have better oxidation ability than the other concentration moreover the electric energy was consumed during the eo pms process and electric energy per order ee o was a critical indicator to assess energy consumption under various process ee o can be achieved based on eq 2 the ee o value was firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the pms concentration from 1 to 10 mm the 5 mm pms achieved the lowest ee o value up to 0 025 kwh kg 1 suggesting that 5 mm pms was more energy efficient than the other concentrations 2 e e o p t 1000 v 60 lg c 0 c t based on the lsv curves fig 3d much higher oxygen evolution potential oep 1 29 v vs ag agcl was observed with the addition of the pms than without the pms 1 23 v vs ag agcl meanwhile lower current response was obtained from the pms curves at the same potential the lsv results suggested that the addition of the pms into electrolyte can reduce the energy consumption inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction and improve the electrochemical selectivity to the pfos degradation song et al 2018 3 3 identification and contribution of reactive oxygen species during the eo pms process for degrading pfos the oh and so4 were the key active species here different scavengers were used to determine the contribution of different ross oh so4 o2 and 1o2 to the pfos degradation in the eo pms process li et al 2022c as shown in fig 4 a b the removal ratio of pfos was significantly inhibited with the addition of scavengers with high concentration however no obvious inhibition effect was observed in fig 4c d suggesting that o2 and 1o2 were not generated for the pfos degradation during the eo pms process based on the kinetic curves fig s5 we found that the reaction rate constant was 0 040 min 1 with the addition of 5 mm methanol meoh which further decreased to 0 017 and 0 008 min 1 at 20 and 50 mm meoh respectively meanwhile the reaction rate constant was decreased to 0 024 min 1 with the addition of 50 mm tert butanol tba the above results showed that the degradation performance of the pfos was greatly inhibited with the addition of the meoh and tba and that the oh and so4 were dominant for the pfos degradation during the eo pms process as displayed in fig 4e the reaction rate constant of the pfos was significantly declined with the increase of the tba and meoh concentration from 5 to 50 ppm and seldomly change for the addition of furfuryl alcohol ffa and p benzoquinone bq furthermore various scavengers containing superoxide dismutase sod the bq ki nan3 ffa l histidine lh tba etoh and meoh 50 ppm were used to further confirm the above results evidently only the addition of the tba meoh and etoh brought the decrease of reaction rate constant much weaker inhibition effect for tba than meoh or etoh demonstrates that the oh has larger contribution than the so4 for degrading pfos during the eo pms process to further discriminate the involvement of the oh so4 o2 and 1o2 epr spectroscopy was examined using dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents during the eo pms process wang and wang 2020 it was demonstrated in fig 5 a that no obvious characteristic peaks were observed in the presence of pms only in the electrolyte indicating that the pms alone cannot be effectively activated for radical generation in addition no peaks were detected in these curves of the dmpo o2 and temo 1o2 suggesting the release of o2 and 1o2 during the eo pms process in comparison with these curves some clear characteristic signals of six line peaks ɑh 0 78 1 48 9 6 and 13 2 g and four line peaks an ah 14 9 g were detected which were assigned to dmpo so4 and dmpo oh respectively the intensity of characteristic peaks was further increased with the reaction time and the signal intensity of the oh was much stronger than that of the so4 indicating the continuous generation of the oh and so4 furthermore these radical concentrations were also quantified and exhibited in fig 5b only minor o2 and 1o2 were detected in addition the concentration of the oh radical was significantly higher than that of the so4 radical in 10 or 30 min suggesting the dominant role of the oh radical in the pfos degradation during electrolysis to verify the origin of the o element in these radicals various gases such as n2 ar o2 and air were bubbled into the electrolyte as represented in fig 6 a the rate constant for the pfos degradation exhibited few changes compared to the control experiment in addition the toc removal ratio kept at stable level in 10 or 30 min with the introduction of these gas fig 6b these findings indicated that the o element in these radicals in the eo process was derived from the undissolved oxygen in the electrolyte these ross of the o2 and 1o2 showed negligible contribution for the pfos removal such released the oh and so4 played important role in the degradation of pfos during the eo pms process 3 4 effects of various water metrices electrochemical technology in our study can efficiently remove pfos from aqueous solution based the lab phase we want to apply this technology for treating actual wastewater however various anions cations and natural organic matter humic acid ha have widely distributed in the actual wastewater in addition various water environments exhibit changing ph value these water metrices will affect the degradation performance of pfos though the pfos can be effectively removed under electrochemical process it is still unclear whether the solution ph will promote or inhibit the degradation reaction with this regard electrolytes with different ph values 2 6 3 8 5 2 6 8 7 9 9 3 10 5 11 8 were used to explore the system stability for the pfos degradation via the eo pms process as exhibited in fig 6c the degradation rate for different ph values showed a minor change from 0 115 to 0 117 min 1 the slight fluctuations suggest that the eo pms process can effectively remove pfos under different ph values and the process possessed strong tolerance to the changes in the acidity of the water environment for the potential application of this technology different ions in water environment may bring changes of degradation efficiency for the pfos degradation various anions f cl no3 hco3 and h2po4 cations mg2 ca2 k and na and ha were introduced into the electrolyte to study the effectiveness of the pfos degradation it can be seen from fig 6d f that the reaction rate constant of the pfos kept at stable level with the addition of different anions or cations 1 mm no inhibition effect was found with the ion concentrations even with a further increase to 10 and 30 mm moreover the reaction rate constant of the pfos with the addition of the ha from 5 to 50 mg l 1 displayed similar changes with the above ions fig 6f this indicated that the eo pms process for the pfos degradation showed little interference from general background ions and organic matter existing in water in summary the eo pms process possessed excellent ph tolerance inorganic ions and organic matter adaptability 3 5 reaction mechanism the dft calculation was used to deeply explore the pms activation reaction and key active sites for electron transfer during electrochemical oxidation fig 7 a c shows the images of the pms adsorption on different catalysts and corresponding differential charge density obviously the localized electrons around the active center and charge transfers from the so4 group to the catalyst substrate were observed in addition the adsorption energy of the pms molecule on the active sites of different catalysts and the corresponding the length of the connecting bond were also calculated as shown in fig 7d the d ce sb2o3 3 371 ev possesses more negative adsorption energy than sb2o3 1 729 ev and ce sb2o3 3 332 ev respectively suggesting good affinity of the pms in addition the length of connecting bond for the ce sb2o3 is 2 165 å which is slightly lower than those of the sb2o3 2 187 å and ce sb2o3 2 174 å respectively further demonstrating the stronger interaction between the ce and o atom after the modification of diatomite consequently the d ce sb2o3 showed the best activity for adsorbing the pms during electrochemical oxidation for the pfos degradation and the ce atom is the critical key center for electron transfer and the pms adsorption the optimized structures of the pfos adsorbed on the surface of the ce sb2o3 and d ce sb2o3 are shown in fig 7e and f and further reveal that the ce and sb atom on these catalysts can strongly adsorb the f in the pfos through the formation of chemical bonds the bond lengths of ce f 2 020 å and sb f 1 861 å for the d ce sb2o3 are slightly lower than those of the ce sb2o3 suggesting much quicker electron transfer between the pfos and the d ce sb2o3 benefiting from the modification of diatomite in addition the adsorption energy of the pfos on the d ce sb2o3 3 899 ev is more negative than that of ce sb2o3 3 864 ev demonstrating that the pfos can be adsorbed and take part in electrochemical reaction on the surface of the d ce sb2o3 with the optimal adsorption structure thus these chemical bonds ce f and sb f in the pfos d ce sb2o3 structure are easy to transfer electron to decompose pms for the degradation of pfos the potential generation pathway of active radicals via the d ce sb2o3 structure is further investigated using the dft calculation as fig 8 a exhibits the pms is firstly adsorbed on the ce active species in the d ce sb2o3 structure to form the pms d ce sb2o3 structure with a gibbs free energy of 3 333 ev subsequently the so4 d ce sb2o3 structure is formed due to the loss of the electron along a gibbs free energy of 1 473 ev under electrochemical effect afterwards the so4 d ce sb2o3 structure can adsorb a water molecule to release the oh 2 842 ev and the hso4 d ce sb2o3 structure finally the so4 is generated because of the decomposition of unstable the hso4 d ce sb2o3 structure 0 337 ev obviously no metal ions are released and leached in generating reactive oxygen species indicating the stability of the d ce sb2o3 structure in addition the above reaction and gibbs free energy confirm that the generation pathways of reactive oxygen species are thermodynamically feasible the electron transfer mechanism between the oh and pfos is also explored by the homo and lumo energy profile different reagent type as shown in fig 8b the optimized structure of the oh pfos d ce sb2o3 and the pms and the corresponding homo lumo and homo lumo energy gap were calculated the lumo of d ce sb2o3 0 05 ev is much higher than that of the homo of the pfos 0 84 ev which indicates that the electron can be rapidly moved from the pfos to the d ce sb2o3 in addition the lumo of pms 0 29 ev is also higher than that of the homo for d ce sb2o3 0 59 ev indicating that similar electron transfer from low orbital to high orbital is occurred consequently the electron can be transferred from the pfos to the pms via the d ce sb2o3 and the computations match well with the above findings the pms adsorbs transferred the electron to produce the oh radical for decomposition of organic contaminants based on the above results a potential reaction mechanism for the pfos degradation has been proposed as fig 8c exhibits the pfos is easy to lose an electron to form unstable pfos under electrochemical condition meanwhile the electron from the pfos and the electrode via active sites of the d ce sb2o3 are transferred to the h2o and the pms to produce the oh and so4 and these radicals will attack the unstable pfos to produce short chains organics for further decomposition reaction after a series of defluorination and decomposition process the pfos is finally transformed to co2 and h2o 3 6 stability and application in surface water the decomposition of the pms condition was important to the degradation stability it can be seen from fig 9 a that much more rapid decomposition of the pms than the pfos degradation was found during the eo pms process indicating the oh and so4 radicals can be quickly released for the pfos degradation in addition extremely weak decomposition reaction was observed in the presence of alone pms which was in accordance with poor degradation performance of the pfos in fig 3a the finding further confirmed the effectiveness of the oh and so4 radicals in the pfos removal to explore the actual application of the eo pms process the reaction system was carried out with the contaminated water derived from different water matrices such as the peal river water sea water ground water tap water and ultrapure water it can be seen from fig 9b that the removal ratios of the pfos for different water matrices were high and the peal river water received slightly lower removal ratio 95 6 1 1 than the other water metrices during electrolysis in addition the reaction rate constant of the pfos was 0 111 0 115 0 104 and 0 093 min 1 for the tap water ground water sea water and peal river water fig s6a respectively and the corresponding toc removal ratio were 80 7 1 2 81 0 0 6 78 5 1 3 and 77 3 0 8 respectively after 30 min reaction although these values were slightly lower in the control experiments total pfos still can be removed via prolonging reaction time or increasing the output current the above results indicated great potential of the eo pms process for the pfos degradation in actual application furthermore various organic pollutants such as phenol acid orange 7 ao7 tetracycline tc pfoa and the pfos were used as target organic contaminants to explore the universality of the eo pms as shown in fig 9d ao7 tc pfoa and pfos were completely degraded within 30 min during electrolysis and the corresponding reaction rate constant fig s6b was 0 181 0 142 0 098 and 0 117 min 1 respectively interestingly phenol could be rapidly removed within 20 min and a high reaction rate constant could be achieved up to 0 241 min 1 resulting from the small molecular structure which was much easier to be degraded than the large one the toc removal ratio for these various organic contaminants exhibited similar properties during electrolysis further verifying the effective mineralization of these organic contaminants via the eo pms process fig 9e the recyclability and stability of the d ce sb2o3 electrode for degrading the pfos were carried out by five consecutive batch experiments at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 its pfos removal ratio showed no significant change during five cycles operations fig 9f and the corresponding rate constant had slight change fig s6c in addition the toc removal ratio was 79 8 0 8 within 30 min after five cycles operations which was close to the result in the first cycle operation implying that the d ce sb2o3 electrode was stable and reusable for the eo of organic contaminants the good recyclability of the d ce sb2o3 electrode was originated from the mechanical and chemical stability of metal electrodes which was beneficial to cost effective advanced oxidation processes the leaching of metal ions would bring some serious environmental safety issues thus the leaching of the ce and sb ions was also determined by the icp aes it can be observed from fig 9h that the concentration of the ce and sb ions under the ce sb2o3 electrode within 30 min electrolysis reaction was 0 59 and 1 26 µg l 1 respectively however the leaching concentration of the ce and sb ions was further decreased to 0 1 and 0 17 µg l 1 respectively after the diatomite modification d ce sb2o3 electrode the leaching concentration of the ce and sb ions for the d ce sb2o3 electrode was obviously less than 0 2 µg l 1 suggesting very limiting leaching performance of metal ions from the d ce sb2o3 electrode this study also further validated the stability safety and high efficiency of the d ce sb2o3 electrode for the removal and mineralization of target organic contaminants the mass balance of fluorine was explored to explain the pfos degradation properties via the eo pms process the fluorine mass balance determined from mf intermediates mmf ion mf undegraded pfos mf initial pfos was in the range of 100 87 8 during 30 min electrolysis of the pfos degradation at the d ce sb2o3 via the eo pms process fig 9i the pfos can be rapidly removed within 30 min and the concentration of fluorine ion exhibited an increasing trend from 0 to 85 6 with the reaction time however this trend of fluorine concentration was slow in the absence of the pms up to 19 7 it suggests that the presence of the pms can significantly promote the degradation efficiency of the pfos and that pms was a critical activator for the pfos degradation it should be noted that fluorine mass balance showed a slight decreasing trend since some degradation products have not been detected or quantified in the solution 4 conclusions in this work the diatomite and ce co modified sb2o3 was synthesized as anode electrode in an electrochemical which exhibited excellent catalytic properties for the pms activation and pfos degradation the combination of electrolysis and the pms activation could significantly improve the degradation performance of pfos which can be completely removed within 30 min with initial pms concentration of 5 mm and current density of 10 ma cm 2 along with high kinetic rate constant of 0 117 min 1 the quenching experiment with various radical scavengers radical quantified tests and the epr spectra indicated the oh and electron were responsible for highly effective degradation of the pfos the dft calculation indicated that the electron can be quickly transferred from the homo of pfos to the lumo of pms driven by the potential energy difference this technology with high stability and minor leaching of ions shows high efficiency for degrading various organic micropollutants consequently eo pms process can be used for application in the

15746,treatment of highly contaminated wastewaters containing refractory or toxic organic contaminants e g industrial wastewaters is becoming a global challenge most technologies focus on efficient degradation of organic contaminants here we improve the cathode feiii peroxydisulfate pds technology by turning down the current density and develop an innovative mechanism for organic contaminants abatement namely polymerization rather than degradation which allows simultaneous contaminants removal and resource recovery from wastewater this polymerization leads to organic particles suspended solid organic polymers formation in bulk solution which is demonstrated by eight kinds of representative organic contaminants taking phenol as a representative 83 of pds is saved compared to degradation process with 87 2 of doc removal the formed suspended solid organic polymers occupy 59 2 of cod of the original organics in solution and can be easily separated from aqueous solution by sedimentation or filtration the separated organic polymers are a series of polymers coupled by phenolic monomers as confirmed by ftir and esi ms analyzes the energy contained in the recovered organic polymers 4 76 10 5 kwh for 100 ml of 1 mm phenol solution in this study can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy 2 8 10 5 kwh in the treatment process a representative polymerization model for this process is established in which the so4 and ho generated from pds activation initiate the polymerization and improve the polymerization degree by the production of oligomer intermediates a practical coking wastewater treatment is carried out to verify the research results and get positive feedback with 56 0 of doc abatement and the suspended solid organic polymers accounts for 42 5 of the total cod in the raw wastewater the energy consumption 47 kwh kg cod including electricity and pds cost is lower than the values in previous reports this study provides a novel method for industrial wastewater treatment based on polymerization mechanism which is expected to recover resources while removing pollutants with low consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollutant resource recovery polymerization advanced oxidation process wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction treatment of highly contaminated wastewaters e g industrial wastewaters is a common admitted strategy to minimize the environmental impact of contaminants however the inevitable consumption of materials and energy during various treatment processes is contrary to this original intention developing robust new methods to minimize the consumption of chemicals and energy to reduce the impact on the environment have been strongly recommended shannon et al 2008 the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing refractory or toxic organic contaminants is becoming a global challenge because this kind of wastewater is widespread and the pollutants are only partially removed by biological treatment tian et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the current mainstream technologies focus on efficient degradation of organic contaminants wang et al 2020 and the aim of a degradation process is to transform the target organic compound into other smaller organic compounds or even inorganic molecules e g mineralization advanced oxidation processes aops are commonly used to accomplish this goal as they can generate active species e g radicals to attack the organic compounds cui et al 2018 liu et al 2021b however the degradation might generate some organic products with unknown toxicity or even with higher toxicity than the original contaminant and an excessive toxicity assessment is still needed cui et al 2018 von gunten 2018 as for mineralization it needs to break a huge number of chemical bonds in the organic molecules and consequently a large amount of chemicals and or energy would be consumed another noteworthy issue is that organic contaminants usually contain chemical energy which would be released along with degradation especially the mineralization process thus sometimes the word combustion is used for a completely degradation process comninellis 1994 it is clearly that the chemical energy would be wasted if it is not recycled moreover it will even increase carbon dioxide emissions in a combustion process as organic contaminants usually have a long carbon skeleton structure developing innovative technologies to reduce consumption on both chemicals and energy recover resources on both materials and energy and control toxicity is significant to the purification of wastewaters containing organic contaminants and sustainable development in the coming decades mihelcic et al 2017 to realize or even come close to this goal here we introduce an improved cathode feiii peroxydisulfate pds process in a cathode feiii pds process feii is regenerated from feiii to activate pds eqs 1 and 2 at ambient temperature and atmosphere and part of the so4 would be converted to ho eq 3 in aqueous solution thus the total iron is not consumed during the reaction 1 f e iii e f e ii on cathode 2 f e ii s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 f e iii 3 so 4 h 2 o h o so 4 2 unlike conventional degradation approaches which transform the original contaminant into smaller organics or even inorganic compounds the present improved cathode feiii pds process polymerizes the original water soluble contaminants to form larger water insoluble polymers by reducing the current density 0 50 ma cm2 thus the contaminants are immobilized and can be separated and recovered from solution as organic resources as a result the actual removal of contaminants will reduce the risk of toxicity of the effluent additionally the oxidant pds and the electrical energy could be greatly saved due to simpler reaction pathways the polymerization of some organic compounds e g phenols huang et al 2005 li et al 2013 masuda et al 2001 steevensz et al 2009 halogenated phenols du et al 2016 feng et al 2013 and acetaminophen lu et al 2009 in aqueous solution has been achieved in enzymatic h2o2 processes with enzymes e g horseradish peroxidase du et al 2016 huang et al 2005 li et al 2013 coprinus cinereus peroxidase masuda et al 2001 soybean peroxidase steevensz et al 2009 and laccase feng et al 2013 lu et al 2009 steevensz et al 2009 however enzymatic reactions require strict conditions e g temperature ph solvent and ionic strength and show high selectivity to the substrate huang et al 2005 pradeep et al 2015 besides the enzymes may form irreversible bonds with intermediates thus leading to their inactivation and consumption divi and doerge 1994 these factors limit the application of enzymatic h2o2 processes an alternative treatment option is based on the fact that hydrophobic polyphenol films can form on anode surface in electrochemical process bao et al 2010 however the formed polymer films adhere tightly to the anode surface which change the electrode properties and cannot keep a stable continuous polymerization thus this process is not suitable for contaminant abatement and is difficult to full scale application sulfate radical so4 generated from pds activation has the ability to oxidize and decompose most organic contaminants without selectivity thereby abating them from aqueous solution wei et al 2017 however pds is also known as a significant initiator for polymerization in the field of material synthesis e g polymerization of styrene kolthoff and dale 1945 acrylamide pohl and rodriguez 1981 and pyrrole khulbe et al 1982 although the polymerization conditions in wastewater treatment are very different from those in the field of materials synthesis the proven ability of pds to initiate organics polymerization can be utilized thus pds was selected in the present study to polymerize target contaminants in aqueous solution and a novel pds initiated polymerization technology with electrochemical assistance which is suitable for wastewater treatment was developed the objectives of this study are 1 to demonstrate the organic contaminants abatement coupled with organic resource recovery in a simple cathode feiii pds process via organic polymers formation suspended solids 2 to establish a representative polymerization model for this process and 3 to evaluate the consumption on both chemicals and energy and recovery on both materials and energy of this novel contaminant removal mechanism then evaluate this process in terms of its applicability for pollutant removal from industrial wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 was used as pds to provide s2o8 2 and ferric sulfate fe2

characteristics of the raw coking wastewater the raw coking wastewater was collected from a coke plant in shandong province china before experiments the raw wastewater was diluted in the ratio of 1 1 to make the influent pollutant concentration close to the concentration actually treated in practical applications the main physiochemical characteristics of the wastewater are listed in table s1 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of phenol polymerization in bulk solution phenols are one of the most serious organic contaminants that widely exist in discharging sources busca et al 2008 mei et al 2019 such as coal chemical industry 370 7000 mg l gracioso et al 2019 guo et al 2018 ji et al 2016 mohd 2022 phenolic resin industry 1270 4000 mg l arutchelvan et al 2005 mohd 2022 petrochemical industry 40 1220 mg l mohd 2022 wood preserving industry 50 953 mg l mohd 2022 fabric industry 100 150 mg l mohd 2022 and fiberglass industry 40 2564 mg l mohd 2022 many countries have published strict emission standards for phenols because of their potential adverse effects to not only individual species and populations but also natural biological communities busca et al 2008 therefore phenol was selected as a typical contaminant in the preliminary study six control experiments including pds feiii pds alone cathode feiii cathode pds cathode alone and cathode feiii pds were conducted to compare the phenol abatement and polymerization fig 1 a no significant phenol abatement is observed for pds feiii pds alone cathode feiii cathode pds and cathode alone processes nor is polymerization the results indicate that pds cannot directly oxidize phenol pds cannot be effectively activated by feiii and the cathodic reduction does not contribute to phenol abatement with or without feiii under the current conditions however in cathode feiii pds process fine brown suspended particles could be observed in the bulk solution and the particles do not deposit on the cathode surface fig s4 a d si the color of the solution gradually deepens to dark brown with increasing reaction time with a ca 96 3 phenol abatement within 120 min fig 1 a the catholyte treated with the cathode feiii pds process at predetermined intervals was collected and the suspended particles gradually settled and a clear solid liquid interface appeared after gravity settling fig 1 b c as the feiii precipitates might cause contaminant abatement by coagulation the iron concentration during the reaction was measured in this study the total iron concentration in the supernatant has not changed fig s5 si and ph 2 is low enough to prevent the formation of ferric hydroxides thus the formation and precipitation of the suspended particles should not be caused by iron coagulation two active species so4 and ho exist in cathode feiii pds process and contribute to phenol abatement with steady state concentrations so4 ss and ho ss of 2 33 10 14 m and 1 22 10 14 m respectively texts s1 and s2 si figs s2 and s3 si with methanol meoh addition phenol abatement drops from 96 3 to 7 1 and the suspended particles could be hardly generated as meoh can quench both so4 and ho this result suggests that these two active species should be the main initiators of polymerization with tert butanol tba addition the particle formation is reduced but could still be observed the quantitative results will be presented later which is consistent with the results of uv vis difference spectra between the supernatant and the mixture δabsorbance fig s2 b si as tba can selectively quench ho it indicates that so4 is the main oxidant which initiate the polymerization to investigate whether ho alone can initiate the polymerization another group of experiments were carried out in cathode feiii h2o2 process with h2o2 as oxidant instead of pds text s3 si and fig s6 si in this process ho can be generated eqs 1 and 4 anotai et al 2006 but so4 cannot be generated the result proves that ho alone also has the ability to initiate phenol polymerization at proper conditions 4 f e ii h 2 o 2 h o o h f e iii in previous degradation based aops the formation of some water soluble polymers with low polymerization degree e g dimers has been reported in dealing with phenolic compounds by aops for example phenol olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 2 4 4 trihydroxybenzophenone pan et al 2018 and bisphenol a poerschmann et al 2010 however the above formed polymers has little contribution to contaminant removal because of the low polymerization degree and the trace production thus the yield of suspended solid organic polymers should be very important if considering the contaminants abatement by polymerization in this study since the total organic carbon toc of mixture containing suspended solid organic polymers cannot be measured by the used toc analyzer the yield of suspended solid organic polymers was measured by the chemical oxygen demand cod difference between mixture and supernatant δcod in this study the original cod substance is converted into three kinds of possible products which are i suspended solid organic polymers ii soluble organic molecules and iii mineralized products cod of the mixture after reaction is caused by i suspended solid organic polymers and ii soluble organic molecules yet the cod of filtered supernatant after reaction is caused by only ii soluble organic molecules therefore the cod difference between mixture and supernatant δcod equals to the cod of suspended solid organic polymers the higher the δcod the higher the yield of suspended polymers as shown in fig 1 d the percentage of δcod increases with reaction time due to the occurrence of polymerization and the gradual accumulation of polymer particles after 120 min δcod reaches 59 2 of the initial cod which means that more than half the organic contaminant including their chemical energy e g combustion energy can be easily separated from aqueous solution and can be recovered as organic resources furthermore the cod percentage of suspended polymer does not change significantly when the electrodes are used repeatedly for eight times without cleaning 16 h of continuous operation fig s4 e si suggesting that the present reactions have almost no impact on electrode performance it should be noted that δcod does not include those polymers passing through 0 45 μm filter thus the total polymer production should be more than the measured value besides the total cod abatement in supernatant is 89 4 data not shown and the dissolved organic carbon doc abatement reaches 87 2 within 120 min fig 1 e the pds consumption in this study was examined and was compared with the minimum pds consumption by degradation fig 1 e the minimum pds consumption by degradation pds deg for a certain doc abatement is calculated as below 5 pds deg doc 0 doc t 72 28 where doc 0 and doc t are doc values at time 0 and t min mg l respectively 72 is the molecular mass of organic carbon per mole of phenol g mol and 28 is the number of transferred electrons needed for phenol mineralization the pds consumption in this study 4 14 mm is significantly lower than the minimum pds consumption by degradation 24 41 mm for a same doc abatement of 87 2 fig 1 e namely 83 of pds is saved by polymerization 3 2 optimization of polymer production pds activation via electrochemically assisted iron e g solid electrode ionic state iron based catalysts processes have been widely explored for the treatment of various organic contaminants as listed in table s2 si however few reports have mentioned the polymerization of organic contaminants one of the most important reasons is that the current density applied in previous studies 2 40 ma cm2 is much higher than that in this study 0 5 ma cm2 another important reason is that the undivided processes without separation between anode and cathode are more likely to be selected since both anode and cathode can treat pollutants to verify the above conjectures three processes namely cathode anode feiii pds undivided process without membrane separator between anode and cathode anode feiii pds and cathode feiii pds were examined under different current input conditions for phenol abatement and polymerization fig 2 the cathode anode feiii pds process can be regarded as a combination of anode feiii pds and cathode feiii pds processes as the current density j increases from 0 50 to 6 00 ma cm2 more electric charge is needed to achieve the same phenol abatement in cathode anode feiii pds process fig 2 a while the polymer yield is greatly reduced and δcod drops from 59 2 to 12 5 fig 2 b this can be explained by the contribution variation of cathode and anode at different current density conditions at small current density the anode potential is too low to oxidize phenol cui et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 while the cathode feiii pds process can effectively attack phenol by reactive so4 and ho fig 2 a thus the δcod in cathode anode feiii pds process is almost the same as that in cathode feiii pds process fig 2 b indicating that all the suspended polymers are generated by cathode process however at high current density anodic oxidation provides more contribution on phenol abatement due to more electric charge input fig 2 a and the degradation process is more likely to occur rather than polymerization as no suspended polymers is observed in anode feiii pds process the phenol abatement as well as polymerization is inhibited in cathode feiii pds process at high current density fig 2 a b due to that the cathode is occupied by side reaction of hydrogen evolution text s4 eq s18 si thus at high current density a high phenol abatement and a low polymer yield are detected in cathode anode feiii pds process fig 2 a b the low polymer yield leads to the neglect the polymerization process thus appropriate current density is very important to improve polymer yield the effect of current density j 0 25 1 00 ma cm2 pds dosage 5 20 mm feiii dosage 1 4 mm and initial phenol concentration 0 5 4 mm on phenol abatement and polymerization were investigated in cathode feiii pds process experimental results including phenol abatement δcod δabsorbance δ269 nm δ435 nm feii variation pds consumption so4 ss and ho ss are shown in figs s7 s10 si and the corresponding detailed discussion is provided in texts s4 s7 si briefly these operating parameters have significant impacts upon phenol abatement and polymerization an optimized current density j of 0 50 ma cm2 is obtained which is much lower than that of previous reports on pds activation via electrochemically assisted iron processes 2 40 ma cm2 the lower current density implies a lower energy consumption as the electricity can be calculated by j2a2r a is the area of working electrode and r is the electric resistance a low pds dosage of 10 mm and a feiii dosage of 2 mm is sufficient to deal with 1 mm phenol and the pds consumption in this study is much lower than that in degradation process as aforementioned a better polymerization effect was obtained at a higher initial phenol concentration besides it is found that δabsorbance are parallel at 250 800 nm figs s7 s10 si at various operating conditions and the values of δ435 δ269 δ435 δcod and δ269 δcod are almost constant fig s11 si it seems that the molecular structure of the suspended solid organic polymers is almost stable within the scope of this study which should be conducive to research and resource recovery for a potential practical application the relationships between the polymer yield and the steady state concentration of radicals are investigated based on the results at different operating conditions figs s7 s10 si positive correlations between δcod and radical ss are observed within the scope of this study fig s12 a si although the polymer is generated in cathode feiii pds with δcod of 59 2 cathode feiii pds tba with δcod of 15 7 and cathode feiii h2o2 depending on the reaction conditions processes their δabsorbance differ significantly fig s12 b si as so4 tends to electron abstraction while ho tends to radical addition lee et al 2020 the polymers might have different molecular structures when the two kinds of radicals act alone or in combination the ratio of so4 ss and ho ss might impact the polymer yield 3 3 characterization of polymer the suspended polymers are collected and characterized to explore its formation mechanism in fig 3 a b the polymers are near spherical solid particles with rough surface and diameters of 50 100 nm no characteristic peaks appear in xrd pattern indicating that the polymers are amorphous solid fig s13 si uv vis difference spectra between supernatant and mixture δabsorbance suggests a specific structure of suspended polymer fig 3 c the ultraviolet absorption peak at 269 nm is one of the characteristic peaks of aromatic compounds while the peak at 435 nm corresponds to yellow color in phenol treatment with conventional aops the solution color changes and the absorption peak at 400 460 nm were believed to be caused by the formation of benzoquinone mijangos et al 2006 while in the present process the darkening of the solution color might also be a signal of polymerization besides the yield of suspended polymer can be approximately estimated by δabsorbance the higher δabsorbance represents higher absorbance caused by suspended polymers the δabsorbance at 250 800 nm increases with reaction time additionally absorption intensity of peaks at 269 nm and 435 nm δ269 nm and δ435 nm are linearly correlated to each other and δcod fig s14 si therefore a mutual verification of these data could be obtained the ftir provides more detailed information about the molecular structure of polymer that is typical polyphenol fig 3 d bao et al 2010 the broad peak at 3377 cm 1 arises from the stretching vibration of o h a small middle bond at 3066 cm 1 is likely to be caused by aromatic c h stretching vibration the four peaks at 1648 1606 1489 and 1450 cm 1 are related to the stretching vibration of aromatic ring the strong peak at 1213 cm 1 derives from the c o stretching vibration of the aromatic ether chain structure which proves that phenol could be coupled via oxygen atom the band at 1104 cm 1 is another signal for aromatic ring since it is attributed to the aromatic c c deformation vibration the absorption bands at 835 and 755 cm 1 represent c h out of plane deviational vibrations when the 1 4 positions and 1 2 positions are substituted on the aromatic ring respectively thus both ortho and para carbon atoms on the aromatic ring are the possible sites for phenol coupling the thermogravimetric data tg and its first derivative data dtg of suspended polymers in n2 are recorded in fig 3 e the first weight loss stage at 30 90 c should be associated with water evaporation the rapid weight loss stage occurs at 210 490 c with maximum weight loss rate of 1 484 min and should be related to the breakage of chemical bonds within polymer the ultimate char yield is up to 45 at 800 c the molecular weight mw distribution of the suspended solid organic polymers was investigated fig 3 f and text s8 si the distribution index di defined as the ratio of number average molecular weight mn the average mw of all molecules to weight average molecular weight mw the weighted average mw of all molecules mw mn is between 1 07 and 1 1 indicating that the formed suspended polymers are nearly monodispersed with a narrow mw distribution which would favor the polymers recovery as organic resource since a narrow mw distribution represents a nearly identical physical property strength plasticity etc 3 4 product analysis the hplc coupled with esi ms were employed to analyze the intermediates of phenol abatement in cathode feiii pds process generally two types of products involved in two different pathways are detected namely degradation and polymerization the degradation intermediate products mainly include catechol hydroquinone resorcinol benzoquinone maleic acid fumaric acid acetic acid and formic acid table s3 si which are similar to the results of phenol degradation in other so4 based or ho based aops cui et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 the evolution of these determined intermediate products was also recorded fig s15 si the other type of detected intermediate products consists of polymers it is widely accepted that the unpaired electron densities of oxygen ortho and para atoms in monophenoxy radical is higher than that in other positions and the coupling of two radicals may produce five stable dimers as shown in fig s16 si yu et al 1994 in this study three stable dimers 4 4 biphenol 2 2 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol have been determined as intermediate products and the variation of these dimers with reaction time was recorded fig 4 2 4 biphenol and 2 phenoxyphenol were not determined due to the lack of standards the 2 2 biphenol reaches its peak concentration at 40 min whereas a gentle variation of 4 4 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol at much lower concentrations is observed during the reaction however whether 2 2 biphenol is the dominant dimer is not clear and the fate of the above dimers 4 4 biphenol 2 2 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol in cathode feiii pds process was also investigated the results illustrate that polymerization occurs for all identified dimers in cathode feiii pds process and more than one kind of dimer should be produced by phenol coupling text s9 si and fig s17 si which is consistent with the results of hplc analysis besides a kinetic analysis suggests that two phenol monomers would prefer to couple together in a priority order of ortho ortho para para oxygen para and 2 2 biphenol should be the dominant dimer among the above three dimers in cathode feiii pds process due to the presence of two ortho positions in phenol molecule text s10 si fig s18 si and table s4 si the esi ms full scan spectra provide more information about chemical structure of the formed polymers fig 5 text s11 si tables s5 and s6 si multiple sets of polymers coupled by two c6h5o m z 93 and several c6h4o fragments m z 92 are found in both supernatant and precipitate with m z values of 2 93 n 92 1 due to the negative ion mode dimer trimer tetramer pentamer hexamer and heptamer with m z value of 185 277 369 461 553 and 645 are identified in supernatant fig 5 a and table s5 si the polymers with low mw m z 277 369 461 553 and 645 are also detected in precipitate fig 5 b and table s6 si which might be due to a co precipitation effect some polymerization products contain monomers destroyed by active species e g so4 and ho while the m z difference of each group between adjacent values are exactly equal to several c6h4o m z n 92 some other groups of polymers containing benzoquinone or hydroxylated monomers might provide a good reason for the absorption peaks centered at 435 nm in the spectra of δabsorbance since the quinone like substances show a strong absorption response in the wavelength region of 400 460 nm lin et al 2011 mijangos et al 2006 3 5 polymerization model phenol degradation has been reported previously cui et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 which includes ring cleavage and further chain breaking to form small organic compounds however the formation of suspended solid organic polymers is more important in this study based on the current experimental results a possible mechanism for phenol abatement especially the polymerization model is proposed and is represented graphically in fig 6 generally it can be described as a step growth polymerization model with three steps the first step is the initiation of polymerization pds is activated by the cathode feiii to generate so4 eqs 1 and 2 which reacts with h2o to form ho via eq 3 then the hydrogen abstraction from phenol c6h5oh to so4 or ho results in the formation of phenoxy radical c6h5o chen et al 2020 which is the actual substance of polymerization yu et al 1994 thus so4 and ho are initiators and the generation of c6h5o is the beginning of the polymerization it should be pointed out that this initiation by so4 and ho runs through the whole cathode feiii pds process since these initiators are continuously generated and might attack organics unselectively implying that not only phenol but also dimers as well as other products might be attacked and form organic radicals therefore the second step namely the increase of polymerization degree actually interweaves with the initiation step two c6h5o with unpaired electrons couple together to form a dimer which has carbon carbon or carbon oxygen bonds dewar and nakaya 1968 yu et al 1994 the dimers have similar reactivity with so4 or ho and form dimer radicals which participate in further coupling with c6h5o or other dimer radicals or other polymer radicals to form larger polymers similar polymerization of dimers has been experimentally demonstrated text s9 si and fig s17 si the generated polymers repeatedly participate in oxidative coupling reactions any two polymer radicals may have the opportunity to pair together thereby increasing the polymerization degree pradeep et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 finally part of the polymers begins to precipitate since they have lower solubility than their precursors in this process some benzoquinone like and benzenediol like monomer appear in the formed polymer structure instead of phenoxy monomer due to the attack of so4 and ho however it is temporarily uncertain whether the ring cleavage would occur on the polymerized monomer despite the interference of degradation the polymerization degree still increases as shown in fig 3 f due to the accumulation of polymers in solution the third step is the polymerization termination there are multiple factors that could lead to the polymerization termination such as no longer providing initiators e g cut off the power supply or exhaust the chemicals or lacking of sufficient paired polymer radicals depending on the operation parameters finally a mixture containing degradation products soluble polymers and suspended solid polymers is obtained fig 6 and the solid polymers can be physically separated from solution 3 6 energy consumption and energy recovery energy consumption is a very important indicator to evaluate the applicability of a wastewater treatment process bolton et al 2001 miklos et al 2018 in the cathode feiii pds process the energy consumption includes electricity and pds cost since the contaminant concentration is comparatively high in industrial wastewaters and the removal rate of the contaminant is directly related to the energy use energy per mass kwh kg is applied and the energy consumption including electricity and pds cost is calculated according to eqs 6 8 cai et al 2019 xue et al 2020 6 e doc 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 doc 0 doc t v 7 e cod 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 cod 0 cod t v 8 e phenol 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 phenol 0 phenol t v where edoc kwh kg doc ecod kwh kg cod and ephenol kwh kg phenol are defined as energy consumption per unit of doc cod and phenol respectively u is the cell voltage about 1 75 v i is the applied current 0 008 a t is the reaction time 2 h v is the volume of the target solution 0 100 l doc 0 or cod 0 or phenol 0 or pds 0 and doc t or cod t or phenol t or pds t are the doc or cod or phenol or pds values of the sample at time 0 and t mg l respectively 9 42 is the energy consumption per kilogram of pds kwh kg sun et al 2016 in present cathode feiii pds process the energy consumption is 152 kwh kg doc 48 kwh kg cod and 102 kwh kg phenol with doc cod and phenol abatement of 87 2 89 4 and 96 3 respectively the different methods involved electricity or pds or pms in previous reports and in this study for phenol treatment are listed in table 1 the energy consumption in cathode feiii pds process of this study is lower than that of most processes in previous literatures or in eletrochemical oxidation processes of this study while the cod doc abatement in cathode feiii pds process of this study is higher than that of most degradation based processes table 1 although the energy consumption in some eletrochemical phenol oxidation processes is even lower 9 9 kwh kg cod or 23 3 kwh kg cod their cod abatement is also lower 59 or 30 and the high cost of anode preparation may hinder their large scale production and practical application the cathode feiii pds process in this study has no special requirements for cathode and anode materials and more efficient electrode materials can be used to further reduce energy consumption in the following research the possible chemical energy recovery from the separated solid polymers can be estimated by the heating value q mj kg as the polymers are composed of c h and o elements dulong formula is a classical empirical formula for estimating heating value eq 9 hosokai et al 2016 wanignon ferdinand et al 2012 9 q 338 2 c 1442 8 h o 8 1000 where c h and o are the mass fractions of each element the elemental mass fractions of the separated solid polymers are measured as c h o 68 3 4 3 27 4 and the q is calculated to be about 24 4 mj kg table 2 it is found that this heating value is about half of the liquid or gaseous fuels is comparable to coal fuels and is higher than some typical biomass fuels cotton stalk and wheat straw and solid wastes table 2 additionally it is worth noting that this recovered energy about 4 76 10 5 kwh according to δcod can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy 2 8 10 5 kwh in this treatment process text s12 si 3 7 feasibility of practical application to check the feasibility of the proposed approach not only phenol but also some other organic contaminants including bisphenol a o cresol p chlorophenol benzoic acid aniline benzene and m methoxyphenol were examined with this cathode feiii pds process fig 7 the selected organic contaminants are aromatic organic compounds which generally exist in industrial wastewaters as representative structural monomers the polymerization takes place on each organic compound and the polymer yield is contaminant dependent the pds consumption is significantly lower than the minimum pds consumption by degradation fig 7 d the formation of suspended solid organic polymers for these contaminants demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach however further investigations are still needed to optimize the efficiency and to explore the applicability the application of cathode feiii pds process was also investigated in a practical coking wastewater brownish black suspended particles were continuously generated and accumulated in the bulk solution and the percentage of δcod reaches 42 5 after 8 h treatment fig 8 with the influence of coexisting organic and inorganic matrices in the coking wastewater including 1118 mg l of chloride ion 134 mg l of scn multiple mixed organic compounds etc the total cod and doc abatement of the coking wastewater reach 61 8 and 56 0 respectively after the cathode feiii pds treatment table 3 and the corresponding energy consumption including electricity and pds cost are 47 kwh kg cod and 149 kwh kg doc table 3 respectively which are even slightly lower than the values obtained in simulated phenol solution 48 kwh kg cod and 152 kwh kg doc as shown in table 1 the results imply that the coexisting matrix in coking wastewater might facilitate to the present cathode feiii pds process compared with other processes for coking wastewater treatment 63 229 kwh kg cod and 378 1198 kwh kg toc for raw coking wastewater 64 116 kwh kg cod and 253 kwh kg toc for biotreated coking wastewater and 499 kwh kg cod for coking wastewater concentrate the cathode feiii pds process of this study has significant advantages in terms of energy consumption table 3 besides the acute toxicity of coking wastewater decreases after treatment as the ec50 median effective concentration the higher the ec50 the lower the toxicity increases from 1 74 to 2 75 table s1 si the pds consumption in this cathode feiii pds treatment process 20 mm is approximately 16 of the minimum pds consumption by degradation about 123 mm estimated by phenol mineralization process with a same doc abatement these results suggest that the present cathode feiii pds process is not only effective for removing single organic compound in the synthetic water but also shows a better performance on the doc cod removal during the practical coking wastewater treatment with a lower energy consumption thus it can be applied to practical coking wastewater treatment and may be an energy saving resource recovery option certainly the systematic investigation on the practical coking wastewater treatment is still in progress in our laboratory 4 conclusion a modified cathode feiii peroxydisulfate technology combined organic contaminants abatement and organic resource recovery from wastewater is developed the active species so4 and ho act not only as oxidants but more importantly as initiators of polymerization and convert organic contaminants into suspended solid organic polymers different representative contaminants bisphenol a o cresol p chlorophenol benzoic acid aniline benzene and m methoxyphenol have been tested and the expected results are obtained taking phenol as a representative more than half the contaminant can be easily separated from aqueous solution as solid organic polymers and can be recovered as organic resources the chemical pds consumption in this process is significantly lower 83 of pds could be saved than that in degradation the heating value of the separated organic polymers is comparable to coal fuels and is higher than biomass fuels which can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy taking a practical coking wastewater as target this process has been tested and proved to be an energy saving resource recovery option as 56 0 of doc abatement with energy consumption including electricity and pds cost of 149 kwh kg doc and 42 5 of organic resource recovery are obtained these features suggest that the present technology is promising for wastewater treatment and has a good prospect for industrial

15746,treatment of highly contaminated wastewaters containing refractory or toxic organic contaminants e g industrial wastewaters is becoming a global challenge most technologies focus on efficient degradation of organic contaminants here we improve the cathode feiii peroxydisulfate pds technology by turning down the current density and develop an innovative mechanism for organic contaminants abatement namely polymerization rather than degradation which allows simultaneous contaminants removal and resource recovery from wastewater this polymerization leads to organic particles suspended solid organic polymers formation in bulk solution which is demonstrated by eight kinds of representative organic contaminants taking phenol as a representative 83 of pds is saved compared to degradation process with 87 2 of doc removal the formed suspended solid organic polymers occupy 59 2 of cod of the original organics in solution and can be easily separated from aqueous solution by sedimentation or filtration the separated organic polymers are a series of polymers coupled by phenolic monomers as confirmed by ftir and esi ms analyzes the energy contained in the recovered organic polymers 4 76 10 5 kwh for 100 ml of 1 mm phenol solution in this study can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy 2 8 10 5 kwh in the treatment process a representative polymerization model for this process is established in which the so4 and ho generated from pds activation initiate the polymerization and improve the polymerization degree by the production of oligomer intermediates a practical coking wastewater treatment is carried out to verify the research results and get positive feedback with 56 0 of doc abatement and the suspended solid organic polymers accounts for 42 5 of the total cod in the raw wastewater the energy consumption 47 kwh kg cod including electricity and pds cost is lower than the values in previous reports this study provides a novel method for industrial wastewater treatment based on polymerization mechanism which is expected to recover resources while removing pollutants with low consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollutant resource recovery polymerization advanced oxidation process wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction treatment of highly contaminated wastewaters e g industrial wastewaters is a common admitted strategy to minimize the environmental impact of contaminants however the inevitable consumption of materials and energy during various treatment processes is contrary to this original intention developing robust new methods to minimize the consumption of chemicals and energy to reduce the impact on the environment have been strongly recommended shannon et al 2008 the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing refractory or toxic organic contaminants is becoming a global challenge because this kind of wastewater is widespread and the pollutants are only partially removed by biological treatment tian et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the current mainstream technologies focus on efficient degradation of organic contaminants wang et al 2020 and the aim of a degradation process is to transform the target organic compound into other smaller organic compounds or even inorganic molecules e g mineralization advanced oxidation processes aops are commonly used to accomplish this goal as they can generate active species e g radicals to attack the organic compounds cui et al 2018 liu et al 2021b however the degradation might generate some organic products with unknown toxicity or even with higher toxicity than the original contaminant and an excessive toxicity assessment is still needed cui et al 2018 von gunten 2018 as for mineralization it needs to break a huge number of chemical bonds in the organic molecules and consequently a large amount of chemicals and or energy would be consumed another noteworthy issue is that organic contaminants usually contain chemical energy which would be released along with degradation especially the mineralization process thus sometimes the word combustion is used for a completely degradation process comninellis 1994 it is clearly that the chemical energy would be wasted if it is not recycled moreover it will even increase carbon dioxide emissions in a combustion process as organic contaminants usually have a long carbon skeleton structure developing innovative technologies to reduce consumption on both chemicals and energy recover resources on both materials and energy and control toxicity is significant to the purification of wastewaters containing organic contaminants and sustainable development in the coming decades mihelcic et al 2017 to realize or even come close to this goal here we introduce an improved cathode feiii peroxydisulfate pds process in a cathode feiii pds process feii is regenerated from feiii to activate pds eqs 1 and 2 at ambient temperature and atmosphere and part of the so4 would be converted to ho eq 3 in aqueous solution thus the total iron is not consumed during the reaction 1 f e iii e f e ii on cathode 2 f e ii s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 f e iii 3 so 4 h 2 o h o so 4 2 unlike conventional degradation approaches which transform the original contaminant into smaller organics or even inorganic compounds the present improved cathode feiii pds process polymerizes the original water soluble contaminants to form larger water insoluble polymers by reducing the current density 0 50 ma cm2 thus the contaminants are immobilized and can be separated and recovered from solution as organic resources as a result the actual removal of contaminants will reduce the risk of toxicity of the effluent additionally the oxidant pds and the electrical energy could be greatly saved due to simpler reaction pathways the polymerization of some organic compounds e g phenols huang et al 2005 li et al 2013 masuda et al 2001 steevensz et al 2009 halogenated phenols du et al 2016 feng et al 2013 and acetaminophen lu et al 2009 in aqueous solution has been achieved in enzymatic h2o2 processes with enzymes e g horseradish peroxidase du et al 2016 huang et al 2005 li et al 2013 coprinus cinereus peroxidase masuda et al 2001 soybean peroxidase steevensz et al 2009 and laccase feng et al 2013 lu et al 2009 steevensz et al 2009 however enzymatic reactions require strict conditions e g temperature ph solvent and ionic strength and show high selectivity to the substrate huang et al 2005 pradeep et al 2015 besides the enzymes may form irreversible bonds with intermediates thus leading to their inactivation and consumption divi and doerge 1994 these factors limit the application of enzymatic h2o2 processes an alternative treatment option is based on the fact that hydrophobic polyphenol films can form on anode surface in electrochemical process bao et al 2010 however the formed polymer films adhere tightly to the anode surface which change the electrode properties and cannot keep a stable continuous polymerization thus this process is not suitable for contaminant abatement and is difficult to full scale application sulfate radical so4 generated from pds activation has the ability to oxidize and decompose most organic contaminants without selectivity thereby abating them from aqueous solution wei et al 2017 however pds is also known as a significant initiator for polymerization in the field of material synthesis e g polymerization of styrene kolthoff and dale 1945 acrylamide pohl and rodriguez 1981 and pyrrole khulbe et al 1982 although the polymerization conditions in wastewater treatment are very different from those in the field of materials synthesis the proven ability of pds to initiate organics polymerization can be utilized thus pds was selected in the present study to polymerize target contaminants in aqueous solution and a novel pds initiated polymerization technology with electrochemical assistance which is suitable for wastewater treatment was developed the objectives of this study are 1 to demonstrate the organic contaminants abatement coupled with organic resource recovery in a simple cathode feiii pds process via organic polymers formation suspended solids 2 to establish a representative polymerization model for this process and 3 to evaluate the consumption on both chemicals and energy and recovery on both materials and energy of this novel contaminant removal mechanism then evaluate this process in terms of its applicability for pollutant removal from industrial wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 was used as pds to provide s2o8 2 and ferric sulfate fe2

characteristics of the raw coking wastewater the raw coking wastewater was collected from a coke plant in shandong province china before experiments the raw wastewater was diluted in the ratio of 1 1

results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of phenol polymerization in bulk solution phenols are one of the most serious organic contaminants that widely exist in discharging sources busca et al 2008 mei et al 2019 such as coal chemical industry 370 7000 mg l gracioso et al 2019 guo et al 2018 ji et al 2016 mohd 2022 phenolic resin industry 1270 4000 mg l arutchelvan et al 2005 mohd 2022 petrochemical industry 40 1220 mg l mohd 2022 wood preserving industry 50 953 mg l mohd 2022 fabric industry 100 150 mg l mohd 2022 and fiberglass industry 40 2564 mg l mohd 2022 many countries have published strict emission standards for phenols because of their potential adverse effects to not only individual species and populations but also natural biological communities busca et al 2008 therefore phenol was selected as a typical contaminant in the preliminary study six control experiments including pds feiii pds alone cathode feiii cathode pds cathode alone and cathode feiii pds were conducted to compare the phenol abatement and polymerization fig 1 a no significant phenol abatement is observed for pds feiii pds alone cathode feiii cathode pds and cathode alone processes nor is polymerization the results indicate that pds cannot directly oxidize phenol pds cannot be effectively activated by feiii and the cathodic reduction does not contribute to phenol abatement with or without feiii under the current conditions however in cathode feiii pds process fine brown suspended particles could be observed in the bulk solution and the particles do not deposit on the cathode surface fig s4 a d si the color of the solution gradually deepens to dark brown with increasing reaction time with a ca 96 3 phenol abatement within 120 min fig 1 a the catholyte treated with the cathode feiii pds process at predetermined intervals was collected and the suspended particles gradually settled and a clear solid liquid interface appeared after gravity settling fig 1 b c as the feiii precipitates might cause contaminant abatement by coagulation the iron concentration during the reaction was measured in this study the total iron concentration in the supernatant has not changed fig s5 si and ph 2 is low enough to prevent the formation of ferric hydroxides thus the formation and precipitation of the suspended particles should not be caused by iron coagulation two active species so4 and ho exist in cathode feiii pds process and contribute to phenol abatement with steady state concentrations so4 ss and ho ss of 2 33 10 14 m and 1 22 10 14 m respectively texts s1 and s2 si figs s2 and s3 si with methanol meoh addition phenol abatement drops from 96 3 to 7 1 and the suspended particles could be hardly generated as meoh can quench both so4 and ho this result suggests that these two active species should be the main initiators of polymerization with tert butanol tba addition the particle formation is reduced but could still be observed the quantitative results will be presented later which is consistent with the results of uv vis difference spectra between the supernatant and the mixture δabsorbance fig s2 b si as tba can selectively quench ho it indicates that so4 is the main oxidant which initiate the polymerization to investigate whether ho alone can initiate the polymerization another group of experiments were carried out in cathode feiii h2o2 process with h2o2 as oxidant instead of pds text s3 si and fig s6 si in this process ho can be generated eqs 1 and 4 anotai et al 2006 but so4 cannot be generated the result proves that ho alone also has the ability to initiate phenol polymerization at proper conditions 4 f e ii h 2 o 2 h o o h f e iii in previous degradation based aops the formation of some water soluble polymers with low polymerization degree e g dimers has been reported in dealing with phenolic compounds by aops for example phenol olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 2 4 4 trihydroxybenzophenone pan et al 2018 and bisphenol a poerschmann et al 2010 however the above formed polymers has little contribution to contaminant removal because of the low polymerization degree and the trace production thus the yield of suspended solid organic polymers should be very important if considering the contaminants abatement by polymerization in this study since the total organic carbon toc of mixture containing suspended solid organic polymers cannot be measured by the used toc analyzer the yield of suspended solid organic polymers was measured by the chemical oxygen demand cod difference between mixture and supernatant δcod in this study the original cod substance is converted into three kinds of possible products which are i suspended solid organic polymers ii soluble organic molecules and iii mineralized products cod of the mixture after reaction is caused by i suspended solid organic polymers and ii soluble organic molecules yet the cod of filtered supernatant after reaction is caused by only ii soluble organic molecules therefore the cod difference between mixture and supernatant δcod equals to the cod of suspended solid organic polymers the higher the δcod the higher the yield of suspended polymers as shown in fig 1 d the percentage of δcod increases with reaction time due to the occurrence of polymerization and the gradual accumulation of polymer particles after 120 min δcod reaches 59 2 of the initial cod which means that more than half the organic contaminant including their chemical energy e g combustion energy can be easily separated from aqueous solution and can be recovered as organic resources furthermore the cod percentage of suspended polymer does not change significantly when the electrodes are used repeatedly for eight times without cleaning 16 h of continuous operation fig s4 e si suggesting that the present reactions have almost no impact on electrode performance it should be noted that δcod does not include those polymers passing through 0 45 μm filter thus the total polymer production should be more than the measured value besides the total cod abatement in supernatant is 89 4 data not shown and the dissolved organic carbon doc abatement reaches 87 2 within 120 min fig 1 e the pds consumption in this study was examined and was compared with the minimum pds consumption by degradation fig 1 e the minimum pds consumption by degradation pds deg for a certain doc abatement is calculated as below 5 pds deg doc 0 doc t 72 28 where doc 0 and doc t are doc values at time 0 and t min mg l respectively 72 is the molecular mass of organic carbon per mole of phenol g mol and 28 is the number of transferred electrons needed for phenol mineralization the pds consumption in this study 4 14 mm is significantly lower than the minimum pds consumption by degradation 24 41 mm for a same doc abatement of 87 2 fig 1 e namely 83 of pds is saved by polymerization 3 2 optimization of polymer production pds activation via electrochemically assisted iron e g solid electrode ionic state iron based catalysts processes have been widely explored for the treatment of various organic contaminants as listed in table s2 si however few reports have mentioned the polymerization of organic contaminants one of the most important reasons is that the current density applied in previous studies 2 40 ma cm2 is much higher than that in this study 0 5 ma cm2 another important reason is that the undivided processes without separation between anode and cathode are more likely to be selected since both anode and cathode can treat pollutants to verify the above conjectures three processes namely cathode anode feiii pds undivided process without membrane separator between anode and cathode anode feiii pds and cathode feiii pds were examined under different current input conditions for phenol abatement and polymerization fig 2 the cathode anode feiii pds process can be regarded as a combination of anode feiii pds and cathode feiii pds processes as the current density j increases from 0 50 to 6 00 ma cm2 more electric charge is needed to achieve the same phenol abatement in cathode anode feiii pds process fig 2 a while the polymer yield is greatly reduced and δcod drops from 59 2 to 12 5 fig 2 b this can be explained by the contribution variation of cathode and anode at different current density conditions at small current density the anode potential is too low to oxidize phenol cui et al 2011 zhu et al 2011 while the cathode feiii pds process can effectively attack phenol by reactive so4 and ho fig 2 a thus the δcod in cathode anode feiii pds process is almost the same as that in cathode feiii pds process fig 2 b indicating that all the suspended polymers are generated by cathode process however at high current density anodic oxidation provides more contribution on phenol abatement due to more electric charge input fig 2 a and the degradation process is more likely to occur rather than polymerization as no suspended polymers is observed in anode feiii pds process the phenol abatement as well as polymerization is inhibited in cathode feiii pds process at high current density fig 2 a b due to that the cathode is occupied by side reaction of hydrogen evolution text s4 eq s18 si thus at high current density a high phenol abatement and a low polymer yield are detected in cathode anode feiii pds process fig 2 a b the low polymer yield leads to the neglect the polymerization process thus appropriate current density is very important to improve polymer yield the effect of current density j 0 25 1 00 ma cm2 pds dosage 5 20 mm feiii dosage 1 4 mm and initial phenol concentration 0 5 4 mm on phenol abatement and polymerization were investigated in cathode feiii pds process experimental results including phenol abatement δcod δabsorbance δ269 nm δ435 nm feii variation pds consumption so4 ss and ho ss are shown in figs s7 s10 si and the corresponding detailed discussion is provided in texts s4 s7 si briefly these operating parameters have significant impacts upon phenol abatement and polymerization an optimized current density j of 0 50 ma cm2 is obtained which is much lower than that of previous reports on pds activation via electrochemically assisted iron processes 2 40 ma cm2 the lower current density implies a lower energy consumption as the electricity can be calculated by j2a2r a is the area of working electrode and r is the electric resistance a low pds dosage of 10 mm and a feiii dosage of 2 mm is sufficient to deal with 1 mm phenol and the pds consumption in this study is much lower than that in degradation process as aforementioned a better polymerization effect was obtained at a higher initial phenol concentration besides it is found that δabsorbance are parallel at 250 800 nm figs s7 s10 si at various operating conditions and the values of δ435 δ269 δ435 δcod and δ269 δcod are almost constant fig s11 si it seems that the molecular structure of the suspended solid organic polymers is almost stable within the scope of this study which should be conducive to research and resource recovery for a potential practical application the relationships between the polymer yield and the steady state concentration of radicals are investigated based on the results at different operating conditions figs s7 s10 si positive correlations between δcod and radical ss are observed within the scope of this study fig s12 a si although the polymer is generated in cathode feiii pds with δcod of 59 2 cathode feiii pds tba with δcod of 15 7 and cathode feiii h2o2 depending on the reaction conditions processes their δabsorbance differ significantly fig s12 b si as so4 tends to electron abstraction while ho tends to radical addition lee et al 2020 the polymers might have different molecular structures when the two kinds of radicals act alone or in combination the ratio of so4 ss and ho ss might impact the polymer yield 3 3 characterization of polymer the suspended polymers are collected and characterized to explore its formation mechanism in fig 3 a b the polymers are near spherical solid particles with rough surface and diameters of 50 100 nm no characteristic peaks appear in xrd pattern indicating that the polymers are amorphous solid fig s13 si uv vis difference spectra between supernatant and mixture δabsorbance suggests a specific structure of suspended polymer fig 3 c the ultraviolet absorption peak at 269 nm is one of the characteristic peaks of aromatic compounds while the peak at 435 nm corresponds to yellow color in phenol treatment with conventional aops the solution color changes and the absorption peak at 400 460 nm were believed to be caused by the formation of benzoquinone mijangos et al 2006 while in the present process the darkening of the solution color might also be a signal of polymerization besides the yield of suspended polymer can be approximately estimated by δabsorbance the higher δabsorbance represents higher absorbance caused by suspended polymers the δabsorbance at 250 800 nm increases with reaction time additionally absorption intensity of peaks at 269 nm and 435 nm δ269 nm and δ435 nm are linearly correlated to each other and δcod fig s14 si therefore a mutual verification of these data could be obtained the ftir provides more detailed information about the molecular structure of polymer that is typical polyphenol fig 3 d bao et al 2010 the broad peak at 3377 cm 1 arises from the stretching vibration of o h a small middle bond at 3066 cm 1 is likely to be caused by aromatic c h stretching vibration the four peaks at 1648 1606 1489 and 1450 cm 1 are related to the stretching vibration of aromatic ring the strong peak at 1213 cm 1 derives from the c o stretching vibration of the aromatic ether chain structure which proves that phenol could be coupled via oxygen atom the band at 1104 cm 1 is another signal for aromatic ring since it is attributed to the aromatic c c deformation vibration the absorption bands at 835 and 755 cm 1 represent c h out of plane deviational vibrations when the 1 4 positions and 1 2 positions are substituted on the aromatic ring respectively thus both ortho and para carbon atoms on the aromatic ring are the possible sites for phenol coupling the thermogravimetric data tg and its first derivative data dtg of suspended polymers in n2 are recorded in fig 3 e the first weight loss stage at 30 90 c should be associated with water evaporation the rapid weight loss stage occurs at 210 490 c with maximum weight loss rate of 1 484 min and should be related to the breakage of chemical bonds within polymer the ultimate char yield is up to 45 at 800 c the molecular weight mw distribution of the suspended solid organic polymers was investigated fig 3 f and text s8 si the distribution index di defined as the ratio of number average molecular weight mn the average mw of all molecules to weight average molecular weight mw the weighted average mw of all molecules mw mn is between 1 07 and 1 1 indicating that the formed suspended polymers are nearly monodispersed with a narrow mw distribution which would favor the polymers recovery as organic resource since a narrow mw distribution represents a nearly identical physical property strength plasticity etc 3 4 product analysis the hplc coupled with esi ms were employed to analyze the intermediates of phenol abatement in cathode feiii pds process generally two types of products involved in two different pathways are detected namely degradation and polymerization the degradation intermediate products mainly include catechol hydroquinone resorcinol benzoquinone maleic acid fumaric acid acetic acid and formic acid table s3 si which are similar to the results of phenol degradation in other so4 based or ho based aops cui et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 the evolution of these determined intermediate products was also recorded fig s15 si the other type of detected intermediate products consists of polymers it is widely accepted that the unpaired electron densities of oxygen ortho and para atoms in monophenoxy radical is higher than that in other positions and the coupling of two radicals may produce five stable dimers as shown in fig s16 si yu et al 1994 in this study three stable dimers 4 4 biphenol 2 2 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol have been determined as intermediate products and the variation of these dimers with reaction time was recorded fig 4 2 4 biphenol and 2 phenoxyphenol were not determined due to the lack of standards the 2 2 biphenol reaches its peak concentration at 40 min whereas a gentle variation of 4 4 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol at much lower concentrations is observed during the reaction however whether 2 2 biphenol is the dominant dimer is not clear and the fate of the above dimers 4 4 biphenol 2 2 biphenol and 4 phenoxyphenol in cathode feiii pds process was also investigated the results illustrate that polymerization occurs for all identified dimers in cathode feiii pds process and more than one kind of dimer should be produced by phenol coupling text s9 si and fig s17 si which is consistent with the results of hplc analysis besides a kinetic analysis suggests that two phenol monomers would prefer to couple together in a priority order of ortho ortho para para oxygen para and 2 2 biphenol should be the dominant dimer among the above three dimers in cathode feiii pds process due to the presence of two ortho positions in phenol molecule text s10 si fig s18 si and table s4 si the esi ms full scan spectra provide more information about chemical structure of the formed polymers fig 5 text s11 si tables s5 and s6 si multiple sets of polymers coupled by two c6h5o m z 93 and several c6h4o fragments m z 92 are found in both supernatant and precipitate with m z values of 2 93 n 92 1 due to the negative ion mode dimer trimer tetramer pentamer hexamer and heptamer with m z value of 185 277 369 461 553 and 645 are identified in supernatant fig 5 a and table s5 si the polymers with low mw m z 277 369 461 553 and 645 are also detected in precipitate fig 5 b and table s6 si which might be due to a co precipitation effect some polymerization products contain monomers destroyed by active species e g so4 and ho while the m z difference of each group between adjacent values are exactly equal to several c6h4o m z n 92 some other groups of polymers containing benzoquinone or hydroxylated monomers might provide a good reason for the absorption peaks centered at 435 nm in the spectra of δabsorbance since the quinone like substances show a strong absorption response in the wavelength region of 400 460 nm lin et al 2011 mijangos et al 2006 3 5 polymerization model phenol degradation has been reported previously cui et al 2009 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 which includes ring cleavage and further chain breaking to form small organic compounds however the formation of suspended solid organic polymers is more important in this study based on the current experimental results a possible mechanism for phenol abatement especially the polymerization model is proposed and is represented graphically in fig 6 generally it can be described as a step growth polymerization model with three steps the first step is the initiation of polymerization pds is activated by the cathode feiii to generate so4 eqs 1 and 2 which reacts with h2o to form ho via eq 3 then the hydrogen abstraction from phenol c6h5oh to so4 or ho results in the formation of phenoxy radical c6h5o chen et al 2020 which is the actual substance of polymerization yu et al 1994 thus so4 and ho are initiators and the generation of c6h5o is the beginning of the polymerization it should be pointed out that this initiation by so4 and ho runs through the whole cathode feiii pds process since these initiators are continuously generated and might attack organics unselectively implying that not only phenol but also dimers as well as other products might be attacked and form organic radicals therefore the second step namely the increase of polymerization degree actually interweaves with the initiation step two c6h5o with unpaired electrons couple together to form a dimer which has carbon carbon or carbon oxygen bonds dewar and nakaya 1968 yu et al 1994 the dimers have similar reactivity with so4 or ho and form dimer radicals which participate in further coupling with c6h5o or other dimer radicals or other polymer radicals to form larger polymers similar polymerization of dimers has been experimentally demonstrated text s9 si and fig s17 si the generated polymers repeatedly participate in oxidative coupling reactions any two polymer radicals may have the opportunity to pair together thereby increasing the polymerization degree pradeep et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 finally part of the polymers begins to precipitate since they have lower solubility than their precursors in this process some benzoquinone like and benzenediol like monomer appear in the formed polymer structure instead of phenoxy monomer due to the attack of so4 and ho however it is temporarily uncertain whether the ring cleavage would occur on the polymerized monomer despite the interference of degradation the polymerization degree still increases as shown in fig 3 f due to the accumulation of polymers in solution the third step is the polymerization termination there are multiple factors that could lead to the polymerization termination such as no longer providing initiators e g cut off the power supply or exhaust the chemicals or lacking of sufficient paired polymer radicals depending on the operation parameters finally a mixture containing degradation products soluble polymers and suspended solid polymers is obtained fig 6 and the solid polymers can be physically separated from solution 3 6 energy consumption and energy recovery energy consumption is a very important indicator to evaluate the applicability of a wastewater treatment process bolton et al 2001 miklos et al 2018 in the cathode feiii pds process the energy consumption includes electricity and pds cost since the contaminant concentration is comparatively high in industrial wastewaters and the removal rate of the contaminant is directly related to the energy use energy per mass kwh kg is applied and the energy consumption including electricity and pds cost is calculated according to eqs 6 8 cai et al 2019 xue et al 2020 6 e doc 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 doc 0 doc t v 7 e cod 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 cod 0 cod t v 8 e phenol 1000 uit pds 0 pds t v 9 42 phenol 0 phenol t v where edoc kwh kg doc ecod kwh kg cod and ephenol kwh kg phenol are defined as energy consumption per unit of doc cod and phenol respectively u is the cell voltage about 1 75 v i is the applied current 0 008 a t is the reaction time 2 h v is the volume of the target solution 0 100 l doc 0 or cod 0 or phenol 0 or pds 0 and doc t or cod t or phenol t or pds t are the doc or cod or phenol or pds values of the sample at time 0 and t mg l respectively 9 42 is the energy consumption per kilogram of pds kwh kg sun et al 2016 in present cathode feiii pds process the energy consumption is 152 kwh kg doc 48 kwh kg cod and 102 kwh kg phenol with doc cod and phenol abatement of 87 2 89 4 and 96 3 respectively the different methods involved electricity or pds or pms in previous reports and in this study for phenol treatment are listed in table 1 the energy consumption in cathode feiii pds process of this study is lower than that of most processes in previous literatures or in eletrochemical oxidation processes of this study while the cod doc abatement in cathode feiii pds process of this study is higher than that of most degradation based processes table 1 although the energy consumption in some eletrochemical phenol oxidation processes is even lower 9 9 kwh kg cod or 23 3 kwh kg cod their cod abatement is also lower 59 or 30 and the high cost of anode preparation may hinder their large scale production and practical application the cathode feiii pds process in this study has no special requirements for cathode and anode materials and more efficient electrode materials can be used to further reduce energy consumption in the following research the possible chemical energy recovery from the separated solid polymers can be estimated by the heating value q mj kg as the polymers are composed of c h and o elements dulong formula is a classical empirical formula for estimating heating value eq 9 hosokai et al 2016 wanignon ferdinand et al 2012 9 q 338 2 c 1442 8 h o 8 1000 where c h and o are the mass fractions of each element the elemental mass fractions of the separated solid polymers are measured as c h o 68 3 4 3 27 4 and the q is calculated to be about 24 4 mj kg table 2 it is found that this heating value is about half of the liquid or gaseous fuels is comparable to coal fuels and is higher than some typical biomass fuels cotton stalk and wheat straw and solid wastes table 2 additionally it is worth noting that this recovered energy about 4 76 10 5 kwh according to δcod can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy 2 8 10 5 kwh in this treatment process text s12 si 3 7 feasibility of practical application to check the feasibility of the proposed approach not only phenol but also some other organic contaminants including bisphenol a o cresol p chlorophenol benzoic acid aniline benzene and m methoxyphenol were examined with this cathode feiii pds process fig 7 the selected organic contaminants are aromatic organic compounds which generally exist in industrial wastewaters as representative structural monomers the polymerization takes place on each organic compound and the polymer yield is contaminant dependent the pds consumption is significantly lower than the minimum pds consumption by degradation fig 7 d the formation of suspended solid organic polymers for these contaminants demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach however further investigations are still needed to optimize the efficiency and to explore the applicability the application of cathode feiii pds process was also investigated in a practical coking wastewater brownish black suspended particles were continuously generated and accumulated in the bulk solution and the percentage of δcod reaches 42 5 after 8 h treatment fig 8 with the influence of coexisting organic and inorganic matrices in the coking wastewater including 1118 mg l of chloride ion 134 mg l of scn multiple mixed organic compounds etc the total cod and doc abatement of the coking wastewater reach 61 8 and 56 0 respectively after the cathode feiii pds treatment table 3 and the corresponding energy consumption including electricity and pds cost are 47 kwh kg cod and 149 kwh kg doc table 3 respectively which are even slightly lower than the values obtained in simulated phenol solution 48 kwh kg cod and 152 kwh kg doc as shown in table 1 the results imply that the coexisting matrix in coking wastewater might facilitate to the present cathode feiii pds process compared with other processes for coking wastewater treatment 63 229 kwh kg cod and 378 1198 kwh kg toc for raw coking wastewater 64 116 kwh kg cod and 253 kwh kg toc for biotreated coking wastewater and 499 kwh kg cod for coking wastewater concentrate the cathode feiii pds process of this study has significant advantages in terms of energy consumption table 3 besides the acute toxicity of coking wastewater decreases after treatment as the ec50 median effective concentration the higher the ec50 the lower the toxicity increases from 1 74 to 2 75 table s1 si the pds consumption in this cathode feiii pds treatment process 20 mm is approximately 16 of the minimum pds consumption by degradation about 123 mm estimated by phenol mineralization process with a same doc abatement these results suggest that the present cathode feiii pds process is not only effective for removing single organic compound in the synthetic water but also shows a better performance on the doc cod removal during the practical coking wastewater treatment with a lower energy consumption thus it can be applied to practical coking wastewater treatment and may be an energy saving resource recovery option certainly the systematic investigation on the practical coking wastewater treatment is still in progress in our laboratory 4 conclusion a modified cathode feiii peroxydisulfate technology combined organic contaminants abatement and organic resource recovery from wastewater is developed the active species so4 and ho act not only as oxidants but more importantly as initiators of polymerization and convert organic contaminants into suspended solid organic polymers different representative contaminants bisphenol a o cresol p chlorophenol benzoic acid aniline benzene and m methoxyphenol have been tested and the expected results are obtained taking phenol as a representative more than half the contaminant can be easily separated from aqueous solution as solid organic polymers and can be recovered as organic resources the chemical pds consumption in this process is significantly lower 83 of pds could be saved than that in degradation the heating value of the separated organic polymers is comparable to coal fuels and is higher than biomass fuels which can fully compensate the consumed electrical energy taking a practical coking wastewater as target this process has been tested and proved to be an energy saving resource recovery option as 56 0 of doc abatement with energy consumption including electricity and pds cost of 149 kwh kg doc and 42 5 of organic resource recovery are obtained these features suggest that the present technology is promising for wastewater treatment and has a good prospect for industrial

15747,biomonitoring of water quality and catchment management are often disconnected due to mismatching scales considerable effort and money are spent each year on routine reach scale surveying across many sites particularly in countries like the uk where nationwide sampling has been conducted using standardised techniques for many decades most of these traditional freshwater biomonitoring schemes focus on pre defined indicators of organic pollution to compare observed vs expected subsets of common macroinvertebrate indicator species other taxa including many threatened species are often ignored due to their rarity as are many invasive species which are seen as undesirable despite becoming increasingly common and widespread in freshwaters especially in urban ecosystems both these types of taxa are often monitored separately for reasons related to biodiversity concerns rather than for gauging water quality repurposing such data could therefore provide important new biomonitoring tools that can help catchment managers to directly link the water quality they aim to control with the biodiversity they are trying to protect here we used extensive data held in the england non native and rare protected species records that track these two groups of species as a proof of concept for linking catchment scale management of freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity to a range of potential drivers across england we used national land use centre for ecology and hydrology land cover map and water quality indicator environment agency water quality data archive datasets to predict at the catchment scale the presence or absence of 48 focal threatened or invasive species of concern routinely sampled by the english environment agency with a median accuracy of 0 81 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve a variety of water quality indicators and land use types were useful in predictions highlighting that future biomonitoring schemes could use such complementary measures to capture a wider spectrum of drivers and responses in particular the percentage of a catchment covered by freshwater was the single most important metric reinforcing the need for space habitat to support biodiversity but we were also able to resolve a range of key environmental drivers for particular focal species we show how our method could inform new catchment management approaches by highlighting how key relationships can be identified and how to understand visualise and prioritise catchments that are most suitable for restoration or water quality interventions the scale of this work in terms of number of species drivers and locations represents a significant step towards forging a new approach to catchment management that enables managers to link drivers they can control water quality and land use to the biota they are trying to protect biodiversity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecological niche models water quality land use invasive species rare protected species gbif data availability all data is publicly available as described in the main text supplement 4 describes the acquisition and processing of this data 1 introduction water quality which is intimately connected to land use change and associated pollutants is a major determinant of biodiversity in freshwaters and biomonitoring programmes have been set up to track these relationships in many countries across the world turak et al 2017 van rees et al 2021 maasri et al 2022 in the uk for instance national biomonitoring schemes have been used for decades to track the impacts of chemical pollution friberg et al 2011 jackson et al 2021 particularly acidification e g the uk acid waters monitoring network organic pollution e g the river invertebrate prediction and classification system wright 1995 and river invertebrate classification tool and more recently but to a lesser extent toxins e g species at risk spear classifications friberg et al 2011 bohan et al 2017 many of these schemes rely on reach a small length of river spanning often just a few metres scale sampling of a subset of the food web usually macroinvertebrates and matching observed versus expected biotic indices based on reference conditions to infer water quality largely because direct chemical measures are prohibitively costly or insensitive friberg et al 2011 however this methodology has some critical limitations and defining suitable reference conditions is often challenging or impossible bohan et al 2017 makiola et al 2020 maasri et al 2022 for instance urban ecosystems in particular are heavily modified and often contain large populations of many non native often invasive species grimm et al 2008 m c jackson grey 2013 van rees et al 2021 such species are particularly problematic in the context of linking biodiversity to water quality because they are often seen as being undesirable biotic elements and so are excluded from such bioassessment schemes as indicators per se and their distributional drivers are often also poorly understood m c jackson et al 2016 nonetheless as with classical bioindicator taxa such as the so called riverflies or ept taxa that are widely used biosensors of organic pollution e g moolna et al 2020 they will also be sensitive to water quality the proportions of invasive species in england in a suite of 48 focal species see section 2 3 monitored by the environment agency shows a strong urban signature fig 1 suggesting that these taxa could be potential novel water quality indicators of particular significance in these highly modified ecosystems where conventional bioassessment methods are difficult to apply pearse et al 2018 another group of taxa that often fall outside the classical bioindicators are those that are protected and or threatened across england their distribution mirrors that of the invasive species in our focal set and they tend to be more prevalent in less polluted rural areas and are often absent from urban systems see fig 1 at the reach scale these taxa are often too rare or too hard to sample to be embedded meaningfully in traditional water quality assessment schemes which rely largely on more abundant macroinvertebrate indicators collected in pond nets e g moolna et al 2020 both these rare and invasive groups which can span the entire food web from basal resources to apex predators could potentially provide important complementary or alternative information on water quality particularly at large scales even though they are monitored for other purposes another major constraint in current water quality assessment schemes is the tendency to take a piecemeal approach focussed on one particular stressor whereas in reality most freshwaters are exposed to multiple stressors ormerod et al 2010 friberg et al 2011 disentangling drivers and responses at scale remains a major challenge and again this is of particular concern in urban freshwaters which are exposed to the greatest range of chemical pollutants miller et al 2018 m c jackson et al 2021 these limitations and caveats related to both drivers and response variables in current biomonitoring schemes are well known and have been discussed in detail elsewhere e g friberg et al 2011 harper et al 2021 but a major bottleneck to addressing them more fully has been the collation and analyses of suitable data that can unpick the determinants of different species distributions especially at larger catchment and river basin scales where more meaningful biodiversity management actions can be undertaken m c jackson et al 2016 bohan et al 2017 makiola et al 2020 these limitations go beyond simply the constraints they impose on passive observational biomonitoring as they also have implications for more proactive management such as restoration rewilding and species reintroductions these actions are often done locally and in an ad hoc fashion with many such efforts failing because the wider context of whether or not the catchment is suitable for the focal species in the first place has not been considered friberg et al 2011 wohl et al 2015 for instance if the chemical or physical conditions within catchments are prohibitive to the focal species then restoring local habitat patches will likely yield negligible benefits because of a lack of propagules to enter the patch lockwood et al 2005 such incompatible conditions are particularly likely in more polluted urban settings where many habitat restoration species reintroductions and conservation efforts are now being directed and these actions are also increasingly driven and monitored by citizen science groups rather than the traditional regulatory authorities wohl et al 2015 huddart et al 2016 bohan et al 2017 moolna et al 2020 given that managers need to predict the future suitability of certain catchments for invasive or protected species tools that can map their occurrence across environmental gradients will also be invaluable for prioritising future control and conservation interventions peterson 2003 traditional biomonitoring schemes are extremely costly and time consuming in particular because the focal species are broadly distributed across regions but also responsive to local and fine scale stressors thus there is a pressing need to determine where and how fine scaled monitoring data can be matched onto broader catchment scales and also to gauge not just the usefulness of repurposing large scale biodiversity data collected by formal regulatory bodies but whether citizen science data collected in a similar way could be used for such monitoring huddart et al 2016 makiola et al 2020 moolna et al 2020 exploring unconventional monitoring will become especially important in the coming years as such informal schemes are increasingly supplanting routine regulatory surveys whose budgets are shrinking in many areas e g see supplement 2 fig s3 that illustrates the precipitous decline in english water quality sampling here we explore the potential for using both formal and citizen science biodiversity data combined with new modelling approaches as a means for gauging water quality in urban and rural catchments across england focusing on these two groups of taxa that are usually overlooked in traditional schemes for biomonitoring of water quality current efforts from catchment scale decision makers towards environmental improvement focus on making in river conditions central to evaluating the impacts of interventions and for identifying efficient systems wide decisions dobson mijic 2020 but shaping effective policy for environmental improvements also needs to consider biodiversity explicitly deflem et al 2021 without such insights current catchment restorations are likely to remain highly variable and often ineffective kail et al 2015 such that management of pollution in rivers and land use at these scales may be insufficient to protect freshwater biodiversity and hence vast amounts of time and money may be wasted on unattainable outcomes to deliver meaningful environmental improvements decision makers need to be able to map their planned land use infrastructure or agriculture interventions against predicted changes to biodiversity whyte et al 2020 one of the tools we can employ to meet this challenge is ecological niche modelling enm sometimes also called species distribution modelling sdm which aims to link independent variables presumed ecological drivers with the presence or absence of species guillera arroita et al 2015 araújo et al 2019 a range of these studies have demonstrated that water quality samples can indeed be used to predict the presence of focal species oliveira et al 2010 tamayo olden 2014 gobeyn goethals 2019 gallardo et al 2020 huml et al 2020 kim et al 2020 2021 enm is a very different and hence potentially complementary approach from the traditional multivariate analyses used in schemes such as rict in the uk for tracking invertebrate responses to organic pollution everall et al 2017 in which an overall index value of ecological status is assigned relative to a predicted score based on reference conditions mapped onto that system s physical chemical attributes and location an enm approach could therefore act as an additional tool and also a potential validation test since it can employ independent datasets that are not tied to predefined baselines additionally because physical chemical water quality data are often already routinely collected for other purposes it helps maximise the amount of useful ecological information that can be extracted per unit effort or cost we propose that the most useful information of this type for decision makers would be at the catchment scale because this is where many key management actions and river basin management plans rbmps are implemented by using river catchments as the unit for presence absence sites rather than more conventional grids or a radius within an observation kuemmerlen et al 2014 demonstrated that predictions benefit from a more informative spatial extent that captures activities across the entire upstream catchment catchment scale information acknowledges that a given river aggregates biotic responses to multiple stressors and particularly those pollutants that are usually generated on land and at large scales e g agricultural runoff rather than those solely in the nearfield observation neighbourhood in time and space e g point source toxic spills sewage outflows this inherent link between water quality with catchment land use has repeatedly been demonstrated to be one of the strongest predictors of species presence dyer et al 2013 kuemmerlen et al 2015 however to the best of the authors knowledge it has not yet been augmented with multiple water quality parameters in species modelling applying this across multiple catchments could provide high levels of replication at regional to national scales and because of significant differences between catchments this has the potential to reveal strong gradients in multiple stressors that are obscured at smaller scales used in traditional biomonitoring schemes such a national scale approach could allow potential drivers and responses to be disentangled in a way not possible using current piecemeal studies and could help to improve the latter by setting them in the wider catchment context by providing this bigger picture multi catchment enm applications could aid prioritisation and more targeted follow up biomonitoring and interventions as and when required rather than the more ad hoc and hence costly approaches that predominate at present another advantage of a catchment based approach is that the impacts of stressors will be manifested at different scales in space and time and across different parts of the food web and these issues around scaling organisational levels and ecosystem responses can be captured in a more holistic manner than is currently possible this allows expanding phylogenetic and functional coverage beyond the more common narrow focus on macroinvertebrates to include multiple trophic levels and even species that span freshwater terrestrial marine ecotones e g riparian plants migratory fishes capturing such species that also respond to more chronic and spatially disaggregate stressors can provide more integrated ecological responses than is possible from focusing on the narrow and hence more functionally constrained subset of taxa within a small part of the food web that underpins traditional approaches in this paper we illustrate how adopting a catchment scale approach to enm can provide useful information for decision makers on the relationships between land use and water quality information with biodiversity conditions based on four testable hypotheses first that water quality and land use data can be aggregated to meaningful catchment management units and used to make robust predictions on the presence or absence of a given species second that this approach can be scaled to a wide variety of species across the food web using the same suite of predictors in a simple and succinct framework third that those species can go beyond the traditional biomonitoring indicators to include both those that are under threat as well as those that are non native invasive species all of these have niche requirements and so fit the modelling framework we are proposing finally these methods can help managers identify what species land uses water quality indicators and locations should be prioritised for future interventions in testing the first two hypotheses we present a method to aggregate species water quality and land use information to a catchment scale and model the presence absence of species because of its increasing role in biomonitoring we also explore the usefulness of citizen science data in comparison to more formal sampling and its potential for integration in future schemes we demonstrate this tool across all 5 638 water framework directive wfd catchments in england as a proof of concept for a set of 48 routinely monitored species of concern across the riverine food web from plants to large predators a subset of four species from different trophic levels are explored further as focal case studies with a more detailed worked example provided for the atlantic salmon which is a major focus across the uk for conservation and river restoration efforts woodward et al 2021 bull et al 2022 with a view to identify what constrains its presence or absence at these larger scales 2 datasets and pre processing a variety of data and pre processing is required both in terms of predictors and responses species observations to generate presence absence predictions for different species all analysis was performed at the catchment scale across england we outline catchments using the smallest water framework directive wfd catchments these wfd catchments are referred to as water bodies defined by the european centre for river restoration as the basic unit that are used to assess the quality of the water environment and to set targets for environmental improvements although the uk is no longer an eu member state this framework still bounds its current biomonitoring programmes and it also serves as a useful test of the potential universality of our approach in terms of being able to ultimately adapt it to the remaining eu member states in england the uk region used in this study there are 5 680 water bodies with an average area of 22km2 covering 124 960km2 in total to avoid confusion we simply refer to these as catchments hereafter we illustrate the data processing in fig 2 for example catchments and provide further details in the following sections all data used in this study are publicly available and further information on acquiring and processing them is available in the supplement 4 2 1 water quality the underlying methodology behind catchment management is to assess whether water quality metrics in rivers meet key criteria of use to managers the english environment agency ea data that supports this can be found in an openly available data repository called the water data archive commonly referred to as wims environment agency 2020c between 2000 2021 the entire extent of the archive around 200 000 spot samples of water quality were taken every year and tested for a range of chemical or physical indicators resulting in an archive containing nearly 60 million individual water quality measurements at 58 000 locations across england these measurements specify the type of water being sampled the sample material for example groundwater river water or sewage effluent and thus provide a wealth of information as to the typical water quality profile for water across a range of stages in the water cycle a breakdown of water quality metric distributions by sample material is provided in dobson et al 2021 and has been used to inform recent reports that provide detailed assessment of water quality in both freshwater and estuarine environments mccormick et al 2021 the sample material most frequently recorded in wims is river water which as set out in section 1 we expect to provide an effective aggregate assessment of overall catchment quality that can be used to predict species presence or absence although species often have highly specific niches that they occupy in terms of pollutants gobeyn goethals 2019 deflem et al 2021 this type of fine tuned control or monitoring of pollution is not available to catchment managers who instead rely on a coarse aggregate metric to assess catchment water quality for example for a catchment to achieve good status under the classification of soluble reactive phosphorus samples averaged over a year must be less than 50µg p l liu et al 2022 to reflect this aggregate approach to catchment management we used the median of all measurements of a given water quality metric within a catchment in the wims archive fig 2 a b demonstrate the aggregation of nitrite spot samples 2a over a catchment to a median value 2b as an example of the general approach 2 2 land use land use data are openly available for the entire united kingdom uk at 25m2 resolution from the uk centre for ecology and hydrology fig 2c in this study we use the 2015 land cover map owland et al 2017 considering it the optimal balance between highest resolution and date most representative of the 2000 2019 wims data archive period we note that aggregated to the average 22km2 catchment scale we expect changes in land use in the 20 years of these data to have minimal impact on our national analysis although the data provide up to 21 detailed land class categories defined by d l jackson 2000 we use the 10 aggregate classes broadleaf woodland coniferous woodland arable improved grassland semi natural grassland mountain heath bog saltwater freshwater coastal and built up areas or gardens adjudging the differences between aggregate classes to far outweigh the differences within aggregate classes to maximise the useful information provided to the enm to ensure land use information is scale independent accounting for different sized catchments we aggregate by providing the percentage area of a catchment that is accounted for by each land use class demonstrated in fig 2d 2 3 species observations an openly available source for species observations is the global biodiversity information facility gbif the api for gbif can be interacted with automatically via an r package gbif 2021 which we use gbif collates both citizen submitted observations and those from institutions or organisations the two ea datasets distributed through gbif are the england non native species records environment agency 2020a and the england rare and protected species records environment agency 2020b between these two datasets 232 000 species observations are available for download via the gbif api the quality control of these ea data is also listed as high because records are provided either directly by biodiversity staff or through professional surveys for the purpose of narrowing down a subset of observations to use in this study we use all species that have been observed in either of these two ea datasets non native species and protected species at least 100 times across all sites with sufficient water quality data between 2000 2020 giving 48 different species and around 220 000 observations thus catchment scale presence is denoted if there are any recorded observations of a given species in a catchment and absence is denoted if not the catchment scale presence absence is the key dependent variable to be predicted by enm described in the following section we explore the impact of bias correction in filtering observations to create a more accurate characterisation of catchment scale presence absence in supplement 1 we also test augmenting these ea data with citizen collected data which doubles the total sample see supplement 1 2 4 ecological niche modelling to reveal ecological drivers at a catchment scale the overall goal of the enm in this study was to perform catchment scale predictions of whether species are present or absent using the independent variables which will enable variables to be prioritised in terms of how effective they are in making reliable predictions of species occurrences ultimately this will help decision makers improve how they assess the suitability of catchments and whether or not interventions or restoration attempts are likely to be successful the workflow demonstrated starts with three raw data sources the wims water quality data archive with a selection of 30 indicators section 2 1 a ceh land cover map with 10 categories section 2 2 and the 48 focal species downloaded using gbif section 2 3 these data are processed to catchment scale supplement s1 see fig 2 for example to produce sets of independent variables water quality and land use and dependent variables presence or absence catchments are allocated to training or validation sets and for each species regression models are fit to training catchments and evaluated on validation catchments section 3 1 4 1 we compare independent variable distributions in presence catchments with absence catchments section 3 2 4 2 and map the output of regression models to indicate suitability as a decision making aid section 3 2 4 2 the presented workflow contains a range of tuneable parameters described in supplement 1 and summarised in table s1 we test different values of these parameters and examine their impact on species predictions performance in supplement 1 2 5 regression modelling to predict presence absence a range of approaches exist to fit independent variables to dependent variables in the context of enm indeed any statistical method falling under the regression or classification family is viable in this study we use a random forests approach because it has had widespread recent application in the water sector tyralis et al 2019 and also in enm de simone et al 2021 the method is also robust to overfitting which is a potential risk in studies like this because of the high number of independent variables 30 water quality indicators and 10 land use classes the python package xgboost chen guestrin 2016 contains support for random forests regression and was used in this study xgboost creates regression models fitting with and without including specific independent variables and measuring how much performance is gained with inclusion this relative performance gain gain hereafter can be considered a measure for how important an independent variable is in predicting dependent variables recording the importance of independent variables is critical in highlighting the relationships that matter for a decision maker to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in a rigorous manner cross validation was implemented by omitting data from the regression fitting process and then evaluating the trained regression models on these omitted data for each species catchments were used for either training or validation the xgboost random forests regression model was fit to the training catchments and evaluated on the validation catchments recording the area under receiver operating characteristic curve au roc the r2 value and the gain for each independent variable in an ideal experiment this process would be repeated using every catchment individually as the validation catchment as a compromise for computational effort 10 of the data was randomly allocated into a validation set of catchments with the remainder used for training and this process was repeated 100 times for each species to bound the likely true performance metrics and independent variable importance measured by performance gain 2 6 understanding ecological drivers the outputs of the random forests regression are predictive performance metrics for each species and gain values for each independent variable for each species the combination of this information can direct decision makers attention towards potential drivers that affect ecological endpoints for example a species with high performance metrics can be well explained by the information contained in the independent variables and those variables with the highest gain will matter the most these high performance high gain relationships are those of most potential use to a decision maker the approach of investigating potential species independent variable relationships by examining distributional differences between present sites and absent sites has been demonstrated in previous studies harrow lyle kirkwood 2021 in this study by plotting the distribution in terms of a cumulative distribution function cdf of the independent variable in sites where the species is absent and comparing against sites where the species is present the profile of a catchment that is suitable for a given species can be identified as with the cross validation of the random forests we plot the cdf for randomly sampled sites 100 times to capture the variability because our method uses openly available data at a national scale results can be mapped over all catchments with sufficient water quality data the output of each regression model is a number varying between 0 absence and 1 presence so we can use these models as indicators of suitability for a given species this enables independent variables to assess species suitability in regions that have not been well surveyed for biodiversity information a suitability map also provides more granularity and thus greater utility to a decision maker in comparison to solely a presence absence classification the models can also be used to estimate the change in suitability that results from a change in independent variables thus exploring the potential of different future intervention options 3 results 3 1 predicting species presence using water quality and land use data in fig 3 we present the distribution of performance metrics across cross validation repetitions by species grouped by trophic level all trophic levels contained some species with high performance metrics and some with low in general high r2 correlates with a high au roc but not exclusively r2 values are sensitive to the total number of present sites with rarer species being hardest to achieve high r2 while au roc values are not thus we use au roc as the primary performance metric fig 3a b show results for rare and protected native species while fig 3c d show results for invasive and non native species there was negligible difference in performance between predictions for native species and invasive both with an average au roc 0 81 although both categories contained a mix of difficult to predict and easy to predict species for 90 of modelled species predictions can be made with fair model skill au roc 0 7 hosmer et al 2013 and for 60 with good model skill au roc 0 8 the distribution of ranked gain values i e gain in performance metric when that independent variable was included in the regression model highlights the importance of different independent variables aggregated over all species over all cross validation repetitions fig 4 a ranks were used because gain values are not comparable between different species each category contained important variables and less important variables although nearly every variable was ranked as either of high or low importance for some species the independent variables of nitrite concentration conductivity hardness and the percentage of catchment that is the freshwater land category accounted for the highest median importance ranks and thus as the most important independent variables in general the conductivity category measurements yellow and nitrogen based pollutants orange were the most important although useful for revealing broad trends grouping all water quality indicators and land use information together masked important differences for some individual focal species we provide the same information but for two selected species salmo salar atlantic salmon hereafter and mustela vison american mink hereafter fig 4b c which revealed a different picture from the importance plot for all species 4a here the range in an independent variable s importance was significantly reduced and just a few metrics nitrite chloride conductivity copper and dissolved oxygen for salmon and conductivity freshwater land cover and nitrite for mink stood out as consistently important atlantic salmon was also one of the best predicted of our 48 focal species fig 3 therefore we should expect that these variables nitrite chloride etc can explain its presence absence and thus that these relationships are significant in contrast another vertebrate top predator the invasive north american mink was among the species worst predicted by individual environmental variables and has fewer consistently important independent variables suggesting its distribution was constrained by other drivers e g food availability suitable breeding sites we also provide further examples for the invasive american waterweed elodea canadensis and the threatened depressed river mussel pseudanodonta complanata in the supplement 3 fig s4 3 2 identifying relevant information for decision makers the proposed method enables decision makers to investigate potential species independent variable relationships in more detail for example in fig 5 a we plot the cdf of nitrite in catchments where atlantic salmon is present and the cdf in catchments where it is absent we select this relationship because fig 3 highlights that this species is well predicted and fig 4 shows that nitrite is a high gain independent variable for atlantic salmon models thus we would expect the relationship to be especially important fig 5a shows that catchments with atlantic salmon have significantly lower nitrite levels than those without regardless of the cross validation repetition in contrast to demonstrate a relationship where we are relatively certain that a factor is not of importance low gain and low predictive power for another of our focal species fig 5b plots the cdf of copper for catchments with the invasive top predator american mink fig 3 here there are no significant differences between the two cdfs which effectively overlap unlike the clear divergence for the salmon a check of the scientific literature can help to elucidate potential mechanisms behind these results and in the atlantic salmon case for example nitrite is associated with high levels of organic pollution and is also directly toxic to salmonids supporting fig 5a meanwhile chloride reduces the amount of nitrite that a salmon can uptake see importance of chloride fig 4 eddy et al 1983 in support of the non relationship we found between copper and mink this species is also seemingly insensitive to comparable levels of this heavy metal in its native range in north america aulerich et al 1982 we can observe similar distributional differences for important independent variables with literature supported explanations in the two further examples of species lower in the food web shown in the supplement 3 fig s5 we can explore the implications of this further returning to the atlantic salmon as a case study fig 6 a shows the output of fitted regression models i e a suitability indicator for atlantic salmon for catchments that have sufficient water quality indicator samples we contrast this with fig 6b which shows solely presence or absence by highlighting catchments with high suitability but no atlantic salmon observations black catchments fig 6b we also show the most promising candidates for catchment restoration or species re introductions in fig 6c we modelled a hypothetical scenario where we set nitrite to a high 0 025mg l concentration for every catchment re evaluated suitability and plotted the resulting change in suitability and discuss hypothetical impacts although we acknowledge our model is based on correlations and observations in fig 6d we did the same but set nitrite to a low 0 005mg l concentration this type of approach can be employed by planners to identify how changes to pollutant concentrations could alter suitability of a given species in the landscape in fig 6c increasing nitrite to a concentration that is prohibitive to atlantic salmon fig 5a shows that only 5 of catchments with atlantic salmon present have a median nitrite concentration higher than 0 025mg l will dramatically reduce the suitability of many catchments across the uk many deep red catchments in contrast fig 6d shows that the alternative scenario of reducing nitrite does improve suitability most catchments are light blue however this intervention is not sufficient alone to dramatically change the overall suitability landscape for atlantic salmon considering the substantial cost of undertaking such an implementation in the real world such a blanket nationwide reduction in permitted nitrite concentration could effectively be ruled out as a realistic legislative option for conservation of atlantic salmon other putative scenarios could then be explored as alternatives for instance more targeted local interventions to address bottlenecks in focal catchments close to threshold nitrite concentrations could yield better marginal returns 4 discussion this study reveals the huge potential for capitalising on and repurposing different forms of biomonitoring data to assess biodiversity and the potential for catchment management at regional to national scales for a wide range of species spanning the entire food web it also shows how such data can guide management of both native species and exotic invaders and even for using the latter as viable indicators of water quality especially in degraded urban ecosystems where invaders often predominate the first hypothesis presented in this work was that water quality and land use data can be aggregated to catchment scale for making predictions on species presence absence the high performance metrics observed in fig 3 whose robustness was confirmed through the extensive cross validation give strong support for this hypothesis from a catchment management perspective these results are highly encouraging as water quality and land use are often tractable variables that can be shaped by interventions at individual catchments discussed in detail in weglarz et al 2021 by equipping policymakers with the tools to understand what species suitable catchments look like we could tailor water quality regulations in a more targeted and efficient manner and open dialogues between communities policy and the water industry to help make decisions based on a significantly firmer evidence base the second hypothesis was that this approach could be applied using the same suite of water quality and land use variables for all species a key finding of this study is that nearly all variables provide important information at some level but the relative importance of each variable differs among species fig 4 that means there is a large amount of complementary insights that can be gleaned by going beyond simpler single species based or macroinvertebrate assemblage perspectives to one that considers many species from across both the tree of life and the food web cairns pratt 1993 bonada et al 2006 friberg et al 2011 from a management perspective this means that it is desirable to continue monitoring a wide variety of variables to maximise the sensitivity of the monitoring scheme this will be challenging considering the dramatic reduction in sampling effort that has taken place over the last 20 years in england alone see supplement 2 fig s3 that demonstrates a more than 50 decrease in pollutant records in the wims data archive when comparing 2000 2005 to 2015 2020 however it is encouraging that citizen science data easily available through the gbif api that was used which increasingly makes up for the growing shortfall in routine sampling and in our understanding of species distributions bini et al 2006 can also be applied in our approach further having a high percentage of freshwater land cover within a catchment was the highest gain independent variable across species indicating that it is the best predictor of presence absence fig 4a and that giving wildlife space above all must be a key priority for planners this supports the conclusions of lawton et al 2010 in the influential making space for nature report that is now the cornerstone of the uk s 25 year plan for the environment our results show that although lawton et al focussed mostly on terrestrial ecosystems isaac et al 2018 the same principles also clearly apply in the freshwater realm providing a clear path to link data models and policy answering the third hypothesis showed that it is possible to make use of even seemingly undesirable non native species to provide us with additional indicators of water quality enm is often challenging if a species is so widespread that their tolerances and limits are unclear they are everywhere whereas if a species distribution is patchy then there are few occurrences from which to produce a model see guillera arroita et al 2015 araújo et al 2019 for a broad review of enm use and fitting invasive species like native species fall along this spectrum but they also present the additional challenge of often being excluded from or marked negatively against assessments of ecological quality this is problematic in areas where novel ecosystems still provide functions and services but invasives are common and reference conditions are lacking notably lowland urban ecosystems weglarz et al 2021 cf fig 1 given that most of the world s human population now lives in urban environments and most cities are on river floodplains with the uk being no exception an ability to include invasive species in assessment of ecosystems is a major benefit thus we were encouraged to find that we were able to produce accurate models of non native species distributions and heartened that we could find no correlation between predictive accuracy and overall occupancy this suggests that current monitoring approaches which are mostly driven to focus on other indicators of more pristine baselines or observed reference conditions cairns pratt 1993 bonada et al 2006 friberg et al 2011 could be quickly and easily augmented with additional metrics based on non natives as such our approach could serve dual purposes it can use these species as indicators in their own right and also provide information to managers about their potential spread based on their environmental tolerances and niche requirements in addition the effectiveness of the enm suggests that it could be used to augment ongoing long term monitoring as well as priori identification of watersheds that are prone to invasive species this enables biomonitoring to adopt a far more predictive and hence proactive approach than has been the case to date the final hypothesis was that these methods can help managers identify what species land uses water quality indicators and locations should be prioritised for future interventions in fig 5a b we demonstrate how the proposed methodology reveals which independent variables have significantly different distributions in catchments where a species is present than catchments where a species is absent these relationships can then be verified by literature study to target catchment management more effectively the fitted regression models for a given species can be used to scale up decision making by creating suitability maps fig 6a to identify the best potential restoration sites fig 6b hence to project the estimated impacts of interventions fig 6c d we ultimately envisage pairing this method into decision making so that managers can directly target the physical and chemical water indicators that will have the greatest biodiversity benefits rather than relying on proxy criteria for water quality a variety of parametric choices and statistical methods were tested in supplement 1 fig s1 by testing the proposed methods with environment agency ea data only and augmented with citizen science observations we highlighted the role that the latter may play in enm more than doubling our observation sample size unlike with the environment agency data we recommend bias correction with citizen science data isaac et al 2014 isaac pocock 2015 because this improved the predictive performance although predictive performance was still lower than using ea data only there are a variety of other statistical refinements that could be made to improve the proposed approach still further including pre processing of independent variables to account for collinearities for example principal components analysis and to remove redundant information de marco nóbrega 2018 because extreme conditions are broadly thought to be of importance in enm zanne et al 2018 we tested the sensitivity of species to extreme conditions fig s1 by aggregating water quality indicators to the 5th or 95th percentile rather than the median although there was minimal sensitivity of predictions to these extremes further investigation into specific species sensitivity would be needed to conclude catchment scale insensitivity to extremes additionally more sophisticated treatment around inferring absence from a lack of present observations can improve predictions based on citizen collected data iturbide et al 2015 domisch et al 2016 we suggest that the proposed method can accommodate these refinements and our analysis presented in supplement 1 provides a simple framework to investigate their impacts overall we suggest that approaches such as the one presented here can be used to make efficient and effective use of data that is commonly gathered for other purposes to give an overview of the bigger picture of constraints on the distributions of key species both native and exotic at larger scales where major policy and management interventions are often conducted it could also be used to prioritise more targeted biomonitoring at reach scales using traditional techniques and offers promise for integration with emerging technologies and tools associated with next generation biomonitoring such as edna carraro et al 2018 which are especially well suited to presence absence occupancy data at scale this could further augment existing schemes as well as provide a means for developing new tools for monitoring modelling and managing our freshwaters to mitigate the impacts of the multiple emerging stressors they will face in the coming decades 5 conclusion in this paper we used land use data and water quality indicator samples to predict the presence absence of species we used regression modelling to make predictions at a catchment scale adjudging that this scale is the most relevant to decision makers our results revealed that it is possible to make accurate and robust predictions of a variety of species both invasive and rare native using common and open access data in catchments across england the proposed method can be used to create tailored decision making information as we demonstrate in an example with atlantic salmon this information includes identifying water quality indicators of interest and understanding their distribution in catchments with atlantic salmon as well as using mapping techniques to identify suitable catchments where they are missing and estimating changes in suitability that could be engineered through interventions ultimately we hope that this method will enable catchment managers to better target interventions

15747,biomonitoring of water quality and catchment management are often disconnected due to mismatching scales considerable effort and money are spent each year on routine reach scale surveying across many sites particularly in countries like the uk where nationwide sampling has been conducted using standardised techniques for many decades most of these traditional freshwater biomonitoring schemes focus on pre defined indicators of organic pollution to compare observed vs expected subsets of common macroinvertebrate indicator species other taxa including many threatened species are often ignored due to their rarity as are many invasive species which are seen as undesirable despite becoming increasingly common and widespread in freshwaters especially in urban ecosystems both these types of taxa are often monitored separately for reasons related to biodiversity concerns rather than for gauging water quality repurposing such data could therefore provide important new biomonitoring tools that can help catchment managers to directly link the water quality they aim to control with the biodiversity they are trying to protect here we used extensive data held in the england non native and rare protected species records that track these two groups of species as a proof of concept for linking catchment scale management of freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity to a range of potential drivers across england we used national land use centre for ecology and hydrology land cover map and water quality indicator environment agency water quality data archive datasets to predict at the catchment scale the presence or absence of 48 focal threatened or invasive species of concern routinely sampled by the english environment agency with a median accuracy of 0 81 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve a variety of water quality indicators and land use types were useful in predictions highlighting that future biomonitoring schemes could use such complementary measures to capture a wider spectrum of drivers and responses in particular the percentage of a catchment covered by freshwater was the single most important metric reinforcing the need for space habitat to support biodiversity but we were also able to resolve a range of key environmental drivers for particular focal species we show how our method could inform new catchment management approaches by highlighting how key relationships can be identified and how to understand visualise and prioritise catchments that are most suitable for restoration or water quality interventions the scale of this work in terms of number of species drivers and locations represents a significant step towards forging a new approach to catchment management that enables managers to

1 introduction water quality which is intimately connected to land use change and associated pollutants is a major determinant of biodiversity in freshwaters and biomonitoring programmes have been set up to track these relationships in many countries across the world turak et al 2017 van rees et al 2021 maasri et al 2022 in the uk for instance national biomonitoring schemes have been used for decades to track the impacts of chemical pollution friberg et al 2011 jackson et al 2021 particularly acidification e g the uk acid waters monitoring network organic pollution e g the river invertebrate prediction and classification system wright 1995 and river invertebrate classification tool and more recently but to a lesser extent toxins e g species at risk spear classifications friberg et al 2011 bohan et al 2017 many of these schemes rely on reach a small length of river spanning often just a few metres scale sampling of a subset of the food web usually macroinvertebrates and matching observed versus expected biotic indices based on reference conditions to infer water quality largely because direct chemical measures are prohibitively costly or insensitive friberg et al 2011 however this methodology has some critical limitations and defining suitable reference conditions is often challenging or impossible bohan et al 2017 makiola et al 2020 maasri et al 2022 for instance urban ecosystems in particular are heavily modified and often contain large populations of many non native often invasive species grimm et al 2008 m c jackson grey 2013 van rees et al 2021 such species are particularly problematic in the context of linking biodiversity to water quality because they are often seen as being undesirable biotic elements and so are excluded from such bioassessment schemes as indicators per se and their distributional drivers are often also poorly understood m c jackson et al 2016 nonetheless as with classical bioindicator taxa such as the so called riverflies or ept taxa that are widely used biosensors of organic pollution e g moolna et al 2020 they will also be sensitive to water quality the proportions of invasive species in england in a suite of 48 focal species see section 2 3 monitored by the environment agency shows a strong urban signature fig 1 suggesting that these taxa could be potential novel water quality indicators of particular significance in these highly modified ecosystems where conventional bioassessment methods are difficult to apply pearse et al 2018 another group of taxa that often fall outside the classical bioindicators are those that are protected and or threatened across england their distribution mirrors that of the invasive species in our focal set and they tend to be more prevalent in less polluted rural areas and are often absent from urban systems see fig 1 at the reach scale these taxa are often too rare or too hard to sample to be embedded meaningfully in traditional water quality assessment schemes which rely largely on more abundant macroinvertebrate indicators collected in pond nets e g moolna et al 2020 both these rare and invasive groups which can span the entire food web from basal resources to apex predators could potentially provide important complementary or alternative information on water quality particularly at large scales even though they are monitored for other purposes another major constraint in current water quality assessment schemes is the tendency to take a piecemeal approach focussed on one particular stressor whereas in reality most freshwaters are exposed to multiple stressors ormerod et al 2010 friberg et al 2011 disentangling drivers and responses at scale remains a major challenge and again this is of particular concern in urban freshwaters which are exposed to the greatest range of chemical pollutants miller et al 2018 m c jackson et al 2021 these limitations and caveats related to both drivers and response variables in current biomonitoring schemes are well known and have been discussed in detail elsewhere e g friberg et al 2011 harper et al 2021 but a major bottleneck to addressing them more fully has been the collation and analyses of suitable data that can unpick the determinants of different species distributions especially at larger catchment and river basin scales where more meaningful biodiversity management actions can be undertaken m c jackson et al 2016 bohan et al 2017 makiola et al 2020 these limitations go beyond simply the constraints they impose on passive observational biomonitoring as they also have implications for more proactive management such as restoration rewilding and species reintroductions these actions are often done locally and in an ad hoc fashion with many such efforts failing because the wider context of whether or not the catchment is suitable for the focal species in the first place has not been considered friberg et al 2011 wohl et al 2015 for instance if the chemical or physical conditions within catchments are prohibitive to the focal species then restoring local habitat patches will likely yield negligible benefits because of a lack of propagules to enter the patch lockwood et al 2005 such incompatible conditions are particularly likely in more polluted urban settings where many habitat restoration species reintroductions and conservation efforts are now being directed and these actions are also increasingly driven and monitored by citizen science groups rather than the traditional regulatory authorities wohl et al 2015 huddart et al 2016 bohan et al 2017 moolna et al 2020 given that managers need to predict the future suitability of certain catchments for invasive or protected species tools that can map their occurrence across environmental gradients will also be invaluable for prioritising future control and conservation interventions peterson 2003 traditional biomonitoring schemes are extremely costly and time consuming in particular because the focal species are broadly distributed across regions but also responsive to local and fine scale stressors thus there is a pressing need to determine where and how fine scaled monitoring data can be matched onto broader catchment scales and also to gauge not just the usefulness of repurposing large scale biodiversity data collected by formal regulatory bodies but whether citizen science data collected in a similar way could be used for such monitoring huddart et al 2016 makiola et al 2020 moolna et al 2020 exploring unconventional monitoring will become especially important in the coming years as such informal schemes are increasingly supplanting routine regulatory surveys whose budgets are shrinking in many areas e g see supplement 2 fig s3 that illustrates the precipitous decline in english water quality sampling here we explore the potential for using both formal and citizen science biodiversity data combined with new modelling approaches as a means for gauging water quality in urban and rural catchments across england focusing on these two groups of taxa that are usually overlooked in traditional schemes for biomonitoring of water quality current efforts from catchment scale decision makers towards environmental improvement focus on making in river conditions central to evaluating the impacts of interventions and for identifying efficient systems wide decisions dobson mijic 2020 but shaping effective policy for environmental improvements also needs to consider biodiversity explicitly deflem et al 2021 without such insights current catchment restorations are likely to remain highly variable and often ineffective kail et al 2015 such that management of pollution in rivers and land use at these scales may be insufficient to protect freshwater biodiversity and hence vast amounts of time and money may be wasted on unattainable outcomes to deliver meaningful environmental improvements decision makers need to be able to map their planned land use infrastructure or agriculture interventions against predicted changes to biodiversity whyte et al 2020 one of the tools we can employ to meet this challenge is ecological niche modelling enm sometimes also called species distribution modelling sdm which aims to link independent variables presumed ecological drivers with the presence or absence of species guillera arroita et al 2015 araújo et al 2019 a range of these studies have demonstrated that water quality samples can indeed be used to predict the presence of focal species oliveira et al 2010 tamayo olden 2014 gobeyn goethals 2019 gallardo et al 2020 huml et al 2020 kim et al 2020 2021 enm is a very different and hence potentially complementary approach from the traditional multivariate analyses used in schemes such as rict in the uk for tracking invertebrate responses to organic pollution everall et al 2017 in which an overall index value of ecological status is assigned relative to a predicted score based on reference conditions mapped onto that system s physical chemical attributes and location an enm approach could therefore act as an additional tool and also a potential validation test since it can employ independent datasets that are not tied to predefined baselines additionally because physical chemical water quality data are often already routinely collected for other purposes it helps maximise the amount of useful ecological information that can be extracted per unit effort or cost we propose that the most useful information of this type for decision makers would be at the catchment scale because this is where many key management actions and river basin management plans rbmps are implemented by using river catchments as the unit for presence absence sites rather than more conventional grids or a radius within an observation kuemmerlen et al 2014 demonstrated that predictions benefit from a more informative spatial extent that captures activities across the entire upstream catchment catchment scale information acknowledges that a given river aggregates biotic responses to multiple stressors and particularly those pollutants that are usually generated on land and at large scales e g agricultural runoff rather than those solely in the nearfield observation neighbourhood in time and space e g point source toxic spills sewage outflows this inherent link between water quality with catchment land use has repeatedly been demonstrated to be one of the strongest predictors of species presence dyer et al 2013 kuemmerlen et al 2015 however to the best of the authors knowledge it has not yet been augmented with multiple water quality parameters in species modelling applying this across multiple catchments could provide high levels of replication at regional to national scales and because of significant differences between catchments this has the potential to reveal strong gradients in multiple stressors that are obscured at smaller scales used in traditional biomonitoring schemes such a national scale approach could allow potential drivers and responses to be disentangled in a way not possible using current piecemeal studies and could help to improve the latter by setting them in the wider catchment context by providing this bigger picture multi catchment enm applications could aid prioritisation and more targeted follow up biomonitoring and interventions as and when required rather than the more ad hoc and hence costly approaches that predominate at present another advantage of a catchment based approach is that the impacts of stressors will be manifested at different scales in space and time and across different parts of the food web and these issues around scaling organisational levels and ecosystem responses can be captured in a more holistic manner than is currently possible this allows expanding phylogenetic and functional coverage beyond the more common narrow focus on macroinvertebrates to include multiple trophic levels and even species that span freshwater terrestrial marine ecotones e g riparian plants migratory fishes capturing such species that also respond to more chronic and spatially disaggregate stressors can provide more integrated ecological responses than is possible from focusing on the narrow and hence more functionally constrained subset of taxa within a small part of the food web that underpins traditional approaches in this paper we illustrate how adopting a catchment scale approach to enm can provide useful information for decision makers on the relationships between land use and water quality information with biodiversity conditions based on four testable hypotheses first that water quality and land use data can be aggregated to meaningful catchment management units and used to make robust predictions on the presence or absence of a given species second that this approach can be scaled to a wide variety of species across the food web using the same suite of predictors in a simple and succinct framework third that those species can go beyond the traditional biomonitoring indicators to include both those that are under threat as well as those that are non native invasive species all of these have niche requirements and so fit the modelling framework we are proposing finally these methods can help managers identify what species land uses water quality indicators and locations should be prioritised for future interventions in testing the first two hypotheses we present a method to aggregate species water quality and land use information to a catchment scale and model the presence absence of species because of its increasing role in biomonitoring we also explore the usefulness of citizen science data in comparison to more formal sampling and its potential for integration in future schemes we demonstrate this tool across all 5 638 water framework directive wfd catchments in england as a proof of concept for a set of 48 routinely monitored species of concern across the riverine food web from plants to large predators a subset of four species from different trophic levels are explored further as focal case studies with a more detailed worked example provided for the atlantic salmon which is a major focus across the uk for conservation and river restoration efforts woodward et al 2021 bull et al 2022 with a view to identify what constrains its presence or absence at these larger scales 2 datasets and pre processing a variety of data and pre processing is required both in terms of predictors and responses species observations to generate presence absence predictions for different species all analysis was performed at the catchment scale across england we outline catchments using the smallest water framework directive wfd catchments these wfd catchments are referred to as water bodies defined by the european centre for river restoration as the basic unit that are used to assess the quality of the water environment and to set targets for environmental improvements although the uk is no longer an eu member state this framework still bounds its current biomonitoring programmes and it also serves as a useful test of the potential universality of our approach in terms of being able to ultimately adapt it to the remaining eu member states in england the uk region used in this study there are 5 680 water bodies with an average area of 22km2 covering 124 960km2 in total to avoid confusion we simply refer to these as catchments hereafter we illustrate the data processing in fig 2 for example catchments and provide further details in the following sections all data used in this study are publicly available and further information on acquiring and processing them is available in the supplement 4 2 1 water quality the underlying methodology behind catchment management is to assess whether water quality metrics in rivers meet key criteria of use to managers the english environment agency ea data that supports this can be found in an openly available data repository called the water data archive commonly referred to as wims environment agency 2020c between 2000 2021 the entire extent of the archive around 200 000 spot samples of water quality were taken every year and tested for a range of chemical or physical indicators resulting in an archive containing nearly 60 million individual water quality measurements at 58 000 locations across england these measurements specify the type of water being sampled the sample material for example groundwater river water or sewage effluent and thus provide a wealth of information as to the typical water quality profile for water across a range of stages in the water cycle a breakdown of water quality metric distributions by sample material is provided in dobson et al 2021 and has been used to inform recent reports that provide detailed assessment of water quality in both freshwater and estuarine environments mccormick et al 2021 the sample material most frequently recorded in wims is river water which as set out in section 1 we expect to provide an effective aggregate assessment of overall catchment quality that can be used to predict species presence or absence although species often have highly specific niches that they occupy in terms of pollutants gobeyn goethals 2019 deflem et al 2021 this type of fine tuned control or monitoring of pollution is not available to catchment managers who instead rely on a coarse aggregate metric to assess catchment water quality for example for a catchment to achieve good status under the classification of soluble reactive phosphorus samples averaged over a year must be less than 50µg p l liu et al 2022 to reflect this aggregate approach to catchment management we used the median of all measurements of a given water quality metric within a catchment in the wims archive fig 2 a b demonstrate the aggregation of nitrite spot samples 2a over a catchment to a median value 2b as an example of the general approach 2 2 land use land use data are openly available for the entire united kingdom uk at 25m2 resolution from the uk centre for ecology and hydrology fig 2c in this study we use the 2015 land cover map owland et al 2017 considering it the optimal balance between highest resolution and date most representative of the 2000 2019 wims data archive period we note that aggregated to the average 22km2 catchment scale we expect changes in land use in the 20 years of these data to have minimal impact on our national analysis although the data provide up to 21 detailed land class categories defined by d l jackson 2000 we use the 10 aggregate classes broadleaf woodland coniferous woodland arable improved grassland semi natural grassland mountain heath bog saltwater freshwater coastal and built up areas or gardens adjudging the differences between aggregate classes to far outweigh the differences within aggregate classes to maximise the useful information provided to the enm to ensure land use information is scale independent accounting for different sized catchments we aggregate by providing the percentage area of a catchment that is accounted for by each land use class demonstrated in fig 2d 2 3 species observations an openly available source for species observations is the global biodiversity information facility gbif the api for gbif can be interacted with automatically via an r package gbif 2021 which we use gbif collates both citizen submitted observations and those from institutions or organisations the two ea datasets distributed through gbif are the england non native species records environment agency 2020a and the england rare and protected species records environment agency 2020b between these two datasets 232 000 species observations are available for download via the gbif api the quality control of these ea data is also listed as high because records are provided either directly by biodiversity staff or through professional surveys for the purpose of narrowing down a subset of observations to use in this study we use all species that have been observed in either of these two ea datasets non native species and protected species at least 100 times across all sites with sufficient water quality data between 2000 2020 giving 48 different species and around 220 000 observations thus catchment scale presence is denoted if there are any recorded observations of a given species in a catchment and absence is denoted if not the catchment scale presence absence is the key dependent variable to be predicted by enm described in the following section we explore the impact of bias correction in filtering observations to create a more accurate characterisation of catchment scale presence absence in supplement 1 we also test augmenting these ea data with citizen collected data which doubles the total sample see supplement 1 2 4 ecological niche modelling to reveal ecological drivers at a catchment scale the overall goal of the enm in this study was to perform catchment scale predictions of whether species are present or absent using the independent variables which will enable variables to be prioritised in terms of how effective they are in making reliable predictions of species occurrences ultimately this will help decision makers improve how they assess the suitability of catchments and whether or not interventions or restoration attempts are likely to be successful the workflow demonstrated starts with three raw data sources the wims water quality data archive with a selection of 30 indicators section 2 1 a ceh land cover map with 10 categories section 2 2 and the 48 focal species downloaded using gbif section 2 3 these data are processed to catchment scale supplement s1 see fig 2 for example to produce sets of independent variables water quality and land use and dependent variables presence or absence catchments are allocated to training or validation sets and for each species regression models are fit to training catchments and evaluated on validation catchments section 3 1 4 1 we compare independent variable distributions in presence catchments with absence catchments section 3 2 4 2 and map the output of regression models to indicate suitability as a decision making aid section 3 2 4 2 the presented workflow contains a range of tuneable parameters described in supplement 1 and summarised in table s1 we test different values of these parameters and examine their impact on species predictions performance in supplement 1 2 5 regression modelling to predict presence absence a range of approaches exist to fit independent variables to dependent variables in the context of enm indeed any statistical method falling under the regression or classification family is viable in this study we use a random forests approach because it has had widespread recent application in the water sector tyralis et al 2019 and also in enm de simone et al 2021 the method is also robust to overfitting which is a potential risk in studies like this because of the high number of independent variables 30 water quality indicators and 10 land use classes the python package xgboost chen guestrin 2016 contains support for random forests regression and was used in this study xgboost creates regression models fitting with and without including specific independent variables and measuring how much performance is gained with inclusion this relative performance gain gain hereafter can be considered a measure for how important an independent variable is in predicting dependent variables recording the importance of independent variables is critical in highlighting the relationships that matter for a decision maker to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in a rigorous manner cross validation was implemented by omitting data from the regression fitting process and then evaluating the trained regression models on these omitted data for each species catchments were used for either training or validation the xgboost random forests regression model was fit to the training catchments and evaluated on the validation catchments recording the area under receiver operating characteristic curve au roc the r2 value and the gain for each independent variable in an ideal experiment this process would be repeated using every catchment individually as the validation catchment as a compromise for computational effort 10 of the data was randomly allocated into a validation set of catchments with the remainder used for training and this process was repeated 100 times for each species to bound the likely true performance metrics and independent variable importance measured by performance gain 2 6 understanding ecological drivers the outputs of the random forests regression are predictive performance metrics for each species and gain values for each independent variable for each species the combination of this information can direct decision makers attention towards potential drivers that affect ecological endpoints for example a species with high performance metrics can be well explained by the information contained in the independent variables and those variables with the highest gain will matter the most these high performance high gain relationships are those of most potential use to a decision maker the approach of investigating potential species independent variable relationships by examining distributional differences between present sites and absent sites has been demonstrated in previous studies harrow lyle kirkwood 2021 in this study by plotting the distribution in terms of a cumulative distribution function cdf of the independent variable in sites where the species is absent and comparing against sites where the species is present the profile of a catchment that is suitable for a given species can be identified as with the cross validation of the random forests we plot the cdf for randomly sampled sites 100 times to capture the variability because our method uses openly available data at a national scale results can be mapped over all catchments with sufficient water quality data the output of each regression model is a number varying between 0 absence and 1 presence so we can use these models as indicators of suitability for a given species this enables independent variables to assess species suitability in regions that have not been well surveyed for biodiversity information a suitability map also provides more granularity and thus greater utility to a decision maker in comparison to solely a presence absence classification the models can also be used to estimate the change in suitability that results from a change in independent variables thus exploring the potential of different future intervention options 3 results 3 1 predicting species presence using water quality and land use data in fig 3 we present the distribution of performance metrics across cross validation repetitions by species grouped by trophic level all trophic levels contained some species with high performance metrics and some with low in general high r2 correlates with a high au roc but not exclusively r2 values are sensitive to the total number of present sites with rarer species being hardest to achieve high r2 while au roc values are not thus we use au roc as the primary performance metric fig 3a b show results for rare and protected native species while fig 3c d show results for invasive and non native species there was negligible difference in performance between predictions for native species and invasive both with an average au roc 0 81 although both categories contained a mix of difficult to predict and easy to predict species for 90 of modelled species predictions can be made with fair model skill au roc 0 7 hosmer et al 2013 and for 60 with good model skill au roc 0 8 the distribution of ranked gain values i e gain in performance metric when that independent variable was included in the regression model highlights the importance of different independent variables aggregated over all species over all cross validation repetitions fig 4 a ranks were used because gain values are not comparable between different species each category contained important variables and less important variables although nearly every variable was ranked as either of high or low importance for some species the independent variables of nitrite concentration conductivity hardness and the percentage of catchment that is the freshwater land category accounted for the highest median importance ranks and thus as the most important independent variables in general the conductivity category measurements yellow and nitrogen based pollutants orange were the most important although useful for revealing broad trends grouping all water quality indicators and land use information together masked important differences for some individual focal species we provide the same information but for two selected species salmo salar atlantic salmon hereafter and mustela vison american mink hereafter fig 4b c which revealed a different picture from the importance plot for all species 4a here the range in an independent variable s importance was significantly reduced and just a few metrics nitrite chloride conductivity copper and dissolved oxygen for salmon and conductivity freshwater land cover and nitrite for mink stood out as consistently important atlantic salmon was also one of the best predicted of our 48 focal species fig 3 therefore we should expect that these variables nitrite chloride etc can explain its presence absence and thus that these relationships are significant in contrast another vertebrate top predator the invasive north american mink was among the species worst predicted by individual environmental variables and has fewer consistently important independent variables suggesting its distribution was constrained by other drivers e g food availability suitable breeding sites we also provide further examples for the invasive american waterweed elodea canadensis and the threatened depressed river mussel pseudanodonta complanata in the supplement 3 fig s4 3 2 identifying relevant information for decision makers the proposed method enables decision makers to investigate potential species independent variable relationships in more detail for example in fig 5 a we plot the cdf of nitrite in catchments where atlantic salmon is present and the cdf in catchments where it is absent we select this relationship because fig 3 highlights that this species is well predicted and fig 4 shows that nitrite is a high gain independent variable for atlantic salmon models thus we would expect the relationship to be especially important fig 5a shows that catchments with atlantic salmon have significantly lower nitrite levels than those without regardless of the cross validation repetition in contrast to demonstrate a relationship where we are relatively certain that a factor is not of importance low gain and low predictive power for another of our focal species fig 5b plots the cdf of copper for catchments with the invasive top predator american mink fig 3 here there are no significant differences between the two cdfs which effectively overlap unlike the clear divergence for the salmon a check of the scientific literature can help to elucidate potential mechanisms behind these results and in the atlantic salmon case for example nitrite is associated with high levels of organic pollution and is also directly toxic to salmonids supporting fig 5a meanwhile chloride reduces the amount of nitrite that a salmon can uptake see importance of chloride fig 4 eddy et al 1983 in support of the non relationship we found between copper and mink this species is also seemingly insensitive to comparable levels of this heavy metal in its native range in north america aulerich et al 1982 we can observe similar distributional differences for important independent variables with literature supported explanations in the two further examples of species lower in the food web shown in the supplement 3 fig s5 we can explore the implications of this further returning to the atlantic salmon as a case study fig 6 a shows the output of fitted regression models i e a suitability indicator for atlantic salmon for catchments that have sufficient water quality indicator samples we contrast this with fig 6b which shows solely presence or absence by highlighting catchments with high suitability but no atlantic salmon observations black catchments fig 6b we also show the most promising candidates for catchment restoration or species re introductions in fig 6c we modelled a hypothetical scenario where we set nitrite to a high 0 025mg l concentration for every catchment re evaluated suitability and plotted the resulting change in suitability and discuss hypothetical impacts although we acknowledge our model is based on correlations and observations in fig 6d we did the same but set nitrite to a low 0 005mg l concentration this type of approach can be employed by planners to identify how changes to pollutant concentrations could alter suitability of a given species in the landscape in fig 6c increasing nitrite to a concentration that is prohibitive to atlantic salmon fig 5a shows that only 5 of catchments with atlantic salmon present have a median nitrite concentration higher than 0 025mg l will dramatically reduce the suitability of many catchments across the uk many deep red catchments in contrast fig 6d shows that the alternative scenario of reducing nitrite does improve suitability most catchments are light blue however this intervention is not sufficient alone to dramatically change the overall suitability landscape for atlantic salmon considering the substantial cost of undertaking such an implementation in the real world such a blanket nationwide reduction in permitted nitrite concentration could effectively be ruled out as a realistic legislative option for conservation of atlantic salmon other putative scenarios could then be explored as alternatives for instance more targeted local interventions to address bottlenecks in focal catchments close to threshold nitrite concentrations could yield better marginal returns 4 discussion this study reveals the huge potential for capitalising on and repurposing different forms of biomonitoring data to assess biodiversity and the potential for catchment management at regional to national scales for a wide range of species spanning the entire food web it also shows how such data can guide management of both native species and exotic invaders and even for using the latter as viable indicators of water quality especially in degraded urban ecosystems where invaders often predominate the first hypothesis presented in this work was that water quality and land use data can be aggregated to catchment scale for making predictions on species presence absence the high performance metrics observed in fig 3 whose robustness was confirmed through the extensive cross validation give strong support for this hypothesis from a catchment management perspective these results are highly encouraging as water quality and land use are often tractable variables that can be shaped by interventions at individual catchments discussed in detail in weglarz et al 2021 by equipping policymakers with the tools to understand what species suitable catchments look like we could tailor water quality regulations in a more targeted and efficient manner and open dialogues between communities policy and the water industry to help make decisions based on a significantly firmer evidence base the second hypothesis was that this approach could be applied using the same suite of water quality and land use variables for all species a key finding of this study is that nearly all variables provide important information at some level but the relative importance of each variable differs among species fig 4 that means there is a large amount of complementary insights that can be gleaned by going beyond simpler single species based or macroinvertebrate assemblage perspectives to one that considers many species from across both the tree of life and the food web cairns pratt 1993 bonada et al 2006 friberg et al 2011 from a management perspective this means that it is desirable to continue monitoring a wide variety of variables to maximise the sensitivity of the monitoring scheme this will be challenging considering the dramatic reduction in sampling effort that has taken place over the last 20 years in england alone see supplement 2 fig s3 that demonstrates a more than 50 decrease in pollutant records in the wims data archive when comparing 2000 2005 to 2015 2020 however it is encouraging that citizen science data easily available through the gbif api that was used which increasingly makes up for the growing shortfall in routine sampling and in our understanding of species distributions bini et al 2006 can also be applied in our approach further having a high percentage of freshwater land cover within a catchment was the highest gain independent variable across species indicating that it is the best predictor of presence absence fig 4a and that giving wildlife space above all must be a key priority for planners this supports the conclusions of lawton et al 2010 in the influential making space for nature report that is now the cornerstone of the uk s 25 year plan for the environment our results show that although lawton et al focussed mostly on terrestrial ecosystems isaac et al 2018 the same principles also clearly apply in the freshwater realm providing a clear path to link data models and policy answering the third hypothesis showed that it is possible to make use of even seemingly undesirable non native species to provide us with additional indicators of water quality enm is often challenging if a species is so widespread that their tolerances and limits are unclear they are everywhere whereas if a species distribution is patchy then there are few occurrences from which to produce a model see guillera arroita et al 2015 araújo et al 2019 for a broad review of enm use and fitting invasive species like native species fall along this spectrum but they also present the additional challenge of often being excluded from or marked negatively against assessments of ecological quality this is problematic in areas where novel ecosystems still provide functions and services but invasives are common and reference conditions are lacking notably lowland urban ecosystems weglarz et al 2021 cf fig 1 given that most of the world s human population now lives in urban environments and most cities are on river floodplains with the uk being no exception an ability to include invasive species in assessment of ecosystems is a major benefit thus we were encouraged to find that we were able to produce accurate models of non native species distributions and heartened that we could find no correlation between predictive accuracy and overall occupancy this suggests that current monitoring approaches which are mostly driven to focus on other indicators of more pristine baselines or observed reference conditions cairns pratt 1993 bonada et al 2006 friberg et al 2011 could be quickly and easily augmented with additional metrics based on non natives as such our approach could serve dual purposes it can use these species as indicators in their own right and also provide information to managers about their potential spread based on their environmental tolerances and niche requirements in addition the effectiveness of the enm suggests that it could be used to augment ongoing long term monitoring as well as priori identification of watersheds that are prone to invasive species this enables biomonitoring to adopt a far more predictive and hence proactive approach than has been the case to date the final hypothesis was that these methods can help managers identify what species land uses water quality indicators and locations should be prioritised for future interventions in fig 5a b we demonstrate how the proposed methodology reveals which independent variables have significantly different distributions in catchments where a species is present than catchments where a species is absent these relationships can then be verified by literature study to target catchment management more effectively the fitted regression models for a given species can be used to scale up decision making by creating suitability maps fig 6a to identify the best potential restoration sites fig 6b hence to project the estimated impacts of interventions fig 6c d we ultimately envisage pairing this method into decision making so that managers can directly target the physical and chemical water indicators that will have the greatest biodiversity benefits rather than relying on proxy criteria for water quality a variety of parametric choices and statistical methods were tested in supplement 1 fig s1 by testing the proposed methods with environment agency ea data only and augmented with citizen science observations we highlighted the role that the latter may play in enm more than doubling our observation sample size unlike with the environment agency data we recommend bias correction with citizen science data isaac et al 2014 isaac pocock 2015 because this improved the predictive performance although predictive performance was still lower than using ea data only there are a variety of other statistical refinements that could be made to improve the proposed approach still further including pre processing of independent variables to account for collinearities for example principal components analysis and to remove redundant information de marco nóbrega 2018 because extreme conditions are broadly thought to be of importance in enm zanne et al 2018 we tested the sensitivity of species to extreme conditions fig s1 by aggregating water quality indicators to the 5th or 95th percentile rather than the median although there was minimal sensitivity of predictions to these extremes further investigation into specific species sensitivity would be needed to conclude catchment scale insensitivity to extremes additionally more sophisticated treatment around inferring absence from a lack of present observations can improve predictions based on citizen collected data iturbide et al 2015 domisch et al 2016 we suggest that the proposed method can accommodate these refinements and our analysis presented in supplement 1 provides a simple framework to investigate their impacts overall we suggest that approaches such as the one presented here can be used to make efficient and effective use of data that is commonly gathered for other purposes to give an overview of the bigger picture of constraints on the distributions of key species both native and exotic at larger scales where major policy and management interventions are often conducted it could also be used to prioritise more targeted biomonitoring at reach scales using traditional techniques and offers promise for integration with emerging technologies and tools associated with next generation biomonitoring such as edna carraro et al 2018 which are especially well suited to presence absence occupancy data at scale this could further augment existing schemes as well as provide a means for developing new tools for monitoring modelling and managing our freshwaters to mitigate the impacts of the multiple emerging stressors they will face in the coming decades 5 conclusion in this paper we used land use data and water quality indicator samples to predict the presence absence of species we used regression modelling to make predictions at a catchment scale adjudging that this scale is the most relevant to decision makers our results revealed that it is possible to make accurate and robust predictions of a variety of species both invasive and rare native using common and open access data in catchments across england the proposed method can be used to create tailored decision making information as we demonstrate in an example with atlantic salmon this information includes identifying water quality indicators of interest and understanding their distribution in catchments with atlantic salmon as well as using mapping techniques to identify suitable catchments where they are missing and estimating changes in suitability that could be engineered through interventions ultimately we hope that this method will enable catchment managers to better target interventions

15748,rhamnolipid rl one representative biosurfactant is widely regarded as an economically feasible and environmentally beneficial additive to improve fermentation efficiency and resource recovery from waste activated sludge was however its potentially detrimental impact on was fermentation such as h2s generation was overlooked previously this study therefore aims to fill the gap through exploring whether and how the presence of rl affects h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation experimental results showed that when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g total suspended solids tss the cumulative h2s yield enhanced from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g volatile suspended solids vss mechanism analysis showed that rl reduced was surface tension which benefited transformations of organic sulfurs e g aliphatic s and sulfoxide and inorganic sulfate from solid to liquid phase the presence of rl not only reduced the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil and damaged the hydrogen bonding networks of organic sulfurs but also promoted substrate surface charges and cell membrane permeability these facilitated the contact between hydrolase and organic sulfurs thereby increasing sulfide production from organic sulfurs hydrolysis further investigations showed that rl promoted the expression of key genes e g apra b and dsra b involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction which accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide meanwhile rl inhibited the corresponding key genes such as cysh and sir responsible for assimilatory sulfate reduction aps 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate organosulfur which reduced substrate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction besides rl decreased the fermentation ph which benefited the transformation of h s to h2s graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation rhamnolipid rl hydrogen sulfide h2s 1 introduction activated sludge process is widely applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide however its byproduct waste activated sludge was is increasingly produced it was documented that 40 million tons of was at 80 water content was produced in china yang et al 2015 treatment and disposal of such a large amount of was are serious challenges for wwtps liu et al 2021a luo et al 2019 nonetheless was also contains abundant organics and nutrients which account for 80 of dry weight make it a potential resource fu et al 2021 anaerobic fermentation which could convert was into high priced products such as short chain fatty acids scfas hydrogen and phosphorus based fertilizer has attracted more and more attention wu et al 2021 during this process the amount of was is reduced pathogens are killed the stability of was is improved and the valuable products are recovered in real word situations however the extent of fermentation is limited due to the poor biodegradability of was which causes low resource recovery dai et al 2017 to promote was anaerobic fermentation several methods especially chemicals addition were previously tested and demonstrated to be effective he et al 2018 for instance when cao2 addition increased from 0 05 to 0 25 g g vss the cumulative h2 yields improved from 0 77 to 10 55 ml g vss wang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 found that addition with 0 05 g g tss polyoxometalates increased scfas yield from 118 16 to 729 96 mg cod l among these chemicals biosurfactants especially rhamnolipid rl are regarded as renewable and environmentally friendly additives due to the good dispersion solubilizing characteristics and non toxic advantages xu et al 2018 2019 zhou et al 2017 which are used in wastewater and was treatments zhou et al 2013 the added rl effectively promoted the removal of some readily degradable organics e g protein and refractory substances e g emerging pollutants and heavy metals in wastewater for example sponza et al reported that 15 mg l rl addition improved the removal rates of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and soluble cod in wastewater from 72 and 90 to 80 and 99 respectively sponza and gok 2010 meanwhile the added rl not only obviously promoted valuable scfas and hydrogen production li et al 2021b zhou et al 2013 but also enhanced sludge dewatering and increased phosphorus recovery from sludge treatment he et al 2016 rl addition accelerates sludge solubilization and improves the proportion of biodegradable substances which could be used for subsequent scfas and hydrogen production for instance zhou et al 2013 found that 0 04 g g tss rl could increase the maximal scfas generation to 3840 mg cod l which was 4 24 fold higher than the control in particular it is worth noted that rl can be spontaneously produced in wwtps by utilizing soluble organics in wastewater and the added rl could further promote the in situ production of rl for example when 880 mg l rl was added to sludge treatment the concentration of rl in liquid phase increased to 1312 mg l after 4d of fermentation zhou et al 2013 together these might result in high levels of rl in wwtps especially sludge however almost all studies have so far focused on using rl to promote sludge fermentation efficiency and resource recovery e g hydrogen scfas and phosphorus but overlooked its potentially detrimental impact in addition to the generation of valuable products such as h2 and scfas some toxic foul smelling byproducts e g h2s methyl mercaptan and dimethyl disulfide are also generated from was anaerobic fermentation li et al 2019 among them h2s is the main component of malodorous gases which is highly toxic and corrosive generally 500 4000 ppm h2s is generated from sludge anaerobic treatment by organic sulfurs hydrolysis and inorganic sulfate reduction dai et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 rl presence would promote was disintegration and soluble organics release which might provide more available organic sulfurs for h2s production the increased generation of hydrogen and scfas after rl addition also provides more electron donors for sulfate reduction but at the same time rl has toxic effects on many anaerobic microbes such as methanogens li et al 2021b which might inhibit srbs activity and thereby reduce h2s production from sulfate reduction however whether and how rl affects h2s gas production from was anaerobic fermentation is still unknown this work was therefore to investigate whether and how rl presence affects h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation firstly the effect of rl at different concentrations i e 0 10 20 or 40 mg g tss on h2s production was investigated then the mechanisms of how rl addition affects h2s production were unveiled through assessing its impact on the release of organic and inorganic sulfurs from sludge solid phase to liquid phase the structure of organic sulfurs the process of macromolecules organic sulfurs hydrolysis sulfur containing amino acids degradation and sulfate reduction in addition the changes in key microbes enzymes and genes involved in h2s production after rl addition were further analyzed through operating the long term semi continuous fermenters this work deepens the understanding of how rl affects sulfur cycle during anaerobic fermentation calls for a reconsideration of the use of rl and other additives in wastewater and sludge treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 was source and characteristics the was used in this study was obtained from a sequencing batch reactor with a working capacity with 60l operated in laboratory before the tests the was was firstly filtered through stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by gravitational settling then stored in refrigerator at 4 c the major characteristics of the used was were described in table 1 the biosurfactant rl was gained from baisheng chemical tech co ltd shenzhen guangdong china 2 2 h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation with rl addition the widely addition of rl in sludge to improve anaerobic fermentation efficiency was in the range of 1 40 mg g tss xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 therefore a set of different levels 0 10 20 40 mg g tss of rl were used to evaluate the effect of rl on h2s generation from was fermentation in this study 2000 ml raw sludge was completely mixed equally distributed and transferred into 4 serum bottles working volume 1 0 l with 500 ml each among these one was set as control without rl addition while other three serum bottles were fed with different dosages of rl to achieve the concentration of 10 20 or 40 mg g tss after fully string to mix rl and raw sludge all the fermenters were flushed with high purified n2 for 5 min to fully remove o2 then each fermenter was covered with a rubber stopper and sealed at last all the fermenters were put into an air bath shaker 150 rpm 35 c the ph value in these fermenters was not controlled but recorded daily all tests were operated in triplicate and lasted for 20 d during which the anaerobic fermentation performance gradually reached stability the concentration of h2s gas and dissolved sulfide in the fermenters were measured daily 2 3 long term operation of semi continuous was anaerobic fermenters in this work two semi continuous fermenters were operated to analyze the changes in microbial community and key enzymes two serum bottles with 2l total volume each were used one was set as the control which was fed with 1l was without rl addition while the other was set as the experimental with the addition of 1l was containing 40 mg g tss rl the operational conditions were consistent with those mentioned in section 2 2 excepting the following description the sludge retention time in both two semi continuous fermenters were set as 19d according to the results obtained in section 2 1 namely 52 6 ml fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each semi continuous fermenter and was replaced with the raw was containing with or without 0 04 g g tss rl after about 100 days of operation the anaerobic fermentation performance gradually reached stability and the daily h2s generation did not change largely then the samples were withdrawn to analyze the key enzymes genes and microbial community 2 4 effect of rl on the structure of was and released organic sulfur compounds there are many sulfur components contained in either the extracellular or intracellular of sludge cell before being fermented these sulfur elements are firstly released from the solid phase of sludge to the liquid phase to analyze the influence of rl addition on the release of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds from was the experiments were operated under the same procedure as the section 2 2 then 10 ml sludge mixture was sampled daily and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min the obtained supernatant was firstly filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters and then was used to measure the concentration of soluble sulfate the main inorganic sulfur free amino acids and protein the main organic sulfur the deposited sludge after centrifugation was freeze dried and then milled and sieved environmental scanning electron microscopy esem xps and elemental analyzer were used to explore the changes in was structure and the sulfur composition and content in sludge solid after rl addition the changes in surface tension zeta potential and cell membrane permeability in sludge system after rl addition were also measured daily after the release of soluble organic sulfur compounds the presence of rl might have a potential influence on their structure and property to further explore the effect of rl on the structure and property of released organic sulfur compound protein was chose as the representative sulfur containing organic since it was the main organic sulfur compound contained in sludge li et al 2019 in this test two beakers were used one was fed with 100 ml 2 g l bovine serum protein bsa the model protein while the other was fed with 100 ml 2 g l bsa containing with 0 04 g g tss rl both the beakers were filled with n2 gas and then sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker 35 c after 2 days of treatment ultraviolet spectroscopy was used to measure the change in the conformation of the protein ftir and cd spectroscopy were used to analyze the change in protein structure 2 5 analysis of abundances and activities of h2s producers h2s is mainly produced from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds and the reduction of inorganic sulfate by srbs during which the hydrolytic enzymes sulfur containing amino acids lyases and srbs play important roles in was anaerobic fermentation process to investigate the influence of rl on the activities of these key enzymes and microbes a set of batch experiments were performed using model substances e g 3 5 g l bsa and 0 5 g l sulfate as substrate the was withdrawn from the two semi continuous fermenters with or without 40 mg g tss rl addition was used as inoculum before used the inoculum was firstly centrifuged washed and re suspended in ultrapure water the specific operation methods were based on our previous literatures liu et al 2021c wang et al 2021a which are described in text s1 the activities of these key enzymes and microbes were compared based on the degradation rate of corresponding model substrates mg g vss h in addition the activity of cysteine lyase which degrades cysteine to h2s was further measured spectrophotometrically the changes in microbial community were analyzed based on illumina miseq sequencing which was described in text s2 the abundances of functional enzymes and genes were predicated using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust langille et al 2013 2 6 modeling analysis according to previous literature the generated h2s from batch tests section 2 2 was fitted by the first order kinetic model eq 1 liu et al 2020 which was used to evaluate the influence of rl addition on the maximal h2s production potential hm mg g vss and hydrolysis rate k d 1 the relevance between the accumulated h2s generation and the fermentation time under the conditions of different doses of rl addition was calculated by origin 8 0 software 1 h hm 1 exp k t the influence of rl addition on the degradation rate of model substrates e g bsa and sulfate is calculated by the zero order kinetic model eq 2 wu et al 2021 where c0 and ct respectively represent the initial concentration of the substrate and the concentration of the substrate at a certain time d t is the fermentation time d while the x is the degradation kinetics rate 2 c 0 c t c 0 1 exp x t 2 7 other analytical methods tss vss and cod were determined according to previous literature liu et al 2021b the concentration of scfas i e the sum of acetate propionate isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric was measured by gc 21020 plus gas chromatograph shimadzu japan the content of h2 was determined by a gas chromatograph gc 112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector soluble protein was analyzed by the lowry folin method wang et al 2017 soluble sulfate was measured by spectrophotometer based on bacro4 so4 2 precipitate method while the soluble sulfide was determined by the methylene blue method wu et al 2019 h2s gas was analyzed by a portable h2s analyzer amino acid analyzer was used to determine the concentration of individual amino acids fu et al 2022 the environmental scanning electron microscopy fei quanta q400 usa was used to analyze the structure and morphology of sludge flocs xps vg multilab 2000 uk was used to analyze the content and composition of sulfur element in the sludge sample the elemental compositions and contents were measured by an elemental analyzer elementar company germany ultraviolet chromatography uv3100 shimadzu japan was used to characterize the change in protein structure ftir nicolet in10 usa and cd spectroscopy jasco j 715 japan were employed to analyze the change in protein secondary structure zeta potential and outer membrane permeability were measured based on previous literatures li et al 2020a wang et al 2021b the carbohydrate transporter solute binding protein pdb id 4rxu was chosen as model extracellular protein and molecular docking was used to visualize the binding process between extracellular proteins and rl according to previous literature li et al 2021a 2 8 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of rl on h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the maximal scfas yields enhanced from 573 5 to 2536 7 mg cod l while the accumulated h2 production enhanced from 2 15 to 6 93 ml g vss fig s1 however rl presence significantly increased h2s generation from was fermentation as shown in fig 1 it was observed that 323 6 10 4 mg g vss of h2s was produced from was fermentation without any rl addition which was comparable to that reported in previous literature dai et al 2017 with an increase of rl from 0 to 40 mg g tss the accumulated h2s generation increased from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g vss which improved by 91 7 according to previous literatures the first order kinetic model was used to fit the accumulated h2s yields attained in the batch tests liu et al 2020 the fitting results are very satisfactory with all r2 0 994 fig 1 modeling analysis results showed that rl presence not only increased the maximal h2s production potential hm but also accelerate the hydrolysis rate k from was anaerobic fermentation for example when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the values of hm and k respectively enhanced from 388 9 10 4 to 658 4 10 4 mg g vss and 0 104 to 0 153 d 1 which increased by 69 3 and 47 1 all these results suggested that rl addition promoted h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation 3 2 how does rl increase h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation 3 2 1 effect of rl on the transformation of sulfur components from sludge solid to liquid phase generally six sulfur compounds are contained in sludge solid which are sulfate sulfonic acid sulfoxide aromatic sulfur aliphatic sulfur and inorganic sulfides respectively zhang et al 2017 before being fermented the sulfur components require to be released into liquid phase as soluble organics he et al 2021 thus the influence of rl addition on the transformation of sulfur components was firstly evaluated as shown in fig 2 the esem image of sludge shows that rl presence destroyed sludge floc structure with many cracks appeared in sludge surface xps is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique which could identify the elements existed within a particle as well as their chemical state zhang et al 2017 li et al 2009 successfully used xps technology to analyze the forms of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds contained in solid hence in this work xps and ultimate analysis was used to unveil the changes in sulfur content and composition in sludge solid after rl addition text s3 liu et al 2012 compared with the blank without rl 40 mg g tss rl addition reduced the total sulfur content in sludge solid from 8 72 to 7 24 mg g ts after 2 days of treatment fig 2 with the exception of sulfate the other five sulfur compounds all decreased in the sludge solid after rl addition for example the content of sulfoxide reduced from 1 18 to 0 75 mg g ts the increase in sulfate content may be due to the adsorption of sulfate from the liquid phase on the solid surface accordingly the content of soluble protein the major source of organic sulfur total free sulfur containing amino acids the sum of cysteine and methionine and sulfate in liquid phase also increased after rl addition which improved by 2 25 time 1 86 time and 3 12 time respectively fig 3 a c these indicated that rl promoted sulfur compounds release from sludge solid phase to liquid phase as a typical biosurfactant rl molecules have a unique amphiphilicity with a hydrophilic polar group at one end and an oleophilic non polar group at the other which make rl have good dispersion and solubilizing characteristics luo et al 2015 this reduced the surface tension of hydrophobic molecules and water fig 3d and destroyed sludge floc structure esem image thereby facilitating the transport of sulfur compounds from the solid phase to liquid phase 3 2 2 effect of rl on the structure and property of the released organic sulfur compounds during was anaerobic fermentation the concentration of rl increased rather than decreased though it is biodegradable fig s2 the increased rl might be produced by the pseudomonas strains existed in was which was consistent with the previous reports that rl can be generated in situ in sludge zhou et al 2013 hence the presence of rl would inevitably interact with the released organic sulfur compounds from sludge solid in this work protein was chosen as the representative sulfur containing organic since it was the main organic sulfur compound contained in sludge li et al 2019 in the uv spectra the bands of 280 nm tryptophan and tyrosine and 257 nm phenylalanine xiao et al 2013 were present in both bsa the model protein solution with or without rl addition fig s3 however the corresponding absorbance intensity in the bsa solution with rl addition was lower than that in the bsa solution without rl addition this may be due to the formation of a complex between bsa and rl jannesari et al 2013 molecular docking was further used to visualize the binding process fig 4 a b it was found that the residues asp154 and gln357 were the main binding sites which binds to rl by forming hydrogen bonds cd and ftir spectra are used to attain the information on the conformation of proteins secondary structure li et al 2020b for example cd spectroscopy as an absorption spectroscopy uses circularly polarized light to investigate structural aspects of optically active chiral media this technique has been widely used to analyze the structure and conformation of protein wu et al 2017 generally there are six main secondary structure components contained in protein such as α helix random coils and aggregated stands among them the α helix which is consisted by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 is the essential shape in the secondary structure of protein li et al 2020a the α helix has a positive band at 190 nm and two negative bands at 209 and 222 nm in the cd spectra rl addition changed the peak location and intensity of cd spectra fig s4 clearly indicated the changes in the secondary structure of protein ftir spectra analysis further quantitatively shows the content of different shapes in the secondary structure of protein as shown in fig 4 the content of α helix and the proportion of α helix β sheet random coil decreased from 21 83 to 20 19 and 51 36 to 47 67 respectively it was reported that when the proportion of α helix β sheet random coil was low the protein molecule exhibited a loose structure yuan et al 2021 these indicated that rl addition destroyed hydrogen bonding networks and caused a loose structure of protein molecules thus providing a more readily available substrate for h2s production rl as an anionic surfactant ionizes in solution to produce a charged group which interacts with the protein s inversely charged amino acid residues through electrostatic interaction then the hydrophobic end of rl further binds to the hydrophobic point near the protein wu et al 2021 when the rl concentration increases beyond protein saturation binding sites further binding rl would cause protein de folding resulting in changes in protein spatial structure these explained why rl addition would affect protein property and cause a loose structure of protein molecules wu et al 2021 3 2 3 changes in the abundances and activities of h2s producers in addition to the available substrates the abundances and activities of key microbes and enzymes also plays important roles in h2s production h2s is produced from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds and the reduction of inorganic sulfate by srbs thereby the influence of rl presence on the abundances and activities of hydrolysis microbes and srbs were evaluated according to previous literatures most of the sulfate reducers belong to the deltaproteobacteria and the clostridia which are all within the bacteria only a few srbs are within the archaea and they are often existed in hydrothermal vents oil deposits and hot springs muyzer and stams 2008 hence in this study the impact of rl addition on anaerobic microbes was analyzed based on bacterial community alpha diversity analysis was used to unveil the changes in microbial community table s1 the coverage indexes in both the long term fermenters were similar 0 995 vs 0 996 which were close to 1 this indicated that the constructed sequence libraries covered almost the entire microbial community the indexes of shannon chao and pd whole tree which represented the relative abundance and diversity of microbial communities and phylogenetic diversity gao et al 2022 were higher in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl addition compared with the control suggesting that rl presence increased the microbial diversity rl addition changed the composition of microbial community fig s5 for instance compared with the control the abundance of bacteroidetes containing many proteolytic bacteria dai et al 2017 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl increased from 5 8 to 10 0 meanwhile proteobacteria containing 23 typical genera of srbs muyzer and stams 2008 is the largest phylum in both the fermenters but its abundance did not change obviously p 0 05 fig 5 further shows that rl increased the relative abundance of hydrolytic microbes and srbs e g desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus yan et al 2020 at genus level for instance the abundance of proteocatella the typical hydrolytic bacteria increased from 0 86 in the control to 1 15 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl while the total relative abundance of srbs in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl was higher than that in the control 0 75 vs 0 58 further investigation showed that rl increased the predicted abundance of genes coding key enzymes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction which uses sulfate to produce h2s but reduced the relative abundance of genes coding key enzymes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction which uses sulfate to synthesize organ sulfur compounds e g cysteine kushkevych et al 2020 fig s6 for instance compared with the control the relative abundance of gene coding dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsirs increased by 11 4 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl but the relative abundance of gene coding assimilatory sulfite reductase asirs reduced by 16 5 it is worth noting that the obtained dna based relative abundance data only provided a snapshot of community composition but cannot directly reflect the activity of microbial populations involved in the community in fig 6 the activities of these key microbes and enzymes were further analyzed based on the degradation rate of corresponding model substrates mg g vss h xu et al 2021 when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the degradation rate of bsa enhanced from 631 22 to 705 16 mg g vss d and the activity of cysteine lyase increased from 25 89 to 35 57 u ml these results showed that 40 mg g tss rl addition improved the activities of hydrolase and cysteine lyase by 11 2 and 37 4 generally the hydrolysis enzymes are existed in sludge flocs which tend to disperse from sludge solid to liquid phase during anaerobic fermentation process then these dissolved enzymes are easily inactivated by binding to some components in the liquid phase e g metal ions liu et al 2015 rl addition can form protective micelles or promote the contact between enzyme and substrate so as to maintain enzyme activity in aquatic biological reactions liu et al 2000 for example zeta potential which was applied to show the surface charge enhanced from 18 9 mv to 15 1 mv when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss fig 6b this indicated that rl weakened the mutual repulsion between enzyme and substrate rl addition also improved sludge cell membrane permeability fig s7 since it inserted the phospholipid layer and connected the membrane inside and outside wang et al 2021b thus enhanced the transport of amino acids from extracellular to intracellular these explained why rl increased the activities of hydrolysis enzymes thus promoted h2s production from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds moreover rl addition slightly inhibited the activities of srbs when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the degradation rate of sulfate reduced from 79 3 to 72 7 mg g vss d which indicated that 40 mg g tss reduced srbs activity by 8 3 it is reported that both dsirs and asirs the key enzymes involved in dissimilatory assimilatory sulfate reduction contain a siroheme fe s center consisting of a reduced porphyrin ring of the isochloric acid group bridged to a 4fe 4s cluster via cysteine thiolate surfactant as an active group would bind to enzymatic protein catalyzed residues through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions fig 6c thus occupying the active sites to affect enzymes activity shao et al 2017 however dsirs is a heterotetrameric αβ 2 complex with two siroheme 4fe 4s centers while asirs has only one peptide and does not form a polymeric protein with only one cluster of siroheme 4fe 4s per molecule parey et al 2010 which causes dsirs and asirs have different active site structures and makes dsirs more stable this explained why rl increased the relative abundance of dsirs but reduced the relative abundance of asirs fig s6 and thereby reduced substrate e g sulfate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction in addition the stimulative effect of increasing available sulfate fig 3c and electron donors fig s1 is greater than the toxicity of rl in a certain concentration range which is beneficial to the overall h2s production from sulfate reduction although rl may have some inhibition on srbs 3 2 4 changes in functional genes involved in h2s production in order to discover the intrinsic reason why microbial community was shifted in the direction for h2s generation with rl presence the key functional genes were further analyzed using picrust based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing data in the pathway of h2s generation from the hydrolysis of organic sulfurs the functional genes related to hydrolase secretion atp binding cassette transporters and amino acids metabolism play important roles as shown in fig 7 rl addition improved the relative abundance of these functional genes in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl for example the relative content of pepd and metq which respectively encoding protease secretion and d methionine transport system substrate binding protein luo et al 2021 increased by 59 1 and 55 6 in the rl supplied fermenter compared with the control in addition the abundance of key genes involved in sulfate reducing process was also affected by rl addition it was clearly found that rl addition inhibited the assimilation sulfate reduction but promoted the dissimilatory sulfate reduction for instance compared with the control the relative abundance of cysh and sir respectively reduced by 12 7 and 15 5 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl it was documented cysh and sir respectively encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase and sulfite reductase in the assimilation sulfate reduction process fu et al 2022 meanwhile the relative abundance of apra b and dsra b increased by 13 1 and 11 7 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl compared with the control yan et al reported that apra b and dsra b respectively encodes adenylylsulfate reductase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction process yan et al 2020 these inhibited the reaction of aps 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate sulfite organosulfur compounds asr and accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide dsr the increased functional genes responsible for h2s production with rl presence might be the intrinsic reason to increase h2s generation from was fermentation 3 2 5 effect of rl addition on the transformation of sulfide as expected the content of dissolved sulfide in the fermenter increased with an increase of rl addition fig s8 for example when the addition of rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the dissolved sulfide enhanced from 0 21 to 0 30 mg s l at the 4th day of anaerobic fermentation meanwhile rl addition also changed the fermentation ph in sludge system which affect the transformation of sulfide with an increase of rl addition the fermentation ph reduced in the sludge system fig s9 compared with the fermenter without rl addition the fermentation ph in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl reduced from 6 91 to 6 30 at the 4th day of anaerobic fermentation the produced high concentrations of organic acids e g scfas fig s1 after rl addition tends to consume alkalinity which might cause the decrease of ph in sludge system it was documented that the pka of the hs h2s equilibrium is near ph 7 at 25 c chen et al 2014 hence the decrease of sludge ph from 6 9 to 6 3 after rl addition would promote h2s formation from hs this indicated that the acidic ph after rl addition promoted h2s gas release from the transformation of sulfide in the sludge system 4 implications generally it is thought that rl addition is beneficial to wastewater and sludge treatment which promotes the removal of degradable and refractory organics in sewage and enhances the recovery of resources and energy e g scfas and h2 in sludge treatment this work however firstly found that rl presence promoted h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation which might pose serious challenges to equipment maintenance according to our analyses rl presence promoted aliphatic s sulfoxide and inorganic sulfate release from sludge solid to liquid phase reduced the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil and damaged organic sulfurs structure thus provided a more readily available substrate for h2s production rl also increased substrate surface charge and improved membrane permeability promoted the contact between enzymes and substrate and the transport of amino acids from extracellular to intracellular these improved the activity of the hydrolase and thereby increased h2s production from organic sulfurs hydrolysis rl improved the expression of key genes e g apra b and dsra b involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction which accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide meanwhile rl inhibited the corresponding key genes such as cysh and sir responsible for assimilatory sulfate reduction which reduced substrate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction as far as we know none of the findings have been previously documented so this work advances the understanding of the effect of rl on sludge treatment the findings attained in this paper might also have important implications for sludge treatment and wwtps operation the rl based method has been regarded as an economically feasible measure to enhance wastewater and sludge treatment which changed the wwtps from linear economy to circular economy li et al 2021b however the increased h2s production reported here raises new concerns when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the cumulative h2s yield increased from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g vss this calls for a reconsideration of the use of rl and other additives in wastewater and sludge treatment more studies should be conducted on how to improve fermentation efficiency while achieving low production of h2s gases according to the results obtained in this paper and previous literatures it seems that increasing fermentation efficiency inevitably improves the release of large amounts of organics including sulfur components from sludge solid to liquid phase fu et al 2022 hence strategies that either effectively increase sulfur removal from the released organics before anaerobic fermentation or strongly inhibit the activity of sulfide producers might be the key to reducing h2s production 5 conclusion in this work a series of batch and long term experiments were operated to explore the potential impact of rl addition on h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation and unveil the underlying mechanisms the main conclusions obtained in this paper are as follow 1 rl addition significantly promoted h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation 40 mg g tss rl improved h2s generation by 91 7 2 rl addition not only increased the dissolution of organic sulfur compounds but also promoted the release of inorganic sulfate 3 compared with blank without any rl addition 40 mg g tss rl improved the activities of hydrolase and cysteine lyase by 11 2 and 37 4 but reduced the activity of srbs by 8 3 4 microbial community analysis showed that rl addition increased the enrichment of hydrolytic microbes and sulfate reducing bacteria in the long term operational fermenter 5 the functional genes analysis presented that rl addition promoted the dissimilatory sulfate reduction but inhibited the assimilation sulfate reduction

15748,rhamnolipid rl one representative biosurfactant is widely regarded as an economically feasible and environmentally beneficial additive to improve fermentation efficiency and resource recovery from waste activated sludge was however its potentially detrimental impact on was fermentation such as h2s generation was overlooked previously this study therefore aims to fill the gap through exploring whether and how the presence of rl affects h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation experimental results showed that when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g total suspended solids tss the cumulative h2s yield enhanced from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g volatile suspended solids vss mechanism analysis showed that rl reduced was surface tension which benefited transformations of organic sulfurs e g aliphatic s and sulfoxide and inorganic sulfate from solid to liquid phase the presence of rl not only reduced the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil and damaged the hydrogen bonding networks of organic sulfurs but also promoted substrate surface charges and cell membrane permeability these facilitated the contact between hydrolase and organic sulfurs thereby increasing sulfide production from organic sulfurs hydrolysis further investigations showed that rl promoted the expression of key genes e g apra b and dsra b involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction which accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide meanwhile rl inhibited the corresponding key genes such as cysh and sir responsible for assimilatory sulfate reduction aps 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate organosulfur which reduced substrate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction besides rl decreased the fermentation ph which benefited the transformation of h s to h2s graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation rhamnolipid rl hydrogen sulfide h2s 1 introduction activated sludge process is widely applied in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide however its byproduct waste activated sludge was is increasingly produced it was documented that 40 million tons of was at 80 water content was produced in china yang et al 2015 treatment and disposal of such a large amount of was are serious challenges for wwtps liu et al 2021a luo et al 2019 nonetheless was also contains abundant organics and nutrients which account for 80 of dry weight make it a potential resource fu et al 2021 anaerobic fermentation which could convert was into high priced products such as short chain fatty acids scfas hydrogen and phosphorus based fertilizer has attracted more and more attention wu et al 2021 during this process the amount of was is reduced pathogens are killed the stability of was is improved and the valuable products are recovered in real word situations however the extent of fermentation is limited due to the poor biodegradability of was which causes low resource recovery dai et al 2017 to promote was anaerobic fermentation several methods especially chemicals addition were previously tested and demonstrated to be effective he et al 2018 for instance when cao2 addition increased from 0 05 to 0 25 g g vss the cumulative h2 yields improved from 0 77 to 10 55 ml g vss wang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 found that addition with 0 05 g g tss polyoxometalates increased scfas yield from 118 16 to 729 96 mg cod l among these chemicals biosurfactants especially rhamnolipid rl are regarded as renewable and environmentally friendly additives due to the good dispersion solubilizing characteristics and non toxic advantages xu et al 2018 2019 zhou et al 2017 which are used in wastewater and was treatments zhou et al 2013 the added rl effectively promoted the removal of some readily degradable organics e g protein and refractory substances e g emerging pollutants and heavy metals in wastewater for example sponza et al reported that 15 mg l rl addition improved the removal rates of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and soluble cod in wastewater from 72 and 90 to 80 and 99 respectively sponza and gok 2010 meanwhile the added rl not only obviously promoted valuable scfas and hydrogen production li et al 2021b zhou et al 2013 but also enhanced sludge dewatering and increased phosphorus recovery from sludge treatment he et al 2016 rl addition accelerates sludge solubilization and improves the proportion of biodegradable substances which could be used for subsequent scfas and hydrogen production for instance zhou et al 2013 found that 0 04 g g tss rl could increase the maximal scfas generation to 3840 mg cod l which was 4 24 fold higher than the control in particular it is worth noted that rl can be spontaneously produced in wwtps by utilizing soluble organics in wastewater and the added rl could further promote the in situ production of rl for example when 880 mg l rl was added to sludge treatment the concentration of rl in liquid phase increased to 1312 mg l after 4d of fermentation zhou et al 2013 together these might result in high levels of rl in wwtps especially sludge however almost all studies have so far focused on using rl to promote sludge fermentation efficiency and resource recovery e g hydrogen scfas and phosphorus but overlooked its potentially detrimental impact in addition to the generation of valuable products such as h2 and scfas some toxic foul smelling byproducts e g h2s methyl mercaptan and dimethyl disulfide are also generated from was anaerobic fermentation li et al 2019 among them h2s is the main component of malodorous gases which is highly toxic and corrosive generally 500 4000 ppm h2s is generated from sludge anaerobic treatment by organic sulfurs hydrolysis and inorganic sulfate reduction dai et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 rl presence would promote was disintegration and soluble organics release which might provide more available organic sulfurs for h2s production the increased generation of hydrogen and scfas after rl addition also provides more electron donors for sulfate reduction but at the same time rl has toxic effects on many anaerobic microbes such as methanogens li et al 2021b which might inhibit srbs activity and thereby reduce h2s production from sulfate reduction however whether and how rl affects h2s gas production from was anaerobic fermentation is still unknown this work was therefore to investigate whether and how rl presence affects h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation firstly the effect of rl at different concentrations i e 0 10 20 or 40 mg g tss on h2s production was investigated then the mechanisms of how rl addition affects h2s production were unveiled through assessing its impact on the release of organic and inorganic sulfurs from sludge solid phase to liquid phase the structure of organic sulfurs the process of macromolecules organic sulfurs hydrolysis sulfur containing amino acids degradation and sulfate reduction in addition the changes in key microbes enzymes and genes involved in h2s production after rl addition were further analyzed through operating the long term semi continuous fermenters this work deepens the understanding of how rl affects sulfur cycle during anaerobic fermentation calls for a reconsideration of the use of rl and other additives in wastewater and sludge treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 was source and characteristics the was used in this study was obtained from a sequencing batch reactor with a working capacity with 60l operated in laboratory before the tests the was was firstly filtered through stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by gravitational settling then stored in refrigerator at 4 c the major characteristics of the used was were described in table 1 the biosurfactant rl was gained from baisheng chemical tech co ltd shenzhen guangdong china 2 2 h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation with rl addition the widely addition of rl in sludge to improve anaerobic fermentation efficiency was in the range of 1 40 mg g tss xu et al 2018 zhou et al 2013 therefore a set of different levels 0 10 20 40 mg g tss of rl were used to evaluate the effect of rl on h2s generation from was fermentation in this study 2000 ml raw sludge was completely mixed equally distributed and transferred into 4 serum bottles working volume 1 0 l with 500 ml each among these one was set as control without rl addition while other three serum bottles were fed with different dosages of rl to achieve the concentration of 10 20 or 40 mg g tss after fully string to mix rl and raw sludge all the fermenters were flushed with high purified n2 for 5 min to fully remove o2 then each fermenter was covered with a rubber stopper and sealed at last all the fermenters were put into an air bath shaker 150 rpm 35 c the ph value in these fermenters was not controlled but recorded daily all tests were operated in triplicate and lasted for 20 d during which the anaerobic fermentation performance gradually reached stability the concentration of h2s gas and dissolved sulfide in the fermenters were measured daily 2 3 long term operation of semi continuous was anaerobic fermenters in this work two semi continuous fermenters were operated to analyze the changes in microbial community and key enzymes two serum bottles with 2l total volume each were used one was set as the control which was fed with 1l was without rl addition while the other was set as the experimental with the addition of 1l was containing 40 mg g tss rl the operational conditions were consistent with those mentioned in section 2 2 excepting the following description the sludge retention time in both two semi continuous fermenters were set as 19d according to the results obtained in section 2 1 namely 52 6 ml fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each semi continuous fermenter and was replaced with the raw was containing with or without 0 04 g g tss rl after about 100 days of operation the anaerobic fermentation performance gradually reached stability and the daily h2s generation did not change largely then the samples were withdrawn to analyze the key enzymes genes and microbial community 2 4 effect of rl on the structure of was and released organic sulfur compounds there are many sulfur components contained in either the extracellular or intracellular of sludge cell before being fermented these sulfur elements are firstly released from the solid phase of sludge to the liquid phase to analyze the influence of rl addition on the release of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds from was the experiments were operated under the same procedure as the section 2 2 then 10 ml sludge mixture was sampled daily and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min the obtained supernatant was firstly filtered by 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters and then was used to measure the concentration of soluble sulfate the main inorganic sulfur free amino acids and protein the main organic sulfur the deposited sludge after centrifugation was freeze dried and then milled and sieved environmental scanning electron microscopy esem xps and elemental analyzer were used to explore the changes in was structure and the sulfur composition and content in sludge solid after rl addition the changes in surface tension zeta potential and cell membrane permeability in sludge system after rl addition were also measured daily after the release of soluble organic sulfur compounds the presence of rl might have a potential influence on their structure and property to further explore the effect of rl on the structure and property of released organic sulfur compound protein was chose as the representative sulfur containing organic since it was the main organic sulfur compound contained in sludge li et al 2019 in this test two beakers were used one was fed with 100 ml 2 g l bovine serum protein bsa the model protein while the other was fed with 100 ml 2 g l bsa containing with 0 04 g g tss rl both the beakers were filled with n2 gas and then sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker 35 c after 2 days of treatment ultraviolet spectroscopy was used to measure the change in the conformation of the protein ftir and cd spectroscopy were used to analyze the change in protein structure 2 5 analysis of abundances and activities of h2s producers h2s is mainly produced from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds and the reduction of inorganic sulfate by srbs during which the hydrolytic enzymes sulfur containing amino acids lyases and srbs play important roles in was anaerobic fermentation process to investigate the influence of rl on the activities of these key enzymes and microbes a set of batch experiments were performed using model substances e g 3 5 g l bsa and 0 5 g l sulfate as substrate the was withdrawn from the two semi continuous fermenters with or without 40 mg g tss rl addition was used as inoculum before used the inoculum was firstly centrifuged washed and re suspended in ultrapure water the specific operation methods were based on our previous literatures liu et al 2021c wang et al 2021a which are described in text s1 the activities of these key enzymes and microbes were compared based on the degradation rate of corresponding model substrates mg g vss h in addition the activity of cysteine lyase which degrades cysteine to h2s was further measured spectrophotometrically the changes in microbial community were analyzed based on illumina miseq sequencing which was described in text s2 the abundances of functional enzymes and genes were predicated using the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust langille et al 2013 2 6 modeling analysis according to previous literature the generated h2s from batch tests section 2 2 was fitted by the first order kinetic model eq 1 liu et al 2020 which was used to evaluate the influence of rl addition on the maximal h2s production potential hm mg g vss and hydrolysis rate k d 1 the relevance between the accumulated h2s generation and the fermentation time under the conditions of different doses of rl addition was calculated by origin 8 0 software 1 h hm 1 exp k t the influence of rl addition on the degradation rate of model substrates e g bsa and sulfate is calculated by the zero order kinetic model eq 2 wu et al 2021 where c0 and ct respectively represent the initial concentration of the substrate and the concentration of the substrate at a certain time d t is the fermentation time d while the x is the degradation kinetics rate 2 c 0 c t c 0 1 exp x t 2 7 other analytical methods tss vss and cod were determined according to previous literature liu et al 2021b the concentration of scfas i e the sum of acetate propionate isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric was measured by gc 21020 plus gas chromatograph shimadzu japan the content of h2 was determined by a gas chromatograph gc 112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector soluble protein was analyzed by the lowry folin method wang et al 2017 soluble sulfate was measured by spectrophotometer based on bacro4 so4 2 precipitate method while the soluble sulfide was determined by the methylene blue method wu et al 2019 h2s gas was analyzed by a portable h2s analyzer amino acid analyzer was used to determine the concentration of individual amino acids fu et al 2022 the environmental scanning electron microscopy fei quanta q400 usa was used to analyze the structure and morphology of sludge flocs xps vg multilab 2000 uk was used to analyze the content and composition of sulfur element in the sludge sample the elemental compositions and contents were measured by an elemental analyzer elementar company germany ultraviolet chromatography uv3100 shimadzu japan was used to characterize the change in protein structure ftir nicolet in10 usa and cd spectroscopy jasco j 715 japan were employed to analyze the change in protein secondary structure zeta potential and outer membrane permeability were measured based on previous literatures li et al 2020a wang et al 2021b the carbohydrate transporter solute binding protein pdb id 4rxu was chosen as model extracellular protein and molecular docking was used to visualize the binding process between extracellular proteins and rl according to previous literature li et al 2021a 2 8 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of rl on h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the maximal scfas yields enhanced from 573 5 to 2536 7 mg cod l while the accumulated h2 production enhanced from 2 15 to 6 93 ml g vss fig s1 however rl presence significantly increased h2s generation from was fermentation as shown in fig 1 it was observed that 323 6 10 4 mg g vss of h2s was produced from was fermentation without any rl addition which was comparable to that reported in previous literature dai et al 2017 with an increase of rl from 0 to 40 mg g tss the accumulated h2s generation increased from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g vss which improved by 91 7 according to previous literatures the first order kinetic model was used to fit the accumulated h2s yields attained in the batch tests liu et al 2020 the fitting results are very satisfactory with all r2 0 994 fig 1 modeling analysis results showed that rl presence not only increased the maximal h2s production potential hm but also accelerate the hydrolysis rate k from was anaerobic fermentation for example when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the values of hm and k respectively enhanced from 388 9 10 4 to 658 4 10 4 mg g vss and 0 104 to 0 153 d 1 which increased by 69 3 and 47 1 all these results suggested that rl addition promoted h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation 3 2 how does rl increase h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation 3 2 1 effect of rl on the transformation of sulfur components from sludge solid to liquid phase generally six sulfur compounds are contained in sludge solid which are sulfate sulfonic acid sulfoxide aromatic sulfur aliphatic sulfur and inorganic sulfides respectively zhang et al 2017 before being fermented the sulfur components require to be released into liquid phase as soluble organics he et al 2021 thus the influence of rl addition on the transformation of sulfur components was firstly evaluated as shown in fig 2 the esem image of sludge shows that rl presence destroyed sludge floc structure with many cracks appeared in sludge surface xps is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique which could identify the elements existed within a particle as well as their chemical state zhang et al 2017 li et al 2009 successfully used xps technology to analyze the forms of organic and inorganic sulfur compounds contained in solid hence in this work xps and ultimate analysis was used to unveil the changes in sulfur content and composition in sludge solid after rl addition text s3 liu et al 2012 compared with the blank without rl 40 mg g tss rl addition reduced the total sulfur content in sludge solid from 8 72 to 7 24 mg g ts after 2 days of treatment fig 2 with the exception of sulfate the other five sulfur compounds all decreased in the sludge solid after rl addition for example the content of sulfoxide reduced from 1 18 to 0 75 mg g ts the increase in sulfate content may be due to the adsorption of sulfate from the liquid phase on the solid surface accordingly the content of soluble protein the major source of organic sulfur total free sulfur containing amino acids the sum of cysteine and methionine and sulfate in liquid phase also increased after rl addition which improved by 2 25 time 1 86 time and 3 12 time respectively fig 3 a c these indicated that rl promoted sulfur compounds release from sludge solid phase to liquid phase as a typical biosurfactant rl molecules have a unique amphiphilicity with a hydrophilic polar group at one end and an oleophilic non polar group at the other which make rl have good dispersion and solubilizing characteristics luo et al 2015 this reduced the surface tension of hydrophobic molecules and water fig 3d and destroyed sludge floc structure esem image thereby facilitating the transport of sulfur compounds from the solid phase to liquid phase 3 2 2 effect of rl on the structure and property of the released organic sulfur compounds during was anaerobic fermentation the concentration of rl increased rather than decreased though it is biodegradable fig s2 the increased rl might be produced by the pseudomonas strains existed in was which was consistent with the previous reports that rl can be generated in situ in sludge zhou et al 2013 hence the presence of rl would inevitably interact with the released organic sulfur compounds from sludge solid in this work protein was chosen as the representative sulfur containing organic since it was the main organic sulfur compound contained in sludge li et al 2019 in the uv spectra the bands of 280 nm tryptophan and tyrosine and 257 nm phenylalanine xiao et al 2013 were present in both bsa the model protein solution with or without rl addition fig s3 however the corresponding absorbance intensity in the bsa solution with rl addition was lower than that in the bsa solution without rl addition this may be due to the formation of a complex between bsa and rl jannesari et al 2013 molecular docking was further used to visualize the binding process fig 4 a b it was found that the residues asp154 and gln357 were the main binding sites which binds to rl by forming hydrogen bonds cd and ftir spectra are used to attain the information on the conformation of proteins secondary structure li et al 2020b for example cd spectroscopy as an absorption spectroscopy uses circularly polarized light to investigate structural aspects of optically active chiral media this technique has been widely used to analyze the structure and conformation of protein wu et al 2017 generally there are six main secondary structure components contained in protein such as α helix random coils and aggregated stands among them the α helix which is consisted by the hydrogen bond between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond number n and the carbonyl oxygen of peptide bond number n 4 is the essential shape in the secondary structure of protein li et al 2020a the α helix has a positive band at 190 nm and two negative bands at 209 and 222 nm in the cd spectra rl addition changed the peak location and intensity of cd spectra fig s4 clearly indicated the changes in the secondary structure of protein ftir spectra analysis further quantitatively shows the content of different shapes in the secondary structure of protein as shown in fig 4 the content of α helix and the proportion of α helix β sheet random coil decreased from 21 83 to 20 19 and 51 36 to 47 67 respectively it was reported that when the proportion of α helix β sheet random coil was low the protein molecule exhibited a loose structure yuan et al 2021 these indicated that rl addition destroyed hydrogen bonding networks and caused a loose structure of protein molecules thus providing a more readily available substrate for h2s production rl as an anionic surfactant ionizes in solution to produce a charged group which interacts with the protein s inversely charged amino acid residues through electrostatic interaction then the hydrophobic end of rl further binds to the hydrophobic point near the protein wu et al 2021 when the rl concentration increases beyond protein saturation binding sites further binding rl would cause protein de folding resulting in changes in protein spatial structure these explained why rl addition would affect protein property and cause a loose structure of protein molecules wu et al 2021 3 2 3 changes in the abundances and activities of h2s producers in addition to the available substrates the abundances and activities of key microbes and enzymes also plays important roles in h2s production h2s is produced from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds and the reduction of inorganic sulfate by srbs thereby the influence of rl presence on the abundances and activities of hydrolysis microbes and srbs were evaluated according to previous literatures most of the sulfate reducers belong to the deltaproteobacteria and the clostridia which are all within the bacteria only a few srbs are within the archaea and they are often existed in hydrothermal vents oil deposits and hot springs muyzer and stams 2008 hence in this study the impact of rl addition on anaerobic microbes was analyzed based on bacterial community alpha diversity analysis was used to unveil the changes in microbial community table s1 the coverage indexes in both the long term fermenters were similar 0 995 vs 0 996 which were close to 1 this indicated that the constructed sequence libraries covered almost the entire microbial community the indexes of shannon chao and pd whole tree which represented the relative abundance and diversity of microbial communities and phylogenetic diversity gao et al 2022 were higher in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl addition compared with the control suggesting that rl presence increased the microbial diversity rl addition changed the composition of microbial community fig s5 for instance compared with the control the abundance of bacteroidetes containing many proteolytic bacteria dai et al 2017 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl increased from 5 8 to 10 0 meanwhile proteobacteria containing 23 typical genera of srbs muyzer and stams 2008 is the largest phylum in both the fermenters but its abundance did not change obviously p 0 05 fig 5 further shows that rl increased the relative abundance of hydrolytic microbes and srbs e g desulfovibrio and desulfobulbus yan et al 2020 at genus level for instance the abundance of proteocatella the typical hydrolytic bacteria increased from 0 86 in the control to 1 15 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl while the total relative abundance of srbs in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl was higher than that in the control 0 75 vs 0 58 further investigation showed that rl increased the predicted abundance of genes coding key enzymes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction which uses sulfate to produce h2s but reduced the relative abundance of genes coding key enzymes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction which uses sulfate to synthesize organ sulfur compounds e g cysteine kushkevych et al 2020 fig s6 for instance compared with the control the relative abundance of gene coding dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsirs increased by 11 4 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl but the relative abundance of gene coding assimilatory sulfite reductase asirs reduced by 16 5 it is worth noting that the obtained dna based relative abundance data only provided a snapshot of community composition but cannot directly reflect the activity of microbial populations involved in the community in fig 6 the activities of these key microbes and enzymes were further analyzed based on the degradation rate of corresponding model substrates mg g vss h xu et al 2021 when rl addition increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the degradation rate of bsa enhanced from 631 22 to 705 16 mg g vss d and the activity of cysteine lyase increased from 25 89 to 35 57 u ml these results showed that 40 mg g tss rl addition improved the activities of hydrolase and cysteine lyase by 11 2 and 37 4 generally the hydrolysis enzymes are existed in sludge flocs which tend to disperse from sludge solid to liquid phase during anaerobic fermentation process then these dissolved enzymes are easily inactivated by binding to some components in the liquid phase e g metal ions liu et al 2015 rl addition can form protective micelles or promote the contact between enzyme and substrate so as to maintain enzyme activity in aquatic biological reactions liu et al 2000 for example zeta potential which was applied to show the surface charge enhanced from 18 9 mv to 15 1 mv when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss fig 6b this indicated that rl weakened the mutual repulsion between enzyme and substrate rl addition also improved sludge cell membrane permeability fig s7 since it inserted the phospholipid layer and connected the membrane inside and outside wang et al 2021b thus enhanced the transport of amino acids from extracellular to intracellular these explained why rl increased the activities of hydrolysis enzymes thus promoted h2s production from the hydrolysis of organic sulfur compounds moreover rl addition slightly inhibited the activities of srbs when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the degradation rate of sulfate reduced from 79 3 to 72 7 mg g vss d which indicated that 40 mg g tss reduced srbs activity by 8 3 it is reported that both dsirs and asirs the key enzymes involved in dissimilatory assimilatory sulfate reduction contain a siroheme fe s center consisting of a reduced porphyrin ring of the isochloric acid group bridged to a 4fe 4s cluster via cysteine thiolate surfactant as an active group would bind to enzymatic protein catalyzed residues through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions fig 6c thus occupying the active sites to affect enzymes activity shao et al 2017 however dsirs is a heterotetrameric αβ 2 complex with two siroheme 4fe 4s centers while asirs has only one peptide and does not form a polymeric protein with only one cluster of siroheme 4fe 4s per molecule parey et al 2010 which causes dsirs and asirs have different active site structures and makes dsirs more stable this explained why rl increased the relative abundance of dsirs but reduced the relative abundance of asirs fig s6 and thereby reduced substrate e g sulfate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction in addition the stimulative effect of increasing available sulfate fig 3c and electron donors fig s1 is greater than the toxicity of rl in a certain concentration range which is beneficial to the overall h2s production from sulfate reduction although rl may have some inhibition on srbs 3 2 4 changes in functional genes involved in h2s production in order to discover the intrinsic reason why microbial community was shifted in the direction for h2s generation with rl presence the key functional genes were further analyzed using picrust based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing data in the pathway of h2s generation from the hydrolysis of organic sulfurs the functional genes related to hydrolase secretion atp binding cassette transporters and amino acids metabolism play important roles as shown in fig 7 rl addition improved the relative abundance of these functional genes in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl for example the relative content of pepd and metq which respectively encoding protease secretion and d methionine transport system substrate binding protein luo et al 2021 increased by 59 1 and 55 6 in the rl supplied fermenter compared with the control in addition the abundance of key genes involved in sulfate reducing process was also affected by rl addition it was clearly found that rl addition inhibited the assimilation sulfate reduction but promoted the dissimilatory sulfate reduction for instance compared with the control the relative abundance of cysh and sir respectively reduced by 12 7 and 15 5 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl it was documented cysh and sir respectively encodes phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase and sulfite reductase in the assimilation sulfate reduction process fu et al 2022 meanwhile the relative abundance of apra b and dsra b increased by 13 1 and 11 7 in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl compared with the control yan et al reported that apra b and dsra b respectively encodes adenylylsulfate reductase and dissimilatory sulfite reductase in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction process yan et al 2020 these inhibited the reaction of aps 3 phosphoadenosine 5 phosphosulfate sulfite organosulfur compounds asr and accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide dsr the increased functional genes responsible for h2s production with rl presence might be the intrinsic reason to increase h2s generation from was fermentation 3 2 5 effect of rl addition on the transformation of sulfide as expected the content of dissolved sulfide in the fermenter increased with an increase of rl addition fig s8 for example when the addition of rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the dissolved sulfide enhanced from 0 21 to 0 30 mg s l at the 4th day of anaerobic fermentation meanwhile rl addition also changed the fermentation ph in sludge system which affect the transformation of sulfide with an increase of rl addition the fermentation ph reduced in the sludge system fig s9 compared with the fermenter without rl addition the fermentation ph in the fermenter with 40 mg g tss rl reduced from 6 91 to 6 30 at the 4th day of anaerobic fermentation the produced high concentrations of organic acids e g scfas fig s1 after rl addition tends to consume alkalinity which might cause the decrease of ph in sludge system it was documented that the pka of the hs h2s equilibrium is near ph 7 at 25 c chen et al 2014 hence the decrease of sludge ph from 6 9 to 6 3 after rl addition would promote h2s formation from hs this indicated that the acidic ph after rl addition promoted h2s gas release from the transformation of sulfide in the sludge system 4 implications generally it is thought that rl addition is beneficial to wastewater and sludge treatment which promotes the removal of degradable and refractory organics in sewage and enhances the recovery of resources and energy e g scfas and h2 in sludge treatment this work however firstly found that rl presence promoted h2s production from was anaerobic fermentation which might pose serious challenges to equipment maintenance according to our analyses rl presence promoted aliphatic s sulfoxide and inorganic sulfate release from sludge solid to liquid phase reduced the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil and damaged organic sulfurs structure thus provided a more readily available substrate for h2s production rl also increased substrate surface charge and improved membrane permeability promoted the contact between enzymes and substrate and the transport of amino acids from extracellular to intracellular these improved the activity of the hydrolase and thereby increased h2s production from organic sulfurs hydrolysis rl improved the expression of key genes e g apra b and dsra b involved in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction which accelerated the reaction of adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps sulfite sulfide meanwhile rl inhibited the corresponding key genes such as cysh and sir responsible for assimilatory sulfate reduction which reduced substrate competition in favor of h2s production from dissimilatory sulfate reduction as far as we know none of the findings have been previously documented so this work advances the understanding of the effect of rl on sludge treatment the findings attained in this paper might also have important implications for sludge treatment and wwtps operation the rl based method has been regarded as an economically feasible measure to enhance wastewater and sludge treatment which changed the wwtps from linear economy to circular economy li et al 2021b however the increased h2s production reported here raises new concerns when rl increased from 0 to 40 mg g tss the cumulative h2s yield increased from 323 6 10 4 to 620 3 10 4 mg g vss this calls for a reconsideration of the use of rl and other additives in wastewater and sludge treatment more studies should be conducted on how to improve fermentation efficiency while achieving low production of h2s gases according to the results obtained in this paper and previous literatures it seems that increasing fermentation efficiency inevitably improves the release of large amounts of organics including sulfur components from sludge solid to liquid phase fu et al 2022 hence strategies that either effectively increase sulfur removal from the released organics before anaerobic fermentation or strongly inhibit the activity of sulfide producers might be the key to reducing h2s production 5 conclusion in this work a series of batch and long term experiments were operated to explore the potential impact of rl addition on h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation and unveil the underlying mechanisms the main conclusions obtained in this paper are as follow 1 rl addition significantly promoted h2s generation from was anaerobic fermentation 40 mg g tss rl improved h2s generation by 91 7 2 rl addition not only increased the dissolution of organic sulfur compounds but also promoted the release of inorganic sulfate 3 compared with blank without any rl addition 40 mg g tss rl improved the activities of hydrolase and cysteine lyase by 11 2 and 37 4 but reduced the activity of srbs by 8 3 4 microbial community analysis showed that rl addition increased the enrichment of hydrolytic microbes and sulfate reducing bacteria in the long term operational fermenter 5 the functional genes analysis presented that rl addition promoted the dissimilatory sulfate reduction but inhibited the assimilation sulfate reduction

15749,water scarcity and quality deterioration often occur in economically developing regions particularly during crises related to climate change or increasing human activities the assignment of priority areas is considered a suitable strategy for stakeholders to mitigate water crises and cope with water stress however most studies focused on protecting water bodies in priority areas and did not consider the hydrological hydrochemical hydroecological interaction between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems we divided a watershed into manageable areas to select priority areas for multiple water related ecosystem services wes priority areas considering the aquatic terrestrial interactions to predict the effects of climate change and human activities the proposed novelty framework couples the soil and water assessment tool and maximum entropy models with a systematic conservation planning tool it uses the gross domestic product as the economic cost to assess dynamic changes and social environmental driving forces a case study is conducted in the xiangjiang river basin a modified watershed of the main tributary of the yangtze river china results revealed that most of the wes priority areas were located in the southern and southeastern regions of the upper reaches in all climatic scenarios the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas decreased from 1 264 to 0 867 in 50 years indicating that the level of protection declined as climate change accelerated the precipitation was positively correlated with the wes priority area selection in all climate scenarios the temperature was only negatively correlated with the wes priority areas when it exceeded 20 c and this effect became more pronounced as the temperature increased the topographic factors had the most crucial impacts on the upstream priority areas selection the water flow regulation service played a leading role in identifying wes priority areas in the middle reaches because the priority areas distribution here was closely related to the water yield and its proportion decreased with the acceleration of global warming the number of wes priority areas was relatively low in the lower reaches it was positively associated with the gross domestic product and the amount of built up land the proposed framework for wes priority areas identification enables a sound trade off between environmental protection and economic development graphical abtract image graphical abstract keywords priority areas water related ecosystem services swat maxent marxan climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity and water quality deterioration represent global threats to human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the rise of the world population improvement in living standards change in the consumption structure and an increase in irrigated agriculture are the main drivers of the increasing worldwide water crisis an effective strategy to deal with complex water health problems is to develop separate control strategies for different river reaches and categorize rivers with similar water quality or societal demands in the same water function zone huang et al 2010 the goal of assigning water function zones is to set water quality and quantity targets however the ecological protection of the water source is rarely considered stemming from the misunderstanding of the water conditions required to support freshwater ecosystems richter et al 2003 therefore ecological protection has received increasing attention in the design of water protection schemes aquatic ecological processes are affected in several ways most ecological responses energy flow fish survival recruitment and community structure are related to the flow rosenfeld 2017 in addition to hydrological processes the surface water quality affects the ecological environment in various reaches to different degrees due to the adaptability of the aquatic organism to the environment luo et al 2020 due to the complex interactions between hydrology and hydrochemistry in aquatic ecosystems a new method for partitioning water function zones is needed another major drawback of the current river zoning law is that the division of water function zones was designed for water pollution monitoring and management of the river channels whereas land based activities surrounding the water have been ignored nevertheless some land based activities may have a considerable influence on water recent studies have shown that changes in the terrestrial landscape have significant impacts on neighboring aquatic ecosystems the conversion of natural landscapes often affects nutrient fluxes soil integrity and native species communities this change will affect the hydrology of the basin by changing the rate of interception evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater recharge resulting in changes in the timing and amount of river runoff baker and miller 2013 on the other hand water based activities may also have several important consequences for the terrestrial ecosystem for example agricultural water consumption accounts for 70 of china s total water consumption representing an important part of the social water cycle jiang 2009 the water demand by the industry is also the key factor influencing the local socioeconomic development level de loë et al 2016 thus the stakeholders must develop an approach that integrates aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to address the dynamics of the complex processes conservation prioritization could provide useful information for selecting priority areas to protect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by considering the economic values of water related ecosystem services wes liang et al 2021 globally water provides multiple economic values by providing drinking water and water for industrial and agricultural production wei et al 2017 some ecosystem services are closely linked to many hydrological processes positively e g water quality for fish raising or negatively e g water erosion maes et al 2009 to provide information for water resource management the water yield the soil retention and the water purification are the commonly used wes when considering the level of ecosystem services in certain regions as those parameters represent the hydrological and hydrochemical factors involved in water demands since wes are spatially heterogeneous and many synergies exist the trade offs are complicated and should be considered carefully to obtain a cost effective solution balkanlou et al 2020 many conservation tools have been developed to select sites with a high conservation value and perform systematic conservation planning as one of the most commonly used conservation tools the systematic conservation planning tool marxan has been widely applied to identify priority areas related to ecosystem services or wild habitats and exhibits excellent performance in identifying priority areas based on the principle of complementarity he et al 2021 however studies on the selection of priority areas with specific ecosystem services have mostly focused on assessing ecosystems services values by obtaining rough statistical data from public institutions rather than combining specific relevant models besides most marxan modeling studies on habitat conservation frequently used climatic parameters as the primary factors affecting species distribution whereas the hydrological and hydrochemical factors were rarely considered however studies have demonstrated that the hydrological regime substantially influences the distribution of freshwater fish hockley et al 2014 moreover the priority area identification procedures that consider both economic and ecological values of wes have rarely been applied to different regions to obtain more accurate and concise data representing wes in the whole river basin some hydrological models could be utilized malekian et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed and continuous ecohydrological model it has been utilized to simulate hydrological and hydrochemical output variables that could be regarded as indicators to evaluate wes schmalz et al 2016 since the hydroecological related wes are important for arranging function zones the species distribution model could be used to simulate the geographic distribution of aquatic species the maximum entropy model maxent is commonly used because of its outstanding performance with limited data kim et al 2020 it has been broadly utilized for modeling fish distribution in freshwater to assess river health conserve species and identify priority areas frederico et al 2014 thus the maxent model was used in our study to estimate fish distribution as one wes studies have shown that excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs may lead to water eutrophication causing oxygen level reduction because of the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter and leading to the suffocation of many fish and macroinvertebrates hockley et al 2014 besides sediment deposits may impact some developmental stages of fish killing roe and destroying the gills of older fish sutherland and meyer 2007 thus we input the output variables from swat as some of the environmental factors into maxent because those wes could affect fish distribution this study was conducted in a modified watershed in the xiangjiang river basin xrb the xrb is a major sub watershed of the yangtze river and the primary rice growing area in southern china tian et al 2018 due to multiple factors such as climate change rapid urbanization and human induced activities the local water ecosystem services in the xrb have been severely degraded in recent years liang et al 2020 conflicts between humans and nature are common in this area for example it is difficult to balance the sustainability of the natural river ecosystem and economic development liang et al 2018 thus the xrb is an ideal and representative area to investigate the selection of priority areas for wes the results are significant for maintaining water ecological security and sustainable economic and social development in china xu et al 2017 in this study a novelty framework is proposed to integrate wes into the selection of priority areas using water land function zoning under climate change furthermore the processes of hydrology hydrochemistry hydroecology in the integrated terrestrial aquatic system are also considered to ensure healthy aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify wes in different climate scenarios 2 determine the wes priority areas cost effectively and 3 investigate the impacts of social environmental factors on the wes priority area s selection within this framework the wes are quantified to support planning and decision making regarding water resources protection in response to climate change 2 study area the study was carried out in the xrb fig 1 the xiangjiang river is the main tributary of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the xrb covers an area of 94 660 km2 with a mainstream river length of 842 km the mean elevation of the xrb is 326 m with an average slope of 0 0134 the xrb is located in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and experiences a hot humid and wet climate with an annual mean temperature of 16 18 c and annual precipitation ranging from 1300 mm to 1600 mm the area is heavily influenced by the monsoon with most of the rainfall occurring in the summer from april to september the xiangjiang river originates from jingfengling mountain and descends northward into the yangtze river it passes through diverse landscapes the upper watershed is covered by alpine forests 63 the middle reaches pass through an agriculture belt 30 and the lower reaches meander through densely populated urban cities 2 7 more than half of the habitants of the hunan province live in the xrb thus the river is the undisputed mother river of 30 million residents providing wes to both local economic and domestic water demands because the selected watershed is relatively big spatial heterogeneity can be taken into consideration when selecting proper priority areas a larger spatial scale will increase the comprehensive evaluation of research results considering the complexity and environmental heterogeneity of aquatic terrestrial systems the diverse landscape patterns throughout this river basin provide an excellent system for investigating wes priority area determination simultaneously considering the complex impacts of hydrological hydrochemical and ecological factors under various landscapes moreover the studied area contains some regions that are undergoing the largest wave of rapid urbanization in human history which is one of the typical systems to reflect the impact of human activities on the wes providing insight into the priority areas distribution with complex anthropogenic influence the study for wes priority areas identification in xrb reflects a sound trade off between environmental protection and economic development in summary we think our findings have implications with regard to both the xrb case and other cases that have been facing a global warming crisis 3 materials and methodology the proposed framework fig 2 consists of the following steps data preprocessing future climate projections the establishment calibration and validation of swat fig s1 the establishment of the maxent model to assess the fish distribution and the systematic conservation planning for wes using the marxan model and the redundancy analysis to investigate the influence of climate change and social environmental factors on the wes priority areas the identification of wes priority areas while considering climate change provides an effective trade off framework for environmental protection and economic development 3 1 data sources the data inputs and sources are summarized in table 1 the land use data were reclassified to fit the categories of the swat the soil data were used to determine the soil properties and a digital elevation model was used to delineate the xrb watershed in the swat simulation the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution inputs containing crop cultivation scattered small scale animal feedlot operations and rural sewage were calculated based on the hunan statistic yearbook during the establishment of swat we used a threshold of 100 000 ha and delineated 53 sub basins which were further divided into 621 hrus the daily weather records at 13 stations in the xrb from 1997 to 2015 were obtained from the china meteorological administration to simulate the daily weather in the swat the daily discharge at the hydrological stations hengyang hengshan and xiangtan monthly sediment transport at the xiangtan station from 1997 to 2015 and the monthly water quality at this station from 2005 to 2015 were obtained from the hydrological department of hunan province fig 1 to calibrate and validate the results of swat the future climate projections average for 2041 2060 hereafter referred to as 2050 average for 2061 2080 hereafter referred to as 2070 were downloaded from the worldclim website to process the future climatic scenarios in swat and maxent models the climate change scenarios in 2050 and 2070 were identical to the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario at 30 s resolution 1 km of the general circulation model gcm mirdashtvan et al 2018 the transient climate projections for 1997 2080 were separated into several time slices in swat and maxent operation 1997 2015 was considered the baseline scenario 2050 was the mid term scenario and 2070 was the long term scenario the geographic coordinates of the feature locations were used in the maxent model the data were acquired from the hunan aquatic ecological monitoring programs to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on fish distribution in the xrb we used 19 bioclimatic variables from the hadgem2 ao model in the worldclim database the topographic data and the soil categories with chemical and physical properties were the same in the maxent model and the swat model the computational results of the swat including the wyld syld orgn and orgp in the xrb were used as input hydrological and hydrochemical data for the maxent simulation the marxan model was implemented at a grid cell resolution of 3000 3000 m because the swat and maxent outputs were resampled to the same cell size the gross domestic product gdp acquired from the chinese academy of sciences was used as the protection cost of the marxan model when identifying the priority areas 3 2 wes simulation and visualization in this study swat was employed to simulate ecohydrological processes representing hydrological and hydrochemical related wes the maxent model was used to simulate fish distribution representing hydroecological related wes the wes related to hydrological processes were selected and calculated based on the swat s hru output file output hru for further analyses table s1 the wes we selected for further analysis were based on expert assessments the experts came from water related academic fields and were familiar with the environmental characteristics of the xrb three types of wes were derived from swat including the water yield wyld the simulated mean sediment yield syld and the levels of organic nitrogen orgn and organic phosphorus orgp to represent the ecosystem services of water flow control erosion control and water purification nutrient status in the study area respectively these wes represent the essential ecosystem services in the forest dominated ecosystems in the xrb providing information for water resource management the minimum and maximum values of the four indicators for all hrus were calculated table 2 the swat model was calibrated and validated using the historical data collected from three major hydrological stations hengyang hengshan and xiangtan on the main stream of the xiangjiang river from january 1997 to december 2015 the periods 1997 to 1998 1999 to 2005 and 2006 to 2015 were used as warm up periods calibration periods and validation periods respectively the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns were used to evaluate the accuracy of the swat model r 2 all above 0 51 and ns all above 0 42 fig s1 wang et al 2019 because ctenopharyngodon idella hypophthalmichthys molitrix mylopharyngodon piceus and aristichys nobilis were the four major chinese carps in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and xiangjiang river is an important habitat of their natural stock resources we simulated the distribution of those kinds of fishes to represent the hydroecological wes we initially selected 44 environmental factors i e bioclimatic data fish occurrence data topographic data soil properties hydrological processes and water quality that might affect the extent of suitable fish habitat to model the current fish distributions since many variables were spatially correlated spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to examine the cross correlation variables with highly correlated relationships were removed to avoid multicollinearity out of 44 initial variables 31 were retained as indicator variables table 1 we used the maxent model to simulate the current and future fish distribution in the xrb we used 75 of the point data for model training and the remaining 25 for validating the model the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc was used to quantify model accuracy auc values 0 7 indicate low accuracy values between 0 7 and 0 9 indicate moderate accuracy and values 0 9 denote high accuracy the auc value of our maxent model was 0 802 we mapped the water flow erosion water purification status and fish distribution in the xrb in different climate scenarios using the swat and maxent model 3 3 systematic conservation planning the systematic conservation planning model marxan is a widely used space optimization software for systematic conservation planning according to the local stakeholder s opinion we input the regional gdp in 2015 as the financial cost in the marxan simulation the goal of the objective function is to minimize the gdp loss to optimize the allocation of the wes priority areas a sub basin with a high gdp is assumed to have i limited areas for conserving natural water resources because those areas were overexploited during urbanization ii higher economic losses for allocating crucial conservation zones since many huge infrastructure projects are being constructed here based on the planning units the total gdp cost was calculated as more details are provided in the supplementary information 1 t o t a l g d p c o s t p u s g d p c o s t 60 p u s b o u n d a r y 30 o f t h e t o t a l a m o u n t o f w e s s p f p e n a l t y where pu represents the planning units and spf refers to the conservation feature penalty factor the marxan model was used to identify the wes priority areas and obtain the conservation values of the planning units in the xrb under various climate change scenarios the results of the marxan model under different climate scenarios were obtained and the wes priority areas and the selection time of the priority areas fig s3 were optimized the results were summarized by determining the best solution the conservation network with the optimum locations meeting the objectives at minimum cost for all climate scenarios we also evaluated the frequency of selecting the planning units from 100 runs in each climate scenario to evaluate the irreplaceability which is defined as the likelihood of the given location having a specific set of protection objectives we adopted the method of xu et al 2013 to evaluate the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas under different climate change scenarios 2 s e e p e s p s where s e denotes the spatial conservation efficiency of the wes e p describes the total wes of the identified priority areas e represents the total wes in the region s p is the area of wes priority areas and s is the total area an se index greater than 1 indicates high conservation efficiency and vice versa 3 4 key factors determining the spatial pattern of wes priority areas based on the level of sub basins the redundancy analysis rda was conducted to investigate the impact of climate change precipitation and temperature topography altitude and slope gdp and land use forestland grassland cropland built up land and water on the wes priority area s selection the analysis was implemented using the rda modules embedded in the canoco software version 4 5 5 0 ithaca usa the integrity index pi and aggregation index ai calculated by the fragstats software were used to determine the dispersion of the wes priority areas he et al 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of hydrological and hydrochemical related wes in three climate change scenarios the wyld syld orgn and orgp all reached the highest values in the wet season from march to july and the lowest in the dry season from november to february table 2 as the result of intensified precipitation the wyld was 99 94 mm in the wet season which was three times the amount in the dry season the values of the syld orgn and orgp were four times higher in the wet season than in the dry season the highest average value of syld in the wet season was 1 29 t ha since surface runoff is higher in the wet season due to high intensity precipitation soil erosion was higher casazza et al 2018 in the xrb farming practices are mainly carried out during wet seasons the large amount of effluents from agricultural activities in the wet season carries nutrient rich moisture such as nitrogen and phosphorus to the xrb thus the values of orgn and orgn were higher in wet seasons zhang et al 2019 moreover frequent rainfall in wet season could further increase decomposition and nutrient release from the natural plants and soil profiles which is another reason causing the higher outputs of orgn and orgp yan et al 2019 the seasonal variation of wes did not have a substantial impact on the spatial distribution of ecosystem services in the xrb but had a significant impact on ecosystem service values fig 3 generally as the rainfall increased between march and july and the flood season of the xiangjiang river approached the values of the four ecosystem service indicators increased most areas that were not forestland had relatively low water flow values due to high runoff coefficients in those regions fig 3a liu et al 2020 since forestland has a higher soil water retention capacity than other types of lulc more runoff occurs than in non forest land during floods malekian and azarnivand 2016 higher values of syld were found in high elevation grassland in the southwest and north of the xrb whereas the lowest syld values were observed in areas with flat terrain and low rainfall fig 3b since grasslands do not have a tree canopy to intercept raindrops or litter layers to prevent splashing during rain events the higher sediment yield was not surprising zhou et al 2016 moreover highly erosive areas were mostly found in cropland especially in valleys with steep slopes and high annual rainfall opening up wastelands could be one reason for the high erosion xie et al 2019 besides high intensity rainfall loosens soil particles which are transported with the water downhill into streams and valleys pimentel and burgess 2013 the most common soil type in this area is alisol which is unstable and prone to erosion the lower erosion levels of cultivated fields demonstrated the protective role of row crops for soil and water conservation the orgn and orgp reached their maximum values 0 903 kg ha and 0 111 kg ha respectively in the southern areas where their spatial patterns were similar to syld fig 3c specifically the largest values occurred in agricultural and forest areas indicating that they were the primary sources of orgn and orgp the spatial patterns of the four wes in the mid term and long term scenarios are shown in fig s2 in the future climate scenarios the lower values of the wyld were found in the southcentral areas and the areas with low values decreased from 2050 to 2070 compared to 2050 the southern regions with steeper slopes showed the higher level of wyld in 2070 the syld orgn and orgp had similar spatial patterns between 2050 and 2070 the highest values of those indices occurred in the south 0 378 t ha 0 639 kg ha and 0 078 kg ha respectively for mid term 0 364 t ha 0 662 kg ha and 0 081 kg ha respectively for long term 4 2 spatial distribution of hydroecological related wes in three climate change scenarios in the current climate scenario the most suitable areas for fish species were found in the freshwater reaches of the main stem of the xiangjiang river in the downstream section fig 4 the remaining regions in the xrb had lower suitability or were deemed unsuitable for fish the outputs indicated that the fish were distributed in the lower to medium elevations in the current climatic condition the model predicted that the most suitable areas for fish in 2050 would be located in the middle mainstream of the xiangjiang river and the downstream tributaries in the eastern section of the basin in 2070 the optimum locations for fish survival would be located in the upper mainstream and parts of the branches in the middle valley increasing the range following climate warming these results were consistent with recent studies that predicted species would move to higher elevations to adjust to the future climate mcmahan et al 2020 barriers such as waterfalls could prevent species from moving upstream restricting species movements and threatening their lives higher values of orgn orgp and syld were found in the southern areas indicating lower suitability for fish higher levels of orgn and orgp may cause eutrophication which may result in the total depletion of oxygen and the generation of harmful gasses such as hydrogen sulfide and methane threatening fish survival nyenje et al 2010 the accumulation of sediments may adversely impact spawning inhibit migration and interfere with food intake kukuła and bylak 2020 4 3 systematic conservation planning utilizing wes priority areas 4 3 1 identifying priority areas for multiple wes the output of the marxan model indicated that the spatial distribution of the wes priority areas differed for different climate scenarios fig 5 and the overlap between the area in different scenarios was about 13 of the total area most of the overlap occurred in the south and east of the study area since forest land accounted for 60 of the study area it substantially affected water cycle and nutrient cycle in the entire study area thus priority areas were centered in forest land with higher altitudes in the eastern xrb priority areas were also found at the source of the rivers in the southern portion of the xrb thus these areas require sufficient attention and protection priority areas located in the central area of the xrb during the baseline scenario shifted to the downstream area in the mid term and long term scenarios due to high water flow in the middle and upper reaches of the xrb as a result of climate change the number of patches and the average patch size of the wes priority areas in three climate change scenarios were 15 and 1214 km2 baseline 19 and 1053 km2 mid term and 22 and 837 km2 long term respectively in each climate change scenario the patches of the wes priority areas were clustered and their overall pi and ai were 99 01 and 96 52 baseline 99 177 and 96 5911 mid term and 98 94 and 96 15 long term respectively indicating the largest clustering effect in the mid term scenario moreover the wes priority areas were more dispersed in the long term climate scenarios than in the baseline scenario the conservation efficiency index of the wes priority areas is listed in table 3 the index was the highest for the baseline climate scenario the wes priority areas with the highest values were located in the upper reaches of the xrb south and southeast of the study area the average conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas was lower in the climate change scenarios than the baseline scenario in the mid term and long term climate scenarios the conservation efficiency was less than 1 indicating an adverse effect of climate change 4 4 the social environmental factors associated with the location of the wes priority areas 4 4 1 the effect of climatic factors on wes priority area selection the results of the analysis of the impact factors and characteristics of climate change on the wes priority areas are shown in fig 6 a precipitation and temperature were selected as key variables to represent the impact of climate change fig 6a 1 b 1 and c 1 a positive correlation between precipitation and wyld is observed in the scatterplot studies have shown that an increase in precipitation in the future significantly improved the wyld affecting certain priority areas shirmohammadi et al 2020 the cumulative proportion of precipitation was 18 4 in xrb moreover the fish distribution was positively correlated with the precipitation in all climatic scenarios our result is consistent with previous study that fish distribution correlated positively with precipitation kinard et al 2021 these findings suggest that aridification is linked to the extinction of competitive and environmentally sensitive taxa potentially resulting in less favorable community states in the baseline climate scenario the average air temperature was below 20 c table s2 the angle between the selected wes priority areas and the temperature in the graph was almost vertical indicating that the temperature had a negligible effect on the wes priority areas fig 6a 1 in contrast in the mid term scenario the wes priority areas were highly and negatively correlated with the temperature fig 6b 1 and the correlation was even higher in the long term climate scenario fig 6c 1 in the mediterranean island of crete 3 c warming caused a reduction in water resources by 10 30 koutroulis et al 2016 in addition a variable infiltration capacity vic model was used to simulate wyld in different temperature scenarios the results showed that the streamflow sharply decreased as the temperatures increased weltzin et al 2003 our results show a negative relationship between temperature and wyld under future climate scenarios confirmed those results the positive correlation between temperature and nutrient outputs orgn orgp was found in all climatic scenarios it might be attributed to the fact that the farming practices are mainly carried out when temperature is higher the effluents from cultivation carry nutrient rich moisture to the xrb numerous studies have also suggested that the increased temperature may hasten the mineralization of soil organic matter which releases dissolved nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus andriamananjara et al 2019 4 4 2 the social and economic factors affecting the distribution of the wes priority areas in different reaches since downstream water users rely on the upstream water supply it is crucial to understand the differences in the wes priority area distributions in different reaches the number of wes priority areas and their distribution differ in the upper middle and lower reaches of the xrb fig s4 climate change had a negligible impact on the wes priority area s distribution in the upstream basin of the xrb in the upper basins of the xrb with rugged terrain the topographic factors were crucial factors influencing the selection of the upstream wes priority areas particularly the slope whose cumulative slope proportion was 20 9 fig 6a the selection of wes priority areas with steep slopes and high altitudes in the upper basin of the xrb was slightly affected by climate change fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 the regions with steep slopes and high altitudes are mainly the source of the rivers in the upper basin thus these areas require sufficient attention and protection in all the climate scenarios which is in agreement with a previous study crossman et al 2012 besides the upper basin of the xrb contained most of the wes priority areas fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 thus decision makers and stakeholders should focus on wes priority areas in the upper reaches the wes priority areas proportion in the middle reaches declined from 6 4 in the baseline scenario to 5 6 in the mid term and 4 5 in the long term respectively fig 5 and fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 the middle reaches including rapidly developing counties that have large areas of cropland and many urban areas are areas where urbanization may increase due to a population boom and industrialization therefore large amounts of readily available water will be required the wes priority areas selection is closely related to the wyld in that areas in all scenarios figs 1 and 6 as climate change accelerates the available water supply in some parts of the middle reach will decrease table 3 thus these areas may not require future protection and will not be selected as wes priority areas moreover the agricultural planting in the middle reaches could promote global warming because a considerable increase in crop yield resulting from increased irrigation and fertilizer application may cause increased greenhouse gas emissions liu et al 2005 since the selection of the wes priority areas are strongly and negatively correlated with the temperature fig 6 the wes priority areas proportion in that areas decreases over time overall because of the incremental demand for water resources in the middle reaches there is a need to consider the influence of future climate on hydrological factors for modifying water resources management schemes mirdashtvan et al 2021 relatively few wes priority areas are located in the lower reaches in all climate scenarios the downstream basin is the social and economic center of hunan province whose economy is well developed compared to other basins with a high urbanization level ying et al 2007 the wes priority areas distribution of the lower reaches is relevant with the built up land and gdp fig 6 all of which could explain 14 7 of the total variance maximumly confirming the above results the high urbanization in the lower reaches results in a high proportion of impervious areas further the aquifers in this area were destroyed by excessive exploitation during economic development therefore there are few places suitable for wes priority areas the number of wes priority areas is inadequate in the lower reaches in all scenarios a large proportion of the water resources for many citizens comes from the tributary of the xiangjiang river i e the liuyang river yang et al 2020 priority areas 6 and priority areas 10 are located in the watershed of the liuyang river those regions should be considered as wes priority areas in all scenarios to meet the water demand of the population in the central city both the water quality and wyld are important aspects that should be evaluated in those regions the clustering degree of the wes priority areas is also dependent on climate change the wes priority areas have relatively high similarity and high aggregation in the mid term climate scenario in contrast in the long term scenario the wes priority areas are less similar and less clustered fig 6b 2 and c 2 this result is consistent with the wes priority area s location fig 5 the low aggregation and dispersed distribution of the wes priority areas could increase their protection costs causing difficulties for management and maintenance hawkins 2004 5 conclusions in this study a novelty framework was proposed to integrate wes into the water resource priority areas management under climate change furthermore the hydrological hydrochemical hydroecological processes in the integrated terrestrial aquatic system were also considered in the climate change scenarios the priority management areas were concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions of the upper reaches the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas declined over time the precipitation was positively correlated with the wes priority area selection in all climate scenarios the temperature was only negatively correlated with the wes priority areas when it exceeded 20 c and this effect became more pronounced as the temperature increased in the upper basin the topographic factors were the most crucial factors for the selection of the upstream wes priority areas thus the wes priority area selection was only slightly affected by climate change in the middle basin the wes priority area s selection was closely related to the wyld in all scenarios and the number of priority areas in that area declined along with climate change relatively few wes priority areas were located in the lower reaches in all climate scenarios and wes priority areas were positively associated with the gdp and the amount of built up land according to

15749,water scarcity and quality deterioration often occur in economically developing regions particularly during crises related to climate change or increasing human activities the assignment of priority areas is considered a suitable strategy for stakeholders to mitigate water crises and cope with water stress however most studies focused on protecting water bodies in priority areas and did not consider the hydrological hydrochemical hydroecological interaction between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems we divided a watershed into manageable areas to select priority areas for multiple water related ecosystem services wes priority areas considering the aquatic terrestrial interactions to predict the effects of climate change and human activities the proposed novelty framework couples the soil and water assessment tool and maximum entropy models with a systematic conservation planning tool it uses the gross domestic product as the economic cost to assess dynamic changes and social environmental driving forces a case study is conducted in the xiangjiang river basin a modified watershed of the main tributary of the yangtze river china results revealed that most of the wes priority areas were located in the southern and southeastern regions of the upper reaches in all climatic scenarios the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas decreased from 1 264 to 0 867 in 50 years indicating that the level of protection declined as climate change accelerated the precipitation was positively correlated with the wes priority area selection in all climate scenarios the temperature was only negatively correlated with the wes priority areas when it exceeded 20 c and this effect became more pronounced as the temperature increased the topographic factors had the most crucial impacts on the upstream priority areas selection the water flow regulation service played a leading role in identifying wes priority areas in the middle reaches because the priority areas distribution here was closely related to the water yield and its proportion decreased with the acceleration of global warming the number of wes priority areas was relatively low in the lower reaches it was positively associated with the gross domestic product and the amount of built up land the proposed framework for wes priority areas identification enables a sound trade off between environmental protection and economic development graphical abtract image graphical abstract keywords priority areas water related ecosystem services swat maxent marxan climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity and water quality deterioration represent global threats to human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 the rise of the world population improvement in living standards change in the consumption structure and an increase in irrigated agriculture are the main drivers of the increasing worldwide water crisis an effective strategy to deal with complex water health problems is to develop separate control strategies for different river reaches and categorize rivers with similar water quality or societal demands in the same water function zone huang et al 2010 the goal of assigning water function zones is to set water quality and quantity targets however the ecological protection of the water source is rarely considered stemming from the misunderstanding of the water conditions required to support freshwater ecosystems richter et al 2003 therefore ecological protection has received increasing attention in the design of water protection schemes aquatic ecological processes are affected in several ways most ecological responses energy flow fish survival recruitment and community structure are related to the flow rosenfeld 2017 in addition to hydrological processes the surface water quality affects the ecological environment in various reaches to different degrees due to the adaptability of the aquatic organism to the environment luo et al 2020 due to the complex interactions between hydrology and hydrochemistry in aquatic ecosystems a new method for partitioning water function zones is needed another major drawback of the current river zoning law is that the division of water function zones was designed for water pollution monitoring and management of the river channels whereas land based activities surrounding the water have been ignored nevertheless some land based activities may have a considerable influence on water recent studies have shown that changes in the terrestrial landscape have significant impacts on neighboring aquatic ecosystems the conversion of natural landscapes often affects nutrient fluxes soil integrity and native species communities this change will affect the hydrology of the basin by changing the rate of interception evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater recharge resulting in changes in the timing and amount of river runoff baker and miller 2013 on the other hand water based activities may also have several important consequences for the terrestrial ecosystem for example agricultural water consumption accounts for 70 of china s total water consumption representing an important part of the social water cycle jiang 2009 the water demand by the industry is also the key factor influencing the local socioeconomic development level de loë et al 2016 thus the stakeholders must develop an approach that integrates aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to address the dynamics of the complex processes conservation prioritization could provide useful information for selecting priority areas to protect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by considering the economic values of water related ecosystem services wes liang et al 2021 globally water provides multiple economic values by providing drinking water and water for industrial and agricultural production wei et al 2017 some ecosystem services are closely linked to many hydrological processes positively e g water quality for fish raising or negatively e g water erosion maes et al 2009 to provide information for water resource management the water yield the soil retention and the water purification are the commonly used wes when considering the level of ecosystem services in certain regions as those parameters represent the hydrological and hydrochemical factors involved in water demands since wes are spatially heterogeneous and many synergies exist the trade offs are complicated and should be considered carefully to obtain a cost effective solution balkanlou et al 2020 many conservation tools have been developed to select sites with a high conservation value and perform systematic conservation planning as one of the most commonly used conservation tools the systematic conservation planning tool marxan has been widely applied to identify priority areas related to ecosystem services or wild habitats and exhibits excellent performance in identifying priority areas based on the principle of complementarity he et al 2021 however studies on the selection of priority areas with specific ecosystem services have mostly focused on assessing ecosystems services values by obtaining rough statistical data from public institutions rather than combining specific relevant models besides most marxan modeling studies on habitat conservation frequently used climatic parameters as the primary factors affecting species distribution whereas the hydrological and hydrochemical factors were rarely considered however studies have demonstrated that the hydrological regime substantially influences the distribution of freshwater fish hockley et al 2014 moreover the priority area identification procedures that consider both economic and ecological values of wes have rarely been applied to different regions to obtain more accurate and concise data representing wes in the whole river basin some hydrological models could be utilized malekian et al 2019 the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed and continuous ecohydrological model it has been utilized to simulate hydrological and hydrochemical output variables that could be regarded as indicators to evaluate wes schmalz et al 2016 since the hydroecological related wes are important for arranging function zones the species distribution model could be used to simulate the geographic distribution of aquatic species the maximum entropy model maxent is commonly used because of its outstanding performance with limited data kim et al 2020 it has been broadly utilized for modeling fish distribution in freshwater to assess river health conserve species and identify priority areas frederico et al 2014 thus the maxent model was used in our study to estimate fish distribution as one wes studies have shown that excessive nitrogen and phosphorus inputs may lead to water eutrophication causing oxygen level reduction because of the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter and leading to the suffocation of many fish and macroinvertebrates hockley et al 2014 besides sediment deposits may impact some developmental stages of fish killing roe and destroying the gills of older fish sutherland and meyer 2007 thus we input the output variables from swat as some of the environmental factors into maxent because those wes could affect fish distribution this study was conducted in a modified watershed in the xiangjiang river basin xrb the xrb is a major sub watershed of the yangtze river and the primary rice growing area in southern china tian et al 2018 due to multiple factors such as climate change rapid urbanization and human induced activities the local water ecosystem services in the xrb have been severely degraded in recent years liang et al 2020 conflicts between humans and nature are common in this area for example it is difficult to balance the sustainability of the natural river ecosystem and economic development liang et al 2018 thus the xrb is an ideal and representative area to investigate the selection of priority areas for wes the results are significant for maintaining water ecological security and sustainable economic and social development in china xu et al 2017 in this study a novelty framework is proposed to integrate wes into the selection of priority areas using water land function zoning under climate change furthermore the processes of hydrology hydrochemistry hydroecology in the integrated terrestrial aquatic system are also considered to ensure healthy aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the objectives of this study are to 1 quantify wes in different climate scenarios 2 determine the wes priority areas cost effectively and 3 investigate the impacts of social environmental factors on the wes priority area s selection within this framework the wes are quantified to support planning and decision making regarding water resources protection in response to climate change 2 study area the study was carried out in the xrb fig 1 the xiangjiang river is the main tributary of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the xrb covers an area of 94 660 km2 with a mainstream river length of 842 km the mean elevation of the xrb is 326 m with an average slope of 0 0134 the xrb is located in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone and experiences a hot humid and wet climate with an annual mean temperature of 16 18 c and annual precipitation ranging from 1300 mm to 1600 mm the area is heavily influenced by the monsoon with most of the rainfall occurring in the summer from april to september the xiangjiang river originates from jingfengling mountain and descends northward into the yangtze river it passes through diverse landscapes the upper watershed is covered by alpine forests 63 the middle reaches pass through an agriculture belt 30 and the lower reaches meander through densely populated urban cities 2 7 more than half of the habitants of the hunan province live in the xrb thus the river is the undisputed mother river of 30 million residents providing wes to both local economic and domestic water demands because the selected watershed is relatively big spatial heterogeneity can be taken into consideration when selecting proper priority areas a larger spatial scale will increase the comprehensive evaluation of research results considering the complexity and environmental heterogeneity of aquatic terrestrial systems the diverse landscape patterns throughout this river basin provide an excellent system for investigating wes priority area determination simultaneously considering the complex impacts of hydrological hydrochemical and ecological factors under various landscapes moreover the studied area contains some regions that are undergoing the largest wave of rapid urbanization in human history which is one of the typical systems to reflect the impact of human activities on the wes providing insight into the priority areas distribution with complex anthropogenic influence the study for wes priority areas identification in xrb reflects a sound trade off between environmental protection and economic development in summary we think our findings have implications with regard to both the xrb case and other cases that have been facing a global warming crisis 3 materials and methodology the proposed framework fig 2 consists of the following steps data preprocessing future climate projections the establishment calibration and validation of swat fig s1 the establishment of the maxent model to assess the fish distribution and the systematic conservation planning for wes using the marxan model and the redundancy analysis to investigate the influence of climate change and social environmental factors on the wes priority areas the identification of wes priority areas while considering climate change provides an effective trade off framework for environmental protection and economic development 3 1 data sources the data inputs and sources are summarized in table 1 the land use data were reclassified to fit the categories of the swat the soil data were used to determine the soil properties and a digital elevation model was used to delineate the xrb watershed in the swat simulation the nitrogen and phosphorus pollution inputs containing crop cultivation scattered small scale animal feedlot operations and rural sewage were calculated based on the hunan statistic yearbook during the establishment of swat we used a threshold of 100 000 ha and delineated 53 sub basins which were further divided into 621 hrus the daily weather records at 13 stations in the xrb from 1997 to 2015 were obtained from the china meteorological administration to simulate the daily weather in the swat the daily discharge at the hydrological stations hengyang hengshan and xiangtan monthly sediment transport at the xiangtan station from 1997 to 2015 and the monthly water quality at this station from 2005 to 2015 were obtained from the hydrological department of hunan province fig 1 to calibrate and validate the results of swat the future climate projections average for 2041 2060 hereafter referred to as 2050 average for 2061 2080 hereafter referred to as 2070 were downloaded from the worldclim website to process the future climatic scenarios in swat and maxent models the climate change scenarios in 2050 and 2070 were identical to the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 emission scenario at 30 s resolution 1 km of the general circulation model gcm mirdashtvan et al 2018 the transient climate projections for 1997 2080 were separated into several time slices in swat and maxent operation 1997 2015 was considered the baseline scenario 2050 was the mid term scenario and 2070 was the long term scenario the geographic coordinates of the feature locations were used in the maxent model the data were acquired from the hunan aquatic ecological monitoring programs to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on fish distribution in the xrb we used 19 bioclimatic variables from the hadgem2 ao model in the worldclim database the topographic data and the soil categories with chemical and physical properties were the same in the maxent model and the swat model the computational results of the swat including the wyld syld orgn and orgp in the xrb were used as input hydrological and hydrochemical data for the maxent simulation the marxan model was implemented at a grid cell resolution of 3000 3000 m because the swat and maxent outputs were resampled to the same cell size the gross domestic product gdp acquired from the chinese academy of sciences was used as the protection cost of the marxan model when identifying the priority areas 3 2 wes simulation and visualization in this study swat was employed to simulate ecohydrological processes representing hydrological and hydrochemical related wes the maxent model was used to simulate fish distribution representing hydroecological related wes the wes related to hydrological processes were selected and calculated based on the swat s hru output file output hru for further analyses table s1 the wes we selected for further analysis were based on expert assessments the experts came from water related academic fields and were familiar with the environmental characteristics of the xrb three types of wes were derived from swat including the water yield wyld the simulated mean sediment yield syld and the levels of organic nitrogen orgn and organic phosphorus orgp to represent the ecosystem services of water flow control erosion control and water purification nutrient status in the study area respectively these wes represent the essential ecosystem services in the forest dominated ecosystems in the xrb providing information for water resource management the minimum and maximum values of the four indicators for all hrus were calculated table 2 the swat model was calibrated and validated using the historical data collected from three major hydrological stations hengyang hengshan and xiangtan on the main stream of the xiangjiang river from january 1997 to december 2015 the periods 1997 to 1998 1999 to 2005 and 2006 to 2015 were used as warm up periods calibration periods and validation periods respectively the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns were used to evaluate the accuracy of the swat model r 2 all above 0 51 and ns all above 0 42 fig s1 wang et al 2019 because ctenopharyngodon idella hypophthalmichthys molitrix mylopharyngodon piceus and aristichys nobilis were the four major chinese carps in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and xiangjiang river is an important habitat of their natural stock resources we simulated the distribution of those kinds of fishes to represent the hydroecological wes we initially selected 44 environmental factors i e bioclimatic data fish occurrence data topographic data soil properties hydrological processes and water quality that might affect the extent of suitable fish habitat to model the current fish distributions since many variables were spatially correlated spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to examine the cross correlation variables with highly correlated relationships were removed to avoid multicollinearity out of 44 initial variables 31 were retained as indicator variables table 1 we used the maxent model to simulate the current and future fish distribution in the xrb we used 75 of the point data for model training and the remaining 25 for validating the model the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc was used to quantify model accuracy auc values 0 7 indicate low accuracy values between 0 7 and 0 9 indicate moderate accuracy and values 0 9 denote high accuracy the auc value of our maxent model was 0 802 we mapped the water flow erosion water purification status and fish distribution in the xrb in different climate scenarios using the swat and maxent model 3 3 systematic conservation planning the systematic conservation planning model marxan is a widely used space optimization software for systematic conservation planning according to the local stakeholder s opinion we input the regional gdp in 2015 as the financial cost in the marxan simulation the goal of the objective function is to minimize the gdp loss to optimize the allocation of the wes priority areas a sub basin with a high gdp is assumed to have i limited areas for conserving natural water resources because those areas were overexploited during urbanization ii higher economic losses for allocating crucial conservation zones since many huge infrastructure projects are being constructed here based on the planning units the total gdp cost was calculated as more details are provided in the supplementary information 1 t o t a l g d p c o s t p u s g d p c o s t 60 p u s b o u n d a r y 30 o f t h e t o t a l a m o u n t o f w e s s p f p e n a l t y where pu represents the planning units and spf refers to the conservation feature penalty factor the marxan model was used to identify the wes priority areas and obtain the conservation values of the planning units in the xrb under various climate change scenarios the results of the marxan model under different climate scenarios were obtained and the wes priority areas and the selection time of the priority areas fig s3 were optimized the results were summarized by determining the best solution the conservation network with the optimum locations meeting the objectives at minimum cost for all climate scenarios we also evaluated the frequency of selecting the planning units from 100 runs in each climate scenario to evaluate the irreplaceability which is defined as the likelihood of the given location having a specific set of protection objectives we adopted the method of xu et al 2013 to evaluate the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas under different climate change scenarios 2 s e e p e s p s where s e denotes the spatial conservation efficiency of the wes e p describes the total wes of the identified priority areas e represents the total wes in the region s p is the area of wes priority areas and s is the total area an se index greater than 1 indicates high conservation efficiency and vice versa 3 4 key factors determining the spatial pattern of wes priority areas based on the level of sub basins the redundancy analysis rda was conducted to investigate the impact of climate change precipitation and temperature topography altitude and slope gdp and land use forestland grassland cropland built up land and water on the wes priority area s selection the analysis was implemented using the rda modules embedded in the canoco software version 4 5 5 0 ithaca usa the integrity index pi and aggregation index ai calculated by the fragstats software were used to determine the dispersion of the wes priority areas he et al 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of hydrological and hydrochemical related wes in three climate change scenarios the wyld syld orgn and orgp all reached the highest values in the wet season from march to july and the lowest in the dry season from november to february table 2 as the result of intensified precipitation the wyld was 99 94 mm in the wet season which was three times the amount in the dry season the values of the syld orgn and orgp were four times higher in the wet season than in the dry season the highest average value of syld in the wet season was 1 29 t ha since surface runoff is higher in the wet season due to high intensity precipitation soil erosion was higher casazza et al 2018 in the xrb farming practices are mainly carried out during wet seasons the large amount of effluents from agricultural activities in the wet season carries nutrient rich moisture such as nitrogen and phosphorus to the xrb thus the values of orgn and orgn were higher in wet seasons zhang et al 2019 moreover frequent rainfall in wet season could further increase decomposition and nutrient release from the natural plants and soil profiles which is another reason causing the higher outputs of orgn and orgp yan et al 2019 the seasonal variation of wes did not have a substantial impact on the spatial distribution of ecosystem services in the xrb but had a significant impact on ecosystem service values fig 3 generally as the rainfall increased between march and july and the flood season of the xiangjiang river approached the values of the four ecosystem service indicators increased most areas that were not forestland had relatively low water flow values due to high runoff coefficients in those regions fig 3a liu et al 2020 since forestland has a higher soil water retention capacity than other types of lulc more runoff occurs than in non forest land during floods malekian and azarnivand 2016 higher values of syld were found in high elevation grassland in the southwest and north of the xrb whereas the lowest syld values were observed in areas with flat terrain and low rainfall fig 3b since grasslands do not have a tree canopy to intercept raindrops or litter layers to prevent splashing during rain events the higher sediment yield was not surprising zhou et al 2016 moreover highly erosive areas were mostly found in cropland especially in valleys with steep slopes and high annual rainfall opening up wastelands could be one reason for the high erosion xie et al 2019 besides high intensity rainfall loosens soil particles which are transported with the water downhill into streams and valleys pimentel and burgess 2013 the most common soil type in this area is alisol which is unstable and prone to erosion the lower erosion levels of cultivated fields demonstrated the protective role of row crops for soil and water conservation the orgn and orgp reached their maximum values 0 903 kg ha and 0 111 kg ha respectively in the southern areas where their spatial patterns were similar to syld fig 3c specifically the largest values occurred in agricultural and forest areas indicating that they were the primary sources of orgn and orgp the spatial patterns of the four wes in the mid term and long term scenarios are shown in fig s2 in the future climate scenarios the lower values of the wyld were found in the southcentral areas and the areas with low values decreased from 2050 to 2070 compared to 2050 the southern regions with steeper slopes showed the higher level of wyld in 2070 the syld orgn and orgp had similar spatial patterns between 2050 and 2070 the highest values of those indices occurred in the south 0 378 t ha 0 639 kg ha and 0 078 kg ha respectively for mid term 0 364 t ha 0 662 kg ha and 0 081 kg ha respectively for long term 4 2 spatial distribution of hydroecological related wes in three climate change scenarios in the current climate scenario the most suitable areas for fish species were found in the freshwater reaches of the main stem of the xiangjiang river in the downstream section fig 4 the remaining regions in the xrb had lower suitability or were deemed unsuitable for fish the outputs indicated that the fish were distributed in the lower to medium elevations in the current climatic condition the model predicted that the most suitable areas for fish in 2050 would be located in the middle mainstream of the xiangjiang river and the downstream tributaries in the eastern section of the basin in 2070 the optimum locations for fish survival would be located in the upper mainstream and parts of the branches in the middle valley increasing the range following climate warming these results were consistent with recent studies that predicted species would move to higher elevations to adjust to the future climate mcmahan et al 2020 barriers such as waterfalls could prevent species from moving upstream restricting species movements and threatening their lives higher values of orgn orgp and syld were found in the southern areas indicating lower suitability for fish higher levels of orgn and orgp may cause eutrophication which may result in the total depletion of oxygen and the generation of harmful gasses such as hydrogen sulfide and methane threatening fish survival nyenje et al 2010 the accumulation of sediments may adversely impact spawning inhibit migration and interfere with food intake kukuła and bylak 2020 4 3 systematic conservation planning utilizing wes priority areas 4 3 1 identifying priority areas for multiple wes the output of the marxan model indicated that the spatial distribution of the wes priority areas differed for different climate scenarios fig 5 and the overlap between the area in different scenarios was about 13 of the total area most of the overlap occurred in the south and east of the study area since forest land accounted for 60 of the study area it substantially affected water cycle and nutrient cycle in the entire study area thus priority areas were centered in forest land with higher altitudes in the eastern xrb priority areas were also found at the source of the rivers in the southern portion of the xrb thus these areas require sufficient attention and protection priority areas located in the central area of the xrb during the baseline scenario shifted to the downstream area in the mid term and long term scenarios due to high water flow in the middle and upper reaches of the xrb as a result of climate change the number of patches and the average patch size of the wes priority areas in three climate change scenarios were 15 and 1214 km2 baseline 19 and 1053 km2 mid term and 22 and 837 km2 long term respectively in each climate change scenario the patches of the wes priority areas were clustered and their overall pi and ai were 99 01 and 96 52 baseline 99 177 and 96 5911 mid term and 98 94 and 96 15 long term respectively indicating the largest clustering effect in the mid term scenario moreover the wes priority areas were more dispersed in the long term climate scenarios than in the baseline scenario the conservation efficiency index of the wes priority areas is listed in table 3 the index was the highest for the baseline climate scenario the wes priority areas with the highest values were located in the upper reaches of the xrb south and southeast of the study area the average conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas was lower in the climate change scenarios than the baseline scenario in the mid term and long term climate scenarios the conservation efficiency was less than 1 indicating an adverse effect of climate change 4 4 the social environmental factors associated with the location of the wes priority areas 4 4 1 the effect of climatic factors on wes priority area selection the results of the analysis of the impact factors and characteristics of climate change on the wes priority areas are shown in fig 6 a precipitation and temperature were selected as key variables to represent the impact of climate change fig 6a 1 b 1 and c 1 a positive correlation between precipitation and wyld is observed in the scatterplot studies have shown that an increase in precipitation in the future significantly improved the wyld affecting certain priority areas shirmohammadi et al 2020 the cumulative proportion of precipitation was 18 4 in xrb moreover the fish distribution was positively correlated with the precipitation in all climatic scenarios our result is consistent with previous study that fish distribution correlated positively with precipitation kinard et al 2021 these findings suggest that aridification is linked to the extinction of competitive and environmentally sensitive taxa potentially resulting in less favorable community states in the baseline climate scenario the average air temperature was below 20 c table s2 the angle between the selected wes priority areas and the temperature in the graph was almost vertical indicating that the temperature had a negligible effect on the wes priority areas fig 6a 1 in contrast in the mid term scenario the wes priority areas were highly and negatively correlated with the temperature fig 6b 1 and the correlation was even higher in the long term climate scenario fig 6c 1 in the mediterranean island of crete 3 c warming caused a reduction in water resources by 10 30 koutroulis et al 2016 in addition a variable infiltration capacity vic model was used to simulate wyld in different temperature scenarios the results showed that the streamflow sharply decreased as the temperatures increased weltzin et al 2003 our results show a negative relationship between temperature and wyld under future climate scenarios confirmed those results the positive correlation between temperature and nutrient outputs orgn orgp was found in all climatic scenarios it might be attributed to the fact that the farming practices are mainly carried out when temperature is higher the effluents from cultivation carry nutrient rich moisture to the xrb numerous studies have also suggested that the increased temperature may hasten the mineralization of soil organic matter which releases dissolved nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus andriamananjara et al 2019 4 4 2 the social and economic factors affecting the distribution of the wes priority areas in different reaches since downstream water users rely on the upstream water supply it is crucial to understand the differences in the wes priority area distributions in different reaches the number of wes priority areas and their distribution differ in the upper middle and lower reaches of the xrb fig s4 climate change had a negligible impact on the wes priority area s distribution in the upstream basin of the xrb in the upper basins of the xrb with rugged terrain the topographic factors were crucial factors influencing the selection of the upstream wes priority areas particularly the slope whose cumulative slope proportion was 20 9 fig 6a the selection of wes priority areas with steep slopes and high altitudes in the upper basin of the xrb was slightly affected by climate change fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 the regions with steep slopes and high altitudes are mainly the source of the rivers in the upper basin thus these areas require sufficient attention and protection in all the climate scenarios which is in agreement with a previous study crossman et al 2012 besides the upper basin of the xrb contained most of the wes priority areas fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 thus decision makers and stakeholders should focus on wes priority areas in the upper reaches the wes priority areas proportion in the middle reaches declined from 6 4 in the baseline scenario to 5 6 in the mid term and 4 5 in the long term respectively fig 5 and fig 6a 3 b 3 and c 3 the middle reaches including rapidly developing counties that have large areas of cropland and many urban areas are areas where urbanization may increase due to a population boom and industrialization therefore large amounts of readily available water will be required the wes priority areas selection is closely related to the wyld in that areas in all scenarios figs 1 and 6 as climate change accelerates the available water supply in some parts of the middle reach will decrease table 3 thus these areas may not require future protection and will not be selected as wes priority areas moreover the agricultural planting in the middle reaches could promote global warming because a considerable increase in crop yield resulting from increased irrigation and fertilizer application may cause increased greenhouse gas emissions liu et al 2005 since the selection of the wes priority areas are strongly and negatively correlated with the temperature fig 6 the wes priority areas proportion in that areas decreases over time overall because of the incremental demand for water resources in the middle reaches there is a need to consider the influence of future climate on hydrological factors for modifying water resources management schemes mirdashtvan et al 2021 relatively few wes priority areas are located in the lower reaches in all climate scenarios the downstream basin is the social and economic center of hunan province whose economy is well developed compared to other basins with a high urbanization level ying et al 2007 the wes priority areas distribution of the lower reaches is relevant with the built up land and gdp fig 6 all of which could explain 14 7 of the total variance maximumly confirming the above results the high urbanization in the lower reaches results in a high proportion of impervious areas further the aquifers in this area were destroyed by excessive exploitation during economic development therefore there are few places suitable for wes priority areas the number of wes priority areas is inadequate in the lower reaches in all scenarios a large proportion of the water resources for many citizens comes from the tributary of the xiangjiang river i e the liuyang river yang et al 2020 priority areas 6 and priority areas 10 are located in the watershed of the liuyang river those regions should be considered as wes priority areas in all scenarios to meet the water demand of the population in the central city both the water quality and wyld are important aspects that should be evaluated in those regions the clustering degree of the wes priority areas is also dependent on climate change the wes priority areas have relatively high similarity and high aggregation in the mid term climate scenario in contrast in the long term scenario the wes priority areas are less similar and less clustered fig 6b 2 and c 2 this result is consistent with the wes priority area s location fig 5 the low aggregation and dispersed distribution of the wes priority areas could increase their protection costs causing difficulties for management and maintenance hawkins 2004 5 conclusions in this study a novelty framework was proposed to integrate wes into the water resource priority areas management under climate change furthermore the hydrological hydrochemical hydroecological processes in the integrated terrestrial aquatic system were also considered in the climate change scenarios the priority management areas were concentrated in the southern and southeastern regions of the upper reaches the conservation efficiency of the wes priority areas declined over time the precipitation was positively correlated with the wes priority area selection in all climate scenarios the temperature was only negatively correlated with the wes priority areas when it exceeded 20 c and this effect became more pronounced as the temperature increased in the upper basin the topographic factors were the most crucial factors for the selection of the upstream wes priority areas thus the wes priority area selection was only slightly affected by climate change in the middle basin the wes priority area s selection was closely related to the wyld in all scenarios and the number of priority areas in that area declined along with climate change relatively few wes priority areas were located in the lower reaches in all climate scenarios and wes priority areas were positively associated with the gdp and the amount of built up land according to this study to preserve healthy aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems the elements of hydrology hydrochemistry and hydroecology should be addressed in the selection of priority areas declaration of
